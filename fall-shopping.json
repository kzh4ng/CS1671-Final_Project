The store has typically had the supplies that I need from cake and cupcake baking and icing to scrap booking supplies. This location is pretty average compared to other Michaels - it's exactly what you would expect when going to this store. It's not a large store, but it's not a small store -- just average.\n\nI do enjoy using the Michael's coupons when shopping. I definitely save a lot of money! Instead of toting around the paper versions, I actually have the iPhone app that has coupons available to use from the app. \n\nMy only complaint is that sometimes it takes a while to check out at this location. I don't normally have a problem - usually only one or two people ahead of me - but sometimes it can be much slower. Today, for example, there were only two customers ahead of me, but one of them was having issues with a coupon. The line began to get longer and longer, and though a couple associates were lingering up front, they kept calling for someone else. From personal experience of being a manger in a retail store, do not linger or let your associates linger near the cashiers without jumping on register. Whatever the reason may be that you are not helping customers, it still appears rude and make everyone more impatient....", "business_id": "yHTLTr-QN-loO_7XoxS8qg", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-10-23", "type": "review"}

They've got items for woodwork, painting, knitting, kids crafts, scrapbooks, you name it. The problem is, the variety of products for your particular craft is probably dismal. They've got lots of cool items all over the store that you're convinced that somehow you need. (Because it is soooo cute, and you could TOTALLY do something with it. Right..?) The store feels cluttered because there is so much stuff everywhere. However, if you're looking for something specific, good luck. It's not even a matter of the product being difficult to find in the store. It's that when you find the right section, there's either nothing in stock, or they simply don't even carry what you need. \n\nI stopped in for crochet supplies, and the yarn selection was laughable compared to many other craft stores. I ended up going elsewhere for my stuff anyway. \n\nPlus the prices at Michael's are significantly more than other area craft stores. I usually only stop there if I'm already at tend Waterfront.

My daily commute takes me by the Waterfront every day, so it's easy to pop into this location and check out their newest inventory. Loft does a great job of turning inventory quickly. Every couple weeks, the store has new product with a full clearance section. I'm also signed up for the brand's emails so I know when promotions are going on. They offer 30-40% off the store every month or so (generally around major holidays) and also offer 40-50% off clearance pretty frequently.\n\nI enjoy the layout and store appearance much better than Ross Park and Robinson. Ross Park's store is very bland, and Robinson is currently in a temporary store. Shopping in an environment with bright fluorescent lights and boring white walls is just terrible, so I enjoy the Waterfront's pretty street-side location best.\n\nThe employees at this location are just OK. Sometimes I am cheerfully greeted at the front door but am generally ignored the entire time that I am shopping. I recently had a very attentive sales associate who opened a fitting room for me when my arms were becoming full, but I thought that I noticed someone with a District Manager vibe lurking around, which probably encouraged the associate's motivation. \n\nI actually had a very negative experience at this store during a recent sales event. The event ended at 7pm on a weekday, and I rushed to the store after getting off work. I hurried around the store and jumped into line at 7:02pm. All associates abandoned the registers at 7pm, totally ignoring me and the other two girls waiting in line. When I was finally helped several minutes later, the snippy associate told me that the discount may or may not go through... that corporate determined when the discount was turned off. OK, that's great, but then why did you totally ignore me and your other customers for several minutes? Did you want us to not get the discount? I was appalled by the rudeness of both the associate and a manager I spoke with earlier in the evening, who was equally rude about the sharp end time of the discount. What made the situation much worse is that a good friend of mine was a manager at Loft a couple years ago and told me that ringing up after 7pm would not be a problem. Hah, well it was a problem at the Waterfront location!\n\nThe only reason that I gave Loft 4 stars is because I love the brand, discounts, and quality of product as a whole. The staff at this location is sub-par and do not reflect the brand well. I hope that Loft does not lose customers based on negative customer service experiences....

So tempting... but I forgot about this amazing bag when I stumbled upon two quality sweaters thirty seconds later. One was Design History, which is a brand currently sold at Nordstrom, Saks, Neimans, and Bluefly, for only $25. I also found Adrienne Vittadini flats for $29, Meri Meri cupcake kits for $7, Woodwick candles for $10-12, and a luxurious Tahari throw blanket for $29. I walked out of the store minus $120 in my debit account with at least $300+ of product.\n\nI've also been delightfully surprised by the cleanliness of the store and the fitting rooms and by the friendliness of the staff. I was having an issue with my debit card while there, and the two associates that I worked with were very helpful and understanding about the issue.\n\nI'll definitely be going back in the next week or two to see what amazing new deals they'll have then!", "business_id": "LQFWH1AKJlXGmEBlIKsBCw", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-10-20", "type": "review"}

But this Home Depot has disappointed me.  The location is great, but the floor staff is unhelpful.\n\nTonight was a great example of I don't like the floor staff.  My vacuum stopped picking up anything but the largest pieces of dust.  After opening her up, I quickly realized I needed a new belt.  It was pouring down rain, but I put on my rainboots, grabbed an umbrella, and hoofed it over to ye ole Home Depot.  I had to stand over the shoulders of five--yep, I counted five--employees in appliances for a full minute before one of them would help me.\n\nAfter someone directed me to the vacuum parts, I had two male employees stop by to see if I needed help as I searched for the correct belt.  I had the vacuum's name and number written down, as well as the belt style, and had the actual busted belt with me.  Yet, each of these men acted like I was some stupid girl.  \"Did you unplug the vacuum before you removed the old belt?\" one asked me.  Duh.  I'm not an idiot.  The other later asked, \"Do you always wear bright yellow rainboots when you're doing repairs?\" and snickered.  Look, all I said to both gentlemen was \"I'm just looking for the correct style number.  But thanks.\"\n\nI received similar treatment I stopped by to buy a new set of bits for my drill.  \"You know drills come in more than one kind, right?\" I was asked.  And when I needed a new bag of dirt of my cacti, I was question about why I wanted succulent dirt over potting soil.  Every time a male employee here approaches me, I'm questioned or given unsolicited advice in a snotty way.\n\nThis girl may wear bright yellow rainboots, but I am also the Norm Abram of my family.  AKA I'm pretty handy.  Oh, and the vacuum works perfectly now.\n\nShout out goes to the check out attendants, who were SUPER polite.

I came in July (2013) with a non standard proportion large photograph print. With the help of the staff I picked out what I thought was going to be a gorgeous job! For a beach photo we choose a sandy mat and a texturized frame that was mostly a tan with a lot of black and white and gold accents. It was up there price wise ($400), but I was so in love and I knew it wasn't going to be cheap in general! They told me it'd be done in two weeks and I was shocked. I got a call about two weeks later to come in because the frame we picked wasn't the same when it came in from the supplier :(. It was totally plain and not what we looked at! They knew immediately if they had put it together with that I would not be happy! They offered me to look at other frames and we spent a good hour or so looking at other frames and I still wasn't finding anything. We picked one and he said he was going to talk to the supplier to see if they'd give it to me at the same price. ALSO, on top of that they painted and texturized it many many times themselves. They called me in to check out a sample before they went ahead with the whole frame. They did tell me I should have no problem with it being done by Sept 19th, which I was having ankle surgery and wouldn't be able to after. I called a couple times checking in and they did explain to me that it took A LOT of painting, drying, and sandy to get it just right. Plus they were busy as well. It ended up being done towards the end of September (2013) and they held onto it no problem until mid October (2013) for me. They also helped me carry it to my car (I was still in a boot). They are very nice and pleasant, but not terribly social or energetic. All in all I got an AMAZING product for probably a fraction of the price!

The Paula Dean pot was only $4 as well and that was great coming from a thrift shop. \n\nIf your ever interested in shopping here it's best to go on a Wednesday or Saturday early!! Wednesday you get half off your bill if you bring a senior with you. I like to use grandma sometimes to get some cheaper clothes. She enjoys it as well so that she can buy all the little nick nacks and holiday items. Happy shopping!!", "business_id": "cKtBFMESwsUWxTv6QjkTGQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-09-29", "type": "review"}

I say yes.\n\nHe responds \"Well, I really wish you hadn't done that.\"\n\nwait. huh?\n\nThis guy then proceeds to berate me for giving them an unfavorable review. He brought up my complaint that they never called me back once they got the sample dress in, by saying that the reason for that was that the dress was far above my price range.  (I'm positive that this is true. While my budget wasn't modest, some of the dresses here can run well over 10k, so the fact that the dress wasn't feasible for me financially doesn't surprise me.)\n\nUnfortunately, I had asked and they had promised me that they would call whenever the dress came in. Had they phoned me and simply said that the dress was in, but it was far above my budget, that would have been fine and the fact that they followed up with me would have been reflected in my original review. Instead, they provided me with bad customer service by ignoring me because they guessed that they probably wouldn't be making any money anyway, so why bother with a 60 second task?\n\nAnd then this phone call....\n\nI'm not exaggerating at all, berate is absolutely the word to describe this. I didn't get much of a chance at all to respond to his explanation, and then this guys says \n\n\"I don't know what else to say except that I'm sorry that you feel that way. I just really hope that some day, people like you aren't able to do things like this.\"\n\nHoooo!\n\n If someone posts a negative review, unless that review is completely unfounded or is attacking someone personally unrelated to the job being performed, the business should either let it go, try to make sure the same problem doesn't occur again with a future customer, or do something to rectify the present situation. \n\nCalling the reviewer and attacking them personally for an honest and not really all that inflammatory assessment is just classless and immature. Even a pitch perfect business will get a negative review every now and then. \n\nIts such a shame too, because the conversation easily could have gone a different way had this guy truly cared about the store's reputation or understood good customer care. Though apologizing and explaining what happened probably wouldn't have changed my personal opinion of Anne Gregory, it would at least show that they care about their customer's experience and opinion of them. Clearly that's not the case. \n\nSuffice to say, the actions of at least one Anne Gregory employee have changed my original review from \"I didn't have a good experience, I would not do business with them\" to SERIOUSLY.\nHOLY SHIT, DO NOT GO HERE.", "business_id": "i5bPwhPg6GqXvWMdl8a_SA", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-09-01", "type": "review"}

At the time, it was the premier cigar shop in the Pittsburgh area. The owner, Frank Jernigan (in his own day a legend among tobacconists, if you go back that far), greeted me at the door with a handshake, personally showed me the humidor and, seeing as I was just getting started, took time with recommendations to help me get started.\n\nThis place had that \"place where everyone knows your name\", which even included outings for barbecues and such, until about 2004-2005, when unfortunately Mr. Jernigan became ill and passed on.  \n\nThe store changed hands, the selection and the \"regular contingent\" both declined.  Within a few months the only thing that remained of the old Jernigan's was the name on the door.  The \"everyone knows your name\" crowd mostly filed out (a few died or moved to Florida, many of the rest started going to other shops in the area they were already familiar with) and it quickly took on a \"dive bar\" atmosphere.  The straw that broke the camel's back (for me) was when another patron physically attacked me because I have a Masters of Business Adminstration (MBA) degree and he thought \"MBAs\" in his company were hassling him at work, so obviously it was my fault, right?  (Sound like dive-bar behavior?)  Not so much that it happened, but the staff's attitude that his behavior was acceptable.  I stopped going there, instead going to other shops, and I didn't stop to explain why.  Betrayal of loyalty goes both ways.\n\nIt was right after this the place transitioned from \"cigar lounge\" to this \"cigar shop/Irish pub with bar food\" hybrid thing and every thing I heard about it told me I had even less reason to give it another chance than before.  When I found out the place had been seized by a bankruptcy court, it felt like the Karma train scored a direct hit.\n\nThe cautionary tale is: when you buy an established \"name\" business with an already-in-place loyal clientele that spends a significant portion of their discretionary income at your shop, don't ignore them in an effort to push through some \"concept\" vision they're verbally telling you they don't want, especially when they're ALREADY patronizing your competition on the side.  Improve the EXISTING concept, make it more profitable, and use the revenues to build your concept separately.\n\nI saw this coming in 2005.", "business_id": "3obPG5F_6rbAu86CuiNW4g", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-09-13", "type": "review"}

Initially, I would argue with my husband that box stores were cheaper and that was all that mattered. But, customer service has converted me to this store. \nI regularly walk in with many questions and someone has always been able to brainstorm, advise, explain and assist. I wanted to know how to make a lamp from antique gooseneck lamp parts and glass shades bought on eBay. Someone told me the specific parts I needed to order online, and how then to do it even though I was only able to buy the antique electric cord from them. When stripped screws have put the brakes on my projects, they have gotten them out for me. \nI recently brought in an antique 2-tiered wooden paper tray that many would have thrown away. Someone helped me figure out a solution and worked with me to make it secure and sturdy once again. \nWith their help, I have been able to renew, restore, create, refinish and learn. That is priceless to me. So I guess if all you want is the cheapest value for something, then let that be your guide. However, being an educated consumer will, ultimately, be cheaper in the long run. \nIf you want a place that knows what they are doing and not afraid to show you, then go to Rolliers- a place that helps you value and care for what you have.", "business_id": "jLgIlhi_A78JG-43C8e63Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-09-26", "type": "review"}

You are likely to become the target of the mall cop and be harassed no matter how innocent your use happened to be, even if you were just taking a picture of a friend of yours. You will have an embarrassing and humiliating experience. Management will not care about your complaint and certainly will not apologize. And, no, I'm not making this up.\n\nHere's the full story: On August 18th 2014 I met my friend George for breakfast at Panera Bread, my favorite restaurant in Mt. Lebanon. We sat together for a little more than an hour engaged in deep conversation. He then asked me to take some head shots of him for publicity purposes so I suggested we walk out into the lobby area of the Galleria to do that. The conversation had been so pleasant and the weekend so lovely that I plumb forgot about how shopping malls have \"no photography\" policies. Nor of course was there any such notification posted between Panera and the mall. My sole purpose was to show George's face and to keep the background as blurred as possible. That's what defines a \"head shot.\"\n\nI took a few shots with potted plants as a backdrop and then a few more in the central area with posts and beams in the background. Altogether I took nine pictures of George and then we walked to the main exit of the mall on the top floor near Panera to get in his car. Suddenly a man in a Polo shirt ran up to us and vehemently began questioning me about what I had been \"up to\" and loudly asserting that photography was forbidden in the Galleria. I tried to explain that I had simply taken a few close-ups of George and that I had no interest in depicting the mall and, in fact, had not done so. But the security guy was on a tear. He would not listen to anything I had to say and kept insisting that I had committed a very serious infraction and that he would have to \"detain\" me, though he never made clear what the point of detaining me might possibly be. By his outraged tone of voice, domineering body language, and accusatory words any passer-by would have assumed that I had broken Anthropologie's window, sprayed paint on Houlihan's marquee, or at the very least had just shoplifted a chocolate bar from the Godiva store.\n\nThe mall cop continued despite apologies and explanations. He threatened to call the police. (And what would they have done with such a flakey complaint?) Though I was under no obligation to do so, I even showed him the pictures I had taken of George to assure him that no crucial mall information had been compromised. Much to my chagrin he then said, \"There's ninety more pictures on that card and I want to see 'em all.\" He could not be mollified by any recourse to reason. Finally his supervisor showed up and when the situation was explained she allowed as how we could proceed on our way with no further hassle.\u00a0\n\nThis experience of rudeness, bureaucratic intolerance, and downright absurdity left a bad taste in my mouth. It would have been so easy for the guard to have said something like, \"Sir, photography is not allowed at the Galleria mall.\" To which my response would have been, \"Oh I'm so sorry. I didn't realize that.\" At this point the exchange would have ended amicably and with mutual respect. That's what I would call a reasonable way of enforcing a policy. As it is, I believe Galleria has overstepped it's bounds and made the experience of doing business there about as pleasant as shopping in North Korea.\u00a0\n\nI wrote an email about this experience and emailed it to the person listed as mall manager, Gine Mercorelli. It was returned as \"undeliverable.\" I also contacted three executives of Jones Lang LaSalle Americas, Inc. (the operators of the mall). All three had valid email addresses. None of them responded to me. \n\nMy advice: find a more pleasant mall where you will not be treated as a criminal for snapping a selfie with your cell phone.", "business_id": "NaRkccIbBE3gt-3fne_bDA", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-11-03", "type": "review"}

I then proceeded to email various people at her parent company and still...no response.  Here's the skinny:\n\nA few weeks ago I was having coffee outside in the Starbucks patio with my mom after a spin class when 3 people sat on a bench in the front of the mall near the Starbucks patio and began smoking. The disgusting smell and carcinogens that we were inhaling made us physically ill so we left and I wrote an email to Gina. She didn't respond but I was hopeful that she would have someone policing the smoking and enforcing the rules given my email...I should have known better.\n\nThe next week we went back and there were 3 of us total and guess what? Same thing but this time the chef for Houlihan's was also out front smoking... Nice right? \n\nThis is so offensive to me, set my health aside...how about all of the kids, babies and pregnant women who had to and have to walk through the smoke cloud to walk into the front door of the mall?  What about all of the mothers that try to sit on the patio of Starbucks but are forced to leave for the health of their children? \n\nUntil this issue is fixed or Gina is fired and they get a real manager in there that knows what they're doing I will be boycotting this sad little mall.  There's really no good stores anyway besides Williams Sonoma and Restoration Hardware so I'll just shop online or go to Ross Park if I need something. I'm also going to complain to Starbucks corporate and to Houlihan's corporate because I have a hard time believing that they want people to see the chef who is going to be preparing their food smoking out front.  \n\nAvoid this place if you can and hopefully together we can institute change for the better health of us all.", "business_id": "NaRkccIbBE3gt-3fne_bDA", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-09-11", "type": "review"}

In the program, the Henne's will offer couples a financial incentive on a couples purchase if they commit to going through premarital counseling. They told me that, \"Most people spend more time planning for their wedding day than they do for their married life.\" I couldn't agree more. My wife and I went through premarital counseling and it was extremely beneficial to us. \n\nWe had such a great experience buying the engagement ring their that we also bought our wedding bands there. When we went in this time, co-owner, John Henne, handed me and my wife a book called, \"Things I Wish I Knew Before I got Married\" by Gary Chapman, to help us prepare even more. \n\nNow, I recommend Henne to everyone I know. They don't just care about making a sale, they care about the couple, and that made all the difference in the world to us.

I purchased from another store in Pittsburgh.  I loved the watch and it was bulletproof.  However, when the watch battery died, I took it back to the store and they could not change the battery; or they could change it, but then could not properly reseal the watch.  I was told they could send the watch to the manufacturers stateside office in New Jersey, where the battery would be changed and the watch would be resealed and certified like new.  I obliged, as I had ruined watches before by thinking that they were waterproof and not water-resistant!  I did not want to take this chance again.\n\nThree weeks, and $150+ bill later, I got my watch back and all was great.\n\nFast forward another 4-years... my watch battery died again, but I had recently heard a radio advertisement from Henne about Chris, their Certified Master Watchmaker on premises.  I learned that he can change batteries and properly re-seal a watch, meeting the same standards as if I had sent the watch to New Jersey.\n\nI visited Henne, dropped off my watch, and got it back within an hour: battery changed and resealed.  And for much less than sending it to NJ!\n\nWhen I decided to buy an automatic Omega watch, I kept Henne on my go-to list for shopping.  I had an idea of what I wanted, based on looks alone, as I am not that familiar with the movements/complications of watches and different price points associated with them.\n\nThey walked me through Omega's Speed, Sea and Vision collection and dutifully explained the differences and related price points of each watch.  \n\nThen, they asked me why I wanted the particular watch that I had chosen (the Hour Vision).  This surprised me as I had never been asked why I wanted something from a retailer!   But my answer allowed them to direct me to a Speedmaster Omega watch that not only matched the look that I wanted, with a quality, robust movement, but at a price that was significantly less than the Hour Vision that I had originally wanted.\n\nLong story short:  With Henne's educational approach to customers, I got the perfect watch for me, at a fantastic price.\n\nI am definitely a Henne customer for Life!", "business_id": "_iZjif9s-jF_Oju_1fhVog", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-09-09", "type": "review"}

The humidor itself has notes next to each cigar, showing what awards, ratings, and special information it has. Extremely informative. Even if you aren't sure what to pick, all you have to do is ask and the staff can help you find the perfect smoke for you or a friend without any trouble. Being an official Espinoza lounge, you'll find the latest of their line, as well as several others when they have different brand events.. which are frequent, and can include a cook-out with drinks of some sort. You can sign up for an email list to get the latest news from their upcoming events and soecials. You can also pick up a card, which for every $100 spent (marked by ten stamps for each $10), you get $10 off your next purchase! These can stack as well for another purchase if you don't wish to use it right then and there. The most important part, aside from the cigars, is the lounge itself. A main common area at the front of the shop can seat a handful of people, with room to stand. The entire room is bright and windowed, with extremely comfortable leather chairs. There is also a chair in the back room as well that's bathed in warm sunlight. My personal favorite to enjoy a smoke.

The sales person....simply glowed and sparkled with the greatest smile. She handled the return and provided great directions to different areas I needed to visit.

The only problem(big problem but easily resolved) with ordering my dress was that they ordered me the wrong size! They apologized but did nothing else for me... No discount for having to come in AGAIN when I thought that time would be when my alterations would get started or anything. We bought my bridal gown, shoes, and my flower girl's dress here. Prices are fair and the women were always kind and helpful.\n\nThe alterations department was a nightmare for me and I regret having my alterations done here. The biggest issue my whole wedding planning journey was alterations and just dealing with them! My dress was $350 and that was a great deal for me. I had no idea what to expect with alterations and I should have reassess had other places! The woman had a hard time giving me a rough estimate for alterations for some reason but I kept asking her to tell me a price because I needed to know what I would have to pay! Finally she told me $380 and my month dropped and I got tears in my eyes. My alterations costed more than my whole dress! The bustle apparently needed \"more work\" because the dress was a different style.. I needed a hem and to be taken in on the sides. $380? Absolutely outrageous!!! Don't look at the \"starting at\" prices listed because they're wrong. I went with them because the stress of finding another place on short notice was too much work. You also have to pay IN FULL before the dress is done so I put it all on a credit card. They need to lower their prices because they're known for expensive alterations and I certainly will never recommend them.\n\nOne more thing was that when Young(I think was her name) was pinning me, she pricked me twice and then pricks herself and gets blood from her finger on the bottom of my dress!! She thought I didn't see apparently but I went right to the other woman to make sure they'll get the stain out!! I wonder if she would have left the blood!! This whole department is insane.\n\nFinding your wedding dress is supposed to be a good experience but it was the worst part for me and I dreaded going every time!!

Let me explain. \n\nFor starters, I just want to say that this store is clean, well-presented and has some very nice girls working in it. The scents of candles and lotions are incredible, and they were hard to resist with their Fall displays front and center with names like \"Autumn Leaves\" and \"Cinnamon Pumpkin\". Their prices are reasonable and their gift items are very nice. (Sigh)...so here's why I'll never shop here again. \n\nI came in to check out the store and in my browsing around, grabbed a tester for a particular scent and gave it a try. I always like to do this with lotions and perfumes; before I commit to purchasing, I put it on and walk around with it for a few hours to let it soak in since it always smells different than when you first put it on. So I left the store and for the next hour could not stop smelling my hands - it was so good it was intoxicating. I don't even remember which scent it was, but that's not important anyway. An hour and a half later I was back in the store and heading for the counter, bottle in hand. \n\nSo I'm reading the back. I'm trying to be ever so conscious about my purchases, especially beauty products, in that I only buy products that are paraben-free and NOT tested on animals. Call me uptight, but I just don't think animals should be tortured so I can smell like fake juniper. I scan the label and see that it does contain parabens, but it smells so friggin good I make an exception. Then I see it: \"This finished product not tested on animals.\" And for a minute I think, Great! Ready to buy. And then...this...\"finished\" product?  What the heck does that mean? Normally if a product is not tested on animals it will just say \"Not tested on animals\", or \"We NEVER test our products on animals\", or the like. And if it says nothing, you always assume that they do test on animals. But \"This FINISHED product\"? So, the final product that fills the bottle in my hand, the one that I intend to use, has not been tested on any animal. But what about everything before that? And then I just got mad. Very mad. Do they think we are idiots? Some big shot at BBW must believe that their customers are totally mindless, lazy, and can be easily fooled by the wording they chose. I don't know what made me more mad; the fact that they do test on animals, or the fact that they take us all for idiots and try to play like they don't run the tests. Either way, out of principle, I put the bottle back and decided I will never again give a dime of my money to BBW.

Went for the Metrolina Fair.\n\nLiked that parking was free but they make up for that for by charging people 12 and up $8 dollars. I decided to get the all day pass. On the week ends it is $25 dollars. Should have only paid per ride. The thing is I went with my daughter but she did not want to go on the rides. And some of the rides you cannot go solo. They do not tell you this until you are already paid for the pass and at the ride. Who  wants to bum a ride at the fair. I ended up on only three attractions. One was the zero gravity ride and after that I was done. Don't really remember it being so bad when I was younger lol. Felt like someone was holding my whole body down. Not a good feeling. Plus felt sick after the ride.\n\nThe food selection was decent but generally overpriced, go figure. They had the fried items like fried twinkie for I believe 5 dollars. And funnel cake for eight. They also had fried cheese sticks, pizza, ice cream, lemonade, sausage and grilled, shaved beef sandwiches.\n\nI had a Nathan's hot dog, fries and medium tea for $8.50. Not too bad for a fair. Hot dog was not bad but nothing to write home about.\n\nI did enjoy the helicopter ride for ten dollars apiece, again, cannot go solo.\n\nI gave it 2 stars because the entrance fee of eight dollars, food on the expensive side, and paying twenty-five dollars for an all day pass when I had to time it just right on some rides  to if I could share a seat with a stranger. It is also a small fair. You will see some of the same people again and again.\n\nThey did have a free petting zoo and horse ride was eight dollars.", "business_id": "bLh6WbEakHBiLHUsUAkJnw", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-10-19", "type": "review"}

We have been customers of Men's Wearhouse for  big events for as long as we can remember, but as of today, we do not plan on ever giving them our business again. \n\nMy fiance had a sheet of paper for all of the measurements he needed, and it SHOWED how all the measurements should be taken. After the first woman looked at the piece of paper as though it were in another language, another woman came and they began to both start the measurements. \n\nThere were a few odd measurements in there (hands, head width/length, etc) but the women could not have been more unprofessional and disrespectful. They both were laughing while doing the measurements, and outright stated they did not know what they were doing and had never done it before. \n\nI would have appreciated these women stating, prior to starting the measurements, that they had never done something like this before but would do the best they could. Not only that, but after my fiance told them he was in the service (not to brag, only to explain why he needed the measurements), I feel like they should have been MORE than happy to help.\n\nAlthough I might be biased because I will be marrying a man who is in the military, but when a military personnel needs something as easy as measurements that take all of ten minutes, I think it is the very least a business can do when this person will be deploying overseas to put his life at risk for YOUR freedom. \n\nMy fiance did not let the women finish and walked out in the middle of them laughing. Usually, I would be embarrassed by something like that, but I was incredibly happy he did. I felt like he was so disrespected today. We are getting married in about a year, and I can tell you I will do everything in my power to find another men's clothing store for the men to get their suits.", "business_id": "1MApscjpyygvanCdaesG3g", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-09-19", "type": "review"}

She said that HT's have never honored these if they are expired. Now I have current ones but since for the past TWO years ALL HT's I have shopped have not cared about the date I don't worry about the dates any longer. Apparently this little store is behind this trend and they don't have any flexibility with customer service.

The nice thing is, they are willing to go out of the way to order something for you, even if you just wanted one piece of something. Also, it is a great place to stop by for last minute maintenance, quick fixes. They usually have a long wait for huge project fix ups, but if you just need a quick check or putting on a saddle, something fast, they will do it on the spot and you won't run into the long wait time.\n\nI trust them to do a good job for my bike. Jacob, who I regularly see in the bike shop, was very detailed in explaining my options when I wanted to add gears to my single speed bike. He even suggested maybe building a custom bike might be something I should consider since my Sanwa is not exactly meant for touring.. A week and a half later (I was out of town), my bike was ready. It fits well, the gears are surprisingly smooth for a no gear gal like me. Everything was great!

Here are a few things I suggest to make your experience supremely successful:\n\n1. Go there with a plan. As you've read it can be overwhelming to navigate the tight aisles with a large cart and huge crowds. Do some research online, look at photos, and make a list of the things you're looking for. It's much easier to shop if you have an idea of what you want. It's sort of like buying groceries on an empty stomach. Imagine spending all day pushing a cart up and down store aisles unable to make solid decisions because of your ravenous hunger. Shopping Klein's with an empty garden or empty pots is similar. Also, tuck your cart in a corner and walk the aisles instead trying to push the cumbersome thing around. \n\n2. Go on a day that's a bit overcast. I went twice this summer just before some rain rolled in, and because the sun was tucked behind a few clouds most of the time I was there, it was much more comfortable inside. If you can, look at a weather report and shop when you know it won't be hotter than Hades. \n\n3. Don't be afraid to ask multiple people, multiple questions. And if you're not satisfied, tell them! The folks I encountered on my most recent trips wanted to steer me in a direction I wasn't interested in because it wasn't part of my plan, and eventually they guided me to plants that would help me achieve the overall look I was going for on my balcony. It was important for me to realize that certain folks will gravitate towards certain plants simply based on personal preference. I learned to say things like, \"I don't like ferns, what else will grow like a fern in an area that doesn't get a ton of sun, but isn't a fern.\"\n\n4. Take someone who knows what they're talking about. I walked the aisles with a dear friend who happens to be a master gardener and she was instrumental in telling me more about plants, what types would thrive on my balcony, and which to stay away from given the climate change and season transitioning we are experiencing this September. Maybe you don't know a master gardener but have a neighbor with a yard you envy.\n\n5. Go outside. I had no idea the selection outside was so vast. And if you don't see it, ask! \n\nI hope these tips encourage you to think about giving Klein's a try. And if you're not feeling it next time your there, give it a day or wait until the next weekend and try again. Like plants, trees and shrubs, shopping can be fickle experience depending on a number of factors.\n\nI've decided it's a-ok to make multiple trips. \nRome wasn't built in a day. \nMy balcony didn't turn into an outdoor oasis after one weekend.", "business_id": "a933ecROIB44zhzos11YTg", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-09-20", "type": "review"}

Overall, the pricing is on the high side and service is very much lacking due to not having enough staff. For example, today they had 3 of 6 registers open and a HUGE line. I counted more than 40 people in the line. The people at the registers were very nice and accommodating.

I was running errands in the area and saw a gentleman standing on the road with an \"up to 80% off\" sign so I decided to stop in since I am in need of a laptop riser. \n\nAfter combing the store, I couldn't find any - hard to say if it was because they had sold out or just don't carry them in their usual stock. I checked out a couple of other items I could use like a bluetooth keyboard and HDMI cable, but those items have not yet hit mega-sale status. They're not bad buys (30% off if I remember correctly), but they still had many in stock so I'm willing to take a gamble on them coming down even farther in price. \n\nThe downsides were that I wasn't able to find a single staff person to ask for help finding what I was looking for  and that the registers were clogged up with people - there is no way to exit the store without walking through a register line, so I had to try to muscle my way through all the skeptical folks that seemed to think I was going to cut them in line despite not having anything in hand to purchase. Again, hard to say if this was just due to them cutting staff because the store is closing, or if it's just how things are run. I've popped into Office Max a few times over the years, and there was nothing memorable. The last time was a couple months ago when I needed a laptop case - I was able to find one that didn't seem to have a corresponding posted price tag and took it over to a register to get it scanned.

Okay, so know you know how I ended up here, let me tell you all about the magnificent Metcalfe's.\n\nIt is just a supermarket. Not of a Safeway variety, but a Gelson's or Bristol Farms variety. Despite the many Yelpers who proclaimed that this is expensive, its not expensive. If you are buying toilet paper or paper towel here, it is expensive, but it is no more expensive on food than anyone else. I don't care about some Brat Fest, I don't even care about brats. Cheese is just cheese, in fact, if you have been to cheese stores in New York and Paris, you realize everything else pales in comparison. In fact, everything pales to New York and Paris anyway.\n\nBack to the review. The store is well laid out, clean, the produce appeared fresh. It was early on a Sunday morning, but a lot of the prepared foods were already out. They looked good, but I don't buy prepared foods in a supermarket, unless its Wegmans, but that isn't a supermarket, its nirvana. Thus I can not assess the prepared section. I do buy baked goods, and it is on this basis that the store failed. As I was walking down the bakery aisle, I noticed a slice of white cake. I love white cake. The soft, dewy white cake, enrobed in creamy butter cream frosting *cue the angels and ethereal music* Anyway, as part of my five dollars, I bought a 2.49 piece of white cake. *gag* How much sugar do you people eat? The cake was okay, but the frosting was just a sugary, you could taste the granules, nightmare. This is not white cake!!\n\nThere was nothing wrong with the store, but if your bakery sucks, it is a good indication that the other prepared foods are not going to be very good and there are also some other flaws. I didn't see anything that was unique or that would make me want to come here. There wasn't any Bell and Evans Chicken. I did see they sold Boar's Head cold meats, which is always a plus, but is it worthy of five stars?

In this case, you're paying more for the shopping experience and the quality of products.  \n\nAlso, parents, they have nice carts with attached cars.  Plus a tiny cart with a flag on it that says \"Customer in training.\"  When you're shopping with a two year old, that is HUGE.\n\nBottom line, I like this place a lot.  I just wish their prices were a bit lower.

It was definitely a bit more than I'd usually pay for trays of meats, cheeses, and the like, but I chalked this up to a wedding expense and didn't think much of it.\n\nCome the day of the wedding, I was happy hitched and getting photos taken when I get a call \"Hi, this is SoAndSo from Metcalfe's and I have a delivery.\" \"Yes,\" I say. \"I'm the bride and I'm not there. There are 2 planners on site as well as venue staff.\" \"But I'm at the back door and no one is here. I have a delivery,\" says Metcalfe's dude. \"I'm not there! I've just gotten married. I'm having my pictures taken. Please just go knock on the front door. There are a bunch of people who can help you.\" \"Yeah, I went to the front door, but it says {the venue} is closed for a private event.\" *FACEPALM* Now I was annoyed. \"YES! And YOU ARE BRINGING THE APPETIZERS!\" I then just snapped a bit and told him to sort it out and that I wasn't to be bothered.\n\nLater (perhaps 20-30 minutes later) we parked our car at the venue for more photo taking and the delivery van from Metcalfe's was just leaving. I got a dirty look.  When I later spoke to the person managing the venue for our reception, he had a laughable mention about the delivery guy as well. Clearly the dude was not a people person and very confused about how to deliver to an event (as opposed to a person's house, etc.).\n\nThe food was good, but didn't have labels as to what it was. I'd asked about this and was told it would have. So our very expensive platter of Wisconsin artisanal cheeses and dried fruits and such didn't get eaten as much as it might have. That thing was *not* inexpensive. I was a bit miffed. \n\nAll in all, the appetizers from Metcalfe's were delicious.

I have never been to a supermarket that has its combination of size, local products and management.  It carries everything from value (Sentry Brands) to premium version of products.  \n\nThey also GIVE out free Sunday papers.  There is no low end of purchase to get this offer - I bought a pack of gum for under a dollar and they asked if I wanted a newspaper.  Righteous!\n\nEvery department runs extremely well.  I've never had a problem with rotten or outdated goods while shopping.  The staff are plentiful and friendly. Even at the busiest times, they staff cashiers smartly and the lines are rarely longer than three deep. \n\nDuring the late afternoon and early evening, you are bound to run into a vendor providing samples of their local product.  Unlike every other store I went to, it's often an owner or manager that handles the stand.  Frequently they even have WINE!  Delicious wine at that. \n\nLocal foods and brands are center stage here.  They are clearly identified as local on their display.  You'll see local everywhere from the bakery, frozen foods and cheeses (of course).\n\nThe only critique is that the deli prepared foods and the bakery are good, but not great.  If I have a little more disposable income, I go down the road to Whole Foods to get my prepared deli/bakery fix.  With that written, I am very picky and their deli is much superior to Copps (read my review of the very sad S. Park Copps -- I really deserve Metcalfe's!) or other like grocers. \n\nAlthough Whole Foods has a short list of better prepared products (for example, their deli and bakery), they cost so much more (it's referred to as \"Whole Paycheck\" for a reason) and have nowhere near the variety and local selection Metcalfe's has.\n\n\nTips:  \n\n1 - Be careful in the parking lot.  Their are many patrons that have lost their driving skill (think that South Park episode) and it may be frightening at times.  Drive very defensively and always given certain drivers the right of way.\n\n2 - Like their Facebook page for insight on demos and events.  For example, last month they had a three-day cheese tasting event hosted by cheesemakers in town for the American Cheese Society Conference. \n\n3 - If you must use plastic bags, Metcalfe's has the best in the business - they are an awesome green (some sort of implied \"gentle\" dig, I know ... but whatever) and very sturdy.  I use those for my small wastepaper baskets - they look and hold up better than anything I paid Hefty for...", "business_id": "OxR3b_qcMJlzwzGPU5fmdA", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-09-09", "type": "review"}

This might sound crazy but it was very refreshing because John had a shirt with cut off sleeves and wearing jeans, that's my attire everyday! It was refreshing to see no uniform no corporate stuff. He didn't need to call anyone to ask for help or about parts, he had everything and got'er done! The time he was here I could hear his phone ringing and he never answered it!

While my tires were being inspected, I looked up to see her sitting in the passenger seat of my car going through the glove box. Obviously upset, I asked what she was doing and she said I told her to go through it to find some documentation. No idea where that idea came from and I asked to speak with a manager. She called for one and I spoke with someone who said he was the manager and he said that there was a miscommunication and what she did was acceptable. I don't see under any circumstances why a receptionist would need to remove everything and go through a customer's personal belongings. I called back later and requested to speak with the manager and I was transferred to Michael Jackson. I explained the story to him and he informed me the gentleman Chelsea called over for me to speak with was in fact NOT a manager.

After earning certain amount of points, you qualify for different prizes.

You absolutely can NOT return course packets, reading packets, opened packets (anything wrapped up in plastic), EVER, and you're only given a week or two after the first day of classes to return books for a full refund.\n\nAnother reason to make sure you sign up for their rewards card (other than the whole point thing) is that on your b-day, you get a free t-shirt!  You'll get an email a week or so before your b-day telling you to stop by to redeem your free gift, so make sure you do it!  You get to choose the shirt from their buy 1, get 2 free t-shirt section, and they always have a great selection there.\n\nIf ever I need something for a class, I've always preferred TIS.

Perhaps it was the fact that in an area with an already awkward racial tension I was just over it.

Stage a sit-in?\"\n\nSo like any disaffected post-Sixties, post-Gen X kid would do, I bought it.  I paid $6 for a piece of outdated, racist iconography.  I emancipated Mammy.

It is not a Woodfield mall by any means, but it is better than Stratford mall. The stores are filled out and there is a medium size play area for kids. The main downside that you have to get used to is the one level for the main mall. Occasionally the main department stores will have two levels that can be accessed through the individual stores. There are not too many amenities compared to the other malls. I wish they had a few more department stores, but based on the location I think this is how it will be. The food court has a wide selection that is not too overpriced and a carousel that my son will like when he is a bit older. \n\nHidden deals:\n1. Nice food court\n2. Carousel\n3.

Kay Jewelers was one of those times.\n\nUpon purchasing two custom engagement rings (one for each of us) facilitated by a nice but seemingly under-trained employee, my partner and I were informed that if we purchased two-day shipping, the rings would- logically, and said explicitly- arrive at the store in two days for pickup. We agreed to those terms and she rung us up on a tablet she struggled to use. Unable to actually give us a printed paper receipt, the employee wrote out our order numbers, the store's number, and a note to call in one to two days to check the status of the delivery, all on a slip of scrap paper in pen.\n\nThe problems became apparent when we called two days later, as we were told to do. A different employee checked the status and reported that actually they would arrive in over a week- well beyond what we had agreed on. Upon disputing this, the employee handed the phone over to an individual named Kim, who we could only assume was the manager.\n\nShe originally agreed with what the employee had stated, but upon seeing we had purchased two-day shipping on the receipt, she said, again explicitely, that our rings would arrive the next day.\n\nSo we called the next day, and at first, the receiving employee had no idea what we were talking about, and we were handed over to a manager once again. This manager checked the order and stated that since it was custom, it would take an extra week- a fact none of the past four employees had bothered to mention. She then gave an estimated time of arrival that was even longer than the previously stated week+. \n\nAt this point we pointed out to her that pretty much every employee at Kay Jewelers had mislead us, and that if they had said that it would take an extra week from the get-go things probably would've been fine- but absolutely none of them did. Instead of saying sorry for the confusion, this manager proceeded to be unapologetic and even attempted to contradict us as if she was assuming we were lying for some unknown purpose. An absurd moment is when she asked for a receipt- a receipt we never actually received in physical form. Eventually she offered us a full refund after we repeatedly emphasized that her store was in the wrong- something she had attempted to dispute every step of the way.\n\nOf course, to make this all worse, we were told to come to the store to complete the cancellation- only to be told once we were there that she \"tried to catch us\" because we apparently didn't actually need to come in. Fed up, and not trusting the store at all, we asked for a printed copy of the cancellation- which once again they were unable to provide. When we asked for their corporate number, she foisted the customer service number on us, believing we were ignorant enough to assume that the two are the same thing.\n\nThe complete inability to take responsibility for their errors is what cements this review as one star- and I don't even blame the employees, because I'm 90% sure they are woefully undertrained- something that is completely and absolutely unacceptable for a jeweler- and their management sets a horrible precedent. \n\nIf you want to see an example of an establishment where absolutely no one knows what they're doing- and will insinuate you're in the wrong when you call them out on it- still don't go to Kay Jewelers.", "business_id": "C9CCYZwmyzdawHa3WAoH0Q", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-09-11", "type": "review"}

Usually, Safeway is my favorite place to shop. Over the years, i have had countless wonderful experiences at various Safeway's across the state. And I have been known to express my love for Safeway numerous times in public. I don't know how it's possible for a manger to screw up a grocery store more than this. Doesn't corporate come by every once and a while? \n\nI am grateful to read that I\"m not the only one with this impression. Every time I go, they're out of something. And I\"m not talking about Peruvian Wild Goats Milk or some other obscure specialty food. I\"m talking basics. Bread, milk, soda.\n\nBut my main issue is their Signature Sandwich Deli. It is atrocious. A few years ago, I remember people would be lined up to get their sandwiches here. Not anymore. The service is incredibly slow, the sandwiches are made poorly and there is always something missing, or low. And getting a bin refilled seems to be a monumental task, so it just doesn't get done. Today, they hadnt' refilled the artichokes. When I asked for artichokes, instead of refilling it and giving me artichokes, the guy behind the counter took the artichoke JUICE and dribbled it on my sandwich, making it impossible to eat without a fork and spoon later. I just don't ever recall that a sandwich required silverware. \n\nThe time prior, I went and they were out of tomatoes. Huh? IT\"S A GROCERY STORE! Walk over to the produce and pick up a tomato!\n\nThe time before that, I just wanted a chilled Coke. Sounds simple. Popular brand. Large grocery chain. What could possibly go wrong? Well, for one, they hadn't stocked the refrigerators by the registers. When I inquired about getting a coke, the staff looked at the cooler that had 2 Dr. Peppers left and asked me, \"Well, do you want a Dr. Pepper?\"\n\"NO! I want a Coke.\" \n\nNo matter what I go there for, I can't seem to get out of the store without some type of issue.

During peak hours, they have very few lanes open, that is a consistent failure with this store. Customer service is also dead here, and they just don't know how to take care of customers. I feel as though the broken window theory is at play here. It seems like because they don't take care of the parking lot, and other details, the whole place goes to hell.

I'm not sure if they just don't staff the loss prevention unit, or if they are inept, but I have seen at least four episodes where a cashier is confronting a thief. It makes for an unsafe situation for everyone. They do have private security there, and the guys seem really nice, but clearly in over their heads.

It was a typically vacant concert at Modified like most I have been to.\n\nThis is partially do to good reason as this place is a terrible venue for a concert. The band and crowd have to be very small to enjoy a concert . The place is extremely small, the stage very low, and every spot in the venue is uncomfortably close and awkward. The band also has to be packing their own equipment because the sound there is terrible.\n\nMy worst experience with the sound there was actually a packed beyond capacity night when Clap Your Hands Say Yea and the National came. This was part due to CYHSY being one of the worst live bands in existence, part due to the frontman's god awful voice, but also heavily due to the house PA that crackled and breaked and blurted unevenly as he belted his patented cat-in-a-meat-grinder vocals.\n\nBut now in the present they are making strides to make this place less of a shithole. They finished giving the outside a slick new look with some corregated metal and some new windows. They are now switching their focus inside which means unfortunately no art right now, which is usually the best thing about going to a show there.\n\nThe two house speakers also appear to have been upgraded because the sound for Besnard Lakes (fuckin trippy man) and Starvin Hungry when combined with the bands' own equipment was great.\n\nThe other main issue of course is their complete lack of alcohol. However, I found out in an interview I had at Dial (of all places) that you can bring in your own. The guy I was interviewing with was in a band that played there sometimes and said you can bring in closed cans. (I didn't get the job by the way, don't talk about alcohol in an interview kids) Last night I asked a guy who worked there and he said the policy is that they don't allow you to bring alcohol in, but if they can't tell its alcohol they won't care. But now with the Lost Leaf and Roosevelt within walking distance you can always get a fix between sets if you don't want to bring alcohol there on your own.\n\nThis place, like many in Phoenix, reminds me of a great spot in Tucson that somehow the \"superior\" city managed to royally screw up.  In this case its Solar Culture, the Tucson arthouse/music venue where they freely and openly allow you to bring in alcohol. People go there with backpacks of booze. It's awesome. It is also much larger and taller with a raised stage and better sound system and way more art.\n\nModified gets 2 stars as a music venue. 4 stars as an art gallery.

I bought a mod 60's chappeau my baby brother picked out as being \"me\" and I am eyeing a full bonnet hair dryer the size of a rice cooker :p\n\nOnto the soda fountain.  There are egg creams, hot fudge and a toe curling number of flavor possibilities. I always want to cook up something outrageous to try but seem to drift toward their amazing executions of classic favorites.\n\nThe regular menu is exactly as it should be.  I have yet to be bold enough to try their Hawiian cole slaw (so 50's) but all of their soups, sides, etc. taste home made with reasonable prices.  I was reading through the reviews here and saw a couple mentions of split pea soup ... how is it I've never been when they've had it?!?!  I am now on a mission to go when it is being served.\n\nOn a side note, MacAlpine's serves stuffed tomotoes!  Your choice of tune or chicken salad, I imagine they'd do egg if you asked over greens and surrounded by lots of veggies, etc.  It's the kind of dish to inhale after killing yourself at the gym and you won't feel all that bad about it.\n\nP.S. Sometimes the service can seem a bit oddly timed but when you take into account the division of labor and the nature of the place it does make sense.

We were helped by two of the staff during our visit, one very friendly waitress who breezed by and said hello  and a waiter who couldn't have appeared more miserable.  \nI was surprised at how small and, hate to say it, dull, the menu is. Burgers, hot dogs and cold sandwiches. The burgers are from frozen patties and I actually had to pull a big chunk of cartilage out of my mouth. Yuck.\nThey use Thrifty brand ice cream and have an extensive menu of ice cream sodas made with unusual flavors. We ordered our sundaes and for some reason, they were made one at a time, so that my companion was halfway through with his before mine was delivered, and it was completely wrong. Wrong ice cream, wrong topping. But it took so long to get that I just ate it. I'm not going to complain too bitterly over ice cream.

It was still an operating pharmacy and soda fountain as recently as 1991, at which time the pharmacy side of the business surrendered to new era competition. Fortunately, the soda fountain remains. \n\nI'm awarding five stars, partly out of annoyance with snarky one and two star reviewers unaware of the spot's historical significance, but mainly out of love for MacAlpine's ice cream concoctions. Moreover, how can you not award five stars to the establishment where Wayne Newton was discovered in 1962? Note to the one and two star reviewers: Wayne Newton is an American singer and entertainer who is best known for his 1963 hit song Danke Schoen and more recently as a surgically enhanced Las Vegas headliner.\n\nI must confess that I'm not a huge fan of the food at MacAlpine's. How often do you read that in a five star review? Let me clarify. The menu is fine, but why would you want to risk eating a Sloppy Joe and not leaving room for a sundae? Another note for prospective one and two star reviewers: The ice cream at MacAlpine's is not hand crafted. It's basic ice cream, served in a manner consistent with the tradition of a soda fountain. Just as it should be. If you want Sweet Republic or Churn like flavors, go to those establishments and please don't write a negative review for MacAlpine's. \n\nMacAlpine's is amazingly kid friendly. Also friendly for anyone else who still has a little bit of kid within. There are roughly 100 flavors of soda from which to choose. One hundred!!! Want a sundae instead? How about Bears at the Beach, a Carousel or Dirt & Worms? They also have a variety of sundaes that cater more to adult tastes (if you must). Or instruct the waitress construct the customized treat of your dreams. The location on Seventh Street is an ideal stopping place before or after a downtown trip to the Science Center, a Dbacks game... Note to one and two star reviewers: Sure, there is a lot of dusty and worn old stuff on the premises. Just remember, you too will one day be old and worn if you're lucky enough to make it over 80 years (and it wouldn't be polite to point it out to you). I suggest you travel back in time and embrace MacAlpine's quirky nature.

Well, with Macalpine's, there's no illusion.  It's legitimate.  I mean, the place has been in business since 1929, which is quite a testament in a modern-obsessed city like Phoenix.  In fact, I'm not sure much has been done to the place in terms of renovations, as the business itself both looks and smells its age.\n\nI'll be honest, the food here isn't really anything to write home about.  The toasted cheese (my personal favorite) and the generously gigantic club sandwich are good, but I can't say much about their burgers and dogs.  If I only cared about food, my rating would be lower.  But we don't come here for the food - we come here for the sweets!  More specifically, the drinks.\n\nYou can request an egg cream or a phosphate.  Do you kiddies know what those are?  They'll be happy to explain them to you, if not.  But the delicious ice cream sodas are the reason for our repeat visits. There are many combinations worth trying, most notably the Velvet Elvis, Bozo, German Chocolate, Hubba Bubba, or even your own sugary concoction.   There's also a variety of sundaes all made using Thrifty ice cream, but we've never quite made it that far. \n\nIn addition to the actual restaurant, there's also a thrift store that sells various used items.  I've never bought anything, but always like looking around.  An archaic dentist chair, cigarette machine, and old school irons.  I consider the place an homage to a time when home appliances weren't all made out of plastic.  There's also a room entirely dedicated to clothing, which I often imagine is where kids take their grandparents' wardrobes after they die.\n\nService is always good, prices are fair, and you're unlikely to find another place quite like this in Phoenix.

I strongly dislike unruly kids in shops (or anywhere else) so I demand that my boys be respectful and not touch anything in places like Lonnie's.  \n\nI was looking at something in the case and my children were meandering around the shop - which is very small so they were never more than 20 feet from me.  The woman in the back room starts calling to them in her fake-nice voice, \"Kids, go stand with your mom!  There are dangerous chemicals out there.\"  Ohhhkay - I see her point but her tone was pretty aggressive.  Once my kids were next to me, she goes back to her post and says to her boss, loudly and clearly, \"I'm allergic to kids.\"  He didn't hear her so she said it again!  She thought she was being funny.\n\nNow, I could sound like some mom who thinks her kids can do no wrong.  I am NOT that kind of parent.  My kids were being quiet and unobtrusive.  She was just rude.\n\nI've also witnessed her being downright mean to her coworkers.

These people may want either evidence that you know what you're doing, or willingness to ask them questions and have them share their knowledge with you.  Those sorts of places can have little respect for amateurs unless the amateurs come in with a willingness to acknowledge the expertise there and ask to have some of it. \n\nThat attitude can come off as pretentious or demeaning, but really it's just a very old-fashioned way of thinking. And jewellery is an old-fashioned art.\n\nHopefully that helps if you are a jeweler in the phoenix area looking for some supplies. Don't go in this store expecting modern customer service, because most people in this site have not found it. Pretend you are in the Middle Ages, and you are an apprentice going into a skilled artisan's store. That artisan probably demands respect in a way most modern people don't.

Good reviews from 3 years ago are not as helpful as good reviews from 3 weeks ago.  Ditto for bad reviews.\n\nIf you sort the reviews for this shop by date, you'll see the 3 most recent reviews below this one are all 1 star, and all for similar reasons: customer service, or lack thereof.  This review is no different.\n\nI am currently in the market for a new mountain bike.  I've done my research, talked to friends who are bike enthusiasts, and I've looked around a few places.  Really, all I needed from Slippery Pig was to get my frame size double checked, and to answer a few questions about some subtle differences between different equipment setups between Cannondale models.  If they had provided those answers, they would have made a sale.\n\nIn the past 4 weeks, I stopped by the shop 3 times.  All 3 times, my entry, browsing, and lingering presence went unnoticed.  I was ignored when the shop was somewhat busy (acceptable), but also when there was only one other customer.\n\nI understand that the guys can get busy, or can be distracted, etc.  But how hard is it to get a simple acknowledgment or something like \"Hey, we'll be with you as soon as we can\"?  I've gotten more acknowledgment of my presence from strangers in a stadium men's room waiting line than I did from the staff at Slippery Pig.  How hard is it to at least give me a head nod, or even look in my direction?  Actually, I take that back.... I watched them all look at me, but then not say anything.  I even got acknowledged by another customer as I fiddled with price tags, but nothing from the sales guy standing between us both.  Unbelievable.\n\nWell, needless to say, I will not be spending my hard-earned money there.  I wish I could opine like other yelpers about their aloof attitudes, or their knowledgeability, or service.  Sadly, I can't because Slippery Pig never had me at hello.\n\nIgnore me once, shame on you.  Ignore me twice, shame on me.  Ignore me three times, get 1 star on yelp.", "business_id": "42Ai9wcFPE2HZ_aADGXI9Q", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-09-13", "type": "review"}

I come here pretty frequently for new tubes. Every couple months, after a valve breaks or a particularly nasty thorn penetrates my tire I know it's time to head down to the pig.\n I love this shop in particular because of several reasons which I will in turn explain below:\n -Location; centrally located along the light rail, it's super convenient for folks like me, who, once their bike has gone out of commission need an alternate means of transport. It's literally across the street from a light rail stop. Also it's right next door to Lux and Panne Bianco, so while your bike is getting some fine tuning you can go grab a delicious panini and chill outside in the fairer weather or lounge inside Lux with the hip kids sipping inky coffee to music from before their time. \n -Customer Service; a lot of bike shops can be like mechanics garages, filled with gear heads that toss around jargon and tools with grease covered hands, intimidating and emasculating you about your lack of knowlege and inadequacy as a cyclist. Not at Slippery Pig, these dudes know their stuff and they're more than willing to share that wisdom. They aren't condescending and they're super helpful. It's also a family/doggy friendly shop.\n -Price; If you're shopping for a new bike this might not be the cheapest spot. However if you're after parts or need some repairs the dudes at the S.P. won't charge you an arm and a leg...or a belly and a loin.\n I'd gladly recommend anybody here and as far as I'm concerned this is the best bike shop in Cen_Pho.", "business_id": "42Ai9wcFPE2HZ_aADGXI9Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-10-17", "type": "review"}

I have not ridden a bike since I was a kid...maybe 8. I went into two bike shops, Slippery Pig and Landis Cyclery. I gave them both the same information on what I was looking for which was I had up to $2,000 to spend but was concerned about buying a nice bike and then just having it sit in my garage...so if I wanted to re sell it I didn't want to take a huge hit. The guy at Landis, to me, simply said whatever he had to say in order to get the sale. He took me to the most expensive bike within that budget and told me if I bought that one I could sell it for MORE than what am paying him for it.... (If I can sell it for more whey can't he?)Then he tried to sell me every gadget he could to max out that $2,000 limit. There were a number of other issues that I could mention that just turned me off to going back to that shop. But anyhow this is a review about Slippery Pig. I went there and spoke with the owner and he basically told me that no matter what I was going to lose about 30% of the value and the only way to minimize your loss would be to buy a cheap bike...something that would be more of an impulse purchase to most people and took me to a bike well below my $2,000 limit. I didn't buy right then but went back a couple days later and talked to a sales rep, who didn't know I spoke to the owner already...told him the same thing and he pretty much said the same thing the owner did.  He then only took me to the things I would actually need to buy in addition to the bike, like locks. I wound up spending almost to my $2,000 limit only because I am hard headed and maybe even a bit of a snob, but I just did not want a cheap bike. \n\n  I really fell like those guys listened to what I was saying and tried to only sell me what I needed. In the end it was me who probably bought a bike that was way more than what I needed and way more than I needed to spend. Had the guy at Landis not come across as such a used car salesman I would have bought the bike he had there in stock. Instead I went to Slippery Pig and purchased a bike they had to order.", "business_id": "42Ai9wcFPE2HZ_aADGXI9Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-09-28", "type": "review"}

Just moved to the area and needed a little bit of work done on my GT force mountain bike. They replace the chain the rear cassette a a derailer cable a rear tire. I had to return the bike twice after the repairs. The first time so they could adjust the derailer correctly and the second because the rear tire which is tubeless did not hold air. So this is 3 times now that I've had to visit the shop. I called ahead to see if the bike was ready which was what I was told when I left it there yesterday. Joelle answered the phone and put me on hold to go see if my bike was ready. After 10 minutes of being on hold I was disconnected. I called back and Joelle acted like he didn't know who I was. I reminded him and he then told me he couldn't find my bike. So of course he put me on hold again. Now mind you I live three minutes away so I was getting in the car and heading to the shop at this point to find the bike myself because I want to ride today. When I get to the shop to they have my bike on the rack finishing the repair and tell me that they didn't put tape in a tire which was what they should have done when they originally replaced it.  The whole time there are three techs having an awesome conversation between the three of them cracking up acting like they don't have a care in the world. All three times I've been in the shop they act like they could care less that I'm there and my guess is it's because they know I won't be slapping my credit card on the counter for $7,000 pivot anytime soon.  These guys remind me of that bartender that lets you sit at the bar for 5 minutes before your presence gets acknowledged, then graciously blesses you by asking you what you would like to drink.

I had received an email saying they were ready for pick up, and came 30 minutes later. \n\nThere the guy at the counter told me they didn't have my pictures. He asked if I had the right Walgreens. I showed him my phone, with the email, saying that I was at the right Walgreens. He shrugged.\n\nI asked if he could look up the order number that was in the email and he tried that, but couldn't find it. Then he tried my name. Then my phone number. \n\nApparently my order wasn't anywhere in their system. \n\nAlright, whatever. I'll just reorder them on my phone. I do that, wait a while, and then the guy at the counter finds my 4X6 prints in the 8X10 box. Jesus. I've been waiting for a half hour and you didn't check all the boxes?\n\nHe asks if I want to go pay somewhere else, because his machine can't give receipts. I said its fine as long as I get my change. \n\nHe scans my pictures, a card, and some candy. He didn't want to put them in a bag, because he didn't want to crush the card or the photos. I appreciate that, but I said it was fine. Just put it in the bag. I'll be careful. He doesn't. He just puts the candy in the bag. Whatever. \n\nI pay, don't get a receipt, and he pushes my card and pictures towards me because he wouldn't put them in the bag. I grab them, and ask where my candy is. Oh! Sorry, he apologizes, I forgot about that. You wouldn't have if you had just put everything in the bag like I asked. \n\nThe guy was nice enough, but obviously scatterbrained. He apologized for making me wait and for the confusion. I didn't care. Things happen. I wouldn't be writing this review if that was it. \n\nI get back to my dorm, and the pictures are wrong. Not even like they were shittily cropped or something (because that has also happened to me at other Walgreens before), but they were not my pictures at all.

Thanks to Mr. Formal, everything went perfectly!\n\nTo start, all the tuxes looked great and were reasonably priced. It's their customer service that really shines. Per their instructions, my boyfriend brought his measurements in for the fitting. Just from looking at the paper, DJ could tell that our local seamstress had done them wrong. Instead of it being a disaster, DJ got my boyfriend a tux that fit. He offered helpful suggestions all afternoon until we found the pieces that suited him perfectly.\n\nAfter all that, we then figured out that the groomsmen had accidentally picked up bow-ties instead of regular ties. DJ to the rescue! He got us the ties we needed the day before (in the correct color and pattern) and allowed us to bring all the ties back when we returned the suits.\n\nThere are so many things that can go wrong in a wedding, but Mr. Formal helped this aspect go off without a hitch.

I was looking to DIY my bouquet for my very small wedding, and they happened to be a good combination of easy to locate and well priced. It's in the building that used to hold My Florist- they tore it down and turned it into a bunch of small little stores.\n\nYou go into the store and are greeted by the adorable store kitty. Super friendly and cute! Sorry, but I've got two of my own, they get at least a 0.5 star for that. \n\nMostly I liked how helpful the girl was. I looked a bit lost, and she asked me what I needed, and I asked to look at the fresh flowers, because I wanted white ones for my bouquet. They didn't have many of the ones I really liked or had initially wanted but she did go out of her way to mention that because it was a Saturday, there were some blooms that weren't up to par when I asked about them. Not letting me buy bad flowers- very nice. \n\nWhen I had questions about the hydrangea stems that caught my eye, and voiced that I wasn't sure if I could make my now-husband's boutonniere out of it, she actually showed me, right on the spot. I also loved that. She told me how to care for them until the day of, and we arranged for her to put aside some stems for me on the spot. When I asked if I might need more, she volunteered to call her supplier. They said they could deliver some the next day, but she was very upfront about the price.\n\nI did catch her making a really cool looking arrangement as well. I rather wish I had had the foresight to come in earlier and order what I needed, but flowers were supposedly easy and the last thing on my mind. My problem, not theirs. Good service, small local business, great location.

But, do I know a well-stocked retail store when I see one? Absolutely. \n\nI walked into All About Books & Comics while on the hunt for a vintage comic book that stood out from the rest. As a girl who played with barbies and my little ponies rather than superman and batman, I didn't know where to even begin, but the yelp reviews promised me a store full of vintage and new comic books and stocked full. Upon walking in, I realized immediately that the store lived up to its yelp expectations. \n\nI consulted the man behind the counter because I didn't even know where to begin. I told him that I was looking for a vintage comic book for under $20 but something that a collector would appreciate. He immediately took out a binder full of a backlog of every single comic book in the store and a history behind each book. I'm talking about a villain's first appearance to the first time a superhero found a new trait. It was like another language to me but I knew this guy knew what he was talking about. Comics like the walls, the shelves, the counters, the cabinets. They are everywhere. If you are a fan of the comics, this could be your kryptonite... to quote an all star super hero of course. \n\nSo after twenty minutes of searching for the perfect comic book, I finally found the one. According to the comic book connoisseur himself, this 1959 spider man comic was the first time Mary Jane appeared on a cover. It's no first edition Batman but for the price, a collector will appreciate it. So, with that I took my brand new (old) comic book and was on my way. \n\nSo all you comic book lovers...I am pretty certain this is the place you want to be to spend the days reading about heroes and villains.

No gaming crowd hanging around, the staff is always amicable and helpful, I can always expect to be greeted at the door with a friendly smile and welcoming attitude. The store is clean, well lit and easy to navigate. New releases are in alphabetical order and have the last few months issues nearby in case you missed something. One of the best features of this establishment is the collection of consignment books, packaged together as runs at VERY reasonable prices. If you are looking for a specific story line, or filling in gaps in your collection, check this section out as they always have a great selection. The interior displays are always changing, with over stock deals, grab bags and more packaged runs rotating in on a regular basis. Their trade collection is second to none. They have a great back issue selection on the floor, and if its not in the bins, they probably have it out back. Their claim of \"over 1 million comics in stock\" is easy to believe.\n\nSome other reviewers have complained that the store doesn't have couches and chairs, but that is fine with me. I tend to avoid the stores with lots of people hanging around for two reasons: 1) the books are probably all messed up and read, and 2) those stores tend to have the clich\u00e9 clubhouse/comic book fanboy feel; if you aren't part of the club, you aren't welcome. NEVER had that vibe here. \n\nI've also seen complaints that the prices for some items are high, based on other stores in the valley. I've never felt that here either. The prices are very competitive and again, the multi issue packs are always a FANTASTIC value. I've bought tons of stuff here, and never felt ripped off. In fact, I've picked up runs that i would probably never have looked at before, simply because they are packaged together already, so I don't have to dig through the bins, and they are being offered at a very reasonable price.  \n\nI've probably tried all the shops in the valley, and this is the one to beat.

The staff at this store is very rude. \n\nI specifically drove here because I was excited to see what they have here. I LOVE stationery and paper goods and am nostalgic for my favorite stores of that kind from my time living on the east coast. It was 3:55pm on a Saturday, and apparently they close at 4 (I didn't know). \n\nWhen my husband and I walked in, two store people were at the register helping another customer. Instead of greeting me, they looked at my with shock to see me and asked emphatically, \"Can I help you?\" As though I were in the wrong place. \n\nAt first I thought I must be confused, that I'd walked into an appointment-only card shop. Realizing they were closing a few minutes later, I explained I had driven to come see the store and that I hadn't realized they were closing soon, and I made a motion for the door. Realizing their own rudeness and perhaps that another customer was watching this, they begrudgingly mumbled something about how I could stay but it was clearly half-hearted. \"Come back another time!\" they said. \n\nI absolutely will not be coming back another time because that behavior was nuts! I worked many boutique retail jobs throughout college and would never have treated a customer that way. In fact, as a rule of thumb, most small shops don't mention closing time to customers until after they've closed, and then only to explain why you're locking the door or pulling down displays (gentle coaxing that you are winding down). \n\nThey definitely lost a customer today--and for all future visits. \n\nI also never write Yelp reviews--I just was so bowled over by the terrible customer service that I felt compelled in hopes that other people won't waste a trip.", "business_id": "stVENgLTS3MiMhyeJ7XQZg", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-10-26", "type": "review"}

I have lived in this neighborhood my entire life and choose to go out of my way to the Tatum and Thunderbird Ace just avoid this place. \n\nThat being said I was in a pinch and had to go in and give it another go. The place was not busy, several workers saw me walk in, did not greet me, and as I stood at the paint counter for several minutes another employee passed me, but did not ask if I needed help. I had to hunt someone down and when I did get an employee he was rudely told to go do something else so that this older women could help me instead. Had she been more knowledgeable in paint or ran that part of the store that would be fine, but she did not seem to be very helpful at all. As she stood there with her coffee mug from home swallowing loudly, she proceeded to tell me that she could not provide the paint I needed (which was originally bought at another Ace location) because they had the \"old base.\" I am not a paint expert, so I questioned her as to whether it would be a visible difference if I used her \"new base.\" She walked away, kept talking to me, as she checked the paints to make sure she didn't have that base, and then came back and kept yelling at me as if she was half way down the aisle. I am in customer service, you do not yell as you are walking away from a customer to confirm something, you simply state \"let me check and make sure.\" So annoyed that this women is now talking very loudly to me about her lack of being able to provide me with matching paint, she offers to make the paint with the \"new base\" and I can see if it matches. I asked her why would I want her to make me paint that I can't potentially use, but still have to pay for. After several minutes of going back and forth I finally just tell her if you can't do this for me just tell me so I can somewhere that can. She continues to talk and try to circle around the fact that she just can't do it and I leave mid conversation because, like I said, I was on some what of a time delay. \n\nFast forward, I run to the original Ace, tell them the story while they make the correct paint for me, and they explain how simple it was for her to just select on the computer what base I had used to modify the color. \n\nNeedless to say, I will always drive 25 minutes out of my way to go to Artie's Ace instead of this one. \n\nGet it together guys, I am obviously not the first or the last person to post a horrible review.

I'm glad I found it through Yelp!\nI came in for an eye exam and possibly new glasses.  Note--the entrance is around the back, not in front like the other offices in the building.  \nAnyway, the gals at the front desk were friendly.  When I said I had an appointment, they looked and told me it was for the next week.  Oops!  My mistake (I guess).  Anyway, they gave me paperwork to fill out and went to see if they could squeeze me in.   They got the okay, and the technician, Laurie, put me through a number of painless tests.   She was friendlly and efficient.\n   Next I got examined by the doctor, Dr. Mastores.   She is probably the nicest doctor I ever met (probably good with kids).  She was also very efficient and knowledgeable.  She took the time to explain, with a picture they took of my eye and a plastic model, some issue with my eye.  It was something that I had for years but no other eye doctor had taken the time to really explain it.  I appreciated that.  She also gave me some samples for dry eyes.\n    While I was waiting for my eyes to dilate for another test, I worked with a helpful optician in the office to find some frames for sunglasses.  He offered some tips and I wound up ordering from them.  They said it would take a week.\n     All this examination plus the glasses cost only a little over $100 with insurance.

I'm sorry, but I have a problem with waiting weeks for a dress I don't even know if I'm going to like when I put it on.  Maybe that's normal for bridal shops, and if that's the case, then I guess I hate bridal shops in general.\n\nAnd lastly, if they're going to act like a fancy, expensive store, then someone needs to tell them that headsets aren't fancy, and neither is their decor.\n\nThey did have lots of dresses, though.  If you're looking for something you've seen in one of those wedding magazines, and your taste isn't too unusual, you can probably find it here.

I called two days later and the Manager then told me that the guy who confirmed with me was new and they don't really do that for $60, it should be more, but they would figure something out.

Someday man will be able to marry a bike, and then I can marry my bike, it's really that great.\n\nWhat I love about Sun Cyclery, is the people there. They eat, sleep, and breathe bikes, and if they don't know about it, it probably doesn't matter. When I first started researching beach cruisers, Electra quickly rose to the top. I visited Sun, and was helped by Adam, who was great. I discussed what I wanted, and he helped steer me in the right direction. Another sign of a great place, when they don't automatically steer you towards the most expensive item, or recommend you buy things you don't need.\n\nMoving on, after weeks of thinking, I picked up a sweet blue Electra cruiser, and what's great about Sun, is they have SOOOO many great accessories, you can totally trick out your bike, and make it yours. Best of all, you can personalize your bike, and not break the bank. For example, a bike I really wanted was around $600, and rather then buy that, I purchased a $230 bike, and just added on the coolest and best extras, which really made my bike mine. Btw, my tip to the bold, rather than buy a bike bell, pick up a cool horn, Sun has sumu wrestlers, sharks, pigs, etc. You name it, they have it.\n\nWhen I went to purchase my bike, Joe had some awesome recommendations, I added on a white tires, and a white bike chain. I would have never thought of that, but once on the bike, it looked amazing! Did you know for around $15 you can buy a colored bike chain which totally accents your bike? They have every color, and they showed me this super cool neon green, which would look great too.\n\nIn closing, you will not go wrong at Sun. Places like this are truly a lost art. They really love bikes, and value customers. This is the rare place that you can go to and just ask questions, and learn about bikes.

I still think Alanis Morissette is cool. I still wear black and pink sometimes. That is how uncool I am. I am not cool, and will probably never be cool, by the exacting standards of Buffalo Exchange. \n\nI know this. I knew this. But I cleaned out my closet and ended up with a stack of mostly designer duds that no longer made me feel fancy... it was time for me to brave the arctic wilderness of shirts with pearl snap buttons and dresses with cowboy boots that is Buffalo Exchange.\n\nI see that some reviewers are a little insecure about their coolness. \"They didn't take my stuff! I hate them!\", or, \"I didn't have enough body mods to be considered an indie badass! Eff those heartless hipster drones!\" \n\nListen, dudes. Who really cares what some icy jerk at Buffalo Exchange thinks about you, or thinks about your clothes? I already know that I am not cool enough for Buffalo Exchange. That is why I was stolid and unsurprised to receive little more than a dismissive grunt from any of the buyers/sales staff working there today. Actually, one of them did call me \"honey\" at one point. I liked that. \n\nWhile the gentleman at the \"buy\" counter was perusing my stuff, I wandered around and saw a lot of cute things, some outrageously priced and others, very reasonable. I saw a few shirts that I've purchased at Last Chance over the last 6 months hanging on the racks there, for triple what I bought them for. I also saw some cute designer shoes, jeans, and dresses at prices that are truly a steal and a half. Really cute accessories, too. I had to use major restraint in that department. \n\nThey took, like, 3 items out of the multitude of junk that I hauled over there. I wasn't itchin' for a fix or trying to pay a bill or needing to buy baby formula or whatever other reason there is that people might complain about the amount they're receiving for their clothes. I took my sweet $16.50 in trade, and peaced. \n\nWas anybody nice to me? Not really. Did that make me feel bad? Nope! Avoid Buffalo Exchange if you have a fragile ego, and if inscrutable, potentially unfriendly facial expressions bother you.

Let's see, after scrutinizing most pieces for a good 2 minutes, asking other sales associates to look things over, etc, I was able to sell five items - three with tags still attached. Guess how much \"cash\" they offered me? TEN DOLLARS. Ten dollars for FIVE items. Ten dollars for 2 dresses, 2 new tops, and 1 new belt. Are you freaking kidding me? What a rip! That means, if ten dollars is 35% of the trade, all five items will retail for a total combined cost of what, less than $35? What a total scam. Silly me was so shocked I just took my joke of a trade and left, but now I'm kicking myself for not demanding an itemized receipt to see what my items will \"really\" retail (cause they sure as hell won't only cost a combined $35).\n\nAlso, I brought in this gorgeous yellow 100% silk dress purchased at Anthro for over $100, and they said that if I dry cleaned it and brought it back (to remove 2 TINY spots on the bottom hem of the dress) they would purchase it from me - for SEVEN DOLLARS. So I'll spend $8 to dry clean it and then sell it for $7? Silly me but that just doesn't seem to add up. \n\nSeriously, Buffalo, stop ripping people off. You just look like a jerk. \n\nPeople, if you're not worried so much about the money aspect and are just looking for a change in wardrobe, organize a Frock Swap with a huge group of friends.

Girl you must of lost your mind!!\n Then she admits, oh no that is if you get this high end cherry wood frame that I have been pushing on you since you walked in.\nLets bring it back to reality Fely. Finally after the manager did a drive by and saw what was going on. Reminding her that there was a 50% off sale on framing all week. I got what I wanted. A cheap Plastic Frame with the cheapest glass they make there. \nAll for $160.00, such a deal (NOT).....

He says that probably some customers just moved around the price signs and he is right. I persist. Why are you trying to say I bought the stool NEXT to mine when I already showed you the price tag for MY stool and you rang me up already? You see, the one NEXT to mine still has it's price tag attached. If I were trying to buy that one..well..your cashier would have it in his hand. We debate back and forth. I question him, if the signs were shuffled around why would there be two price signs for the stool NEXT to mine?  You see each stool already has its own price tag correctly attached as you just reviewed each one. He's stoic. Well, what's the price then? Hmm.. he doesn't know and he goes back to look it up. Turns out it is $50. I don't understand. An associate was just working with me and confirmed that $30 was the price. \n\nManager is adamant that customers probably just moved the signs around. I pointed around the furniture displays. Okay. Where is the $50 sign then? Was it shuffled around? Nope. No $50 sign anywhere. Just 4 stools, 4 price tags all at $30. My stool had a $30 sign, I brought it up front, paid for it and you are saying that this was a signage error?

Their other \"gifting\" items like soaps, totes, candles, and knick knacks are a tad pricey but worth a look, especially for someone who has more of an Anthropologie, old-fashioned, artsy, or hipster type taste.\n\nI've purchased three pieces of furniture from this location and overall am very satisfied with the quality for the price I paid (using coupons/sales of course).  Putting the larger items together was a pain, but at least you only have to go through all of the hassle once!  I have looked at but not purchased their lighting and wall art.\n\nThe market/gourmet selection seems to vary with whatever special displays they put up (I can't seem to find several Hawaiian items they had featured earlier in the year), but is always a fun place to get some more unique or international treats.  Their pricing on items seems to be around the same as the Asian and gourmet supermarkets I've shopped at, and while they lack the selection and any fresh items, they have excellent customer service!  I wholeheartedly recommend the Hawaiian coconut syrup, and I'm not even a big fan of coconut flavors!\n\nThey have an excellent Torani syrup selection by the coffee wall, and they sell the pumps for the bottles too!\n\nNote that some items will be found with the seasonal displays and not with their \"category.\"  Also, their parking lot can be a little congested at peak shopping times.\n\nWith great customer service (they've offered to call me and hold a minor $6 grocery item), a unique selection, and some great sales and coupons if you are patient, Cost Plus World Market is a store I enjoy shopping at.", "business_id": "u8bQvtkVa5lW-SNwRLH6Vg", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-11-22", "type": "review"}

When I went to return it, they didn't have any other open box deals, so I was forced to buy a new one. The manager, a little asian guy, marked a new one down to the open box price for me. This was totally unexpected, and definitely the right thing to do. \n\nMore recently, I went TV shopping, and I had so many questions I wasn't even sure what to ask. I talked to Hilberto, and a couple of other salesman. They spent over an hour answering my questions and educating me on televisions. In past experiences, salesmen would have become bored and quit trying to help me.\n\nAll in all, nobody here really went above and beyond... they just did what one SHOULD do in a customer service field.

This location has a good crew who never said \"no\" or \"I don't know\" but rather said \"let me find out\" or \"I'm not sure, but my colleague might know.\" So I guess four stars for doing their jobs is a bit generous, but it really is very unexpected in this day and age. \n\nOh, the missing star is because of the douchenozzle manager. The large black guy who runs the store is obnoxious. I have watched him time and time again question employees who are going above and beyond to help me. He questioned the little asian guy who was discounting my computer to make me happy, and he questioned the computer guy who brought over a laptop to plug into a tv so I could see what it looked like on netflix. This guy needs to understand something... he works in customer service, when a customer has a question or a request and it's doable, it needs to be done. The employees here have done a great job to make this Best Buy my first choice for electronics shopping. Unfortunately, if the manager were helping me, he would have ran me off long ago.", "business_id": "kEqcAtMaC6hcY8Wbi1nxtA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-10-21", "type": "review"}

How dare you even call yourself \"Best Buy\" when you are nowhere near the \"best buy\" on anything? Your prices are inflated to a point that I find offensive and your staff has to be some of the rudest, most entitled (to what, I cannot tell you) group of individuals I've ever met. \n\nWas there a couple years back with Collin S. to easily get the worst customer service I've ever received while trying to buy a giant HDTV. The main TV salesman straight up refused to help me. I asked for his assistance several times, he ignored me and was just a cocky son of a bitch like helping me was somehow beneath him. It took everything out of me not to unleash a YOU WORK FOR ME ASSHAT on him, but somehow I refrained, probably because I am a lady : )\n\nI ended up having to seek a manager who must've slapped his employee upside the head as all of a sudden he stopped being an asshole and was willing to help me. Thoughtful of them, don't you think? Willing to help me spend $1,000 at their store? That is really just soooo generous of them.\n\nAnyways, I do not like Best Buy. The only Best Buy I like is in a tiny little town called Anderson, South Carolina because everyone who works there is polite and I only go there once a year over Thanksgiving when I'm in town visiting my grandfather. It's in the middle of nowhere so it is the calmest Black Friday Best Buy in the world, I am convinced.\n\nTo make a long story short, if you must go to Best Buy, avoid the one on 20th St & Camelback like the plague, and hop on a plane to Greenville, South Carolina, you'll thank me, I'm certain of it.", "business_id": "kEqcAtMaC6hcY8Wbi1nxtA", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-11-17", "type": "review"}

I peeked through the front window because the flat irons were on a display facing the window so I figured I'd window browse until they opened. At 11:03 the brunette \"manager\" (she was pretty young) started unlocking the doors for the employee who had just arrived, smoking a cigarette on her way in the door. Then the same manager opened up the gates on the windows and walked away. I tried to make eye contact with her because it appeared that the gate opening signalled they were open and I wanted the go-ahead to enter but she refused to look at me. So finally I just opened the door and asked \"are you open now?\" very politely. The manager snipped \"Yes, we don't open earlier than 11. Those are the hours!\" with a frown and a white-trash attitude. I said \"okay thats fine... I just wasn't sure if you were opening the gates because it was officially open or not.. wow.\" \n\nNow, I know how irritating the \"waiting at the window\" customer can be so I tried my best not to be that person - but was not greeted, was treated rudely and received a nasty \"welcome\" by the angry-at-life manager.\n\nThen the employee girl and manager started talking together about going out to clubs, about how they were 30 dollars short on the till the day before because they counted it too fast the night before because they wanted to \"get out of here and go out!\" and other inappropriate conversation. The employee did her best to be polite and helpful, but it was clear she had never been trained on proper customer service (probably because her manager is so awful).\n\nI ended up buying the flat iron thanks to the help of the employee. At one point another customer tried to pay with a credit card, but the employee had to wait for the manager to get off the phone so she could use the dial-up to swipe the card. When the employee asked the manager to end the conversation so she could help the customer the manager yelled \"No just wait!\" from the back of the store.

He told me how the experts that work there will be able to see how you run and suggest a perfect shoe specifically for you. \n\nI decided I would check it out. I was helped by a young kid who was clearly still in high school, maybe not even older than a junior. He had me run up and down the path as he watched my running style. He explained that I needed a special shoe to correct the way I ran. I bought these shoes for over $100 (the most I have ever spent on running shoes). \n\nOff to the track I headed, excited to get a run in without the post run shin splints. I have to say after this run I did not have any shin splints, however the muscles on the front of my shins hurt so bad the next day I could barely walk. I thought it was just something that I had to adjust to so I decided to try another run. The same thing happened, but this time the pain was much worst. At this point I knew that something wasn't right. \n\nI took the shoes back and this time I was helped by an older gentleman who knew way too much about running and shoes than any human being should. After having me run up and down the path he knew right away that I was prescribed the wrong shoes by the  \"kid\" who helped me the 1st time. He offered to either exchange my shoes or return them. I chose to return them and save $40 and buy the shoes somewhere else. \n\nThe prices there are way too high. I am all about supporting small businesses, but it is sad when a corporate giant like Footlocker is 40% less then a Ma and Pa shop like this place. I feel like they over complicate the process of buying a pair of running shoes and that is how they charge so much, much like a shady mechanic does with your car.", "business_id": "P6H-p8fXbPq8VjO4kLTz4A", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-11-19", "type": "review"}

Sure, you can definitely find a pair of simple running shoes somewhere else for cheaper; however, as is the case with many things in life, you get what you pay for. Not only are the shoes they sell high quality and durable, but further, they assign certain types of shoes to you based on a short interview on your running/foot strike habits.

Based on the reviews and my efforts to support local, I was really hoping for much better service.  We went in to see if they were able to size my engagement ring so we didn't have to send it out to the designer in CA.  I have a very beautiful and unique rose gold ring with an \"emerald\" setting.  I put emerald in quotations because the lady that helped us asked what type of stone it was and when I said emerald, she scoffed and looked over at her colleague and blurted out that it wasn't real and that she could have another one of her colleagues look at it for us.  Then she looked up at my fiance and said that emeralds are just as expensive as diamonds and if it were a genuine emerald that he would've paid well over $50k for it.  I really don't appreciate her nose-in-the-air demeanor for the fact that we were unaware that emeralds are as costly as diamonds and to imply that I am going to base my love and acceptance of an engagement over the cost of a ring.  For the record, I don't look down at my ring and think about how much was spent on it.  I think about the fact that my fiance spent a lot of time and effort into finding the perfect ring that he knew I would love and something that he wanted to see on my finger.  I couldn't have imagined a more perfect ring and I absolutely adore it.

From my first time going all the way to my most recent time, I've always experienced the best service.  They're very knowledgeable and always willing to teach their customers more about their business or share their own opinions.  They are very patient and very friendly as well.    \nNow their selection is very big compared to many of the other gold bullion and stamp places around phoenix or probably in all of AZ.  I recently moved here from CA, and have went to many gold bullion and stamp stores, and this is by far the one with the biggest selection.    They won't have EVERY single size and country that makes gold coins, but they do have their share of interesting things.   They don' jUST have gold, they have a LOT of silver as well, a big selection of notes, old US coins, and coin supplies.  \n\nNegative things others may say that shouldn't be a factor into a low rating.  \n\nPeople who come here often are impatient and get mad that they don't get helped right away.  Note that they are very attentive to Every single customer they come across and that some customers may have a lot of questions.  Blame the  customer who came before you, not the people who work there.    Come on a day when you aren't in some rush.  I come on days that I want to just relax and have nothing planned, that way I'm never in a rush when i come and heck, I may see things I haven't seen before in the store, or you may actually see something you like that others bring in.  \n\nAnother thing people may get mad about is getting turned down for having fakes.   For example.  If I was a gentleman who came in with 20 silver dollars and was told they are fake, I'd be pretty mad.  But I would not express my anger towards the person who told me they are fake.  It is NOT their fault, nor did they sell you those fake silver dollars.  DO your own research people.  It ISN'T that hard to get into this stuff.    \n\nI'll be honest.  I'm guilty of being someone who used to think coin collecting or gold and silver was for weird and nerdy people because I used to think this stuff was complicated.  But in the end I became one of them.  This is probably the easiest thing to understand and learn about, and of the smartest things you can do for security and insurance reasons(unless ur a numismatist) \n\nThis place overall is a great place to Not only sell gold n silver but to bring in rare collectable items.  Both selling and buying is important to them.  Have a good day everyone.", "business_id": "_yPLHvbeRcFazrUusCNHKA", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-10-27", "type": "review"}

We went in here to get shadescreen material for our windows...I called ahead, asked if they had the correct kind and was told by a very nice guy that they did indeed have what I was looking for.  I have been recovering from surgery and I was not able to walk or drive, so I got my dad to help me out by driving me over and going inside to do my \"legwork\".  Instead of coming out with a bundle of shadescreen material, my dad came back out of the store looking annoyed.  He said they didn't have the material and the guy in the back wanted to know the name of the guy that I spoke with.  Oops.  Sorry I didn't get his name, but if you say you have the material, why has it suddenly disappeared?\n\nSo, since we were sitting in our car in the handicapped spot just in front of the store, I decided to call and ask to speak to the manager.  He answered the phone up at the front cash register, so I could see him from our car.  I asked him what was going on and why this material was not there when I'd spoken to the guy earlier, blah blah blah.  He didn't apologize.  He didn't go check.  Didn't offer to correct the mistake by finding a store that might have it.  Nope...he said *I* must have made a mistake.  When I told him I was currently handicapped and it took a lot of effort to get to his store and that I'd called ahead precisely for that reason, he said he couldn't do anything about that and hung up the phone.  Then to make matters even worse, he POINTED at our car and started LAUGHING with the cashier at the front.  Holy crap...really?  Laugh at the handicapped girl???  Wow...I don't even know what to say about this a$$ except that I will NEVER NEVER NEVER go back here.\n\nThe Ace on 24th st is just down the street and has nicer employees even tho' it is small.

(review written on 9/16/2014). I went in to collect my money at My Sister's Closet at T&C today. I approached the sales gal standing at the register and explained to her what I was there to do. I was told to go to another register in a rather apathetic and dismissive demeanor. Prior to today, approx. 56 days ago, I took in 8 items to sell and 7 of them sold. They were decent labels (BCBG dresses, Coach purse, Elie Tahari skirt, Cache leather skirt, Italian suede blazer, Banana Republic skirt, etc.) and what I received in return in cash was $55. I asked Jenny (sales person) if I could take home my 1 remaining item and they wanted to charge me $5.00 to do so (and that charge will be going up soon according to Jenny and the sign she brusquely pointed to). It was because it was an item they had priced under $25. \"It's in the contract\" Jenny so gruffly explained. So when taking your clothes for consignment I highly suggest that you stay current on your contract so you know exactly what kind of exchange you will experience from them. Apparently they make changes to your contract whenever they see fit and do not notify you of the changes other than the signs they post in-store. Be cautious and informed before doing business here. I've had my account there for years and I've never felt so dismissed by the sales persons (esp. Jenny), so uninformed, and frankly, ripped off. Bottom-line: Doing business with My Sisters Closet feels bad. I will not be taking my items to be sold there to receive very little in return and to be treated so poorly for being a client of theirs. I'd rather donate my clothes to a good cause, get a tax write-off that I believe is a better financial decision and, more importantly, feel good about doing it.", "business_id": "OkRzw22eDg45do8i-1jHow", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-11-03", "type": "review"}

One guy, who seems to be in charge, is just a total prick. One time I was in there, he got into a yelling match with a female customer - apparently what he remembered was different than what she had recalled of their phone conversation earlier that day. Ultimately, he looked her in the eye, put his hand up, waved goodbye like a two year old, and told her to leave the store. Today I was in there and he saw a couple coming in, he said \"F&$@ no, I'm taking my break.\" The guy that helped me today questioned everything I was saying. \"Well, did you measure it? I mean, take a ruler to it and measure it?\" Yes, I told you it was a 9\" cover I needed. He reassured me that I was wrong, and actually had me questioning myself. Imagine that - 2 Master's degrees, and I can't use a tape measure properly. The younger guy that works there is a really, really nice. So if you go in and have to wait in line to talk to him when the others are eating or talking shit about customers, it'd be worth the wait. He's knowledgeable and polite. While the other guys seem to know what they're talking about, they certainly have a lot to learn from their junior counterpart.

They will teach you how to use your new purchases and the many options that are available that you had no idea you wanted or even needed.\n\nThe staff is well-trained, not your usual retail sales clerks, but men and women who know their inventory and how it can make a difference in your cooking life and they aren't afraid to tell you.\n\nThe WS staff at the Biltmore are on the top end of the sales scale. They are there to teach you what they have in the store, what you might need to fulfill your every kitchen desire and what you cannot live without. Yep, I challenge you to get out of there without buying at least one thing, or learning how to cook something you didn't even know you wanted.

We had a very good friend pass away who loved Gucci (why I don't know) but he did. So for all of this we wanted to purchase bracelet for his girlfriend and several other people to remember him by. We started our search online and found what we wanted. Great! A cute little silver bracelet with a heart on it, it was a great gift and a great bracelet for each one of us to wear on our wrist to remember him by. We decided to go in to the store to see if they had any in stock. After circling the store several times FINALLY we got someone to help us who treated us like minions. Thanks. Turns out she looked in a few drawers and said she didn't have what we were looking for and to order it online. The next day (Wednesday) we went online and tried ordering - Not Easy - we were not able to add items to our cart - Again Annoying. After all of this we decided to call to order, we wanted to do rush delivery so we could get them on time so we had to get basically everyone they had in random sizes. Not a huge deal but it took about an hour on the phone with them for this process. They had to complete 3 separate orders and although we were paying $35 per order for next day delivery she couldn't guarantee it would arrive by Friday. What? We are paying for next day shipping and you don't know if it will be here 2 days later?  As I mentioned we did rush delivery and had them sent to the office because we knew that we would not be at home when fed ex came and had to sign. After I stressed the importance of this they sent some boxes to the office and some to the billing address, what is their problem! That being said we missed some of them so had to go to fed ex at 6pm on Friday when we needed them by 5pm and then we get them and may I mention they cancelled 4 bracelets last minute and refunded us - Not Ok. Now let's get to the real bad part. Over half of them came TARNISHED with spots all over them. Who goes to a luxury brand and wants defected bracelets - Amateur hour. Again we get back on the phone with customer service who hangs up on is when we tell her what's going on, call back and explains the story to someone else to tells us to chill out. WTF! At this point we don't want the merchandise, they are defective #1 and #2 they have been absolutely awful to us. Game over, don't want to deal with this any more. Next day, go in to store again to see what they can do, maybe clean them or return. They say NO you didn't buy from here so we can't help you with anything. I give Gucci the big FU and will absolutely never do business with you again.", "business_id": "-fIGHIUdHX-T_ZGh2IQz4Q", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-09-22", "type": "review"}

I've been in there multiple times with appointments, once to see why my iPhone 5 battery kept dying so quickly which I was told was not their fault and once a few months later to have the battery and on/off switch when they were recalled. Both appointments took way longer than they should have because they were so understaffed. So when I bought an iPhone 6 last week I bought AppleCare+ with which I was sold on by being told I could just bring my phone in and have it serviced if there were any issues and it would be covered for 2 accidental damage issues (for $79 each). I left for Australia the next day and didn't have time to buy a case (the only ones sold at the Apple stores are Apple cases which I think are overpriced and not very protective). So I ended up dropping my phone in a jetway and shattering the screen. I thanked god that I bought the AppleCare and that it would be relatively easy to replace when I returned. After I got back to the States I was driving to work and the screen completely stopped working. I happened to be right by the Apple store so I thought perfect I'll go in get this fixed and only be a little late for work. I showed up before the store opened. When it opened I was informed by some guy with an iPad that their next available appointment was at 1:30pm (mind you I arrived at approximately 9:30am). I politely informed him that since my phone wasn't working there was no way I could have possibly made an appointment, and that I had to go to work and therefore didn't have 4 hours to sit at the Apple store and wait. His solution we can see if there's another Apple store with an earlier appointment (all the other stores are about a half an hour drive away) or we can find an appointment that works better with your schedule. I told him those options didn't work for me so he said he would get a manager to see if they could a manager to make an exception. I explained to the  manager, Brandon, my situation and he was nothing but rude. I could not use my phone at all, which I rely on for everything, GPS to get to clients, hotspot wifi to work, and most importantly for my work and family to be able to contact me. My father is terminally ill so it's very important that they are able to contact me at all times. I finally lost my patience and told him about my father, which resulted in a full on melt down and me crying my eyes out in the middle of the Apple store. He then decided he could help me, I guess a crying girl were too embarrassing for him to have in the store. So he took less than 5 minutes to give me a replacement phone and get me out the door. Had he done this in the first place it would have saved up both a half hour or arguing, my emotional breakdown, and a bad yelp review. I understand needing an appointment when you're MacBook or iPad is not working, or when you iPhone has a non critical issue (eg. battery), but when a device that you depend on for everything and is covered under warranty does not work it needs to be addressed immediately not when you can get around to it in 4 hours. An easy solution?

While I am completely reliant and basically happy with most Apple products, the approach toward servicing customers at the store is horrible. The system of having a host greet you and get you to a customer service rep is simple, but for some reason also chaotic. My guess is the store is continually understaffed and probably mismanaged and the employees know it. The attitude of the multiple hosts/greeters I've experienced is unwelcoming, indifferent and often a little conceited. I have watched numerous people walk out of the store in frustration and have also done so myself.\n\nI guess they know their products great and just don't give a crap, they know we'll be back.", "business_id": "l5vzFaqSjvxZiRn0MJeKkg", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-11-02", "type": "review"}

You have no idea.)\n\nLost and confused with a failed interaction at that nameless giant store I rang this Apple. One voice input into their system and I was speaking to a rep. ONE.

I was just in with my mother to buy Thanksgiving dishes.  We come to this store all of the time, and never get a \"hello\" or smile.

She then said: \"I have to ask the manager if I can make change.\"  Really?  That's how they run a business?

The same cashier said in a nasty tone, \"Well we have baskets. Use that.\"  She was very rude to the customer.

They did not give me a screaming deal by any means but I just wanted to get rid of them so I took the offer. The sales girl then showed me an iPhone they had just received & I then made an even bigger mistake & bought the jail-broken iPhone. Forty days after having the phone it broke (would not turn on, would not charge) I took it back in & was told I shouldn't have let it die completely & it would take 40 minutes to fix. I didn't have 40 minutes so I left it & said I would have to go back at another time to pick it up. (Mistake number 3 if anyone is counting).\nI was not able to go back until a week & half later only for them to tell me they couldn't find it. After spending 20 or so minutes there I finally just told them to ship it to me which they said they would do. A week & a half later I still haven't received my phone so I called to find out when it was shipped & was told it had been lost but they found it today & would ship today or I could go get it myself. Did I mention all of this interaction came with attitude from them with the exception of the initial sale?! I asked the guy I spoke to, to have the manager call me & he replied \"sure whatever!\"\nI then called the manager at the Camelback location to find out if he was the manager or if he knew who I could speak to. He is not the manager of the Indian School location but offered to call & find out if the phone had in fact been shipped. Paul, the manager of the Indian School location called (blocked his number so I couldn't call him back) & left a message saying my phone was never lost, they did find it 30 minutes after I left & they do not ship & I would have to go get it myself. No apology for the whole mess! So I called him back at the store & was told the manager was off until Tuesday & I could talk to him then. I told them to have him call me back & he said he probably wouldn't because it was his day off...umm didn't he just call me & tell me I could call him back but now I can't talk to him?!\nI called the manager of the Camelback location back & apologized for getting him mixed up in the whole mess but asked if he could have the phone sent to his store since it is closer to me. He said he could do that. \nIf you must use one of these stores I recommend the Camelback loction & if you need to sell your phone, use Craigslist....you'll save yourself tons of money, time & aggrevation!", "business_id": "u0P8ZOHbAY3B0-g4de1EEg", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-11-05", "type": "review"}

I keep wanting to go back, hoping they get the Chef Basket. I swear out of everything I've ever wanted to buy on TV I've never wanted anything more than 2 Chef Baskets plus a Forever Sharp Knife for $14.99 plus shipping and handling.  I realize that I've said that same sentence about Space Bags, Magic Bullets, Slap Chops, and ShamWowws, but this time I really mean it. The thing is, after you see those things and wait a few months, Ross usually has them for cheaper and NO shipping and handling (though you do have to pay the substantial personal fee of being surrounded by unsupervised children during your shopping trip, so maybe S&H is worth it).\n\nThis particular Ross is right next to a Target. If you have a specific item you need to buy in housewares, ALWAYS GO TO ROSS FIRST. I made the mistake of going to Target once for champagne flutes, one of those fancy wire egg slicers, and two ramekins and ended up spending about double what I would have spent at Ross, which I stupidly went to second.\n\nMy other go-to Ross department is shoes. You can find some ridiculously marked down (like more than Marshall's or TJ Maxx) Steve Maddens, Jessica Simpsons, and Nine Wests here. They are usually last season and run about $30 for the more high-end brands, though I'm no stranger to picking up a pair of Joey O pumps for $12.99. I've never even heard of that brand before, but they fit my feet really well and are SUPER cheap at Ross. Another word for the wise:  Check all the shoe sizes, not just your own. Bitches hide shit. But seriously, if I have to tell you this, odds are you've never stepped foot in a discount store in your life and probably won't go to this Ross ever, so I suppose that's irrelevant.\n\nDespite the bratty kids and somewhat cluttered appearance, Ross is good for select things (housewares, shoes, workout clothes) at a good price.

When I think of going to Target, I don't think about going there to eat their fast food culinary creations. Skip the food court (your arteries will also thank you) and check out the rest of this Target. It isn't that bad but it's not amazing either. Here are some things this Target is good for:\n\n- Prescription refills!!!!!!! The Pharmacy is where this Target really shines - it deserves 5 stars. If you want to wait for your prescription to be filled, go here! They are faster than the speed of light, and they have tons of super cheap $5 generics. Also, I HIGHLY recommend it because the staff is incredibly friendly and they put customer service first. \n\n- Munchies, candy, gum, soda, beer & wine! They also have a good seasonal shopping selection too.\n\n- There is a Starbucks inside but since it isn't a stand alone store so expect to wait as it's manned by one employee.\n\n- Cheap yet fashionable clothing. If you have a great eye for fashion (be honest with yourself) you can find some classic wardrobe pieces here. BUT, if you don't have good taste in clothing, you could potentially walk out of here with something ugly.\n\n- Impulse shopping. Want to blow some cash? Go to Target and you can drop $100 in the blink of an eye.\n\n- I've also returned stuff here and I've never had an issue. It was fast and painless.\n\nThis Target is conveniently located but it's also in a ghetto fabulous area of Arcadia. So lucky for us shoppers, there's a security guard to watch over us and our vehicles. How thoughtful of Target to employ someone who puts safety first, right?

Compared to other targets, I find that this location could improve on their cleanliness, and customer service. Today, I had been agitated that all the shoes were completely unorganized, scrambled and messed with, while no associate was there to organize the stock which made it harder for me to find what I was looking for, especially with shoes thrown on the floor in addition to that. Also, as I was waiting in line at Starbucks in a rush, I find it a little frustrating that nearly 10 employees were in the way of waiting for my drink, talking about their personal life. Whether or not they were on break, they should also be considerate of actual customers having somewhere to go and an agenda to attend to while they have the store to themselves for the day. Also, it does not look good for the store or company at that. I even had to say \"excuse me\" in a loud and uncomfortable tone because an associate did not hear me while he was standing right in front of the sugar and cream section for no reason other than he needed somewhere to stand by. Why they all decided to hoard by at a place that people need to get through, is beyond me. There were plenty of tables and rest areas they could have sat in. Instead, they caused an inconvenience for a shopper. \nPlease don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees.", "business_id": "VxnV1uMZURUQMNUaPdB8QA", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-09-25", "type": "review"}

I bought a pair of skinny jeans (g star) that I brought into Danese for hemming, as I do all of my jeans.\nAfter picking them up (24 hours later, talk about fast) I noticed they were shorter than I remember use discussing and marking while I was in the shop. i was out of town, so I wore the jeans and dealt with my indifference over the weekend. I was going to let it go figuring, what can really be done?\nI called the shop and spoke to the owner's husband who happened to be the one who marked my jeans and he advised me to \"bring them on in, and we will take a look.\" Both the owner and hubby were there and I tried my jeans on. Because they are skinny, he said they looked about right. I explained to him that I clearly recall use making them longer because I wanted the option to wear them with flats. No arguing the owner offered to extend them out an 1/2 inch. That was the best she could offer with the materials she had to work with. I found the offer to be fair, then she hit me with \"can you buy another pair of the jeans?\" my response was yeah, but why would I? She then offered to pay me for my jeans (keep in mind these are $200 jeans). I couldn't believe it. I was floored. Of course I was thrilled by such a nice offer, but would never accept that. It was an honest mistake, one that I am sure I somehow played a part in. Both husband and wife said if i wasn't happy after they pulled the hem out, that they would pay for a new pair of jeans for me. The offer alone reminded me why I take all of my alterations there, and why I will continue to do so. \n\nI am shocked by the other reviews stating that they are rude. That is crazy!

Don Baker has been overseeing this operation for over 40 years. He is a major supporter of the local Master Gardener program, which is committed to educating the community on native plants of the sonoran desert or plants that will do well in this climate without being excessively needed.\n\nThe plants at this nursery are all either locally grown (which means that they won't immediately shrink back in to the earth when you replant them at home) or are grown in a climate that is similar. For anyone that has invested in plants, this is HUGE. Sure I love looking at the beauties at Home Depot, but unless you know what you are getting, they just wont make it in our oven of a climate here in the valley of the sun.\n\nThe staff is friendly and super knowledgable. If you have an idea of something that you would like (i.e.: I want something that flowers yellow from June through the frost season and will survive Southern exposure), they can lead you to the perfect plant. If you want some unique yard art, they have it. If you need to know why your bogenvilla has little black spots on the leaves, take a sample in and they will educate you on how to make it better. If you want something that they don't carry, ask and they will get it for you. I could go on and on with examples of incredible customer service. This place is simply the nirvana of gardening in Phoenix.\n\nAnother incredible service they offer is their website. They have a calender which is frequently updated. It will tell you everything from when to feed your citrus trees to the proper way to prune your rose bushes. The FAQ section will tell you how to get the white stuff off your clay pots, has a plethora of xeriscape resources for those of you looking to be more water conscious, and will help you with controlling pests in your garden. It's a great resource, and since it's local, the answers actually make sense for those of us that live here. Best of all... it's all FREE!!!\nhttp://www.bakernurseryaz.com/\n\nIf you are looking to spruce up your yard, do yourself a favor and head over to Bakers Nursery. Your plants will thank you!  ; )", "business_id": "7p0OI2Ld46-EzJkRHGQEJQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-10-02", "type": "review"}

Truthfully, I have always had such a good experience here that anytime I have used anyone else, I end up returning.  They just can't be beat.  They answer your questions nicely about their tremendous supply of just about anything at any given time.  If your desire to garden never goes past house plants, they are just as much for you.

What a lovely nursery! It was well organized with plenty of shade so you didn't have to wander the aisles with the sun blazing down. All the plants looked so healthy and beautiful. My husband and I are both pretty uneducated when it comes to plants. We had so many questions, and there was always someone there to tell us about the plant, what kind of soil, sunlight and water it needed, etc. I wanted a particular cactus that our neighbors have in the front of their house, but I didn't know it's name, so we played a kind of Pictionary meets Pantomime in describing it.  It took about 10 seconds for the gentleman to understand what I was talking about, pointed us in the right direction and picked the healthiest of the bunch. We loved the personal attention, and we were grateful to all the people who helped schlep the plants up to the front for us and load them in our vehicle using plastic to make sure the dirt didn't dirty the car.  Two weeks later and all our plants are thriving!

For business reasons I literally go from what it seems from North to South and a lot of places otherwise.  I deliberately stop in at a lot of nurseries, so have a lot to compare with when I say that. I like growing things and in the middle of a busy day a few minutes at a nursery can be a nice break.  All in all,  Baker's, it seems to me, still provides the best personal service.  They know their product and will work for you at whoever your knowledge level is.  They are also very good about checking with you to help you find what you want.  I like that as looking all over is something I don't always have time for.  This is as opposed to one of their competitors where they could find you dead of a heart attack at the end of the day when they were closing and wonder where you came from! \n\nSpeaking of Big box stores as to going to a local nursery like Baker's...  There is a place for the big box stores and I'd be a liar if I didn't say I haven't bought plants there.  What happened on Wednesday, though, reminded me of why usually I'd rather just at start at Baker's.  I was looking for a  a particular variety of a certain plant.  I saw the plant but not the variety I wanted.  I was told they didn't have it.  I happened to see a representative of one of the big plant companies that supplies the big box stores. I can tell you from past experience these people are a different breed!  I know to handle them very carefully  as  they usually they just don't want to be bothered. There job is to get the product out there and be on there way, I guess.   I asked him if his company supplied this variety. I specifically told him I'd be happy to buy his brand if he had them.   He said they didn't.  When I said it wasn't that important as I was sure I know where I could get them, he asked where.  When I said Bakers, you'd have thought I had said an evil word.  From the look I got, he must consider this one local nursery to be a threat to his major brand?

After you've purchased, though, forget about it. Every single interaction I've had with a salesperson or customer service person since I placed my order has been bad--no one ever calls back, they don't meet their delivery estimates, they constantly make mistakes, no follow-up. Seriously, no one cares about you here. The salesperson said we could get a certain mattress in a full size and neglected to tell us it only came in an 8 inch, when we asked for a 12 inch. So when they delivered it, we realized immediately it wasn't the same as the one we had lain on at the store. We sent it back. This combined with multiple negative interactions with people at the store lead me to call and request my delivery fee back, as we'd also had a bunk bed delivered, but now I realized I would have to go elsewhere to order a mattress. Because they refunded the delivery fee, I decided I wouldn't leave them a bad review. However, we were just attempting to put the new mattress on, and to do so, we needed to remove the bunk bed ladder. The men who installed it threaded the screws terribly and completely stripped them and we literally cannot get the ladder off to put the mattress and support board in. This is the crappy service that just keeps on keeping on long after you place your furniture order. I will never make another purchase at Pruitt's again no matter how cheap their furniture is.

Myself and my family have purchased furniture items from here in the past and have never had any issues. \nWe were in the Phoenix showroom yesterday and had great service from Carla.  We have been looking for a small counter height table and we we're deciding on one from Pruitt's or another furniture retailer.  We wanted to give it some thought and would make a decision.  We decided to go with Pruitt's. \nI called today to check the inventory before I drove down.  My first call I was told no one able to click at the moment. Y second call (20 minutes later) I was transferred to an older gentleman.  I gave him the item description and the stock #. He told me he was busy and will check, but that he believes they were sold out.  I asked him if he can check and call me back so I don't make a wasted trip to the showroom.  After waiting 30 minutes (with no call back) I tried AGAIN.  I was transferred again to have someone check on the item.  This time the man I was transferred to was able to check ASAP while I was on the phone.  I was told they had 88 in stock.   I explained to him how I called earlier and was still waiting for someone to call me back from earlier.  As soon as I hung up the man from earlier finally called back and said how he was right on the item being sold out.  Now I'm confused since I was just told they had 88 in stock.  I told him how I just called and spoke with another man that was able to check the item and didn't need to call me back 30minutes later.  I even gave him the stock # again and he continued to tell me how that item is sold out.  Then he said the price and I told him \"no, that is not even the correct price\".  Then he wanted to argue with me on how I looked at a wrong ticket.  I explained that I wrote it down and I took a photo of the dinning set with the stock number tag on it.  I became upset and hung up!\nI called back and asked to speak with a manager.  I spoke with Pam and I explained the situation.  She also checked the stock number and confirmed that had 88 in inventory.  I told her how I was unsatisfied I was with my precious customer service...waiting for a call back when two people checked ASAP on a call and then being given incorrect information. I told her that because of this we may go someplace else. \nThen my phone rings and it's the previous man calling back...again.  I told him how I just got off the phone with Pam who also verified the 88 they have in stock.  I asked him if he's given thought to how many other customers they have lost business to when they're told items are no longer in stock and they have plenty?  I told him how his customer service was horrible since he wanted to argue about the information I had given him (that was correct).  He still wanted to argue.  I never got his name, but Pruitt's you can give a huge Thank You to your sales rep for losing a customer and a sale!  Since this Jack wagon sales rep continued to call me and wanted to argue that he was correct (when he clearly was not) I will make my furniture purchase elsewhere.

I have gone twice.  The first time I talked to a semi-informed unfriendly mechanic .

My favorite question (heard over and over) \"Hey, do these tires do something special?\" As shoppers point to beach cruiser balloon tires. With the patience of a saint, and without fail, the employees here explain the history.*\n\nThis is a one stop service store. They offer everything you could possibly need for a bicycle. (And a granny knee scooter, should one have foot surgery.) Obviously, bicycles. The scope of bicycles sold is mind boggling. They offer a fitting service to help you select one. Bikes can be assembled for you if you ship one here.\n\nAccessory products range from locks, gloves, water bottles, lights, shorts, tops, mirrors, fenders, baskets, bells (I personally own one with a pink heart, thank-you-very-much), tech gadgets galore [  deep breath  ], socks, pumps, helmets, shoes. (Did you hear me search engine?) There's more. They sell stuff. Price points range from almost nothing to over 4K. And that's because they carry high quality merchandise. They also have an e-commerce store too! http://bikebarnaz.com\n\nKid products abound. (I know, I tried to purchase a unicorn design set of gloves. Alas this is understandably popular and was out of stock.)\n\nThe owners and employees of this store really are invested in the community. You're not just coming to buy stuff here. If you want, you can join a network of super nice people. They offer bike rides for all levels of cyclists. This information is posted on their website and on the white board in the store. It says \"No one left behind.\" :)  That would be me.\n\nI brought in my bell from my knee scooter and Hamilton was super happy to find a new home on my bicycle for it. He also showed me how to use a camel hydration system (which was not purchased at Bike Barn). I knew they would they help. Additionally I was shown how to use the different levels on my new front light. These guys are really looking out for you. I've learned something in every visit to this store.

BIG MISTAKE. they had to assemble my bike in the store. they did. i rode it home and immediately noticed the wheels were out-of-alignment, the seat was unstable and there was a persistent weird clicking noise as the wheels turned.\n\nsimply put, they assembled the bike improperly.

They're a little pricey but they carry the top brands and I found that ordering from Amazon or online really wasn't that much cheaper when all said and done. :) Next trip, hopefully I will purchase the mint green beauty in the window!!! ;)", "business_id": "pU2yeKn-NNJnbMLuFfAXBQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-09-28", "type": "review"}

I pulled quick u-turn and wrangled my car into a spot in their tiny little parking lot. \nWalking into the shop, its not much to look at-but what caught my eye is that is was CLEAN! Pristine to say the least-a nice change from most watch places that typically are cluttered with pieces as I think most watch/clock repair business's lean towards being hoarders :) \nIt turns out the shop is under new ownership as of a few months ago (so give it another try Coda B.!) and the owner himself Eddie was upfront working on a piece. \nI only needed a battery replaced, but he did so within 5 minutes and only charged me $5.00. \nWhat impressed me more than his timeliness, was the fact that he actually knows his timepieces. I was wearing a watch that he offered to clean for me and upon inspection noted that not only was it a beautifully designed piece, but that it was a custom piece by a smaller designer-surely hard to find just anywhere. He was dead-on, the watch was a honeymoon gift my husband purchased for me while in Capri, Italy. \nNot only did he clean it-but he also reset a few of the dials that I had not done so since being back in AZ. \n\nCheck the shop out for yourself and make note that he only accepts cash", "business_id": "k6C5YiGHU_aT8oXSkGb0Pg", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-10-02", "type": "review"}

I really wanted this to be \"my watch guy\" for repair and servicing.\n\nAfter reading all of the amazing reviews about 'The Watch Repair Company' I decided to bring in a few of my old watches with the hope of giving them new life. I brought in older Seiko chronograph that needed a battery, cleaning, and some scratches buffed out. I also brought my Skagen World GMT watch that needed a crown replacement, battery, and cleaning along with my Vostok-Europe Anchar that needed the rotating bezel pin replaced or fixed (to keep the bezel from falling off).\n\nI was certain this was going to be the beginning of a wonderful business relationship. After all, the owner is Russian, one of my watches is Russian, and I even spent some time in Russia, so I knew a little about Russian watches and culture. Gosh this would be great I thought. \n\nBoy was I wrong. \n\nStrike One: \nAfter dropping off the Seiko and Skagen for what I thought would be a pretty quick fix and clean up (the owner tells me this), I get a call a week later stating that the Seiko is ready but he would need more time to fix the crown on the Skagen. \n\n\"Ok, sure. Let me know when it is ready.\" \n\nNo worries right? I'm not in THAT desperate of a rush to get the watches back. I can wait. About five days after that, he calls me to inform me that the Skagen is ready with the Seiko for pickup. \n\n\"Bring cash, I don't take Visa.\"\n\nSure. No problem. His business, his rules. I get it. Well, I pick up the Seiko and Skagen to see that yes, they are fixed, but he did not clean or polish them AT ALL and they were both really dirty still. \n\n\"Maybe he just got busy and forgot?\" \n\nAnyway, while I'm waiting to pick them up there were also several other people (shady looking folks selling gold, and selling it FAST) making deals with him so I felt like mentioning it my \"cleaning problem\" would not have not warranted a good response at that moment. So I figured I would mention it another time, or just clean them myself as I am more than capable. No biggie. \n\nStrike two: \nA few days later I I decide to give him another go as he mentioned to me that he was an expert in Russian watches. So in good faith (once again) I bring him my Vostok-Europe Anchar, and ask him to fix the bezel. he gives me a \"range\" for a price and so I drop it off. He wasn't sure if he had the parts and said he may have to send it \"to a friend\" to get it fixed. \n\n\"Ok. Just let me know when it's ready\". \n\nA couple days later he calls me to tell me that maybe I need to call the distributer (only a couple in the U.S) and have the parts paid for, and shipped out here so he can fix it. So to recap, a Russian watch \"expert\" who is now asking me to do the leg work and get the parts needed to repair the watch. Hmmm. At this point I decide not to invest any more time into this, as I can now see where this whole thing is going. I decline politely opting to send the watch to RI for repair instead.  \n\nStrike three: \nA few days after the Vostok fiasco I somehow rationalize with myself that the reason he couldn't fix it was because of the rarity of the watch itself and that i should just stick to \"easier\" repairs for him. \n\n\"Man, I'm trying so hard to give this guy my business it is unreal\" -This what I was thinking at this point. \n\nI give him a call and ask about crystal replacement for my Skagen. Why not? Surely he's got this under control right? \n\n\"Yes, bring it in. I replace with same crystal, $30.00 cash\". \n\n\"Great. See you Thursday\"! \n\nNot so great when I visit him though. He takes one look at it and tells me he cannot fix it because the crystal is \"too big\". Mind you, he had an extensive amount of time with this watch (I presume) because he had it for close to two weeks when he repaired it the first time. Ugh. \n\nHere is the deal. I am patience to my own detriment sometimes, I am aware of this. Therefore sometimes I get treated a little poorer by businesses that think I won't do or say anything. I get it. But I really wanted this to by \"my watch guy\" and I was trying so hard to give him my business even after he fell through twice on his end. What else could I do? \n\nHere is my actual evaluation of his operation:\n\nGot a quartz watch in need of battery? \nSee this guy. \n\nGot ANYTHING of value that you want back in a specific time frame? \nGo to an AD. \n\nGot a watch over $100 with repairs needed? \nGo to another shop or send it off to an AD or highly recommended place. \n\nGot gold for sell? \nSee this guy for quick cash (it seemed like a popular choice when I was there). \n\nSorry, I tried. Guess I'll have to take my business elsewhere. \n\nOne other quick note. The whole \"desperate people selling gold and ONLY dealing in cash\" made me think that this guy's operation of watch repair may be a front for his other dealings.

If the employees aren't related by blood, the owner will tell you they are \"like family\" and while he doesn't say it, he's implying that keeping them happy is more important than keeping you as a customer, even when the employee is at fault.\n  I had pool service with this company for a year. First I communicated with the man who serviced the pool himself. I asked him for a time card for him to fill out each time he was here. He said the company didn't have those. I asked for a day or two a week that he could guarantee being able to service the pool. According to him, impossible. It was whenever he felt like it and if he didn't bother to show up, I had no way to prove he had never completed the service. Multiple times I had to request he come because it was obvious he did not service the pool that week and if he had, he had done an extremely poor job.\n  After a year of sending photos of my dirty pool to Eric, the man B & L enlisted to service my pool, I had an accident that caused an injury requiring physical therapy in the pool. Once I started using the pool every day, my disappointment with the lack of services I was paying for caused me to call B & L Pools directly. The phone was answered by an immature sounding employee, Marissa Benson, who as it turns out is the manager's daughter. I told her that once again, Eric had not showed up for over a week to service the pool and once again, it was gross. She promised to talk to Eric and get back to me. She didn't call back that day or the next morning so I called her back. Her solution was that Eric would be out later that day. No apologies or explanations for the poor service or her inability to return a call. I told her that was fine, but this kind of service needed to change. For instance, do they have a check off list or a card for Eric to leave for him to prove he was here every week? She said they did. I told her Eric had said the company did not have such a sheet. She gave no explanation or apology for why I was lied to and instead just said that she would have him bring a sheet his next service. Because her reaction made it seem like these kind of problems were standard, I wanted to let her know that I was simply not going to allow this kind of \"service\" to continue. I stated that I was going to be loud and obnoxious until I started getting the service I signed up for, weekly service that resulted in a pool that looked like someone spent more than five minutes cleaning it. I stated I had been polite and had asked Eric to do his job for nearly a year, which produced no results. Her response was in no way reassuring that service was going to get better. Immediately Marissa's defenses were up and she reacted to criticism of a business in the way young people often react -- as if you had criticized them. She raised her voice and said that if I was going to be loud and obnoxious, she didn't have to help and acted as if I needed to be grateful for sub-par pool service. She continued that they didn't have to guarantee a day of the week for weekly pool service. I understood that I was never going to get my pool service every Thursday at 9 a.m. But I thought it was beyond reasonable to ask for service to guarantee to be completed one of two days a week that they could pick. Her resistance makes me think that the reason they don't want to commit to service being completed on certain days allows them to scam people and do service every 10 days or 12 or whatever is convenient for them. Because Marissa was acting so childish and taking the whole thing so personally, I had to ask her if she owned the company, because in my experience, only people who own the company are that secure with unprofessional behavior. She told me she did not, so I asked to speak with a manager. She was happy to hand me over the manager, Blaine Benson, otherwise known as her dad.\n  There's lot more including the owner, Dale Howard, defending all of his employees unprofessional behavior but Yelp only allows so much space. Feel free to check out the full review on the Better Business Bureau of AZ website. But the bottom line is these guys are liars and can't complete basic pool service. There are plenty of pool companies who actually want your business and will do a great job, B & L pools isn't one of them.", "business_id": "CNGrFenwRbwDzE24lKDfiw", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-09-03", "type": "review"}

Sassy Glasses has a rep for style, so I came in on a Saturday morning to look around.  The service was great - I was greeted immediately, then whisked away to try on frames at their suggestion that I probably would have not dared on my own.  All the frames seem of excellent quality, and I don't remember ever seeing any of them at any other store...certainly not my doctor's office.  Being the most indecisive person on earth, it was really helpful when he took my picture on their iPad so we could easily compare and see which frames actually fit my face and personality, which pared my options down to two really good ones, none of which were the most expensive.  At this point, he introduced me to all three other employees there who proceeded to give their expert opinions.  I chose a pair, we did the paperwork, and I was out of there in about an hour.  By far the easiest frame buying experience I've ever had, doubled with the best frames I've ever had to choose from.  The people were all very friendly, so helpful and exceedingly patient.

When using 1 scoops in my 15,000 gallon pool it turned the water very cloudy.   I called the store and the person at the counter advised I place more in.  Upon further research I discovered that due to the \"hard\" water in Arizona a calcium-based product such as this will cause a precipitation of calcium resulting in cloudy pool.  Luckily I did my homework before simply following this salespersons bad advice.  It took almost 5 days of running my pool equipment to get the pool looking correctly.  I went to another Lesilie's Pool in Chandler and purchased a large bucket of  sanitizer with 99% sodium dichloro-s-triazentrione.  My pool now looks great.  I attempted returning the 73% Calcium Hypochlorite to the the Phoenix Lesilie's on Glendale ave and they stated that because I opened it and used 1 scoops they could not refund my money or provide me store credit.  \"It's our policy,\" claimed the sales representative who gave me the bad advise initially.  He called his manager and they offered me a 30% discount on another purchase.  This upset me deeply.  Their negligence resulted in some fairly serious and potentially expensive damage to my pool.  The cost of running my pool equipment 24 hrs x 5 days to filter out the calcium is not cheap. The cost of potentially draining my pool and refilling it (had I followed the sales reps advice of \"adding more calcium hypochlorite\") would have been even more expensive.  I filled a disupte with my credit card.  Their staff accountant Dararat Muyathorn actually lied to the Amex card's investigation department.  This person sent in a copy of the receipt form the Chandler store showing the purchase of the 99% sodium dichloro-s-triazone and claimed it was the same product that I purchased from them ( 73% Calcium Hypochlorite).  This person stated \"this proves our product was not defective\"  Apparently both products are called \"Chlorbrite\" so he was hoping we would not investigate.

For this visit we were working on our front yard. Small project, but we wanted to test the waters of several nurseries before we tackle our beast of a back yard.\n\nThis review is somewhere between a 2 and a 3 star. I'm giving them a 3 because 85% of the items we purchased are still alive (we didn't have Whitfill plant them for us because they were flowers and (to us) it seems silly to have a nursery plant flowers). However, despite the high prices that we ended up paying for these items, they do not cover any plants that they don't plant themselves, so I guess we just wasted that money.  \n\nThey have a lot of plants and trees. I would have liked to have seen a wider variety of FLOWERS because I was working with a particular color scheme. \n\n I believe we were only there for about 5 minutes before we were accosted by the owners and some sales people. We let them know several times that we were just wanting to look around first (there is a lot to see there and we really didn't need a chaperone), but once they started talking we were unable to escape them. Somehow we went in looking for a couple of trees and 3 bushes and ended up ordering 3 trees, 5 bushes, a couple of torchglow bougainvillea, and 6 or 7 flowers (that we really weren't all that enthused with, but after being there for hours, neither of us was really in the mood to go visit another nursery) and some other odds and ends for them to deliver to us at a later date. \n\nOne of the bushier palms that we picked out (the one that we were really excited to put in the new flowerbed) didn't get delivered and they said we never ordered it. It was the first one that we picked out and distinctly remember him putting the red piece of tape on it for us. The purple leaf plum tree showed up looking a bit smaller that we expected, but it was ok. The leaves looked a little battered, but it's been in the ground for about 2 weeks now and we are just hoping she makes it, since we planted it ourselves and it isn't covered by any warranty. Sorry Whitfill, there are too many nurseries that go above and beyond with their post-delivery services. \n\nAre they terrible?

Thanks for being a fantastic neighborhood nursery!", "business_id": "pCvl0km6v3Imcpq5UV_-UQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-09-11", "type": "review"}
