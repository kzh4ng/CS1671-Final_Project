I'd suggest going with a group of people so then you can order the porterhouse for 2. It is delicious. They bring it out on a hot place and set it between the 2 people eating it. You are then each given a piping hot plate with hot butter drizzled on it. The server then puts some of the meat on your plate and rubs it around in the butter. Delicious. For the sides, I would suggest getting the creamed spinach. The asparagus isn't bad either. \n\nI actually went there for my fraternity senior class dinner with a group of 8 guys and they gave us our own room which was really cool. You just have to put down a cover for each person which you lose if one guy doesn't show up. We all got the porterhouse for 2. \n\nFor deserts, you need to get the souffle which has to be ordered with the meal because it takes some time to make.\n\nAfter multiple bottles of $60-80 wines, the total tab came out to a little more than $1000 for the table which wasn't too bad.", "business_id": "90Fqfzd8zD9AuuNBSv9lAg", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-09-21", "type": "review"}

And THEN, we had kids.  I was happy when my wife suggested we go to Morton's for our wedding anniversary.\n\nMorton's was bought out less than two years ago (Spring 2012) by the Landry Group of restaurants who owns a ton of restaurants.  In Pittsburgh, McCormick and Schmick and the Grand Concourse are probably the two most recognizable restaurants in the group.\n\nThere was definitely a change at the restaurant.  Modernize the menu. Expand the menu. Turn off Frank Sinatra. Brighten the place up.  Gone are the wheeled-around meat carts showing the different cuts of beef. The pewter pig lamps are still there.  The lava cake and souffles are still there.  Thank god some things are still sacred. Oh, and one other thing: prices went up! :)\n\nWe started off with a few $15 cocktails, and then opted for the Oceans chilled seafood platter which was fantastic.  King crab legs, great shrimp, raw oysters, lobster, jumbo lump crab.  It was awesome.  Served on ice, as it should be, everything was cold and fresh.  We ordered an extra shrimp cocktail because they were so good, and those were even larger than the ones on the platter.  These were 3-bite shrimp, and I take big bites!  Couldn't have asked for anything to better.\n\nThe warm spinach salad was good.\n\nMy wife had the filet, which was nice and tender, but was under seasoned and lacked a good hard sear.  She was unimpressed given the $50 price tag on the steak.\n\nI had the 22oz bone-in ribeye, which has become my steak of choice, and ordered it medium.  It arrived definitely medium-rare and without the cajun seasoning I had asked for.  Once re-fired, the steak was fantastic.  Great seasoning, great flavor, and I basically gorged myself into a food coma.\n\nThis did not, however, prevent me from eating about half of the chocolate lava cake and ice cream which was also awesome.\n\nWe were initially seated at a table where the chairs sat in one of the aisles.  We asked to be moved, and got the normally-less-than-desirable booth by the host stand.  While I would not be happy normally with this table, it turns out that we got some extra attention and the service was probably better than it would have been otherwise.\n\nThe service was fairly good --- our main server was not as attentive as he could have been, but the maitre'd made up for it.\n\nIn terms of making our day \"special\", they did a good job.  They take your picture and then print it on site, and includes a \"Happy Anniversary\" message (or happy birthday, or congratulations, or whatever) and I think they achieved that.  It's nice to see that this can be the place for us to celebrate.\n\nBottles of wine were available from about the $55 price tag and up, with the majority of bottles being well over $100.\n\nMy real reservation(har har) in giving this place 5-stars comes from the whole value proposition: Did the customer experience his money's worth of food, service, atmosphere, and so on?  While I think it's close, I feel much more confident at the 4-star level than at the 5-star level.\n\nWe're used to dining in great restaurants, but this really pushes the limit of acceptable pricing, EVEN for a great meal.  We spent $370 for two, including a few cocktails, a $60 bottle of wine, taxes and tip. (but excluding an on the house dessert)\n\nIt's an expensive, but a delicious way to celebrate a special occasion.", "business_id": "90Fqfzd8zD9AuuNBSv9lAg", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-11-04", "type": "review"}

They consistently deliver great steaks and dependable apps, sides, and desserts.  However, my first and forever true love for steaks will always be Ruth's Chris.  I can still remember my first trip there in high school after my buddy's dad took us there to celebrate graduation.  As the 500 degree plate came out with the glorious aroma of perfectly cooked meat sizzling in butter, I knew I was not only in for something special, but a livelong love.\n\nRuth's Chris is a franchise and the setting in different cities can be quite variable.  The Philadelphia Ruth's Chris is right next to the Academy of Music with gas lamps lighting Broad St.  The Boston's Ruth's Chris is in old city hall with a beautiful ceiling 2 stories up in the bar area.  Pittsburgh's Ruth's Chris cannot boast such extravagance in their setting, but the food is equally outstanding in all their restaurants.\n\nMy recent venture to Ruth's Chris was with 4 other young men in a \"guys night out.\"  I brought several bottles of wine (you have to love the PA Chairman's selection) because Ruth's Chris amazingly allows you to do this.  We started with the seared Ahi tuna.  It was raw, thick, and delicious.  Actually, it kind of tasted like steak.\n\nWe each went on to get various cuts of meat.  I personally rolled with my favorite:  NY Strip, medium rare (correctly done with a blood red center), extra butter.  The extra butter is key.  If you're going to roll with a decadent feast of steak, might as well pull out all the stops.  It was brought out absolutely perfect and delicious.  The table also shared the excellent huge family-style sides of asparagus and garlic mashed potatoes.\n\nOur server was extremely gracious.  She opened and decanted a couple of our bigger bottles as soon as we sat down to give them time to breathe.  They arranged for us to have a cab-van at the end of our meal to take us to our next location.  \n\nIf I was really searching for something negative to say, it's that I wish that the Pittsburgh Ruth's Chris was in a more extravagant setting like some bigger cities.  However, since the main menu is exactly the same, Ruth's Chris is forever my go-to location for a perfect steak dinner.", "business_id": "0FgwBx7pgmNdUtsd_T8UYQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-09-21", "type": "review"}

Our server Christina was so personable and friendly, always smiling and happy to accommodate us.

The flavors were good throughout.\n- Filet mignon: it was good! I divvied up more of my portion to my steak-loving boyfriend, as I was satisfied with just a few bites. He was very grateful.\n- Creamed spinach and mashed potatoes: surprisingly large portions. Both were very hearty and delicious. \n- Creme brulee: UNFF. You HAVE to get this. I'd like to think I can identify a good dessert when I see one, and this one was HEAVENLY. The caramelized sugar crust was just the right thickness and evenly torched all over. The custard underneath was balanced and very smooth. I also quite like that you could see the black specks from the real vanilla beans they must have used in it. We had a restaurant week dessert as well, but it really couldn't hold a flame to this creme brulee. It's served with fresh berries too, which just made such a wonderful end to the meal.\n\nI wonder if it's heresy to like the dessert at a steakhouse more than the steak.\n\nOverall, I think it's important to order wisely here so you don't accidentally break your budget... but even if you do, the majority of what you get will be so worth it.", "business_id": "0FgwBx7pgmNdUtsd_T8UYQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-09-02", "type": "review"}

The wine menu was pretty extensive, and my husband had two more glasses of a red wine, while I decided on a Patr\u00f3n margarita. Once again, the most stout margarita I've ever been served at a restaurant. It was delicious.\n\nWe started with salads; my husband had the Caesar, and I had the strawberry almond salad. The portions were large and both salads were delicious. My salad had just enough dressing to taste it lightly but none was visible on the plate. \n\nFor our main meal, my husband had the 22oz Cowboy ribeye rare, while I ordered the filet medium. Both of our steaks were cooked exactly to our preference. We both agreed to being served our steaks on the 500 degree hot plates, which was an excellent decision as they kept the steaks at a consistently good temperature for the duration of our meal, including for me, and I'm a fairly slow eater. We ordered steamed broccoli and potatoes au gratin as our sides. The potatoes were delicious. The broccoli was undercooked, but honestly were an afterthought and neither of us cared about it with all of the other delicious things we had at our fingers.\n\nFor dessert, we decided to treat ourselves and split two desserts. We ordered the chocolate sin cake, and at the suggestion of many other Yelp reviewers, I had to try the cr\u00e9me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. The chocolate sin cake was very rich and delightfully textured. A few small bites was enough to sate my desire for anymore; it tasted delicious but was so very heavy and rich I couldn't eat much. The cr\u00e9me br\u00fbl\u00e9e however, was easily one of the most delicious desserts I've ever had placed in front of me, and my husband agreed. The sugar was perfectly caramelized on top, which made a thin crispy layer on top of the decadently textured cr\u00e9me. It was like eating cream cheese air. My husband and I have already talked about taking a night to go sit at the bar and specifically order nothing but the cr\u00e9me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. \n\nOverall we had an excellent experience here. The service was fantastic and all of the food, minus the broccoli (but really who cares about that) was truly fantastic. With the steep prices it's not something we will be doing often, but it was a great night of splurging and very much worth a night of spoiling ourselves.", "business_id": "0FgwBx7pgmNdUtsd_T8UYQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-10-25", "type": "review"}

I had first sampled the famous about five years ago and hadn't had one since.  Now, that I've moved the office downtown it's convenient for me to visit as much as I'd like.

I had almost forgot about this place.  There are a few locations around the city with two downtown (I think?).  The one we went to is close to 6th St. I think.  You walk in and it looks like anyother dumpy yinzer bar with a poke machine to the left next to the cigarette vending.  There is a large bar in the center of the restaurant with plenty of regulars having a lunch beer. It's relatively dark inside and for somereason really muggy, not sure why because it's relatively cool outside.  There also is a few larger tables on the right where we decide to sit.  At first we all sat down thinking that there was a server, there wasn't.  So, we looked a little dumb (not the first time), then we realized that you actually order and pay yourself in the back.  In the back there is a deli counter with large coolers to also purchase beer by the 6 pack (I guess).  I order for Ray and myself.  I get one corned beef on rye with swiss and a side of dark mustard.  I also get another corned beef with cole slaw as the topping for us. Tom gets the corned beef with cole slaw ontop.  I also order a couple orders of macaroni salad and grab a couple of iced teas out of the cooler.  We walk back to the table and I first sample the macaroni salad, not good...not good at all...The flavor is somewhat offputting and there also is something sweet like cinammon in it.  I only have a bite.  Now, the sandwiches are great!  I had a 1/2 of the Corned Beef on rye wiht mustard and it's great!  The bread is fresh, the mustard is cgood quality and the corned beef is delicious piled high packed with flavor.  The other 1/2 I tried with the coleslaw on top is also delicious the coleslaw is creamy and is the perfect topping for the savory corned beef.

I've had famous burgers such as the ones at Mr. Bartley's up in MA or the french bread burgers down at Rotier's in Nashville as well as regional burgers like the green chili cheeseburgers of the southwest.\n\nAfter it all, I still see Tessaro's as one of the best burgers I've had ever (my other top burger joints are scattered throughout the midwest where the beef is as fresh as fresh gets).  I started out with medium rare burgers when I first started going there, but eventually I toned down the knob to rare.  My cheese choice is always a slice of American.\n\nI typically like my burgers griddled with only burger bun and cheese, but since Tessaro's serves up \"Pub Burgers\", I find it okay to eat with rabbit food (lettuce, tomato, onion).  Ketchup on a burger is blasphemy.  There is never a reason to add ketchup on a burger unless the burger is of poor quality.  Ketchup on a good burger is like heading to a prime steakhouse and asking for A1.  Save it for when you overcook your burgers at home or when you're at McDonald's.  Mustard is okay in reasonable quantities since its texture and taste complements the burger as opposed to covering it up.\n\nMy first thought was wow. These buns are huge. The top bun was awkwardly round and I had squish it a little to get a first bite that consisted of both burger and bun. It worked out in the end, as the buns were able to sop up all the excess beef juice without getting excessively soggy and difficult to hold. The patty itself was perfectly cooked. A full half pound of loosely packed coarse ground beef. I'm not sure what blend they use (definitely more than just chuck), but I want to guess around 75-80% lean, which is perfect in my book. The beef itself had an amazing texture and wasn't heavily seasoned. The beef itself tasted remarkably fresh and just the right amount of \"beefy\". I usually order cheeseburgers over hamburgers as the slice of cheese makes the burger more forgiving to being overcooked and dry; however, at Tessaro's, this was not the case. The slice of American cheese was perfectly melted and added the textural difference between the soft buns, the crisp lettuce, and the beefy patty. The lettuce and onions added additional contrast with their crunchy attributes, and the acidity from the two tomato slices balanced out the cheese. The soggy pickles were overshadowed by the red onion slices which offered not only a crunch but also a spicy kick, and I did not notice them at all.\n\nMy side choice is always home fries.  They come slightly charred and taste of delicious butter.  I had half my portion \"naked\" and paired the half with the traditional Heinz ketchup. Honestly they didn't need the extra boost of flavor from the ketchup as they were amazing beforehand already. With the addition of the Heinz, the subtle tones of the char and butter were covered up, which was a pity.\n\nWhen you go to a steakhouse you order a steak.  When you go to a coffeehouse you order a coffee.  When you go to Tessaro's you order a burger.", "business_id": "vgXE1I7c9ElcfYyZfQiN1Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-10-01", "type": "review"}

Also, IMHO, grilled meat tastes better, but griddled meat is juicer.\n\nThe burgers are served on what appears to be a Portuguese style bun, rather plain tasting they add very little to the burger itself. Toppings are simple lettuce, tomato, onions, etc. Their goal is to highlight the meat and not cover it up with lots of toppings or sauces.\n\nOn the side I had the home-fries, which they suggested, and to be honest they were disgustingly gross. Overcooked lumps of potato and onions saturated in grease that not only looked bad but didn't taste very good either.\n\nI like the ambience of the local burger joint, but thought a burger for $ 9.00 was pretty spendy. Service was good.\n\nBottom Line:\n\nSome of the best meat that I've had in a burger, it was cooked perfectly and very juicy - skip those home fires (yuck).\n \nIf you are burger purist, enjoying a plain all American hamburger with nothing fancy you will love Tessaro's, if however, you like a more complicated burger with lots of dressings / sauces and complex toppings you will find Tessaro's lacking.\n\nSo why three stars? 1 off for the home fires and 1 off for not grilling the burger over that hardwood.", "business_id": "vgXE1I7c9ElcfYyZfQiN1Q", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-10-01", "type": "review"}

I went with a traditional American cheeseburger, while Christian, I mean, my husband, got the Gourmet burger. Both were cooked to our specifications (medium and rare, respectively), and were juicy and flavorful. No french fries here as sides, which is an interesting decision, and makes the experience more unique. Though we could have gotten something healthy, like steamed broccoli, we both went with the home fries. They were great: tender on the inside, crispy on the outside & flavorful. Because so many of the review focused on the burgers, we were surprised to see they have lots of other menu items, including fish & ribs. So, I plan to return and give some other menu items a try.

We actually had to move the table out to get in and out of the corner booth. I decided on the basic cheeseburger and ordered the boiled red skin potatoes for the baby and a side of chips for me fully expecting homemade chips. Not the case. I got a handful of what seemed to be a ruffles knock off. The potatoes were very bland despite being served with warm butter on the side. Great for a picky baby. Bad for an adult who is looking for something tasty. Now to the burger. Huge, yes. Juicy, not even close. Despite ordering my burgers well done, I expect them to still be tender and juicy. This was not the case. My burger was as dry as a burnt piece of chicken. I ate half of it.

I  aware that my boyfriend and I went to enjoy Mortons for the first time during Queens Feast aka Restaurant Week which some may say that is why our experience was so poor. I believe this week is a way to win new patrons and to showcase what your restaurant does well. It may be a discounted price for Mortons but we are still spending our hard earned money. \n\nOur evening started out well, promptly greet by the host, who quickly found our reservation. We were slightly early so they requested that we wait for a few minutes in the bar. We may have waited 5 minutes before our table was ready. \n\nThe decor is awful and the lighting feels like you are under fluorescent. I felt like I had walked into a mans bachelor pad with the black and silver ultra mod vibe. We were seated and given water from back waiters quickly. We discussed the menu, which we had already reviewed online before we picked which restaurant we wanted to try, therefore we knew what we wanted. \n\nWe made a decision on a bottle of wine we wanted which we ordered from the manager. At this point we still had not seen our server. Once the server finally made his way to our table he was very pushy about trying to get us not to eat off the restaurant week menu. It was obvious he was disappointed that we were there to partake in RW. \n\nWe finally made the server understand that we weren't going to do anything over than RW and wine. I ordered the tuna tartare as my starter which took a very long time to reach our table but was delicious. My second course was the Filet (Med Rare) prepared Oscar style with Bearnaise sauce on the side. We waited and waited... Then waited some more. \n\nThere was a large private event which I am assuming took preciseness over us. Even with that being said our server just disappeared!!! I poured my own wine refills. We were sitting there wondering what was taking so long for our steaks and he didn't come by to offer an update. When the steak came out I cut into mine and it was Well Done!!!! My boyfriends steak was also over cooked, he ordered Rare and received MedWell! They took our steaks and then we waited again... Mine comes out covered in Bearnaise sauce!!! I requested sauce on the side because I don't like sauce on my steak, only on the asparagus. Eventually they bring my steal out correct. \n\nWe ate our dinner quickly because of how hungry we were. Very little apology from the staff about the horrible experience. Our table was cleared and the server brings out the dessert which AGAIN was wrong! He rolled his eyes at us when I told him, this isn't our fault that he is getting our order wrong! \n\nEven at the discounted price we paid for Queens Feast we felt robbed. Our server still made good money from us, we never tip poorly but we felt he didn't deserve it. The experience was absolutely horrible and my boyfriend and I vowed to never visit again. \n\nI received an email, from the automated system, asking how our experience was so I wrote the manager telling him about our experience and he never even bothered answering me. \n\nIf you want to enjoy a nice steak dinner take your money to Capital Grille or Flemings!", "business_id": "Lt9o2RmacVY2L-IWLA8uTg", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-11-16", "type": "review"}

I called and made reservations, they were very nice and completely accommodating over the phone.  We arrive on time for our reservations and we are greeted by the hostess who is the first to tell my girlfriend Happy Birthday, everyone inn the restaurant from the servers to the bus boys said hello to us and wished my girl a happy birthday.  When we arrived at the table it was covered in a very classy looking glitter and decorations specifically yfor the occasion.  They made us feel like movie stars, and she thought I was amazing because I had set all this up, but really it was all Capital Grille. So right away the service has set the scene for us to have an excellent night.\n\nThen came the food, we started with a round of gin and tonics, good, and a crab cake appetizer which was amazing, chunks of perfectly seasoned crab meat, and just enough to wet our appetites for the main course.  She ordered the fillet Mignon, and I got the porterhouse.  It was spectacular.  The meat is aged in a glassed in room, which you can see when you first walk in, and tastes incredibly rich, with many layers of flavor, from the smoked grilled aspect to the texture of the aged beef, ummm, I even took the bone home and gnawed on it the next day, it was that good.  The mashed potatoes were really good too.\n\nCapital grille is perfect for special occasions, a little pricey, but when you're celebrating, this is the place to go all out.", "business_id": "CChwRoYVXA3QZulS8a6xOQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2007-09-30", "type": "review"}

However more modern interpretations like Houston's/Hillstone or J.Alexander's score higher and feel better. \n\nThe service was knowledgeable, but rushed, and not attentive.Not bad in any way but not what I would expect from a place that seems so polished, pretentious and more importantly so expensive. Lets just say I have had much better service for half the price... ( recently Acme in Chapel Hill but I have yet to get to that review)\n\nFood ... OK $40 an entree  ala carte, $10 sides, those are NYC, LA, SF  prices. I expect it to be of comparable quality...... Sadly it was not.  \n\nThe menu list \"daily seafood feature\", when I asked it was, I was told filet(beef) medallions with scallops .... sorry Chef .... that may feature seafood, but it is not a \"seafood feature\" !  \n\nBetween the 2 of us we had - \n\nCedar Plank salmon, slightly over cooked, vastly under seasoned ( my better half rarely salts anything she did this)\n\nBone in NY ordered mid-rare, received very much on the rare side, slightly cold, flavor was good, but undercooked and served with a slightly roasted shallot that was still crunchy (not cooked enough), not the sweet, soft, unctuousness that it could have been.\n\nPotato gratin ( $10) needed an extra 15 min. in the oven, the potatoes were not cooked through... and there was a very very strong raw garlic flavor, AND there was plastic wrap inside ! .. In fairness I understand this happens occasionally and it and the dessert were comped, however I see a trend of sloppiness with the food that should not be happening at this price point.\n\nGrilled Asparagus ($10) it was ok ... but just ok. \n\nDessert creme brule, ......nothing special...  thin  not very crisp carmel, made worse by too many wet berries, and a strawberry fan garnish which even in the darkly lit dining room (as opposed to the kitchen) I could see was past its prime.\n\nit was a $50 dinner for more than $150, so I think that \n\n\"Meh.

My oh my is it amazing. From the bar, to the table and everything in between... absolutely top notch.\n\nDrinks: My knees go weak for an amazing filthy martini. They make it just the way I like it. Bonus: they bring the shaker out to the table and pour it in front of you. Double bonus: blue cheese stuffed olives. I also recommend their signature drink the Stoli Doli martini. Great cocktail.

For the wine lovers, the selection is overwhelming... which is a good thing.\n\nFood: the pan fried calamari is CG's signature app. My problem here though is that I can not partake in appetizers or else I stuff myself full before the main course arrives. Last night I went with French Onion Soup, split a house salad with my friend and the Sliced Filet Mignon with Cipollini Onions and Wild Mushrooms. We also got the lobster mac n cheese and grilled asparagus. It was all pretty amazing. I may or may not be still thinking about that mac n cheese. Wow, that's a must get side item there.\n\nDessert: I was already full at this point... like throw-a-white-flag-in-the-air kind of full. But then it happened- they brought out a tray with every one of their desserts on it for the birthday boy. I had no choice but to try them all.

Let me first state that I was  dining solo and was wearing a baseball hat, jeans and cowboy boots. When I entered, the hostess asked me if I preferred sitting in the bar area.  Given what I was wearing and since I was alone, that made perfect sense to me.  I sat at the bar and Richard was my waiter.  I had an absolutely different experience with Richard than was described in a recent post.  He...and the food...made my visit memorable.\n\nLet me first say that Richard had to have been one of the most professional, yet congenial, waiters/servers that I have encountered in a long time.  He had the perfect mixture of banter with me---while waiting for food--- while allowing me to have quality time with my food when it came.\n\nI do not like onions and indicated that to Richard. He then said that he was going to change some of the bread with my meal as it contained onions.  Nice touch!  A few minutes later someone from the kitchen came over and asked me if I was allergic to onions (which I am not).  I make it a habit to let servers know of my distaste for onions, when appropriate.  Never have I been asked before if I were allergic to onions.  I truly appreciate the C.G. staff for going out of their way to cater to me like they did.\n\nRichard also steered me well with food choices.  On my own, I NEVER would have thought of ordering mashed potatoes at a restaurant of the caliber of C.G.  Richard suggested that I have that as a side.  I agreed and am so glad I did.  The best word to describe them was \"sublime.\"  My main dish, salmon, was equally superb.  My only disappointment in the whole meal was that I had two beers which helped fill me up.  Alas, there was no room for dessert.\n\nAre C.G.'s price ridiculously high?  Absolutely!\n\nIs the food at C.G. ridiculously good? Absolutely!\n\nDid Richard help make my visit spectacular?

We also had various vegetable sides but I didn't sample many of those.  For the main courses, all the adults had different steaks on the menu. Mine was the Steak au Poivre with a creamy French sounding sauce. It was beautifully tender at medium rare and spiced just right. Everyone raved about their steaks. The kids had their Chicken tenders (?) which was not on the regular menu but the waitress arranged it. The ambience was classy but not stuffy. We were not loud but pretty chatty and never felt rushed or uncomfortable. The vibe was bustling but relaxed for the guests. Only one person had dessert, everyone else were too full.

My steak was cooked to perfection and our sides of Sam's mashed potatoes and asparagus were also prepared to our liking.\nI can find nothing but great things to say about the quality of food.\nThe only thing keeping me from giving me The Capital Grille five stars is the service.

Our waiter was \"Ok\". Nothing special. He was semi-attentive but as we were having our first sips of our after dinner drinks he brought us the check. Really? Do you want us to leave or do you want us to sit and spend some more money.? It was Halloween and its not like the place was slammed full. \nCall me picky but if I am dropping $250 for dinner then I would expect that the service equal my expectations.\nI do want to give The Capital Grille a big Thank You for going the extra step of setting up our table for our anniversary.

First off, it is one of the only real restaurants in a wasteland near the airport.  Fast food and gas stations abound, so if you are there and looking for a dining option, this is the one.  Don't be thrown off by the hulkin security guard in the parking lot either....the place is fine.\n   One piece of advice...when folks say it is dark....it is DARK.  If you are getting old and you forget your reading glasses, forget about reading the menu.  Hell, bring a flashlight.  \n   At any rate, we were seated immediately (there was a large party having a really good time on the other side of the restaurant) in a booth.  Nothing fancy like tableclothes here...but there are clothe napkins. The menu is very simple....steak and more steak.  I ordered the 22 ounce cowboy ribeye medium rare and that is exactly what I got.  It comes with a salad (chopped iceberg lettuce and two radish slices) and your choice of side (steamed veggies or potatoes).  The steak was fine. I wouldn't put in par with the finest steak houses, but it compared favorably to Ruby Tuesday or Outback.  It was well prepared and was buried under three large onion rings.  A little on the fatty side, but tasty.  I would liken it to the best supermarket steak you would buy and grill yourself. \nUnfortunately, I was under the weather, so other than the house merlot and a shot of glenlivet after dinner, nothing else to report.  Our waitress was sociable.  The atmosphere was utilitarian.  I wouldn't rave about the place, but considering some of the eateries I find on the road, this one was okay.  In other words, I'd go back (for a meat fix).  \nPricewise, this ain't cheap.  My ribeye was $29 and my colleagues 13 ounce boneless ribeye was $22.  \nStrangest thing about the Ranch House....although it is a steak house, there was absolutely no smell of food in the place.

Yes, I'm a fan of steakhouses, as much for the ambiance and service as I am the food. I like to call my visits to steakhouses, \"scotch & steak\" as that is how I roll at these places. Not the cheapest way to go, but the style that I choose. What sets The Palm at the top is its attention to service, not only to me, but everyone around me as I listened in to their conversations with other servers. Definitely a spot for loyal regulars of which I will now become one of. \n\nGot there last night around 6:30pm and sat down at the bar and ordered my scotch from Michele, who was a great bartender offering up just the right amount of conversation. The bar area is long and has plenty of seats as well as small 2-top tables behind it. When my colleague arrived we decided to grab a booth next to the bar area...this is the way to go for me as you get the bar/lounge steakhouse feel. Now for the steaks...probably the highest price in Charlotte, even a tad higher than Morton's. All steak started in the $40's and went up to the $60's. My colleague, who is a regular, went with the \"off-the-menu\" porterhouse, while I went with the new your strip. Had my standard side of mushrooms and a wedge salad to start. \n\nThe steak was cooked perfectly medium rare, with a \"Pittsburgh crust\", which adds the char to the steak. This is slightly different than a true Pittsburgh style steak, which had the char, but it cool/rare in the center. It was recommended my the waiter (thanks Tony!), and it was delicious! If you're around Southpark I would choose The Palm over Del Frisco's all day long.", "business_id": "1gKBusJMk66ypwEKF0vOAA", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-11-03", "type": "review"}

In fact, I really can't name one other business we've been to where our reviews span more than one star apart. Therefore, I'm surprised to say that, overall, The Palm didn't knock my socks off. Was it a nice meal? Yes. Was it worth the money? No. And here's the why to it all.\n\nThe place: The Palm Steakhouse, SouthPark, Charlotte-NC\nThe occasion: Our three-year wedding anniversary\nThe channel of reservation: Open Table\nThe scene: Beautiful night on the patio, very empty on a Monday evening\n\nWe made an Open Table reservation and noted that it was our wedding anniversary...it was a special night, not just a fly by for a quick steak. As mentioned, the patio is great although you really just look out into a wide driving lane that heads towards the Hampton Inn. \n\nOur server, Fernando, was top notch. Really, five stars for the service all the way around. Very formal but completely in tune with the cadence of the meal and the guest's needs. The food, however, is where I take issue...especially for the price.\n\nBeefsteak tomato Capri salad: 4/5: Big slices of bright red tomato with hunks of fresh mozzarella and basil. Props to Fernando for lightly pouring on the oil and balsamic at the table. Nice touch. \n\nChilean Sea Bass: 3/5: The fish was beautiful - really a great filet. However, I knew it would be sauteed in a white wine butter sauce, not swimmin' in it. The delicate fish was sitting in a pool and drowning in the sauce. \n\nGoat cheese whipped potatoes: 3/5: Fairly tasty mashed taters, but nothing out of the ordinary. I didn't taste too much of the goat cheese and they required a heavy hand of salt and pepper to liven them up. \n\nCreme brulee: 2/5: As some may know, I'm a total treat monster and the creme brulee came highly recommended. The flavors were bright - light with just a hint of citrus, but the bruleed top was ice cold and the middle of the creme was also super chilly. I have a feeling this was refrigerated for a long time and the texture and temperature suffered. \n\nOther notes: The shrimp cocktail is $18.90. Are you kidding me? That's insane. Also, there is not a petite filet...only a 9 oz. option for $43. This served as the reason why I went with fish instead of steak. I did, however, try a few bites of hubs' steak and it was cooked perfectly and was very well flavored. Additionally, I was a bit surprised that, considering the great service, no one wished us a happy anniversary in any way. \n\nOverall, our meal for two people, with a few drinks added in, came to $200. I'm completely fine shelling out some coin for a great meal, but The Palm fell short for me.", "business_id": "1gKBusJMk66ypwEKF0vOAA", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-09-13", "type": "review"}

I liked the fact that they offered 9 oz pours for the wine and they had a pretty extensive wine variety.  \n\nMy husband ended up ordering the Filet and I ordered the crab cakes because I was told these are their house specialty!  We ordered the goat cheese mashed potatoes and broccoli for our sides.  \n\nI thoroughly enjoyed the crab cakes.  Were they worth almost $40?  Not even close.  It was three small little crab clusters.  They were void any fillers which I appreciated and packed with good quality crab meat.  They were great but not worth taking out a loan over..  \n\nThe steak my husband ordered was decent but again nothing special.  The flavoring that they recommended he try was a peppercorn/olive oil sauce.  The steak honestly shouldn't need this additional flavoring but it did in this case.  It was a little chewy and it didn't melt in your mouth!  It was not flavored well on its own.  I honestly think a Ruth Chris' steak is much better!  Again, this just wasn't worth the $50 it cost.\n\nThe sides were good although there was nothing about the potatoes that tasted like goat cheese...they were just very good and creamy mashed potatoes.  The broccoli had great flavor and was cooked perfectly--not too crunch and not soggy--just how I like it!\n\nWe didn't have time for dessert (catching a play uptown) but their menu looked decent.  We were told to try their donuts.  I'm sure they are good.  I think it would have been nice if they offered a free dessert or something special because it was our anniversary.  \n\nRoundup?  I expected more, especially for the price point.  I'm telling you I can go into Ruth's or Sullivans or Terra and many other restaurants that are not as expensive and have a better overall dining experience.  I can't figure out why someone would choose the Palm over all the other great steakhouses in the area.  They are more expensive and offer less quality and a worse environment.  I wouldn't come back.", "business_id": "1gKBusJMk66ypwEKF0vOAA", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-11-14", "type": "review"}

The place was packed and had a constant stream of people, busy busy.  We had 6:30 reservations for a party of 6 and once everyone arrived we were promptly seated.  They will not seat you until everyone is there.\n\nWe were seated around a hibachi station - each station has seating for 8, so we had two strangers at the end of our station (no big, they were nice).  I was a little concerned at the cost of the meal when I was looking at it online, but the amount of food is well worth the cost.\n\nI ordered the teryaki chicken.  You start with an onion broth while the chef is warming up.  Next is the small chilled garden salad served with a pink creamy dressing.  While you are finishing your soup and working on your salad, the chef starts with hibachi veggies (thin sliced carrots, onions, zucchini, mushrooms and broccoli).  Next are hibachi noodles (spaghetti with an oil and garlic ? coating).  Next, if you order fried rice with your meal ($1.75 extra) instead of white rice, the chef does the fried rice and portions it out.  Then the meat is started.  Our table had a variety of steak and shrimp items, which were served first since they cook more quickly than chicken (no one wants rare chicken).  I thought everything was quite good (though my white rice was cold, but that is what I get for not ordering fried rice like everyone else at the table).  All of the preparation is done in front of you by the chef, who puts on a show while cooking.  Very interesting, though I was concerned that I was going to lose my eyebrows when the onion volcano was done.\n\nWith 6 people, it was hard to hold a conversation, though not impossible.  If you are catching up with friends, I would suggest getting there early for drinks, or planning drinks and dessert after - once the chef's show starts going, along with all of the tables around you, it is rather noisy.  \n\nOur server kept drinks filled.  The chef was quite personable.  I had water to drink, so my dinner before tip was just under $15.  Contrary to what my dinner date told me, you don't necessarily have to take off your shoes, though they do have traditional tables there as an option.  \n\nBe warned that your hair and clothes will reek of the hibachi smell, so I wouldn't take a post-meal walk through the woods unless you like bears and wildcats.", "business_id": "xLZilmaLXY0r-dBFaiLxww", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-11-09", "type": "review"}

There is a small waiting area to the left of the door that has complimentary lemonade and they also pass out samples of appetizers.  This small space is a real life saver when it's really cold outside.\n\nRegarding the food, I recommend either the Victoria Filet or the New York strip (rare or medium rare).  Since the prices are so reasonable, you're basically looking at a $10-14 steak if you get the sirloin and based on the comments from the table next to us, a $10 piece of meat is what you're gonna get.  While we enjoyed our filet and New York strip, the couple next to us was unable to finish more than half of their sirloins.  They said that the meat was kind of tough and dry.  I personally found my strip to be tender and juicy, however it was lacking in the seasoning department, let just say I needed a lot of steak sauce.  The loaded baked potato was cooked well, but the cesar salad that I had was very bland.  The dressing had almost no taste and the parmesan cheese was bland with an odd peppery taste.\n\nThe service was great, our waitress was very attentive and friendly.  If you asked me if I'd return, I'd probably say no.  The food quality just isn't what I'm used to in the realm of steaks.  To be honest, I've had better steaks at some of Charlotte's local bars.

We went here on Saturday, simply because we had a gift card. We aren't usually chain restaurant people, but someone in my family gave us a gift card.\n\nWe each ordered a glass of wine and decided to split the 11 oz sirloin steak with loaded potatoe. I'm so glad we split it. Definitely enough for two people (and my husband is an eater too!). Good steak, well seasoned. Side was good too. Nothing special but good.\n\nJust some things I noted that were kinda off:\n-We didn't say anything about this cause in the end, we didn't care that much. However, they seated us at the booth that shares the wall with the kitchen/server station area. It was pretty loud.....and there were servers standing like 3 feet from us chatting....and dishes banging. At one point, someone in the kitchen dropped a crap ton of silverwear. It was so loud, I jumped out of my seat haha. Pretty distracting. I mentioned to my husband that if we were a couple that never went out very often and we were going out for a special meal, I would be pretty upset, cause we could barely hear each other. We got there at like 5:30 and there were plenty of other seats in the place.....I would only use that table to seat people as a last resort. \n-Our waitress was kinda non-existent. Basically, she brought us a menu, initial drinks, food, and check. Which is kinda odd considering the serving station was a mere 5 feet from us! My water was empty for most of the meal and it never got refilled. Not a huge issue cause I did have my wine :)\n-Lastly, I don't know if I even have the right to mention this. I mean we did split a meal and that isn't how most couples do it. However, they brought out one salad and one meal. Like no extra dishes, no splitting anything, etc. I mean we are super laid back people so we never said anything and just dug in and ate. However, afterwards, both of us mentioned it to each other. The salad was so big. They could have easily split the amount of lettuce and dressing and just put it in two bowls so we werent reaching across the table. It would have just created one extra dish to clean...big deal.\n\nIt's little things like the above that can make or break an experience....especially when there are soooooooo many restuarants in the area.

I sat in the restaurant for about 25 minutes in an area where I could see inside the kitchen and watched the manager bag an order and sit it on top of the ice machine and did not say anything to the barkeep about it being there. I looked at my cell phone clock at that time and it was 3:20 P.M. I noticed 5 different customers getting served their to go orders that came in about 20 minutes behind me. Asking the barkeep what was taking so long I was told my order would be coming up next. It is at that time 3:35 P.M. When the barkeep asked where my order was at she was told on top of the ice machine. Seeing what I saw I referred to the time it sat there and knowing how long it would take me to get home the food would be too cold to eat. Asked what I would like for them to do I asked to redo the order. Here comes the manager now asking me what was wrong. I told her then she said she would take care of it. Here comes the cook now refusing to redo my order and telling me blatantly that he had just taken the steak off the grill and it did not sit for any time at all. I told him I did not appreciate being called a liar and showed him the video of the transaction I had recorded on my cellphone and he then denied that was his kitchen. I asked for a refund then and he didn't want to do that either. I finally got my refund and left the restaurant not happy at all. UNBELIEVABLE!!!! I have had bad experience with phone orders in the past 3 months but this one takes the cake. Longhorn now has to suffer another dissatisfied ex customer who has been spending at least $100.00 a month at this location. I don't normaly post bad reviews because I am a business owner myself and know how they can hurt the business but this had to be posted.

I've driven by many times, and the location, right on the lake, looks very nice.  You can tell from the general exterior decor that this place was probably last remodeled back in 1975.... but I'm not going to pass judgement on that. As we all know, sometimes places like this can have excellent food, be quite charming, and a good time.\n\nSince it's November, it was dark, and there of course was no outside seating.... no boats bobbing in the water... so other than a nice clear night with glassy water in the moonlight, there was not much to see. We did get seated at a very nice window seat, thanks to the hostess, who had orders barked to her by the \"manager\", who resembled a female version of Jabba The Hut from Star Wars... I felt bad for the hostess.\n\nI think the food was very good.... I had the Fantail Shrimp, our son a burger, and my wife the Gorgonzola/Walnut stuff chicken. We had an appetizer of the stuffed mushrooms. As far as the food goes, the mushrooms were probably really the only letdown of the evening.... slightly over-priced and underwhelming.... the gravy they were sitting in left much to be desired..... not terrible..... but not $9.95 appetizer good.....  ya know???\n\nInitially, when we sat, our server greeted us promptly, which I thought was great. Sadly, this was the only server-like action she took for the rest of the evening. After bringing our drinks, and taking our order, she was not to be seen again until after the main course had been delivered. My drink was empty, my wife's water was empty... she had wanted to order a beer. When our server finally did stop by, she did not ask about our food.... but at least we were able to order more drinks. When my wife asked what beer was on tap, she had no idea..... and didn't really seem to care to have an idea.\n\nI noticed that our server would disappear for long periods of time. In the time it took her to come out once, the server in the next section had made the rounds 4-5 times.... making sure everyone was ok, filling sodas/waters, etc. We were left sitting, alone.\n\nWhen we were finally done, she came to get plates. There were a few, since of course she hadn't been around to gather anything through the course of dinner. Since she couldn't take them all, she left a stack of dirty plates on our table - disgusting.  \n\nAt that point, I laid down 4 crisp $20's for our $75-ish tab, and we got the heck outta there...... as we departed the \"manager\" (Jabba The Hut) wished us good night in a very un-caring tone, and we noticed upon leaving the dinner specials - not mentioned to us by our server at all!!!!  Absolutely terrible.\n\nSo.... this place could be a solid 3-ish.... IF you get a good server... and if it's summer, and you sit outside, and it's nice..... you might hit a 4.  Again, our main courses we ordered were pretty good.... but with the poor service, our dinner basically sucked.", "business_id": "Zc2IwSzGY63zkyhfNrr7HA", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-11-15", "type": "review"}

My companion and I both like that Fitzgerald's is one of the few supper clubs in Madison where you can get a full salad bar, a well-crafted Old Fashioned, and a loaf of bread comes standard with every meal. The salad bar is pretty decent and one can make a meal out of that alone as it includes two soup options. We enjoyed nice conversation and delicious food in the warm ambiance of this restaurant.

Because Ribeye has many happy customers, as well as fellow Yelpers who are fans, and who are marking Ribeye higher, I will try to describe Ribeye as well as I can as I relate my single dining experience. That way, you, the reader, will know what to expect if and when you go.\n\nAmbience and Decor:\nLet me first describe the restaurant's ambience. The restaurant is a dark, windowless interior space. The decor is simple, something like wood or wood-like tables and chairs along with booths. When I was there the restaurant was very busy and extremely noisy. TV's were visible from most seats of our table, so watching a TV show or event while eating is part of Ribeye's draw. I imagine drinks and dinner while watching a football game would be an example. There is a full bar in a space connected to the dining area. \n\n\nFood:\nThe food at Ribeye is not to my taste. \n\nThe ribeye steak is low quality meat. Eating the steak is not a pleasant or satisfying experience. Perhaps a hamburger or meatloaf type order would be safer. Ribs are on the menu but I just know that the barbecue sauce would not be better, and might be worse, than that offered by McDonalds.\n\nThe salad bar comes with most dinners. The salad bar has a mediocre selection of items, and the quality of each item is basic. Coleslaw would be on par with that available in a chain supermarket deli. Freshness of the salad bar is variable by item, depending upon how it turns over. Overall, the salad bar is not worth ordering. It just is not very good.\n\nBread is a hot, fresh loaf, but mediocre nonetheless. Also, Ribeye does something to its butter. The butter is whipped up for sure, but they might add sugar or something to it. \n\nThe vegetables, and items like baked potato or mashed potatoes are edible, but mediocre. These don't appear to be prepared to order. Unfortunately, potatoes and vegetables lose much of their appeal if they are not eaten when freshly cooked to order.\n\nI can't comment on dessert. None of us ordered dessert, and I don't remember what was on the dessert menu.\n\n\nSummary:\nOverall, Ribeye leaves me with the impression of being an upgraded (albeit, a much upgraded) version of Sizzler. It also has the feel of a sports bar. Prices are pretty much in line with what Ribeye offers. That is, prices are neither too high nor are they particularly good values. Service is adequate but unremarkable either way.\n\nFor me, this all is about 1 1/2 stars on Yelp. Ribeye is targeted to, and evidently, successfully fills, its own niche in the market. The other reviewers have different opinions, but all of us are evaluating the product that I have tried to describe to you above, in my review. I hope this will give you some idea of what to expect if you visit Ribeye.", "business_id": "SoyigEmlt4JYwnOqR_cqUw", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-09-05", "type": "review"}

I am assuming it is a post game tradition because most people have imbibed before, during, and after the game and need the Ribeye's bland food to stay in their stomachs.  I am only halfway joking.  \n     My SO and I went to the Ribeye recently on a Saturday night and true to course, it was packed.  Even with the full house we did not have a long wait.  The clientele was a mixture of older couples and slightly depressed game goers.  The interior of the Ribeye is straight up old school steak house, dark and dated. \n    Like prior reviewers have noted, the Ribeye is famous (or infamous) for its very small menu: ribeye steaks, chicken, and shrimp.   They charge you $1.50 per ounce after $23.99 for a 10 ounce ribeye so it makes it just a little more expensive than going to a chain steakhouse restaurant.  They do have a salad bar that is included with your dinner.  It is not a huge salad bar and only has the basics for salad toppings.  It's meh ... I was impressed to see spiced apple rings on it though.  I had not seen those things since the grade school cafeteria!\n     The server we had was very friendly although she was busy and did not offer a refill or any suggestions to go with the meal.  I will chalk it up to being busy although she did take time to chat up the U of I game goers at the next table.\n    I ordered a 8 oz. ribeye rare with saut\u00e9ed mushrooms and loaded baked potato.  SO ordered the 10 oz. ribeye medium rare with steak fries.   It did not take long for the entrees to arrive on sizzling hot on plates like a fajita.  The saut\u00e9ed mushrooms were canned button mushrooms in a weird wine sauce and swimming in oil.  They were not bad, but they were not saut\u00e9ed.  My steak was medium rare but it's hard to cook a steak-umm rare.  Seriously, my steak looked like it belonged on a Philly cheesesteak. I did not mind the fat but the lack of any type of seasoning was ridiculous (salt & pepper should be requisite seasonings!).  If you want to be known as THE steakhouse for the Champaign-Urbana area, maybe you should invest in some quality steaks and not truck stop steaks. My husband enjoyed his steak but he had just recovered from the stomach flu so I am not sure his experience is valid.  SO's steak fries were okay, again no seasoning and my baked potato was a baked potato. Sour cream is fully loaded here and you have to ask if you want extra butter other than the one that comes with the tableside bread.   Disappointed in general and completely confused as to how people consider this a great steakhouse. \n\nPros:   Nice service, kind of cool retro atmosphere\nCons:  Bland over priced food, over inflated reputation", "business_id": "SoyigEmlt4JYwnOqR_cqUw", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-10-23", "type": "review"}

Unfortunately tonight's visit was far from superb as we are used to. We walked in and requested a BOOTH for 5, we told there was another group ahead of us and it would be 10- 15 minutes. When our table was finally ready for us 15 minutes later, it was not a booth. I told her specifically ,\"I requested a booth not a table with chairs.\" She responded with, \" I was not aware of that request.\" So I told her, \"I refuse this table since I requested a booth.\" She again responds, \" you didnt say anything of that sort when you walked in.\" At this point my fiance chimes in with, \"Actually, he said a booth for 5 please?\" The hostess then tells us,\"This table is all we have for you at this time and to wait for a booth will be another 30 minutes.\" I told her, \"Fine then we will will wait.\" She got an attitude and began gathering all the napkins and flat ware that she just laid out at the table along with the menus. At this point I was furious, more so because I was getting the attitude from someone who obviously had no concern for my request and then got upset when I corrected her. I was so mad that I was ready to leave and go elsewhere and when I expressed that to her. She retorted \"Fine, go somewhere else and eat I don't care!\" After hearing her say that I asked to speak to the manager, she completely ignored me and walked away. Another employee gladly got the attention of the manager for me and when I expressed my disbelief and how I felt so disrespected to him. All I was told is, \"I will talk to her about this this.\"  I'm sorry but when people come into your establishment and no matter what the situation is, automatically spend $60 or more on food and drinks you should do everything in your power to make them feel at ease. We finally got our booth in a matter of minutes after talking to the manager. To put the icing on the cake, I noticed after that anyone requesting a booth after we were seated got one right away. This had me heated, then my fiance told me,\" You made a  complaint, so now she is gonna do everything to make sure she doesn't get another one tonight.\" \n\nTo say the least I hope the young lady has a much better night.

Texaz grill serves the best Chicken Fried Steak and Chicken Fried Chicken I've ever had.  Be forewarned though.  If you come, bring your appetite.

Sometimes quantity has a quality all its own, but not here. Let's face it: chicken fried steak is a vehicle for gravy. Even though the TexAZ steak was big enough to feed four hungry lumberjacks, they really skimped on the gravy. Even worse, both the gravy and the steak were bland, without a hint of identifiable spice. I kept eying the numerous condiments on the table while wondering if maybe adding them to the meal would make it easier to eat. The sides that accompanied the meal let me down too. The biscuit is more like a roll, and didn't flake as a biscuit should; the corn seemed like it might have come right out of a can; and I don't remember much about my mashed potatoes. \n\nIn summary: \"Meh.

The breading definitely could've used some flavor or spice and so did the gravy. Odd that the steak is such huge portion but the gravy is very much skimped on. I liked it, but it definitely could use some major seasoning. Maybe they can steal it from Chili's. Even though Chili's is a chain, they have one of the best chicken fried steak I've had.

I noticed right away that \"they don't season their meats.\"  WTH?  Whatev - there was salt and pepper on the table...and A-1.  Our food came with a salad (iceburg sopping with water) and you had a choice of ranch or some other vinegarette.  We both got ranch and it tasted like mayo with water.

I was seriously expecting an explosion of chicken fried steak in my face! I was ready for pure sodium sin that would allow my taste buds to dance in circles around every morsel with pitch forks raised in true devil worshiping style.

The okra was pretty good, just battered and deep fried, and served with some sort of sauce (I didn't examine it well enough to say what it was).

Think I Would Rather Suck Down Your Colonoscopy Bag?\n\nIf you are truly looking for a unique dining experience accompanied with old world business cards and lifeless animals, then you will need to try out Texaz Grill all for yourself. If you are looking for good food, solid service, and a nice atmosphere, then you probably want to avoid this strip mall hangout at all costs. If you love low-quality food, poor service, and a revolting atmosphere, then you need to steer your lifted F350 right on over to Texaz Grill.\n\nWow, from the moment we walked in I knew we were in for trouble ... I just didn't think it could be as bad as it actually was. This is one establishment that will leave you wondering whether the city of Phoenix mandates any sort of cleanliness or health standards. This place is dirty, vile, unkempt, and this is way before we even met our server or received our food.\n\nJust 7:30 PM on a Thursday night, but you would have thought this place was closing up shop for the night or permanently (which wouldn't be a bad thing). Guests are sparse and the few who do remain look like they have chain smoked all of taste buds right out of their mouths. The servers give you the impression they are NOT working for tips and really make no attempt at ensuring a pleasant guest experience. The inside will remind you of a cross between a real, small town BBQ joint and a TGIFridays minus the corporate cleanliness standards. The booths are ancient, uncomfortable, and anything but clean. The walls are littered with business cards, dead animals, used hats, and license plate frames. You will want to write off all the dirt and disaster on the wall as good old Texas charm, but you will quickly realize your appetite fades as each minute passes you by.\n\nSo we arrive at our booth and are quickly greeted by our degenerate server who you would have thought was being paid by number of tables she turned over per night. She doesn't look like she wants to be there, and, frankly, neither do we. Our drinks are brought out in a timely fashion, and then she did the best she could to get us to order a quickly as possible. And, we're off....\n\nOrders are put in for a Chicken Fried Steak and the Thursday night BBQ sampler. Our server had to check that there were any of the BBQ samplers left which should tell you that this combination was probably made yesterday and has been hanging around all day. The salad came quick - too quick. Within two minutes of ordering, I had the misfortune of choking down a brown, bland, and boring salad. Of course, nobody goes to a BBQ joint for a salad, but I think most prefer green lettuce and more than two dressing choices.  Not even ten minutes later and our entrees had arrived, and we suddenly had enough food to feed an entire homeless shelter but I have my doubts of them even touching this piss poor attempt at Texas BBQ.\n\nChicken Fried Steak - imagine about 1oz of beef shankle meat breaded in a pound of breading and smothered in some alien gravy. The meat was bland, veiny, chewy, and not even good enough for my neighbor's dog. You get two of them and each one will be bigger than your head, but I'm not really sure what you are supposed to do with them because they are anything but edible.\n\nBBQ Sampler - I would have rather have sampled what was soaked up in the dirty bar rag or growing out of the rug. The ribs were too fatty and smothered in the generic BBQ sauce that made this place famous. The brisket was boring and overcooked. The Texas fries were not fries, nor were they good. The sausage was edible, but more so in a comparative way. Even the bread was terrible.\n \nThe food can be summed up as atrocious, inedible, poor quality, and even hard to look at. Truly some of the worst food I have ever eaten or looked at in my entire life. The highlight of the night was easily when our server seemed astonished we refused the to-go box. Sorry, but you should have been shaking our hands for even trying to make a meal out of those make-me-want-to-go-vegetarian plates of meat. \n\nIt is worth mentioning that Texas Grill does two things and two things only correctly. You will be seated quickly to ensure that the dead animals or the plethora of 1970s business cards stapled to the walls don't scare you away and the plastic soft drink mugs are gigantic, but I'm sure this was implemented to minimize server interaction with the tables.\n\nGo grab a McRib or two before you throw away any money at this place...or be ready to pop some serious laxatives. Outside of some rough drinking nights, I have never felt the urge to vomit all over the place 15 hours after a meal. Good luck to you if you choose this place. If you do decide to go, don't forget to bring your business card - it might be old enough to go up on the wall in 2032 - that is, assuming this place is around much longer.", "business_id": "18TUn9oiW0k0yB6lheiOvw", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-11-29", "type": "review"}

Chain steakhouses have NOTHING on this place!\n\nWe finished our meal with the homemade bread pudding with whiskey sauce. Trust me, you've never had bread pudding so good! Full of cinnamon, raisins, and pecans with the most delightful whiskey sauce.\n\nIf you live in Phoenix or are just passing through stop in at The Texaz Grill!

The meat was very tender and flavorful.\n\nThe chicken fried steak was very good, with tender pounded beef and crispy breading.  There were 2 giant pieces on the platter, and it was topped with a generous amount of gravy.  \n\nAs for sides, you have your choice of salad or coleslaw, and mashed potatoes or Texas fries.  I had some salad, which wasn't too impressive since it tasted like someone had made it way in advance, making it taste soggy and wilted.  The coleslaw was decent, in a mayo-based sauce that was tangy and sweet.  The mashed potatoes were a hearty portion of skin-on mash.  \n\nService was friendly and drinks were refilled as needed.  Parking, on the other hand, is a nightmare if you come at a busy time.

Just a point is all.\n\nAnyways, the bartender (whose name I can't recall - shucks) was great. I told her it was my first time and she walked me through the menu and highlighted the chicken fried steak (their specialty) and the prime rib. I ordered the large prime rib and it was excellent. I have also tried the chicken fried steak and, while rich, it's also very good. Just all around, nothing but good things to say about TEXAZ Grill.\n\nPlus you get little glasses for your beer.

Lone Star is one of the restaurants consistently in our orbit. We used to dine here for special occasions. Unfortunate circumstances put us into lots more restaurants for meals these days. \n\nOur favorite foods, like so many other Yelp*ers are the pork chops with sweet potato on the side. Cinnamon & butter on the side please. Mom goes big for the half rack of ribs and sweet potato. We usually take half home. I enjoy the salad wedge/steak wedge or steak salad. I'm taking a liking to the French Dip, Sweet D is eating burgers more these days with their fat, hand formed sirloin patties. \n\nSpeaking of hand formed, Lone Star's steaks are aged off-site, but are hand cut in the back room. The bleu cheese dressing, all sauces and the cobbler-type desserts are made on-premises. The Bovarian brown bread appetizer loaves and baguettes arrive from Texas by truck. Does SB 1070 allow that? Salted peanuts are no longer automatic, frequency of allergenic attack made them a \"by request only\" item. \n\nKera, Assistant Manager is on the floor, circulating and greeting. She and one other cafe owner are the top circulators where we eat. We've spoken with Joe, the Manager off and on, and another manager some years back. \n\nService is attentive, as mentioned by several other reviewers. My glass is never half empty. We're getting to know Jasmina of the many pens. She and Sweet D are passionate about office supplies. \n\nLone Star is a chain, which BTW Yelp*ers, corporate reads your reviews. My mind keeps it in on the same steak house shelf as two other steak house chains. We've been to all three. Lone Star is the place we return. Price, quality, service, close to where out evening business keeps us. I suggest the old bald plastic cacti be replaced. Someone plucks spines obsessively. I wonder if someone has a Lone Star cactus spine stash at home? \n\nSomebody snarked away on Lone Star, with a mixed list of chains and locally owned places to eat. Rate chains with chains, local with locals, its only fair. Unless you've had one two many giant margaritas, then you'll say whatever you want no matter what. \n\nThis place is fine. I guarantee we'll be back.

The first visit, was a Thursday night when I had just picked my tired husband up at the airport. Fresh off the plane, arriving from my home state of Rhode Island, he wanted to speak of nothing but steak.\n\nHe had chatted with a local about a good steakhouse downtown; I think he had the wrong name, we got stuck Chase field traffic, but I digress.\n\nAfter doing a quick Garmin search in our rental (a whole separate review) I saw Omaha Steak House. Would have never usually gone with this choice, but its the only name we knew I had to get this man a meal immediately.\n\nPleasant surprise. So, let me break it down:\n\nFirst visit, Thursday evening around 9 pm\n\nEmpty\n\nGreat decor- This restaurant is in the middle of a hotel, so I am comparing to other hotel restaurants.\n\nService- The waiter happened to be from our home state. Great conversation, great service, excellent all around.\n\nFood- We started with the fried calamari- excellent choice. So good that we ended up getting a second order (give us a break- we were famished). I have high standards for any seafood- even if we are just talking about fried fish. This calamari was fresh and on par with good calamari back in RI.\n\nHusband had steak- he was very happy. He does med-rare- it was cooked perfectly. I trust his steak critique more than my own- he is much more involved in seeking out great steaks & better butchers.\n\nI had stuffed shrimp- It was great. \n\nSides- asparagus & Yukon gold mashed. Again, both were great.\n\nSecond visit- My parents are in town this week from RI.\n\nWe went last night and I would say our experience matched the one above. We arrived around 9:30 and it was already quiet again. \nThe parents like good food & service minus anything overly trendy. This place did the trick. They left with smiles.\n\nSummary\nI have this restaurant on file as reliable, consistent, and basic. A place you go when you seek out good hearty food, reasonable prices, quiet atmosphere, and are all about a good quality meal. Also, for me its a place I can go when I am not up for \"going out\" but am up for getting a good meal minus the cooking & cleaning. Not that I was in sweats, but I was comfortable and passed on getting dressed up for a night out.", "business_id": "bewtZL-VV1oeGUdAhHVz6Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-10-11", "type": "review"}

We booked here out of convenience more than anything else during our last night in Phoenix. We were staying at the embassy suites where this restaurant is located.

The wings, on the other hand were some of the best I've ever had. Crispy yet juicy with a nice amount of heat. I would have ordered these for room service every day if only i had discovered them earlier.\n\nAs mentioned the place was deserted on a Saturday night, but it was definitely not for lack of quality. Our server was helpful and entertaining. Our food was fantastic. A colleague commented that his filet was one of the best steaks he'd ever had. I had scallops that were also great.

Rivals Ruth's and Flemings and stomps Morten's.  Great ahi sandwich, too. Even the vegetables were great.  :)  Atmosphere low key (think: hotel lobby restaurant atmosphere). \n\nThis restaurant is hidden away inside the Embassy Suites hotel which sits on the edge of a very high-end-old-money shopping and residential area near the Arizona Biltmore and the Biltmore Fashion Park.  A 3 iron's stroke away from Capitol Grille, with all of its stuffiness and see-and-be-seen crowds and valet parking, hides this amazing little find.  If you are going for the amazing food, courteous and efficient service (I.e. not to self-flagellate at the hands of uppity waiters), and a place to sit and enjoy the company YOU keep (not the company sitting in the tables around you), then this is by far a better choice.\n\nWe are on a 40 day strict diet protocol and had to order accordingly on our last visit.  The restaurant obliged without a blink and we were floored at how amazing a really good piece of meat and a pile of super-fresh asparagus can taste without floating in butter or oil of any kind.  That said, we can't wait to go back when we can try the dressed-up versions, too.\n\nThis isn't where you take your first date to impress.  It is where you go when you are confident that you are dating the right person and aren't afraid to let him/her know about your secret place for mind-blowing steak without the glitz of the big-name steakhouse.", "business_id": "bewtZL-VV1oeGUdAhHVz6Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-09-01", "type": "review"}

It's not because of the ambiance or the physical space. It's simply a nondescript restaurant in a moderately-priced hotel. It's the kind of physical space in a hotel where you might see a family with a couple kids drop in or some other non-pretentious folks just heading out for dinner. From the looks of it when I was there, you probably won't need a reservation, but I do hope you go because I want Omaha Steakhouse to be open on my frequent visits to Phoenix. For everything the place lacks in pomp and circumstance, it makes up for what you want in a steakhouse, high quality beef.\n\nI travel a lot in my work. I entertain a lot. I visit fancy steakhouses and seafood joints all over the country. When it comes to quality of meat, tenderness of a steak, I put Ruth's Chris and now Omaha Steakhouse up there with the best of them. They're as good as the many awesome local top-of-the line local steakhouses across the country. And I find their beef to be preferable to Morton's, Capitol Grille or Gibson's. Those places have great product, but it certainly is a lot pricier than you'll find at Omaha Steakhouse and it's simply not as good. You go to those places for a lot more than great steak. You can go to Omaha Steakhouse if it's not the atmosphere, but the meat that is your number one priority.", "business_id": "bewtZL-VV1oeGUdAhHVz6Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-09-06", "type": "review"}

The 5 to 6 pm reception was delicious and excellent in the beautiful atrium. The problem was the wedding planner was given the wrong diagram. It was for the square room when we were given the larger rectangular room.  At least two of the tables was missing a place setting.  No biggie, just get another place setting and we would be happy. Instead, I (mother of the bride) was missing my place setting and had to ask three times and wait 25 minutes. My sister had faster results because after the wait staff argued with her about how the table was not missing a place setting, my brother-in-law went to get one himself. \n\nThe salad and green tea sherbet were great. Our entrees were salmon and New York Steak.  I was extremely disappointed with my first experience with an Omaha Steak. It was supposed to be medium-rare and instead it was well-done and dry. The mashed potatoes were dried out and crusty. The sauce was great and a lot more of it might have helped.\n\nThe result after I wrote to the corporate office was that the catering manager called me. I do not think that she understood what I had to say. She praised her staff for how great they were and how they kept the water glasses full. Hello! I did not even get a water glass! I wanted to hear how that issue had already been addressed and would never happen again to another guest. As for the dry steak, she said that she tried one at the reception and it was excellent. Yes, I probably got the first one off the grill and then it was kept warm too long, as a result, it was dry. Her steak that she got at a later point would be great. Some of my guests did say that their steak was great. I would recommend that if you are having a wedding reception there, that you add 30 minutes to the actual time that you want your steaks so that they are not sitting in the warmer. The catering manager blamed the wedding planner for the dry steaks so you know that she depends totally on the wedding planner's schedule.  Regrettably, she is not watching closely to see if the evening is running on schedule.   I suggest that she should be flexible and in charge of  the time for the kitchen to start the entrees.

It's a good thing I enjoy smooth jazz.\n\nChose the French onion soup starter, the Kona-crusted sirloin steak entree, and cheesecake w/ fresh berries sauce to finish.  I really enjoyed the onion soup- salty from the cheese, yet just enough sweetness from the caramelized onions.  I really liked how some areas of the cheese that blanketed the bowl were crispy!  I thought perhaps it was the bread that sometimes one would find below the cheese, but no, it was the cheese itself.  Wished the whole piece was crunchy...\n\nI absolutely adored the Kona-crusted sirloin.  Cooked to medium- perfect!- and I could taste the coffee, too, and not just feel the texture of coffee grains, as I've ordered similar entrees from other venues, but never tasted the intended effect.  The caramelized shallot cream sauce absolutely floored me!  One of the best sauces that has graced my lips :)  Mmm... The entree came with two standard sides (no substitutes allowed, or at least that was what I was told) of creamed spinach and smashed red potatoes.  Both were delightful- decadently rich and creamy.  Before I forget, the table bread basket (seeded dinner rolls and lavosh) was good, especially the seeded rolls.  You may also order toasted sourdough if you have food allergies to avoid.\n\nStepping back down, but not much, from the piece de resistance (in this meal, the standout was the steak), was the creme brulee cheesecake w/ berry sauce w/ fresh berries!  Simply incredible!   While I had to return the more beautiful (more caramelized sugar crust) first offering, untouched, due to food issues, the second was less visually stunning, but tasted divine.  I should've asked for more sauce on the side, as I ended up taking some home.

Litterally driving into the parking lot of a few other well known restaurants and going \"no...not feeling it\", and driving out of the parking lot without stopping.   I was intent on trying some place new.  Honestly I don't know what made me park and come into TCG, and even then when I walked in I was about ready to turn around, I wasn't wanting so upscale but decided to just go in and grab a seat at the bar.  \nMy indeciseiveness that night extended into trying to choose what to drink and what to eat.  The bartender and the lady sitting next to me highly recommend the Stoli Doli, house infused pineapple vodka martini.  Why not? What a great recommendation.  Wonderfully simple, slightly sweet pineapple goodness in a martini glass.  \nLooking over the bar menu, I then asked for the full menu.  Wow the Wine list is IMPRESSIVE.  The menu options matched the rich darkness in the restaurant.  Sultry and romantic...I can see why there were so many couples here enjoying the ambiance.  The service is as impressive as the wine list.\nI finally decided, but I question my own combination of what I chose.  Obviously not that hungry, I choose the Wagyu beef carpaccio and a wedge salad( this is where I wonder what was I thinking).  I would have much happier in the end had I just had the carpaccio.   Not that it was bad....just so didn't do the restaurant justice.   It's not ment to stand out on its own.  But it satisfied something at the moment.  The rich blue cheese dressing and bacon...unfortunately iceburg lettuce is never stellar even with the dressing.\nThe Wagyu carpaccio was beautifully plated.  Lightly seared exterior and rare interior of thinnly sliced beef accompanied by a portion of lightly dressed arugula salad and parmagian cheese.   The seared exterior had a seasoning that I am not sure that added to the dish.  I appreciate carpaccio for its simplicity. However that was my only \"issue\" and it didn't keep me from enjoying the dish.  The richness of the wagyu and the peppery arugula were perfect together.  Including tip my vist was around $50.\nNext time I will go with a friend or 3 who are ready for a fine meal.", "business_id": "QdbZyl-LWFS54u93Vjd5SA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-09-05", "type": "review"}

We went after late evening at work...my environment is pretty casual, so I was in t-shirt and shorts. Even on a Tu night it seemed the general atmosphere was business casual.  We were greeted and seated as soon as we came in and appeared no judgments were made. We then waited.  ....and waited.....and waited.  I was beginning to wonder if they didn't like my attire or something.  We noticed it seemed there was a huddle between the wait staff wondering who would take our table. Still no one.  I got up to use the rest room and when I got back my lady said they were bringing out some calamari on the house for our wait.  Sweet!  I generally don't care one anyone the other about calamari...but theirs was really good.  A bit of. A spice, a little kick...but quite tasty.  The waiter was extremely apologetic about our wait and was on top of everything afterwards.  I got the bone in sirloin, lady the filet.  Both were very tasty and cooked to our liking.  The mashed potatoes were delicious...creamy and buttery tasting.  Green beans tasty and crisp.  The espresso chocolate cake dessert...oh my was it rich.  A little chocolate sauce or more raspberry sauce would have been a welcome addition to the dollop of whip cream and raspberries but it was still tasty.. \n\nBut the final action that really put the experience over the top was when the bill was supposed to come and instead the manager said dinner was on them.  They did not want to leave us with a bad experience (esp. considering it was our first time there.). I tried telling him this was unnecessary as they already more than made up for many issues.  They insisted...so the waiter ended up with a pretty good tip out of it.  That was all class though and made me feel quite good about our dining choice. The way they handled things and the food quality even prior to that would have gotten them at least 4 stars.  But the fact they have proven themselves a class act...that puts them over the top.

The clam chowder was average at best, and definitely wasn't anywhere near as good as some I've had at bar/restaurants on the pier in San Fran or Seattle.  And although I can't remember the name of the sliced steak dish with the shoestring fries on top, that's a pretty accurate description of the dish itself.  The steak itself was horrible, as it had a completely inedible piece running through the center of the entire steak. I ate around it, but seriously, this is not what I expect from a place like the CG.  It completely ruined the rest of the experience, and it's doubtful I'll ever go back for another lunch.  \n\nYou never get a second chance to make a first impression.

While others feel it is a place for the \"good old boys\", it is none the less, one of the absolute prize steakhouses of the world. Morton's is a chain, and can be found in many countries of the world. I have eaten in many of them ranging from Hong Kong to New York and the food is consistent wherever you choose to go.\n\nDrinks at Morton's are nothing to sneeze at. They are always made with premium brands and are more than adequate for most people. (Their chocolate Godiva martini is to die for!)\n\nA word of warning - all food at Morton's is a la carte, and portions are big. Should you order a tomato as a salad expect to see one of the largest and most succulent tomatoes on your plate, perfectly presented. Morton's has a large assortment of entrees ranging from lobster bisque to shrimp cocktail (not sure if those are shrimp or small lobsters) to tuna tartar, crab cakes and perfect oysters on the half shell. Always remember that portions are huge and you still have the main course coming!\n\nSpeaking of main courses - in a word - unbelievable.\n\nThe portions, once again, are huge, and their meats are all true prime. Your waitperson will wheel a cart of the meats to your table so that you can make your selection. Watch out for that 3 pound lobster - It's alive on the cart and just could nip your finger if you get it too close!\n\nFor a real treat try the porterhouse or the Chicago bone in rib eye. Truly amazing to eat. The prime rib (Friday and Saturday only) are wonderful but if you want it you will need to come early - it's a limited cut of beef at the restaurant - when they run out that's it for the night.\n\nFor lighter fare they also have assorted fish and chicken dishes as well as spectacular lamb chops.\n\nFor sides, try the creamed spinach, the Lyonnaise potatoes, or share a small football sized baked potato.\n\nDesserts are legendary at Morton's. Some like the chocolate souffle must be ordered at the beginning of the meal, but oh are they worth it. The desserts are made with the same care as the entire rest of the meal and are just as fattening! For a change of pace, try their fresh berries - you won't be disappointed and it will help with your waistline. Do plan on bringing a doggie bag (perhaps several doggie bags) home with you.\n\nSanitation is impeccable, and the bathrooms are gorgeous. This is a terrific special occasion place. Valet parking out front.\n\nI rate this a 5 star restaurant. (Expensive but worth every penny)", "business_id": "_BhzcKojv1gjdRINe3Gkig", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-09-02", "type": "review"}

He notice we were both wearing dark pants and gave us black napkins to ensure that lint from the white napkins would not get on our dark clothing. \n\nWe were seated immediately and given menus. The waiter came and got our drink orders and returned back with them in less than 5 minutes. \n\nWe already knew what we wanted to order as I looked at the web site and noticed that Morton's had a special prixe fix menu. The menu was salad (wedge or caesar), fillet mignon, 1 side and a dessert for $109. \n\nMy husband upgraded to the rib eye instead of having the single cut fillet mignon. Both steaks were cooked and seasoned to perfection and the baked potato was HUGE! \n\nThe waiter came with a tray of all the fixings needed to load up a potato. The only thing that was not on the tray was chives. When I asked for chives the waiter went back to the kitchen and immediately brought back chives and sprinkled them on my potato. \n\nThe dessert was a choice of key lime pie or creme brulee which was exciting. Creme brulee is my favorite dessert and key lime pie is my husband's favorite. Needless to say we were satisfied all the way around. \n\nThe waiter knew how much I loved creme brulee and when we got to the dessert course he joked that there was no creme brulee that day. I was briefly taken a back but the waiter could not hold a straight face and began laughing and said he was just kidding. It was really funny and we all had a good laugh. \n\nThe food was great and the service was AWESOME!!! \n\nThanks Morton's for making our visit that was full of drama much better and from then on the trip got better. \n\nYes we will definitely visit Morton's in Phoenix again.", "business_id": "_BhzcKojv1gjdRINe3Gkig", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-09-10", "type": "review"}

We were getting the oil changed on my husband's car (or something else equally mundane) and a salesman kept trying to get us to test drive a new car but we had no interest. He finally sweetened the deal with a Ruth's Chris gift card. Long story short, we drove the car, got the gift card, got our car back and went to dinner. \n\nWe got there and sat at the bar and enjoyed a couple of glasses of champagne and scotch before we moved to our seats. I've got to say, this is the only location I've been so I can't speak for the ambiance of others, but this one is sorely lacking. The lighting is bright, it feels overly open and the air conditioner was blowing full force. \n\nWe started with the wedge with blue cheese. It was as expected. Iceberg with bacon and blue cheese. Hard to screw up. Tastes good. I don't remember was cut if steak we ordered but I was talked into getting the butter on my plate. Huge mistake. It just made it overly rich. I also can't say I'm a fan of the searing hot plate. It made my medium rare steak progressively more cooked. If it has to go in either direction, I prefer it to be rarer. My husband wanted the au gratin potatoes so we shared an order of those. Here's another one of my beef's. Sometimes restaurants equate richness (butter and cream) with flavor and goodness, which they are, but they stop there. They load up the potatoes au gratin with sticks of butter and pints and heavy whipping cream and think, \"Viola! I have created a masterpiece!\" but in reality they're just rich and really don't have much flavor. You can probably tell I didn't think much of them. \n\nFor desert we ended up with the chocolate sin cake and the creme brulee. Both were OK but so are the frozen deserts from Trader Joe's. I'd say they were on par with those. OK when I'm paying $4.99 for two and preparing them myself. Not so much when buying one in a restaurant. \n\nNothing was bad at Ruth's Chris, I was disappointed to find that nothing stood out as phenomenal. Next time I'll stay home and make some steaks myself, we'll eat them in our pajamas with a bottle of wine them watch some Mad Men.

The server was by pretty quick after our seating to explain everything, came back in about just the right amount of time afterwards to actually take our order (about 5-7 minutes).  We got the AZ Restaurant Week 3 course deal.  $29 for it, was hard to beat.  \n\nFirst course: Wife got the Tomato and Crab soup, of which I got a taste, and it was excellent.  My caesar salad was quite good also (had shavings and pieces of real parmesan cheese).  \n\n2nd course:  We both got the petite filet, hers Medium, mine medium rare.  I got the garlic mashed she got the mushrooms.  She didn't think that the mushrooms were seasoned to be anything special (like good 'ol Jonah's back in IL).  But they were good from what she said.  The garlic mashed potatoes were tasty also.  The steak.  It comes out on a plate...sizzling in the butter they slathered on it.  Mine seemed a little more rare than medium rare..but it continued to cook on the plate...so it ended up being just right.  Cooked up even quicker if you slice it up and give it just a few moments.  I have no idea how they seasoned it...but we got nothing special on it.  Yet..it was SO VERY tasty.  It had an excellent flavor, was very tender.  It was steak happiness in every bite.  \n\n3rd course: We got the \"Sin Cake.\"  It was a piece of chocolate cake.

Also it would be nice if they put out a sign that the deck is free parking for the restaurant in the evening instead of having the valet have to tell everyone would be helpful.

We got a room to ourselves, and dedicated wait staff. The staff was friendly, and attentive.\n\nI admit that I didn't try the appetizers because I could tell there would be a lot of food. I had one of their biscuits, which was fluffy and tasty with the sweetened butter they served it with. \n\nMy dirty K.O. martini was tasty, too. They had a crudite plate (raw veggies) that was less than appealing... just some sticks of jicama, carrots, black olives and radishes rolling around in a bowl that looked like a horse trough. The quesadillas they put out looked really good, though, and people enjoyed them. I tried half of a grilled portabello mushroom app, and while tasty, it was grilled a bit too much and was a little tough. Flavor was good, though.\n\nFor dinner, I had the half-rack of baby back ribs. They were VERY good. The mashed potatoes weren't that hot anymore, so they had gotten kind of hard on top. I understand it's hard to cook for 24 people, and have the food arrive around the same time, but it seems like they could've waited to slop your potatoes on the plate until before they were going to serve them up. The meat was tender and very tasty on the ribs. I could only eat half of a half. Gave the rest away... if I had a fridge at the hotel, it would've gone with me!\n\nCouldn't even fathom dessert. The food was plenty enough for me! \n\nThe ambiance was nice. Would've been better if there weren't smoking allowed in the lounge part of the restaurant. That was the worst part of the experience. Being from California, I\"m not used to having to smell second hand smoke while eating anymore. \n\nIt may have been a better experience if we didn't have 24 people...

We arrived for an early dinner during Restaurant Week and were promptly greeted by a gaggle of friendly staffers at the entrance. After being seated in probably the nicest leather booth in all of Arizona, we ordered beverages - right off the bat, go for the Brown Cow Stockyard Rootbeer that they have on draft. It comes in a frosty mug with no ice. At about $3.50 a pop, there are no free refills, but it's well worth the two you'll probably down for $7 during dinner!  \n\nNext came the basket of fresh biscuits, cornbread, and sweet butter. DELISH! This was accompanied by a sizable dish of super fresh crudites. Also DELISH! But then came the Mushroom Rockefeller appetizer, which was a mild disappointment. Four fresh, large mushroom caps stuffed with spinach and bacon, topped with cheese and then baked. Pretty simple - except they were unintentionally served cold. You couldn't taste the bacon either, and the cheese had coagulated on top, making for a weird combination of consistencies in my mouth. By weird, I mean not good. The best part of the plate was the mess of sauteed spinach and garlic sitting as a garnish in the middle. THAT was so delicious - I saved it on a side plate to eat with my entree. \n\nFirst up on the Restaurant Week menu was a choice of salad. I ordered a Caesar. I loved the dressing, the cheese, the crouton, and the presentation, but the lettuce was brown. Like, really brown. I was pretty disappointed about that too.\n\nSecond, the 12 ounce ribeye with whiskey peppercorn sauce and parmesan potato stack. The ribeye was pretty thin, but flavorful and cooked to my medium rare liking. I sort of expected the Walmart guy to pop out and yell, \"THIS IS A STEAKOVER!\" It never happened. I would assume that the 16 ounce on the regular menu is of the thickness I prefer in my ribeyes; 12 ounces was just too thin to enjoy medium rare.  \n\nMy ribeye was also missing the whiskey peppercorn sauce, but that was quickly remedied. The sauce was more like a gravy. I really couldn't tell where the whiskey or the peppercorn was, but it added a nice dimension to the meat that I thought had been lacking in my first dry bite. My potato stack was also tasty - a bit old school and on the salty side, but good considering it was real au gratin potatoes. My husband definitely preferred my stack to his mash. \n\nThe end of the meal was the real superstar. Pecan pie. Topped with bourbon infused whipped cream. Wow. I can't even justify this dessert with a description; it was just that good. \n\nThe place is a historic gem, the staff is incredible friendly, and bless our server Justine - she was a real trooper. They get extra points for a $5 kids menu that includes a drink and dessert. I think next time I'll just jump right to the root beer, prime rib, and pecan pie - but trust me, there definitely will be a next time!", "business_id": "7U8TYNW4Mvx6m3zexsO0sg", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-09-21", "type": "review"}

We told the waitress about the cold meat and in as professional a manner as I've ever seen she removed it and apologized. Forward 5 minutes she returns with my second prime rib. I touched the top and it was minimally warmer, although the plate was so hot it couldn't be touched. Cut into this one and again barely warm.

The place was busy, Horny the Bull was out in front, and we were seated right away as we had a reservation. We slid down the slid, and then were escorted to our table. We were in a Huge Booth that overlooked the Valley of the Sun! What a Gorgeous View at night! We all ordered drinks and they were brought right away. Of course we had to order the Rattlesnake, wings, and nachos. The wings were soggy and not very good. They were called the \"4 Alarm\" wings...one would have thought they would have been hot. The nachos were just so so, good but not great. My Filet Mignon was perfect! No complaints here. Everyones elses meals were very good as well. We finished off the night out by the Fire-Pit with drinks and great conversation. A good time was had by all. It was blast from the past, as a lot of the pictures on the walls/restrooms upfront were from the 80's.", "business_id": "wZwZcte4lcbu51NOzCjWbQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-09-03", "type": "review"}

Because if she was, she would have taken you to the OYE which would remind you how awesome and AZ Authentic this place actually is! Rustler's Rooste is THEE place to take out of town guests who need a little wild, wild west.\n\nAfter attending the last Elite event, I came back a week later for the full Rustler's Rooste experience outside of the hosted event. It was a Wednesday and the place was filled with energy; the tables surrounding the band and dance floor were full of European visitors.\n\nThe sun started to set over the Valley as we enjoyed the best fried mushrooms the valley has to offer. The view from the restaurant is unbeatable. Atmosphere and view (and FRIENDLY service) is what gives Rustler's Rooste its 5 stars.\n\nHowever, the fun truly begin when our dinner arrived. Yes, the Filet Mignon was great, but watching the foreigners learn to line dance was priceless. As we dined and watched, I couldn't help but think about the 'Arizona' experiences these visitors were having - and how something so simple to us very well could be the highlight of their U.S. adventure! Some even had dressed for the occasion with bandannas and cowboy hats. Adorable. As the beer and wine kept flowing the visitors got more brave and started dancing their own mixed version of the 2-step. What a spectacle!\n\nThe food fits the atmosphere. It's not fine dining with foams and porcini dust - but - considering the old barn feel, sawdust on the floor, music/band, slide, bull at the entrance (p.s. I also love the new cotton candy in a tomato can touch) I'd say yes - rattlesnake does taste like chicken.\n\nForget the out of town guests, I'm comin' back when I need a swift reminder of what the wild, wild west means to me!", "business_id": "wZwZcte4lcbu51NOzCjWbQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-09-20", "type": "review"}

Yeeeehaw!!\n\nLocated on the top of a little hill in the middle of the Point, you get a great view of the valley. This is a Western style eatery, with a real bull sitting outside pretty much every night. Gives it the \"authentic\" smell i guess. When you enter, you can decide to choose the \"fun\" entrance, which is sliding down this slide instead of walking down the stairs! haha...I loved that, definitely makes you feel like a little kid again.\n\nThere's a nice live band playing on most of the nights, so pretty lively place. When you get to your seat, it's in these traditional wood benches. Along the floor, you have the typical western style hay thrown about. Nice touch to it.\n\nTheir menu selection is the classic Western food. If you are adventurous, I recommend trying the Deef Fried Rattlesnake as a starter. They actually serve the meat in a different portion and bring out the entire ribs of the snake, which is also deep fried. Meat is nothing too unique, just a tad bit chewy, however very neat presentation.\n\nThe rest of the menu is pretty standard Western food: steak, beans, etc.\nAfter a hearty meal, I recommend standing outside the patio (when the weather is cooler) and enjoy the view of the valley. \n\n If you are looking for really high quality food, you probably won't come here as the price is pretty steep for just decent western food. However, this place gets excellent ratings for the atmosphere. Perfect place to take any guests that visits the Valley for the first time.", "business_id": "wZwZcte4lcbu51NOzCjWbQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-10-14", "type": "review"}

Our pictures looked like they were already instagrammed with the way the lighting hit.  The food- worst free bread I think I've ever had, no fluffiness, no texture, hard and cold.  The rattlesnake was super chewy and honestly you get more crunchy fried batter than snake in each bite.  The presentation is awesome with the rib cage for sure.  I'm just wondering if they have someone out on then hill hunting them or what?  Definitely the closest I'd ever get to a snake by choice.

The Mac n cheese was a perfect balance of crunchiness and a little kick without being too cheesy or liquidy.  If you decide to order mushrooms on your steak, it's a huge portion so I'd recommend sharing one order amongst the group.  Finally, the cotton candy... Such melt in your mouth goodness.

If you are from the Denver area this can be compared to a steakhouse version of Casa Bonita. No cliff divers here, but you will find a bull, complete with smell at the entrance, a slide going from the main level down to the dining level, a live band and a dance floor that may or may not be flooded with a Sweet 16 party. The only thing this place is missing is a mechanical bull, which would definitely bump it up to four stars and guarantee repeat business from me. \n\nThe food is average. We were brought biscuits and fry bread with two different types of butter. I found the biscuits to be too dry, but the fry bread was good. I mean, it's basically a donut, how can you not like it. I ordered checken with bbq sauce and a baked potato. All of their vegetables are pre-made and soaked in butter and the only salad dressing available without dairy was oil and vinegar. So, maybe not the best option if you are allergic to dairy or lactose intolerant. They bring a gigantic bucket of what tasted like bubblegum flavored cotton candy at the end of the meal. None of us asked about dessert, so I am no help there, sorry.\n\nThe service, live music and the view were the best parts of this establishment. Our server had been working there 26 years and was so kind and helpful in making sure nothing I ate had dairy. They also have a bus that will take you back to your hotel, even if it is not close!

Let me just say that this place is not for everyone. Certainly not for someone who is about to celebrate his 78th.  At first impression, the place is Chaotic and LOUD.  Did I mention that it is LOUD.  If you like your dinner with a side of Screeching Teenage Girls and sing a long Happy Birthday, then welcome home.  Of the 2 hours that we were there, about an hour and a half were spent listening to that musical, over and over again. My uncle was not amused! I was embarrassed that brought the family in to this spectacle.  What is ironic, is that the food wasn't actually bad at all. My medium rare filet was very tender and flavorful.

But he was nice and we tried to be positive. He brought us the first course with no utensils.  He apologized and we understood they were busy and I bet the dishwasher was running behind. We order our drinks and a few were alcohol beverages.  He never asked if we wanted more drinks or check on us that frequently.  Again I am a part time server so I kept positive.  The food i do have to say was delicious but the portions were really small. Not sure really worth the price. When my spouse was cutting the turkey he was pushed by a busser. He didn't say excuse me. So rude. When my family and I wanted to split the check a certain way he rolled his eyes! We were going to give 20% or even a little more but soon dropped it. Then we asked for foil to cover our leftover pie he just threw it on the table and walked away without asking how was our dinning experience.  We informed the manager/owner Karen I believe and she seemed genuine but only said sorry and next time just ask for her and she would make sure we would have a different experience.  I live in California. I highly doubt I will ever come and if I have friends who visit Phoenix area I would never suggest this place.  I would probably warn them. I honestly think they need to hire a new restaurant manager and reevaluate their staff.", "business_id": "wZwZcte4lcbu51NOzCjWbQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-11-27", "type": "review"}

Yesterday, I was very disappointed in Rustlers Rooste! We made reservations for 5 pm, arrived at 4:45 and did not get seated until 6:20 pm. Many families were in same boat! It was a chaotic scene yesterday! Service was horrible, mashed potatoes were WAY too salty and pumpkin pie was super soggy / sugary! The only thing they got right was the turkey and yummy salad. For next thanksgiving, please honor your reservations! People don't mind waiting 15 to 30 minutes... But really an hour and a half??? You got the view going for you but that is about it!

I had only been there once before, in 2006, and it was so memorable that I promised myself that if I ever visited Phoenix again, I'd eat there. \n\nI tried so hard to convince my friends, who were in town with me, to check the place out, but they were too tired from all of our traveling. Guess what? I went by myself anyway, as a party of one!\n\nThe restaurant sits on a beautiful hilltop with a great view of the city. There's a live bull just hanging out' in a bullpen near the entrance...yes, a live bull, literally, just chillin'! The place is at least two stories. You enter on the top level and have a choice to take the stairs down to the first level, or you can take the slide...yes, a slide, literally. I wish I had that kind of setup in my house. It's magical! \n\nThere was a talented live band playing country music on the bottom floor, and there were people dancing. Good times! \n\nI was pleasantly greeted by the hostesses and promptly seated. I ordered the 12 oz. prime rib w/mashed potatoes on the side. A basket of two kinds of bread and two kinds of butter was brought out to me along with a delicious salad. One minute later, my dinner arrived.\n\nThe prime rib was PERFECT! The au jus that came with it was unique and delicious. The mashed potatoes were yummy. I had the biggest smile on my face the whole time I was eating. It was all very reasonably priced and high in quality. I had the rattlesnake the first time I went there. You should try it at least once, and then you can buy a T-shirt there that says you ate the snake. \n\nThe service was EXCELLENT!\n\nNeed I say more? Whenever anyone mentions Phoenix, I rave about this restaurant, and I will continue to do so. I'm also impressed by the fact that it's been nine years since I last ate here and it's still as amazing as I remembered it to be.

This was my daughters 4th birthday I read plenty great reviews on this place to help me choose this place to be her birthday dinner. We walk in see the bull the kids were excited we took the slide down to our table they absolutely loved that and then we get to our seat... We sit for awhile (10 min) waiting for someone to come over and the girls have to go to the bathroom so they leave to handle that I sit for another 5 minutes before the new waitress stumbles by and finally notices me. Asks what I'd like to drink I give her my order and tell her it's my daughters birthday and I'd like to order the birthday package (cake, photo, hat=$15)  yes that's right $15 for something other restaurants do for free. Anyways I order it while my daughters in the bathroom she said ok I'll go write it down right now I say thank you and we move along with our night. We had a decent dinner great band kept the kids happy it was sort of busy so we were patient with the waitress who mentioned she was new when we asked how to get the free meal for kids that's printed on the kids menu to ask the server about the free meal lol she had no idea. My daughter order a hot dog and fries it took 20 minutes to get ketchup but like I said it was busy so we were patient anyways they brought out our check brought out cotton candy I paid the bill and waited.. After 20 minutes or so after paying the bill we finally see the birthday song coming in our direction I pull out my camera to capture the special moment and it stopped a table before us hahaha jokes on us after they got done singing he waitress walked over asked if there was something else I needed I asked if they were still going to help us with my daughters birthday celebration and she started to apologize and say she completely forgot which is ok because like I've stated twice before it was busy and she is human so things happen she then asks if we still wanted it or if we just wanted the cake lol I respond I mean if it's alright with you id still like more then just the dinner for my daughters birthday thinking I had already paid for it .. By this time both my kids heads are on the table from being tired it's 9pm and they have school/daycare tomorrow so they come back 15 minutes later sing the birthday song give us the cake and take the picture our waitress says they will be right back out with the picture and again apologizes for the mix up and keeping us waiting I say it's ok ask for a box and box up the cake because my little one was being crabby as you can see in the video so it was just best we left. We're headed out and the waitress runs up and gives us a new ticket saying that she updated the price since she forgot about the birthday I'm thinking how nice of her to fix her mistake lol she updated the ticket and charged us for the horrible celebration that she forgot. Listen in the video as they stop in the middle of the song to ask her her birthday then asks how old she is . I told the lady she could get the manager because I wasn't paying for it and she responded Rudely saying \"well I guess I'll just pay for it out of my tips\" I left her $12 on the original ticket yes you should have to pay for your mistake the worst birthday dinner I've ever seen. Great establishment but horrible waitress we will not be back. Sorry for the rant but she bummed a very important day for us. Did I mention after talking with the manager he apologized for her and also mentioned we don't get a hard copy of the photo like she said we just get to download it off their website lol the strangest $15 bday package I've heard of.", "business_id": "wZwZcte4lcbu51NOzCjWbQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-10-25", "type": "review"}

I spent about 15 minutes in their parking lot (phone server was running slow) poring over my options in the area and decided to give this place a try.  It was about 8pm.\n\nIt wasn't crowded at all so I was seated right away. The waitress kind of surprised me when she plopped down across from me and started talking to me like I was somebody she knew, but I kind of got a kick out of it.  I had looked at the menu and the hostess told me on the way in that her favorite was the sirloin so I decided to get it. It was under $11, which I thought was reasonable. It came with two sides so I got green beans and seasoned rice.  Rolls are provided right away and there is a bucket of peanuts on the table to hold you while you wait.  The rolls were excellent, soft and yeasty, with a cinnamon butter that was delicious but sweet and better suited for dessert.  The green beans were kind of salty but cooked in bacon and had good flavor, the rice was unimpressive, sort of reminded me if a rice-a-roni, but that steak was perfect!  It was so tender I barely needed a knife to cut it and had a nice grilled flavor.  \n\nI found out they had an early bird special menu and returned 10 days later to try it.  I got a  Chicken Fried Steak smothered in gravy with sides of Caesar Salad and mashed potatoes.  For a dollar extra I got them \"loaded,\" topped with grated cheese, butter, onions, sour cream and a side of brown gravy--more toppings than potatoes!  All were good although the steak was very salty.  \n\nI wanted to get back there again before I left town but didn't make it since I returned to San Diego a week later.\n\nNov. 2012:  I'm back in town and finally got back here, barely squeaked in by the 6pm deadline for the early bird steak dinner.  I ordered fast and my waitress submitted it a minute to six!  This time it was a 6-oz sirloin with sides of green beans (very bacon-y but not so salty this time), and mashed potatoes.  Because of the rush when she asked if I wanted the potatoes loaded I just said yes and forgot to ask if it was extra.  It was.  I think they should let you know this.  I probably still would've gotten it for a dollar but I think it's fair to tell people.  When she asked if I wanted the steak \"smothered\" I did think to ask if that was extra, and she said yes it was 99cents.  It turned out it was $1.99.  So my $8.50 steak dinner ended up an $11.50 dinner, not so much of a bargain.  Next time I'll know. But she should have told me the truth.  Other than that she was a great waitress, checked back frequently to make sure everything was ok, etc.\n\nI would return because the steak is so good.  And I should mention that it was extremely busy on a Wednesday night at 6pm, so there must be a lot of people happy with the place.", "business_id": "Mm8x_jzeLrWlvDEnqhuCBQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-11-08", "type": "review"}

I remember when Applebee's had 12 minute lunch options so my husband & I headed over for a quick bite to eat. \nWe were seated behind a mgr. interviewing a waitress which was a first for me. It was a bit strange because I thought maybe that should be done somewhere private or at least NOT directly behind a booth of customers so who can overhear the questions & answers. \nWe ordered & received our drinks in a reasonable amount of time. HOWEVER, we ordered a chocolate lava dessert (for me) & an all you can eat soup & salad (for my husband) and after TWENTY MINUTES we did not get any food!!! I ended up having to cancel my dessert order & leave to pick up our children from school & drive BACK to the restaurant to get my husband since he chose to go ahead & wait for the food because he really likes the tomato basil, french onion & chicken tortilla soup (he also likes it at Chili's) and the oriental chicken salad as well as the fiesta chicken salad. \nWhile I was gone he moved to a table in the bar area to see the \"game\" on TV & told me the bartender was friendly. However, I don't plan on going back here for a LOOONG time. Especially since today we went to BJ's Restaurant & Brewery on Superstition Springs & Power where they have all you can eat soup & salad for only $7.95 as opposed to the $9.99 price at Applebee's. \nThinking back I do remember having a problem at this location about 5 yrs. ago when we went for a family dinner with my parents & they sent us a gift card in the mail because of the problems we had then.

We met friends there before going to see a movie and arrived after they had ordered.  Our drinks were brought quickly, our food was fairly prompt arriving, and it was GOOD.\n\nI was going back and forth between a burger and a chicken sandwich with avocado and sprouts and went with the latter and a side of barbecued baked beans.  The beans were great, though boiling hot and they did a number on the roof of my mouth.  The sandwich was also great and huge: I ate half of it as I wanted popcorn at the movie.\n\nBecause of a toothache, I decided to have a Mudslide.  When it arrived, it was a bit different than what I was expecting.  I'm used to this drink being in a daiquiri glass that had chocolate syrup drizzled in it and probably more of a dilute milkshake consistency.  This was in a much shorter glass, had more icecubes in it, but the flavor was great.  And it was potent.  I was feeling it after one drink, which really helped with my tooth.  And yes, I made sure the prescription didn't have a problem with alcohol, and my wife was driving home that night.\n\nAfter the movie we went for dessert as the parking lot was absolutely crazy with two full theaters letting out at the same time, we wanted to burn some time to get out more easily.  Even though it was now half an hour before their posted closing time, no problems getting a booth.  The waitress was a little slow getting to us, but she was prompt and provided good service once things got moving.  She seemed to be the only waitress in the main dining room and was servicing another group, plus probably doing shut-down tasks.  All we wanted was to split a slice of their key lime pie, and I have to say that it was one of the best key lime pies that I've ever had.\n\nReal key limes, a walnut/graham cracker crust, and really yummy whipped cream.  And a size that was perfect for sharing.  I've had a lot of key limes over the years that ranged from key lime in name only to exceptional ones, and this was one of the best.  I would seriously consider coming here just for dessert if I were in the area, but I would not hesitate to come here again for a full dinner experience.  I with we'd arrived earlier and met with our friends on-time, but Phoenix freeways being what they are it just wasn't possible.\n\nDefinitely recommended place and not too pricey in my opinion.", "business_id": "Rus-ewyqLj2D1RlqK-je4w", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-11-25", "type": "review"}

I mean, if when you walk into a restaurant and nobody is there take that as a sign from God not to eat. So we sat down and ordered some food. \n\nEverybody got soup. I guess it came with your meal. I didn't try the soup myself, but I looked around and watched as others did. And the reaction on their faces told me that it probably tasted of dishwater. A while after we got our soup our main courses arrived. I had the Teriyaki Chicken. Let me say that the rice was mushy and the chicken was cold. I could hardly eat any of it. The chicken was served on top of a nasty piece of lettuce that just made me want to barf. Forgive me if I am being a little sensational here, I am trying to make up for the lack of sensation I had when eating the food. Two of my other coworkers had some noodle dish of which they complained that there wasn't enough chicken in it. \n\nAs we were eating what we could I saw the cook at the sushi bar premaking some food. There was nobody in the restaurant and I wondered who he was making all of it for. Clearly the food isn't prepared fresh and I could taste it in my own dish. I thought to myself, \"..how long ago was this chicken cooked, because it is cold now.\" I must say that Ichi Ban had one thing going for it, great tasting Coke. \n\nAfter we finished, we got the bill and it ended up costing me $12! I normally don't complain about prices. I'm not poor. But for what we got, it just wasn't worth it. I was pissed. Perhaps I had been a bad boy and maybe that is why I got such horrible food. As we left we all decided not to come back, thank God. I wonder how long Ichi Ban will last before it goes under. It looked and tasted pretty grim.", "business_id": "rHFWPJML2WlGbad0Tqevxw", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-10-23", "type": "review"}

No bartender to make mixed drinks. They were out of Bacardi and Captain Morgan. Who doesn't have a bartender and popular alcohol on a Saturday night? Oh well, lets move onto the food. The food was not very good at all. I was surprised because it's usually decent. The filet was not good meat and the lobster was dry.

I don't see myself ever going back. The total was over $100 for 2 people. For that kinda money I expect good service and good food.

Me too. Unfortunately, I don't have to worry about that here. Since I did my first Outback store opening on Rapid City, SD, over 15 years ago, nothin could beat a Bloomin Onion followed by my favorite cut of meat; ribeye. I have rarely strayed. After work today I was craving some dead animal so much I could already taste it. Outback is closer that Texas Roadhouse and the nicer steakhouses in the area weren't really fit for my golf shorts and flip flops. \n\nMy girlfriend and I were seated in a booth for six. Lol. Hey, at least it was roomy, and I can eat!  Was tempted to try something different but wanted to enjoy my dinner and if I tried something new (sometimes I do) and didn't like it I would leave unsatisfied and pissy. I ordered the Bloomin Onion and the 14oz Ribeye with salad and garlic mashed potatoes. She ordered the Shrimp on the Barbie and a Cobb Salad. The Onion was good as usual. Although its not rocket science to drop a vegetable in grease for a few minutes. We'll give them a thumbs up anyway. \n\nRemember I'm pretty big on customer service so little things like beverage refills and butter with the bread doesn't rank up there with ingenious thought concepts like the invention of the wheel or flight. The guy who fills our soda machines at work was out sick today so we were out of a lot. Maybe he's in charge of this Outback's butter and soda supply as well. \n\nAnyway, I'm not sure if you all know what goes on a Cobb Salad in general, but I do. So if any of you reading this know or decide to find out for yourself, could you pass it on to Outback. It looked like a Chicken Caesar.  The best was the two itsy bitsy cherry tomatoes cut in half. \n\nOk, to the main issue; MY dinner, lol. Garlic mashed potatoes sucked. What is it with Phoenix restaurants that they will O.D. someone with cilantro but are at a loss with any other spice. Bland: I think I will be overusing that term a lot here. \n\nYou can always tell when they forgot about the steak they were cooking. In this case, my mid-rare came out medium to mid-well. That's being generous. It had a little pink left but was dry as a desert due to the cook putting some obvious pressure behind the steak weight. One side was hard to even cut through because it had 99% of the cook time and the other side barely was seared. Due to the improper cooking technique none of the seasoning stuck, hence my additional use of the word bland, again. \n\nSo it brings me back to the beginning of getting that favorite dish that keeps you coming back. It didn't happen and I probably won't be back anytime soon in another futile attempt.", "business_id": "r6zT-YqmOtHg8BJT3LLzfg", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-10-30", "type": "review"}

Sadly, chandler blows. I am so angry and I want my $34 back. \n\nI ordered curbside to go. Please understand that you have to give them the make, model, and color of your car. So I ordered and it said online it would be ready in 20 min. I got to outback in 18 mins. Thought that was great... \n\nWhen I got there, the 4 \"to go\" spots were taken - one by a car which had no driver and was clearly not waiting for food. I parked in the very next spot - no to go sign, but right next to those. Left car on, lights on, watched, waited... Nothing... For 41 minutes. At that point I thought, they know what I'm driving, they know they have food sitting in the kitchen getting cold, it can't possibly be that I'm one...parking...spot...over... Can it? So I back up my car and park on the OTHER side of the douche that took to go parking. I sh** you not, 4 seconds later a server brings my food. I dressed her down asking why she left me out there for 40 mins when she knew what I was driving and the spots were full, she meekly said I parked in the wrong spot. I am still pissed at her. Great customer service. Moron. \n\nGot home, guess what? My medium rare burger is now well done, stone cold, and inedible. My husband's med rare steak is med well and also cold. This particular outback owes me $34.\n\nDon't get curbside here. The waitress decided not to pay attention, then not care after I called it out, management didn't care, and the food blew (though it was probably correct when they bagged it - I doubt it's the chef's fault). Go to McClintock and Southern. They actually give a sh** about their customers. \n \nBTW, if outback management reads this, I hope you talk to your staff about looking at the CARS you expect, not zeroing in on a spot.

I was cautious and apparently justified. Sat in the bar. After drink orders were promptly taken and delivered, orders taken, we waited over twenty minutes for breadsticks that literally had the same consistency as the wood in our table.  They brought us replacements.  The cheese is deliscious. The breadsticks are similar to those you buy in the frozen food section and microwave to a warm rubbery consistancy which is edible but not something that was intended for consumption. It would have been a great app if the breadsticks didn't bring it down. Also had the Alice Springs Chicken Quesadilla which is very good and thus delivered above standard pleasantries as expected.  \n\nSalads came next.  I am picky but I know what I like. I asked for just lettuce, cucumbers, and ranch. Of course they added cheese. Good thing I'm not lactose intolerant. May not seem like a big deal but I am paying for this. \n\nIt is now 12:48pm. We are sitting at a booth in the bar. The bartender has 5 tables, and is very busy, where is the manager? Steak is here. Only took 45 minutes. Cooked mid-rare, looks great.  Must have got lucky cause they forgot it on the grill.  Check the pic. It was rare and uneven which is a sure sign the cook either isn't very good or forgot about it. \n\nI give up. Get your heart set on a pleasant experience and your favorite dish at a favorite place and let down to the ground. Sounds like an overreaction but it pisses me off. My bill was 54.86 after they took off the breadsticks, which was appropriate so I give them kudos for that.

There were just a few tables in there dining. About 6 people in the Bar.\nOur Hostess was really perky and sat us right away in a booth,with our menus. We waited so long to be greeted that we actually were ready to completely order by the time our Server came over. \nThe menus are nice well laid out.

The Tables were not set high end at all.\nThe food was good! I really liked it.

About 10-15 mins later give or take my steak came back out again and the manager advised that I cut my steak to make sure it was perfect . For my wasted time he advised he would take off half of the bill which came up to be 7$ ....  Now as I cut my steak open once again the steak was not medium .... It was still medium well ..to done....Of course at this time we had waited so much time and we had other plans for that day I figured I don't ever want to be that customer that complains about her food but then again I never complain so I just said it was fine but was very disappointed because you can clearly see that it was still medium well to done !

This was the first time for both of us.  The restaurant is very clean and you get a nice homey feel inside.  They have a nice sized patio if you care to eat outside.  We came in around 8:45 on a Friday night and we were seated promptly.  I started out with a Pacifico beer and my wife had a Belini from the bar.  We started out with an order of crab cakes and Mushrooms Neptune.\n\nThe Crab Cakes were very good and were filling.  You get 2 to an order and a side of their house tartar sauce that was a great accompaniment.  The Mushrooms Neptune is a mixture of cream cheese & crab stuffed inside mushrooms and baked.  These were really good as well.  You get 6 to an order.  A dinner roll came with it and I'm not sure why?  It was a plain ol' dinner roll, no butter or anything.  It really had no purpose of being there really.\n\nFor dinner I ordered the N.Y. Strip with a twice baked potato and added a lobster tail to the meal.  The steak was prepared perfectly (I ordered medium) and seasoned the way a steak should be.  The lobster tail was succulent with the drawn butter and the twice baked potato did not disappoint either.  My wife had the 10 oz. prime rib dinner (medium) with a twice baked potato and onion strings and that was out of the park as well.\n\nThe service was first class and at the end of our meal, the manager came over with 2 complimentary glasses of champagne to celebrate our anniversary and I thought that was a nice touch too.  The Keg won me over and I would have no reservations going back.  The prices are a little higher than other chain steakhouses but you'll find out quickly why and it's not a bad thing.

Every other experience here before had been a 4 star or better, but that was years ago.  Also know that the restaurant had people, but was not busy at all on the bar side.  The restaurant side was reservation only for lunch and had people, but not busy as well.\n\nI unfortunately forgot our server's name, but she was a 20 something female.  She was quick to great us with waters.  When we were not ordering alcohol that is when things took a turn.  She took a bit to bring the iced teas out & did not bring sweetener.  My father had to ask several times before we received it.  When she finally took our order that was the death blow.  We ordered three wedge salads & I had the sirloin added to mine. We have a big, early Thanksgiving dinner and did not want to get stuffed.  After that we could not get her to come by for anything.  We had to ask other servers for drink refills (I hate doing that).  After about 45 minute wait for our salads (mind you the place was not busy), we received my mom's wedge, mine with the sirloin, but my dad's was missing.  She forgot to ring his up.  So the food runner got his within 5 minutes, amazing how quickly they can get them out when stuff is messed up.  Going back to the food drop, we all still had empty drinks & no silverware.  When they brought our silverware out, they never brought out a steak knife; I had to ask for that as well.  \n\nFinally the taste of the food. The lettuce was super wet, so much so that the dressing wouldn't stick.  My steak was almost room temp and the steak knife had a hard time cutting through it.  \n\nMy dad got a little snarky and made a comment about how bad things were to one of the other servers trying to help out. Alexa, the manager, finally stopped by.  She asked us how everything was going, mom & dad started going off.  I stopped them and spoke calmly to her.  She ended up apologizing for things not being great and comped our meal (for three it probably was $40).  She did a 4-1/2 star job.

This latest visit was not as good; the service wasn't friendly. I sat @ the bar with a buddy, and we both ordered the prime burger. The burger was good, but regardless of how busy the bartenders were, they just weren't friendly (male or female). Shouldn't a place like this offer friendly, quality service? I'm a patient guy, and understand when a place is busy but that doesn't mean quality has to be lacking.

The chiptole butter was the best.  \n\nI chose a Chilean sea bass with saut\u00e9ed spinach.  It was a flakey and stringy texture as a great bass would have.

My friend had the filet mignon with crab on top and scallops on the side.  The scallops were the best.  Not too bouncy and cooked just right.  The crab has a mediocre taste.  Something common like it can be made at home.  The filet is tender deep red meat and not that flavorful because of the lack of fat.  And again, it was average.\n\nThe dessert was the best part of the meal.  The chocolate lava cake with REAL whipped cream.

We've been to this Fleming's on several occasions, and tonight seemed to be a continuation of the progression downhill for this restaurant, in my opinion.\n\nWe decided to make this a family of four dinner, bringing our 10 and 12 year olds.  Obviously, we tried to stick with steak at this steak house.  We came at opening, about 5pm, arriving at 4:50.  They did have us wait until they were ready at 5pm, and that's okay.  The opening, though, plays a big part later in this review.  We stuck with water, as you can run up a really high bill very quickly.  Our orders were taken late (about 15 minute wait)  because we had not ordered drinks, and the waiters were busy brining out wine, etc, to the other tables.  The bread was fresh, but the butter was not.  It was dried out, like it had been frozen, and we were served the freezer burnt butter.\n\nI asked for the Crab Cake appetizer to be brought out at the same time as everyone else's plate.  This was screwed up, and was brought out early.  So everyone else had to watch me eat.  I was having this as a \"small plate\" dish.  The boys had the specials, which were a petite filet mignon along with 3 scallops.  We asked for medium--they were undercooked, more along the lines of rare to medium-rare.  The scallops were well cooked, but a little bland.  The 10 year old did not like them, and he usually really enjoys seafood.  I added on the Chipotle Cheddar Macaroni and Cheese for the kids, which they liked, along with Half and Half, which is shoestring fries with Onion Rings, both tasted okay.\n\nMy wife had the Double Thick Pork Rib Chop.  The sauce was very tasty, BUT the pork was underdone, and was visibly raw in the middle.  This was unacceptable.  We had to send the plate back, which was put under the broiler, and then brought back to us.  I have to say this is the second time in a row that my wife's meat was raw at this Fleming's.  I would've chalked it up to oven not being hot enough for the first dishes, but this seems to be a recurrent problem.  \n\nI had a small plate, the Sliced Filet Mignon, which is served on Risotto.  The meat was very well done, but the risotto was completely dried out and tasteless. I was very disappointed.\n\nAs it took about another 10-15 minutes between when our plates were taken away and our waiter came with the dessert menu, we had decided to skip dessert and coffee and make our way to Starbucks, about two buildings away.\n\nI'm willing to forgive the delays due to them just opening up.  Plus, it was Veteran's Day.  However, the food being underprepared for the second time in a row is unforgivable, especially for as expensive a restaurant as Fleming's is.  This is really starting to feel like a \"chain\" restaurant as it really is rather than an exclusive steak restaurant, which they strive to be.  Overall, I think we're done with Fleming's.", "business_id": "0ONypOKIhttBz9IJzBE8jg", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-11-13", "type": "review"}

This review is strictly related to the \"experience\", or in our case, lack there-of. We left after 30+ minutes, in large part due to the large gaps in time between the server coming back to check on us.\n\nOur unfortunate experience was rather short, so I'll try to keep it to the point. It was the wife and I's 4 year anniversary. I made same-day reservations for a Friday night (9/5) at 7:15. We pulled up and used the valet out-front, which was nice. We walked in and were seated within a few minutes. So far, so good. We were seated at a 4-top in the middle of what I can only describe as a cattle yard. Everyone seemed so close together, with booths surrounding the room, apparently the only good seats in the house. The wife likes to sit next to me, so I thought I'd ask to switch. Upon getting up to request a booth, I was told they had already sat it... Oddly enough, said booth wasn't sat for another minute or two after I had returned to my seat. Not a big deal, as the experience I was hoping for could easily make up for it. \n\nI returned to my seat in time to greet our server (40+ yo woman) who had only been there briefly. Rather than offering her name, all she said was \"Cocktails?!\". My wife said she was interested in a glass of wine, and asked for a possible suggestion. The server handed her an iPad to look through instead of, ya know, imparting knowledge that a seasoned server should do at a \"fine dining\" establishment. We told her we'd need a few minutes to look through the cocktail list, and upon her return she then asked us if we're interested in hearing the specials for the night. I wanted to cut off her butchered attempt at telling us the features, but didn't have the heart to do so.\n\nTheir beer/wine menu does not allow one to discern if the beer is draft or bottled. So, while I did not ask, I was not told how the beer I ordered would come, but at least my $7 bottled beer was delivered with a glass. My wife ordered a glass of wine, and at that point, I handed the server my card when she asked if we'd like to start with any appetizers. Clearly knowing something was wrong, she bleakly stated, \"Oh, just the drinks? But it's your anniversary! I hope it's not something we did.\" and walked away.\n\nThe way she said it, she clearly could not care less and seemed glad for us to be leaving. I'm under 30, so maybe she assumed we were cheap. Both my wife and I have worked before in the restaurant industry for a combined 12+ years. We left a 50% tip to dismiss any conclusion on their part that we are \"cheap.\"\n\nWhile I am sure the food is great, as that's all the other reviews seem to cover, if you are looking for an intimate restaurant to visit with your significant other and are looking for a level of service that is on par with the price, then dine elsewhere. I personally am not willing to pay $50+ for a steak and $10 for a baked potato if the level of service I receive is that of a 2am visit to Denny's. I've only been in AZ a year, so perhaps the bar is much lower here for fine dining than it is in Seattle (El Gaucho, Palisades, Canlis, Daniel's Broiler, Salty's, etc). \n\nVery discouraging visit for our first time.

The steak was a bit overcooked, did not want to complain and put a damper on the celebration at hand - it was acceptable, it also had obvious fork holes poked into it.  The side salad is small, we used to be able to split it, not anymore. The appetizer they serve as a complimentary appetizer was dull - cracked bread with 3 dips that aren't very flavorful. It was noisy, hard to visit. We sat on the main floor at a 4 top table. The Service was confusing, had one person take our order & then it seemed another Server took over, we hardly saw the person who took our order at our table, but saw her at others surrounding ours  - food was delivered by someone else, which is typical in many restaurants - that was acceptable. There was a birthday celebration and the birthday person was handed a little box with candies, which is nice - but not special, in the past, they would serve the birthday person creme brulee -- When we want a special night out again, it won't be at Flemings. Prices do not justify the atmosphere, food or service.", "business_id": "0ONypOKIhttBz9IJzBE8jg", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-10-27", "type": "review"}

We were greeted by name upon checking in. We were seated immediately and acknowledged that it was our wedding anniversary on the way to our table. Upon being seated we received a complementary starter dish, a happy anniversary card signed by the staff and was greeted by our waiter who was the utmost friendly, professional and attentive waiter we have ever met! We enjoyed 2 unbelievable Ribeyes, cooked and seasoned to perfection. They should call their steaks \"Crack Steaks\" because once you have had one, you are hooked and must have another! Our waiter guided us through the entire meal experience making sure that we were happy and pampered. He even suggested that we share a potato rather than ordering one each as they were so large. Our waiter also suggested an incredible red wine to complement the steak. it was reasonably priced and a perfect steak companion! Our waiter also recommended that we order dessert early so that it would be ready to be served promptly upon completing our meals. Once again, absolutely delicious!!! The entire dining experience was beyond words. We have NEVER had a better meal, service or experience than we experienced at Flemings. So if that was not enough, we were presented with a delicious box of truffles and a $25 gift card as a wedding anniversary gift before we left. Are you kidding me??? I am currently seeking that Flemings adopt me so that I can be fed and cared for in this same manner everyday!", "business_id": "0ONypOKIhttBz9IJzBE8jg", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-11-01", "type": "review"}

Yes, the ambiance was nice, but the focus of our trip, the food, was not worth it.\nI ordered the steak with the king crab. Kudos to the for actually making it lump crab versus shucking your own. However, it was so dry I had to ask for a replacement.  They were quick to get a new fresh order out to me. It was fine, but did have shell mixed in. :(\n\nAnother positive was that my steak was cooked to perfection.  \n\nWe ordered the Chipotle mac n cheese and the peppercorn parm mashed potatoes.  Mac n cheese was flavorful and a great spin on a classic. The mashed potatoes were flavorless. Which made the dinner even worse... I was so excited to have them! \n\nIn the end we thought we'd redeem the night by getting dessert to go..  carrot cake and turtle pie. We've yet to eat them, but regretted the order as soon as we got the bill... they were 12 bucks each!!!\n\nSo in the end we spent $200+ tip on a meal that was worth maybe $100. \n\nThis place has some cool factors -ipads for wine and dessert options and great service, but I wouldn't pay that much more for those qualities.", "business_id": "0ONypOKIhttBz9IJzBE8jg", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-11-08", "type": "review"}

There are other seating areas, but the main dining is in one particular area. I will say apart from the noise, I enjoyed the lighting and the atmosphere in general; lots of people smiling and enjoying food. \n\nI ordered the Chilean sea bass & ended up sending it back. Here's why: the 'broth' that it comes in is a bit much for me. My fish was swimming in a broth that made the crunchy bits of potato soggy & took away from the overall enjoyment of the fish. The fish itself was cooked perfectly, but it lacked flavor. The chile pesto that was used to dress the plate was FABULOUS ! I'm wondering why they don't ditch the broth and focus on how the fish and the sauce pair together effortlessly.. \n\nThe second meal I ordered was the filet mignon & lobster tail. The steal was OK. It was dry and over cooked but instead of ordering AGAIN I decided to give it a try... Eh. I should've sent it back! The lobster was the highlight def. it was tender and cooked perfectly. \n\nSuffice it to say, I'd give them another chance and try some other options on their menu. Although, for a steak house to send out a dry over cooked steak requested medium, that's a pretty tough blow.! I think there's a fine line between being a restaurant that can handle volume & being one that produces decadence with every plate served.", "business_id": "0ONypOKIhttBz9IJzBE8jg", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-09-14", "type": "review"}

We were looking for restaurants tonight in and near Tempe (we're visiting from Los Angeles), we found Flemings!  And then I remembered I  had a gift card for $100 that a friend had given me.  The portions looked so huge that we decided to split an entree, a potato and a salad. We even split a glass of wine!  It was a wonderful decision.  As we looked around, we saw all male/female couples and we pondered and wondered if male/female couples were treated any differently than us. So Janet casually asked our waitress  if she were homophobic. She said, \"No, not at all!\"  We told her we were celebrating our anniversary - 2 years of legal marriage and almost 24 years of being together.  She thought that was great!  How wonderful, we thought.  We even showed her a picture of our 3 month old granddaughter.  So we ate our delicious meal which was excellent, everything cooked to perfection- we were too full for dessert.  The check comes and it's almost exactly $100... $102 to be exact. Great!  I took out the gift card and was about to pay when the manager comes over and extends his hand and says \"I hear it's your anniversary!\"  \"Yes,\" we say.  He tells us that they are very supportive of us and he is so happy to tell us that the whole meal was comped!  We were more than thrilled!  Not only for the comped meal but for the recognition that we are as legit as any other couple.  They even brought us some Godiva chocolates to take with us.  Please patronize Flemings whatever your relationship status! We come back here about once a year and will certainly come back again - for our next anniversary!  All because we decided to speak up and be seen as who we are - a couple, in love, celebrating with good food and a great atmosphere. And instead of prejudice, we were met with compassion, equality and legitimacy. Made us feel very special. Megan was our server who was great even before she knew about us. And Anthony was the manager who was so genuinely kind and generous. We were really astonished!  The whole staff was great.  Oh and when one of the male/female couples left (one of the ones we noticed were very sweet and close to each other) they came over to us and said \"We overheard it was your anniversary and we wanted to tell you our congratulations!\"   Amazing!!  How far we've come. Thank goodness.", "business_id": "0ONypOKIhttBz9IJzBE8jg", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-09-19", "type": "review"}

The caramelized onion contrasted with the bleu cheese was phenomenal! I think I ate about 7 of them!\n\nThis was paired with Caymus' 2008 Conundrum; a blend of Napa and central coast varietals. This was my first experience with a blended white, and I am a fan! Vanilla, melon, pear, mild acidity, really amazing.\n\nThe combination of the sweet onions, and the vanilla and citrus of the Conundrum, made for a fantastic finish. Yumm!\n\n\nOut next course was an heirloom tomato salad with burrata cheese  (mozzarella), arugula, and diced beets.\nI'm not a fan of tomatoes by themselves, but these were delicious, hearty, and very fresh. And the spice of the arugula paired with the acid of the tomato, and the creaminess of the burrata, made for a delectable salad. I finished it off, even the beets.\n\nThis was paired with the 2007 Mer Soleil Silver Unoaked Chardonnay. Very fruity, creamy, beautiful golden wine.\n\nPaired with the acid of the tomatoes, and the creaminess of the burrata highlights the richness of the wine wonderfully.\n\n\nFor the main course we were served peppercorn-crusted New York Strip with Bordelaise Sauce, Sauteed Escarole and Fingerling Potatoes.\nThe strip was what other cuts of beef aspire to be. The preparation is what other chefs aspire to accomplish.\nSimplistic, subtle, yet very powerful in both mouth feel, and flavor.\nThe escarole was topped with shaved hard-boiled egg, which was unique, and definitely changed the impact of the escarole. (I'm not particularly fond of it myself)\nThe fingerling potatoes were perfect.\nThe bordelaise could have been delivered in a cup and I'd have happily drank it up.\n\nPaired with this course were two Cabernet Sauvignons; a 2000, and a 2008.\n\nThe 2008 had far too many tannins for my liking. I don't want to pucker up like I've just eaten sand and have dry mouth.\nThe 2000 was much more mild, and was rather delicious.\n\nBoth paired wonderfully with the grilled meat, and the saltiness of the herbs on the potatoes meshed well with the reds.\n\n\nFor dessert we were served Berry Trifle with sour cream pundcake and amaretto mascarpone Cream.\nOMG. I died and went to heaven. Which I don't believe in. But almost could have.\n\nTopped with toasted almond slivers, this dessert was pure bliss. The berries floating in the rich mascarpone, resting atop that delicious yet sinfully good pound cake.\n\nAs if that wasn't enough to knock your socks off, they paired it with a 2004 Mer Soleil Late Viognier that alone could make you think you were drinking pure sugar, with great flavor.\nApricot, honey, orange, balanced acid make for a lush and long finish.\n\nAn amazing dinner and dessert, but in addition to the fantastic food, we were connected via videoconference with Chef Russell Skall; Fleming's Executive Chef, Chuck Wagner; owner of Caymus Vineyards, and Marian Jansen op de Haar; Fleming's Director of Wine. They fielded questions from several locations that were all conferenced in, making it feel a bit more personal. :)\n\nAs if all that weren't enough, one of the servers mistakenly switched my tab with another party's. That didn't really bother me, as I understand that mistakes can happen.\n\nHow it was handled made me want to reserve my 100th review for them; Mike Head, one of the Operating Partner's for the Fleming's in the Scottsdale Hilton, had introduced himself during the event, and had provided me his business card.\nI was expecting a deposit the night of the event, so the next morning I checked my account, which was how I noticed the disparity between my tab, and the amount my account was debited. (It was a triple digit charge)\nI emailed Mike, explaining the situation, and requested he contact me.\nLater in the day I hadn't heard from him, so I called him.\n\nLong story less long; he was going to contact my bank and, calling as a merchant, attempt to reverse the charge. He called me back to inform me that, rather than take a chance on there being any delay in me getting my funds back, he just went ahead and took cash to my bank, and deposited it in my account.\n\nNobody does that. Ever.\n\nMike Head of Fleming's did.\n\nHe even returned my gratuity for the mistake having been made in the first place.\n\nAnd after all that, they still gave me a gift card to entice me to return.\nMike Head, and Fleming's of Scottsdale, epitomize what customer service should alway be about.\n\nThank you Fleming's, Caymus Vineyards, Chef Skall, Mike Head, and most importantly, Shwaag, for such an amazing evening.\n\nAnd thanks especially to my date, for being so beautiful. :)\n\nIf you haven't been to Fleming's, do so at your earliest opportunity.", "business_id": "9AbyBqGWHYZC73GlyAuTrQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-10-04", "type": "review"}

Oh yeah, the martinis are large, cold and good.\n\nOtherwise the service is top notch.  I really like a place where waiters are trained to observe every table, not just their own.

As soon as we were done with one course a passing waiter picked up the dishes, checked on our experience so far and asked if there was anything else they could do. That makes for a great dining experience.\n\nThe Porcini rubbed tenderloin in gorgonzola sauce was great.  Ask for extra sauce on the side and you'll get some chunks of gorgonzola in it.  The added texture really helps the sauce. \n\nThe scallops in lobster cream sauce were equally good.  Slightly crisp outside, sweet on the inside, perfectly complemented by the lobster cream sauce.

I mean who doesn't enjoy an extremely well prepared Filet Mignon accompanied with a succulent lobster tail? Oh Yeah!  So of course we had to go pay Fleming's a visit with some good friends.  We go to Fleming's for their steak because they know how to prepare it better than most!  \n\nFor starters we were treated to a warm, rosemary loaf of bread.  The bread was already very good by itself, but the butters were even better.  I don't remember what each butter flavor was but I liked them both.  I preferred the orange (sun dried tomato maybe?) looking one.  The white one had a bit of a feta cheese taste to it.  We quickly polished off our whole loaf of bread.  Shortly after that, our soups and salads arrived, nothing special to write about here.\n\nNext came our steak and lobster.  The server waited while we cut into our steaks to make sure that it was cooked to the precise way we had requested.  My lovely bride's steak was so small it looked as though it was meant to be on a tasting spoon and not part of a surf & turf. The server apologized and was embarrassed he had not noticed it prior to bringing it to our table and quickly sent for another one.  My steak was perfectly cooked, mid-rare but I could have used a bit more seasoning.  The lobster tail was the highlight for my meal. The lobster came out served on top of its tail shell, but then it was removed by the waiter, (as if I could not handle it on my own :-) The lobster was not at all dry, which I worried about.  It was moist, tender, and was pure lobster deliciousness!\n\nAs we dug into our steaks, we were given sides of asparagus and Fleming's potatoes.  I found the asparagus to be seasoned and cooked very well but a bit overly oily.  The Fleming's potatoes were like layers of lasagna, covered in a creamy sauce.  I've never been a big fan of any creamy potato dish, but this was exceptionally good.  \n\nFor the finale we had Chocolate Lava Cake ~ a rich chocolate cake with a hot molten chocolate center, served with vanilla ice cream and sweet crisp wafers. The warm hot molten center with a scoop of the cool vanilla ice cream was the perfect way to end this wonderful meal.\n\nFleming's is a fantastic place to dine for a couple, family or with good friends.  They are a chain, but they know how to cook steak very well and they are consistent. They have an exceptional wine list, which is what I recommend. Their well drinks are a too pricey (vodka & water X 2 = $24) so stick with wine.", "business_id": "9AbyBqGWHYZC73GlyAuTrQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-11-19", "type": "review"}

Seattle, Washington, high school Senior Prom dinner. Yeah...That far back. That location is now closed, but I digress. When I moved to Scottsdale, I was excited immediately because there were multiple Flemings locations. It quickly became my go to special occasion dinner option, as my wife loves it as well. \n\nIn short, the food is phenomenal. I've had multiple cuts of steak there and different preparations and they're all amazing. Last time I had a 6oz Filet that was stuffed with jumbo lump crab...Just let that sink in for a minute. Their sides and salads are also really nicely done, and their wine list and bar is one of the best out there. They also have a very good happy hour which is a pretty well kept secret. It's 5 items for $6 until 7pm Monday through Friday, and they also have $6 glasses of wine and cocktails as well. \n\nObviously the food should be great, but the thing that sets Flemings apart for me is the service and commitment to quality. A brief story, if I may...\n\nIn July of 2011 I made reservations for my wedding anniversary. We got to the restaurant and were seated, everything started out fine. It took longer than usual to get the bread course and to get our order taken, and since it was a Wednesday night it was a little surprising. Everything was taking forever, but the biggest disappointment was the food. I ordered a New York peppercorn steak medium rare. When it came, it was well done. Brown inside and tough...I sent it back and they were apologetic for the mistake. It took nearly 20 minutes for me to get my second steak (my wife was done eating hers by this time), and while it was still overcooked for my liking, it was edible. The rest of the service continued to take way longer than necessary, the waitress wasn't attentive, and at the end of the meal, there was an issue with the bill that took another 15 minutes to resolve. It took nearly 3 hours (and not in a good way) from start to finish, and was not a good dining experience in the least.\n\nI ended up writing Flemings the next day to express my disappointment, because it was a special occasion, and I'd never before been unhappy with the food or service I received. Within 24 hours, I had an email from the President of the company saying that he was very sorry and he'd have the GM of the restaurant reach out to me to amend any issues. The next day I got a call from the GM Mike Head and we chatted for a few minutes about our experience. He too apologized and asked me for my address so he could send something to make it right. Two days later I had a letter with a business card and a note saying \"please call me personally to arrange your next reservation\", along with $150 in gift certificates. I was floored.\n\nWe've since returned a few times, and the food and service was back to it's absolute best. You will rarely, if ever, see business done like this, and it's the reason I'm happy to keep Flemings as my special occasion go to.", "business_id": "9AbyBqGWHYZC73GlyAuTrQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-11-02", "type": "review"}

The complimentary bread comes out crusty and hot and the flavored spreads were delicious!  The burrata with heirloom tomatoes and arugula with a balsamic dressing was slightly overdressed, but amazing! The little hint of fresh mint in the dressing takes it over the top!

We both had the rib eye steak, medium rare. The seasoning was good, but the outside wasn't crusted or charred enough. The cut of meat was hard to eat with bite after bite of gristle and too much fat. Overall, just a bad cut of meat!  We used to have a manager's special, a double bone-in rib eye for two (that they no longer have available...not to be confused with the one on the menu) that came out sizzling hot and crusty, and was to die for! They need to bring it back!  Their signature potatoes were good, but came out with the cheese already hardened and cold at the top. Tasted like it was made far in advance and dried out. When I cut into the cheese, the top separated like you'd expect with leftovers. The asparagus was very skinny and so tough I couldn't even cut through them with my steak knife. To their credit, our server was happy to replace it with green beans (which were very good).\n\nOverall, we had a pleasant experience, but the main attraction fell short.

Our dinner consisted a shared plate of calamari, two petite filet with a side of grilled asparagus and sauteed mushroom. \n\nCalamari plate was very big, pre-mixed with the hot n sour (though it says hot and sweet) sauce, not the typical calamari I had tried, especially there were sauteed red pepper, onions and some very sour jalapenos.

We both opted for the petite size, it was perfect for us, very well accompanied by the grilled asparagus and sauteed mushrooms. My medium rare filet came out very nice and juicy.

My wife had eaten here previously and wanted to have dinner there.\n\nShe called for a reervation and was told that the seating was primarily booth seating and could be 'tight' for a party of 8.  Hostess was named Emily.  She suggested 2 booths, we declined.  She then said there was one large table but she could not reserve as it was first come, first served.  Since we were planning to be there at 5 PM, we assumed we could probably get the table due to the early hour.\n\nWhen we arrived, it took 15 minutes for them to show us to our table.  It was a regular booth, judged too small by all of us.  Manager then got involved and showed us to a both that was \"3 inches bigger\".  No more than 3 inches, that's for sure.  We declined as asked about the table.  Manager said, and it was evident from looking, that there was no table.\n\nWhen I said that \"Emily\" told us about a table the day before on the phone, she denied it.  Emily apparently has trouble with the truth.\n\nWe declined to eat at the restaurant and found another venue across the street.  After all, Scottsdale has lots of good restaurants.\n\nI see that the other Houston's in Phoenix is now closed.  I don't doubt that the Scottsdale location will still follow due to their lack of customer service and inability to seat more than 4 people for dinner.  \n\nWill never return. We found J. Alexander's right across the street.  Had everything a good restaurant should-large tables, excellent service, businesslike attitude and good food.", "business_id": "jBb5KHHAj4s8hcXVS6QXDg", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-09-24", "type": "review"}

I went there with two co-workers while I was in Arizona for business. We all couldn't resist the temptation of the cheeseburger. Mine was cooked and seasoned to perfection, and the portion was huge. The fries were kind of like shoe string ones and very thin, which is why I knocked a star off the top. I prefer big steak fries.\n\nThe beer list was pretty impressive too. I had a Pacifico and a Heineken Light while we were there.\n\nOne warning, the prices can be a little steep. A cheeseburger is $14 and it was the cheapest thing on the menu.

My friend next to me order the Pork Beef Ribs and we decided to tag team -- we felt like we were eating a whole animal. The Pale Ale swished all excess down nicely.

Probably my favorite Caesar salad right now, great sides and their burgers and ribs are amazing.\n\nLast night, I had the Hickory burger and a caesar, while my wife had a salad and a baked potato. Both of us thoroughly enjoyed our meals, and the service was impeccable.  Seems like the service really sets Houston's apart from a lot of other restaurants. My water glass would be close to empty, and then all of a sudden I'd look over and it would be full...They must hire food and water ninjas that sneak up on you and provide great service. I'm not complaining.\n\nI've yet to order a steak there, but I hear they're good. There are a lot of other places that I'd rather order a steak though, so I think I'll stick to my standbys.  \n\n4 stars because it's always a wait...Always. I know, I know, it's not Houston's fault, it's the fault of the country club snowbirds that park their range rovers and make me jealous that I don't have that kind of money. Kidding...Sort of. Seriously though, if you go on a Wednesday at 4:30pm, expect to wait 10 minutes. Lunch can be a 15-20 minute wait usually and peak dinner times can be 30-45 minutes. Houston's does take reservations, so if you're planning on going there for dinner, it's best to call at least an hour ahead and make a reservation. \n\nIf you've yet to dine at Houston's, do it ASAP. If you haven't been in a while, go back. Highly recommend.", "business_id": "jBb5KHHAj4s8hcXVS6QXDg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-11-24", "type": "review"}

We were greeted and seated immediately. We started with a couple cocktails: martini for me, Manhattan for my mom. Our server was very nice and respectful of our request to catch up over our drinks. \nFor old time sake, I had to go for the Chicago-Style Spinach Dip. I do wish they had a better selection of starter. It's between the dip and some smoked salmon thing. Talk about limited ...\nFor our entrees, we went for salads: Ahi Tuna for me and Thai Noodle for my mom. Both came out perfectly prepared and timed. We also switched to wine with our entree salads. The wine list is nice, high quality selections. Something for everyone. \nI'm not the biggest chain restaurant fan, but Houston's does it right.
