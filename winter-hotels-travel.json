I was desperate for a place under $70/night.  I  AM NOT A PICKY PERSON!  I was homeless in Texas for 3 months on the streets once.   Life has turned around for me since then.  \n\nThe Avalon motel is a sesspool of filfth and disease. I am NOT exaggerating!  HOW IN HELL DID THIS PLACE PASS A HEALTH INSPECTION. BULL!   I checked in at 8pm on a thursday night.  Got my key, and walked in. LOOKED HORRIFYING, But what the hell.  I was tired and just needed a warm half clean bed to sleep in.  I peeled back the sheets and noticed tons of little black spots on the pillows and sheets.  The closer I looked I realized there were tiny smears of blood all over the sheets, too.  That alarmed me because those are sure signs of bed bugs.  So I peeled back the fitted sheet and OMG!!!!  Dead dried bed bug carcasses, bed bug poop, blood splotches all lined the entire length of the mattress.  not exaggerating.\n\nI had the misfortune of living in an apartment building once that became infested with bed bugs after I bought a used mattress off Craigslist.  IT WAS HELL getting rid of them- even after throwing the mattress out.  If ONE EGG gets on your property, your done.  Every night you will go to bed and be unable to fall asleep because you feel them crawling on you. Once you finally DO manage to fall asleep you will wake up the next morning to dozens of bites all over your body that can inflame into the size of dimes and ooze puss.  They itch bad and take Weeks to dissappear.\n\nAS SOON AS I saw the bed bugs (5 minutes after entering the room) I went back to the clerk and kindly demanded my money back on grounds that the room was not up to health code.  I could put up with the other deplorable disgusting repulsive problems with the room, but I DREW THE LINE AT SLEEPING WITH LIVE PARASITES IN MY BED.    WTF.\n\nI begged for my money back and explained that proir to check in I only had $100 in my bank account and spent half of it on the room and did not have enough money left to go to another hotel.  And asked repeatedly to PLEASE get my money back for a room that I had NOT EVEN USED and JUST purchased 10 minuted prior. The clerk refused and toted their beloved \"Health Department Approval Certificate\"  how in the hell they got it---I dont know.  Had to be fake.   She called me a liar and said there were no bed bugs and no one else has complained.  I practically begged her to walk to the room with me so I could show her the obvious HUNDREDS of bed bugs infesting the entire room.  Her response?  .....\"  Oh Im not going out there, its cold! \"  .....These are the kind of people were dealing with folks. And she  proudly kept my $50 and said I was welcome to go sleep in my car in the 6 degree weather.  Disgusting people who live to cheat citizens out of their money. The epitome of whats wrong with the world.  Very SAD,   Oh yeah..... so, don't stay here.", "business_id": "dEuJ4A6v1lUDKF8wWwxy_w", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-02-19", "type": "review"}

We found the rollaway we had requested (and paid for) not present, and I went back down to the old gentleman. He stared at me and then went back to pecking at his computer. I waited. Suddenly he looked up at me and started yelling, something to the effect that there wasn't anything that he could do, and that he would see if someone could do something but probably not. He also angrily admitted that the reservation did show the rollaway.\n\nI slunk away with my guest who had by now come down, too, embarrassed and insulted. It shouldn't be this way. If this is personalized service, I'd rather stay at a motel.\n\nEven without grumpy old man, there's nothing special about this place. The rooms were ok, but the bathrooms tiny (I guess they should be called showerrooms). Everything else was sub-par. The dining room breakfast was served in was tacky and the coffee awful. We did not dare try the free wine. The hotel is in a bad neighborhood.\n\nFor the money, find a special at the William Penn on the Omni Hotels website.

The hotel is right across the street from a housing project. There isn't enough parking, especially if The Grand Hall is hosting a wedding when you arrive.

However, the headboard was only loosely connected to the bed and - well, let's just say noisy.\n\nWe only stayed one night, so can't expand too much.

The hotel is located across the street from a housing authority building.  Projects?  UGH.  Great.  \n\nThen we were put into a \"historical\" room that was similar to that of a rundown cheap apartment-- old shower stall, moldy threadbare carpeting, lumpy squeaky bed.  \n\nI find out an hour later (after freaking out about the lo-end aspect of this room) that they have new rooms that were just recently renovated.  I asked to see the room, and then ultimately change to that room-- for a fee, of course.  About 50% more expensive.  But I pay more because NO WAY would I be able to exist in this old \"historical\" creepy room.  \n\nFinally, a regular room-- the \"renovated\" room was similar to that of an acceptable hotel room.  Why even keep this historical, old, dingy, dirty room?  Do they figure unsuspecting people who don't know any better will just accept it b/c they have no other choice?? \n\nI slept well in the \"new\" renovated room, and would have been freaked out all night in the old room. What a difference. Actually, the bed and linens were very, very comfortable.  The bathroom was nice and clean.  The room was what I expected a hotel room to be... not high end four seasons, but not cheap and nasty either. \n\nThe hotel obviously had availabilities of the new, renovated rooms, so why put us in an old, unrenovated, ugly old apartment looking room? If they believed in upgrading, then they would have at least gotten repeat business!! For those who are going to book here, pay more for the new rooms, or go somewhere else.  The option of staying in the old room should not be an option at all.  \n\nI don't think I will ever go back here if I ever go back to Pittsburgh.

I had to grab cash a couple of different times just to make sure I could keep paying fares throughout the days.\n\nThere's no day pass. Boo.

Can you have degrees of hate...well apparently you can and in this contest the Port Authority wins out marginally - which is why it gets 2 stars rather than 1.\n\nI should clarify, I hate the bus system but don't mind the trolley or \"T\".  But unfortunately, I've been destined to live in an area which only has bus trasport so I've been trying to manage and I'm so fed up with the constant delays and no-shows of the bus I try to take to and from the city.\n\nI have the option to take the G3 or 28X to get to and from the city in a reasonable amount of time.  There are other bus options but from my research they take well over an hour to get to and from the city to the Robinson area.  The G3 and 28X are the only \"express\" options.\n\nThe G3 has been very reliable in my experience but the timings are a bit inconvenient.  They operate from 5 AM something to a little after 8 AM and then resume around 3:00 PM until 7:00 PM during the weekdays only.  So if I need to get a bus after 8:00 AM or before 3:00 PM then this option is out so I have to rely on the 28X.\n\nThe 28X in my experience is constantly delayed or just does't show up and I make use of the schedule and the TrueTime app.  You would think that a bus that runs every 30 minutes could get it together and show up at least within 5-10 minutes of it's supposed scheduled time.  On most days, I wait over 20 minutes sometimes even 40 minutes and most of the time I'm at one of the first stops!  \n\nI wish there was a better transit option in the Pittsburgh area or the infrastrucure of the city (roads, parking, etc.) was improved...I feel like I'm stuck in between a rock and a hard place.", "business_id": "1n0n_-Iz0e3iVpH8sereiA", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-01-15", "type": "review"}

But I would rather Yelp about it and people know rather than it goes unnoticed.  More on that later in the review. \n\nI booked this stay about two months prior to me showing up on New Year's Eve.  Check it went fairly smooth with a little bump.  I forgot one of my IDs in my car and could not be checked in until after I had that ID in hand.  After walking back to my car I returned and everything went smoothly afterwards.  Kudos to the front desk staff for allowing me to leave my bag there instead of having to drag it back to my car and back to the hotel.\n\nThe room itself gave the impression that it was huge.  As several people have already stated, the ceiling were very high.  I was lucky enough to have a front facing room that looked out over Penn Ave.  I kind of loved this as I could watch the New Year's Eve parade from my room and save myself from the freezing temps outside.  However, you could tell that this was an older building as the floors creaked as I walked around the room.  I could also hear the person above as they walked about.  The beds were comfortable and the bathroom was very clean.  I am not sure how this happened, but I got a handicap room.  So I am assuming that this is why everything felt so spacious in here as well.  Everything about the room screamed modern, from the paint colors to the carpeting.  \n\nNow, to get back to what I was referring to at the beginning; the bad news.  Upon arriving at the hotel and after checking in I decided I needed to take a nap in preparations for the night's festivities.  It was a fairly short nap, roughly about an hour.  When I woke up after my nap and turned on the light, I noticed something crawling across the sheets.  *starts itching*  Yes people, it was what you are thinking, a bedbug.  BEDBUG!  I immediately grabbed a tissue to dispose of the hideous little monster (I know, it did me no good by doing that, it was more of a reflexive response than anything).  I have made contact with Courtyard about this, but have yet to hear back from them on how they are going to rectify the problem.  I felt dirty afterward and moved all of my belongings into the bathroom, on the counter for the remainder of my stay.  I also slept in the other bed (I know, that may have been futile) and with the lights on for the rest of my stay.\n\nOther than that snag, I really have no complaints about this place.  Everything and everyone was pleasant.\n\n*Things to note: there is room service available, valet service, or if you prefer, park in one of the city garages and walk to the hotel, business center, fitness center, ATM and Starbucks available around the clock at the front desk.", "business_id": "uILvDDCgw63_KJsZMO9GvA", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-01-06", "type": "review"}

We like using it to get to Chicago because the schedule isn't that bad--it leaves late at night an arrives early the next morning.  We always get the sleeper car.  When Amtrak is on time, or if it's less than say an hour late, it can be wonderful.  The problem is that Amtrak is at the mercy of the freight railroads that own the tracks. \n\nLast year, according to my husband the train enthusiast, the train was constantly arriving into Chicago 4 to 5 hours late because of extreme frieght train congestion.  We avoided it then, but since then the company that owns the tracks has gotten its act together and its been much better.  It's also nice that your food travels with you and you can get up and stretch your legs when you want to.\n\nAmtrak used to run two trains a day to Chicago and two across Pennsylvania.  Unfortunately, budget cuts a few years ago caused one of these to be cancelled, so it is much less convenient.  Also, the train to Washington, DC leaves Pittsburgh in the wee hours of the morning.\n\nOne thing I like is that Amtrak, upon 24 hours notice, will provide refridgeration or ice for my insulin.  If you are a \"special needs\" traveller, they can usually accomodate you with advanced notice.  One other tip.  If you are using Amtrak, you can actually check your trains' on-time record using the website.  You can see which trains have good on-time records and which don't (and believe my husband when he says it varies from route to route).

We got a very good rate on Hotwire--otherwise I don't think we would have been able to stay here. Although the hotel was very comfortable and in a good location, we could hear every noise from the hallway and adjacent rooms (including the bathroom). I was sitting up in bed reading, and every time the people next door closed a drawer in their bureau the whole headboard would shake.\n\nParking was also expensive. We needed to use the car several times during our stay, so we had to valet park, which was over $20/day (plus tips each time we picked up or dropped off the car).\n\nThe coffee shop attached to the hotel is just OK. The breakfast/lunch place was not very good. You will probably have to venture a bit to find affordable and good quality food (other than the hotel restaurant, which I can't comment on because we did not eat there given the high prices).\n\nOne perk--the hotel does offer free internet, but it is a low bandwidth version. We didn't need the internet for work or anything so it was hard to justify paying for the high speed, so we used the free version. It gets the job done for email and web browsing, but it does not stream videos well.\n\nThe bed was comfortable and the shower head was very good. I agree with other reviewers that the amenities were not as nice as I have seen in other Westins--no bathrobe, room service menu not as good, staff not quite as helpful. Also, because it is a green hotel, they will be a little stingy about replenishing your towels and toiletries. If you have a lot of people in your room or for some other reason require extra supplies, be sure to request that. We came back after housekeeping to find that they had given us a half-full bottle of shampoo to replace the one we had used.

The room was spacious with plenty of room for the four of us, no crusty stains and pretty clean smell. The bathroom was large with a single sink outside the room so one person could get ready while another showered (or puked their pants off in my case). The room could have used more mirrors to make it a little easier for me and the other girl to get ready without rubbing our butts together at the sink area, but I guess it was fine since I came down with some form of the plague over the weekend and no amount of primping was going to make me look like a respectable human anyway.  \n\nThe area the hotel is in seemed like a pretty central one for happening things and not too terribly far from ish, but their $20 nightly parking fee adds up. We're cheap so we opted to save our wallets from being raped of any Andrew Jackson's and parked at the meters surrounding the Marriott that run from 9-6pm each day. Just remember to set your alarm so you can have your quarters in the meter before the clock strikes 9am EST or you'll end up forking over $20 for a parking violation anyway, and the hipster meter maid man in this area was noticeably diligent. On Sundays the parking on Aiken right across from the Marriott and in front of that church is free, so we made it a point to snag a spot there so we could sleep in on our last day of Pittsburgh-ing. \n\nThey have an indoor pool, free coffee and computers usage in the lobby, free wi-fi throughout the whole hotel and conference rooms should you need that sort of thing for work as well.

On a side note, we didn't leave the party until 2am so this ended up being a stellar idea. The hotel is centrally located, convenient to UPMC Shadyside, CMU,Pitt,etc. We actually walked to and from the party which was right on Walnut Street (the main shopping street in the Shadyside District) and it was only about a 7 minute walk. The parking is valet ONLY (I understand why due to the fact the parking lot could easily be used by non-guests if it wasn't valet), however it's $17.88/day, which in my opinion is a bit steep for Pittsburgh. The lobby is very nice and there is a Starbucks inside as well. I also noticed there is a pool for anyone with kiddies (or anyone that brought a swimsuit!). Customer service at check-in was very friendly, being rewards members we were asked what floor we would like and if we would like a balcony, and we also found out there is a complimentary shuttle that goes at least to Shadyside if not further. \n\nNow when we got to the room, it was, well, average. We had a king size bed, a tiny sofa and coffee table, a flatscreen tv. We were not going to be using the room really so the fact it was not as nice as other hotels we have recently stayed in was ok. There was free wifi in the room which is always a plus. Another drawback in my opinion was the fact that the sink area was outside of the bathroom. It was also a tight squeeze and we had to take turns using that area. A minor, slightly annoying inconvenience was all that was really. Now the other drawback was the price. Our room for one night was $245!!! The room was clearly not a $245/night room nor was the hotel in general. We most recently stayed at a Boutique hotel (The Tudor Arms Doubletree in Cleveland) and that was between $150-$170/night as I recall, and it was MUCH more nicely furnished and with better amenities than the Courtyard. Now because we agreed to split this $245, I wasn't as astonished about the price, however, this is Pittsburgh, one night at the Courtyard should NOT be $245! I am doubting I will have a need to stay here again in the future, however, it is important to note they are building a Hilton right across the street from the Courtyard so possibly there will be some price competition when that opens and anyone in the future does not need to pay an arm and a leg to stay here.", "business_id": "DiPbxquQQHSgz123I27Drg", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-12-22", "type": "review"}

We were there for just one night, and overall the accommodations appear quite pleasant. \n\nFor starters, we arrived at the office to check in and the gentleman in the office was on the phone. Although we stood there for at least five minutes while he finished, he never made any attempt to look at us, or indicate that he would be with us as soon as possible. As we waited, several other staff people passed us in the office, and never acknowledged our presence. When he finally got off the phone, he was very pleasant, but never even acknowledged the fact that we had been standing there waiting.  \n\nEven though it was almost 1p, we were told that our room was not yet ready, and that it might not be available until 4p, which was the \"guaranteed check in time.\"  I indicated that we had been on the road for hours and we had an important function that evening, before which we really had hoped to catch a short nap. I asked if he could please get us a clean room as soon as possible, and he said that he could call us when the room was ready. To their credit, they did call us within about 90 minutes.\n\nOur room was essentially a small studio apartment, with a bedroom/sitting room, kitchenette and bathroom.  When we entered we were practically assaulted by an overwhelmingly strong smell of some sort of floor or room cleaner - perhaps an artificial lavender scent - so strong it was like walking into a Bath & Body Works.  Almost immediately my partner developed a bad head ache and we had to leave the door open for about 20 minutes to air it out.  Though the scent diminished a little, it remained strong for the duration of our stay.\n\nThe furniture was modern and the room well laid out.  It included an open wifi network, a rather large flat-screen tv connected to basic cable, a queen sized bed, a large arm chair, and a dining table with chairs. There were a few tacky prints on the walls that appeared to have been designed by some Thomas Kinkaide wannabe.\n \nAs it was January, it was rather cold out, and so we sought to turn up the heat, which was provided via an old radiated steam heat system in the bedroom/sitting area.  There was no wall thermostat, so we had to fiddle around with the knob at the base of the radiator, but as anyone who is familiar with those older steam systems, they're touchy and hard to control. There was also a radiator unit in the bathroom, but it didn't work, which meant it was rather chilly when you stepped out of the shower. The entire evening we found ourselves trying to adjust the heat in the main room, and often opening the window just a crack, to compensate for excess heat, or closing it to allow the heat to build up again. It was bad enough that neither of us got a good night's sleep, because we found ourselves either sweating or shivering, and the temperature never evened out.\n\nI had some work to do while we were there, so after dinner, I sat down to use my computer and the wireless network, but at about 10P, the network shut down, and didn't come back.  I called the main office, only to get a voicemail saying that they were closed; there was an emergency number, but I didn't feel that I wanted to go to that trouble.  I kept checking periodically, but the wifi didn't come back that night.  In fact it wasn't on the next morning when I woke at about 7A.  I called the office again, but the same voicemail was still on, and still again at 7:30A and at 8A.  Finally after I got out of the shower at about 8:30A, the wifi was back.\n\nThe final straw occurred as we were leaving. There was no elevator in the old building, so we had to use the stairwell. Apparently someone had mopped the stairs, but good, shortly before we left our room, and they were slippery and wet, but we were not aware of this, as there was not \"Caution Wet Floor\" sign, and the stairwell was not illuminated enough to be able to see quite how wet the floor was.  As a result, on the very first step down, my foot slid out from under me, and I landed hard on my backside. Fortunately I wasn't hurt, though I did spend several days with soreness afterward. When I stood up, I realized that the floor had been so wet that in the 2 seconds I was on the floor, my jeans were soaked through to my undies.\n\nWhen we got to the office to check out, the same gentleman who checked us in was attending the desk.  He asked how our stay was, and I limited my comments to my recent fall.

Neither was anything special, eggnog had absolutely no taste whatsoever!\n\nThen, the pastries:  we were served a gingerbread cupcake which was fine--nothing like Vanilla Pastry Shop!  A pumpkin torte, again, fine.  And a chocolate mousse/brownie bite with a raspberry and candy cane on top--it was dry as a bone!  It looked as if it was on it's last legs--chocolate was turning white, mouse separated from brownie.

The tea sandwiches, scones and desserts are why I gave the rating of four out of five stars. They were good, but could have been a tad more tasty. I agree with another review on here that the bread on the tea sandwiches was a little stale. We enjoyed the scones, but they could have had a little more flavor to them. And I would have preferred a different dessert choice other than a small heart shaped sugar cookie, which went along with a bite of gingerbread cake and a chocolate truffle. All in all, we went for the experience and the Inn on Negley more than delivered! The innkeepers were there and were very friendly and gracious. We took a tour of the inn, which is one of the original Shadyside mansions, and the rooms were elegant and filled with beautiful antiques.

We were met at the door by the hostess (I presume) who did not take our arrival kindly and seemed annoyed that we were there.\n\nWe shrugged it off and went to the bar.  The bartender was something else and it seemed as if he was on a variety of drugs. He acted as if he was on the last quaaludes in his posession and moved with a subtle grace most often reserved for Miss Universe pageant constestants.  And that's saying something.\n\nThe bartender would disappear for long periods of time, during which we would hear odd sounds coming from the kitchen.  Mostly the sounds of silverware banging around.  It was as if the hostess and bartender were throwing cutlery at each other in attempts to get us to think just what the hell was going on.  We were there for about 2 hours  and during that time saw the bartender a total of 4 times.  Most of the time he was hiding out in the kitchen.  \n\nEven when it came time to get our check, it took about 15 minutes for him to return with my card.\n\nTerrible service that night from an otherwise reputable place.  I have no plans on returning.\n\nI hope this isn't deleted again, and if it is, I will make sure it's well known and will take printed copies of this and put them up around Sunnyledge and use every contact I have to get this printed in the Post Gazette and City Paper.

The interior of the Dunhill is elegant and well-appointed.  The interior bar stays open late, so if you don't feel like freezing your tail off (it was twenty degrees the night we stayed over) you can warm yourself with a bourbon in the lobby.\n\nThe oldest hotel in Charlotte feels old in a good way - it's not outdated or dirty or sketchy or infested with anything but good cheer and southern charm.  The staff is amazing - really amazing and helpful, even for the late arrivals.  This was so refreshing after a very long day of multiple flight connections and shoddy treatment by surly American Airlines staff.\n\nThe price was very reasonable - less than $90 (online special) for one of the nights near Thanksgiving.  The location is perfect should you wish to explore downtown Charlotte - you are smack dab in the heart of things, close to bars, restaurants, and coffeeshops, but far away enough that the noise of the grittier downtown nightclub scene doesn't infringe on your sleeping experience.\n\nSo why the three stars?  \n\nThe bed in our room was the most uncomfortable bed I have ever encountered in my life.  There was a really deep pit in the very middle that kept my husband and I awake all night as we kept fighting our way out of the sunken pit and over to the edge.  There was no relief.  We both have bad backs - I'm actually in physical therapy for mine - and the bed really set our trip off badly, as it re-injured my fragile muscles and caused me to be in pain for the week of Thanksgiving.

Quality of the facility, quality of service, quality of food, value, and location.\n\nWe used the Marriott City Center for our wedding celebration (11/12/11) and Danijela Djukic took care of every single minute detail perfectly and on time.  The chef is great, and if you want to get truly inventive they will work with you.  All of the support staff at the wedding were phenomenal, the servers, bussers, barstaff, front desk, everyone.  Granted, this service wasn't anywhere near free, but compared to any other uptown hotel you cannot beat it.  Throughout all of the planning they took as much off of our hands as they could.  I guess the best thing I can say is they provided pro-active service instead of re-active repair.\n\nThe suites are very nice, we had two for the weekend, one for us and the other we used as a hospitality suite.  Let's not forget the great views too.  Even though we may have been a LITTLE loud, they didn't seem to mind TOO much (I mean come on after the party it's the afterparty).\n\nThe standard rooms are a normal uptown hotel room size, but they are updated, clean and convenient.\n\nThe pool area is clean and is a great place to relax for a bit or stretch your legs on a treadmill. \n\nThe location is perfect.  You are right at the \"heart\" of uptown Charlotte, the intersection of Trade and Tryon.  There are tons of restaurants in every genre in the blocks surrounding the hotel (be certain to try Dandelion Market on 5th - directly behind the hotel).  There are dozens of nightlife venues.  You can walk to Bank of America Stadium (Panthers), Time Warner Cable Arena (Bobcats), the Lynx Light Rail system, the Epicentre, NASCAR hall of fame, and a half dozen museums and culture exhibits.\n\nI cannot say enough about how impressed I was both the weekend of the wedding and throughout the process.  I am a fan and will recommend this to anyone who needs a large venue.", "business_id": "fJ72j9pRjLcRzBA_EhB4-g", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-12-08", "type": "review"}

But, to give them the benefit of the doubt, I'm sure they never thought to ask.\n\nSo, you get where this is going, right?  Walking into the hotel, it smelled stale.  They sent me to a room (on the 8th floor) that smelled totally moldy - I kept wondering if they had been involved in a flood - did Hurricane Sandy hit here?  I thought another room might help.  The second room they sent me to was either occupied, or someone had decided to have their dinner there.  I asked for a third.\n\nRoom three doesn't smell much better.  Again, stale and moldy.  But I finally got it - it's the entire hotel.  The elevators reek from old cigar smoke, and the entire building is permiated by this acrid odor.

I've seen about 10-15 different rooms and we've hung out in the lobby spaces extensively, especially since we tend to start our runs from here on Sundays.\n\nI'm a big fan of this Westin.  As others have mentioned, the lounge is very modern and chic, lots of marble and a really cool Zen fountain running the length of the bar seating area.  The conference rooms are also on two separate floors adjacent to the lobby- great for easy access and they have separate elevator service that runs straight down into the parking garage.\n\nThe restaurant downstairs does a really mean breakfast buffet and their lunch menu is far from an after-thought- tasty grilled flatbreads.\n\nThe rooms are what you expect in any newer Westin- heavenly bed with mainly modern style furniture- clean lines and neutral earth tone colors.  Bathrooms are done in marble with large mirrors and glass enclosed showers.  Here's a hint for you- try to get a room or suite on the ends of the hallways- the showers have an extra window that looks out onto uptown- but the tinted glass makes sure others don't see in.  The square footage in these bathrooms is also quite a bit bigger than a standard room.\n\nI also like the views from any of the upper floors of this hotel.  Due to it's location on the edge of the uptown sky scrapers, rooms that face town have a great ariel view of uptown and/or Panthers Stadium.  But even the rooms facing the opposite direction look out towards the light rail line and South End- on clear days you can see out to Carowinds at the state line.  Really no terrible views here.\n\nMy only downgrade here is for the weekend crowds that flock into this hotel.  Interesting people watching, to say the least, but the circular driveway gets way too crowded at times and entry/exit becomes a  game of trying to move the puzzle pieces around until it all fits.  Parking is also quite expensive unless you have elite status here, but then that's pretty much anywhere in uptown.\n\nExpect larger crowds for the bigger conventions in town as this hotel is literally across the street from the convention center.

The employee stated she would send someone from security up.  A few minutes later, the guitar music briefly stopped.  However, it started up again soon after. Again, we called down to the front desk, explained the issue at hand, & was given the same response. The music continued.  Around 4:15, my boyfriend got out of bed, went downstairs & pleaded for some assistance.  Again, he was told that security would come.  No one came.  Around 4:30 / 4:45 AM, he called the front desk again & was told the issue was \"pending & that meant it was taken care of\". Unfortunately, \"pending\" in normal circumstances does not mean \"taken care of\".  My boyfriend waited at our door to ensure someone was in fact coming to handle this noise complaint.  Finally at around 5 AM, security came, knocked on their door & asked them to \"keep it down\". It was at that point, there was silence.\n\nWas it necessary we had to go through all this?

There was so much lost revenue, last night because I saw a lot of people including my group that just left and went elsewhere to get a drink.\n\nThe main bathroom off the lobby was one of the most disgusting I have encountered.  one stall was roped off with no toilet at all,  there was  a broken bottle in the other shattered all over the floor, no towels, and one had overflowed.  Wouldnt you think they would have an attendant check on the bathroom on occasion.\n\nMy recemendation is step it up Westin,  I assure you I wont be back unless you do..I hope this group considers another venue, want that wants the business, as it seems the westin is not interested..", "business_id": "4nFqPL-glgDm9v7bZptskQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-02-23", "type": "review"}

I must say it was hard to leave! \n\nHotel:\n\nThe Westin is right in Uptown located across from the Convention Center and next to a light rail station, The Epicentre is only a 10-minute walk away (yes, we braved the cold, but it was nice!), and the arena is another few minutes from there. You can pay $25 for valet parking or $18 to self-park (which we did).\n\nThe lobby area was nice, and check-in was smooth. There is a mini-Starbucks there and a gift/sundries shop around the corner. The elevator bank has six elevators, so we didn't have to wait long (except when we ran into the ACN International Convention attendants coming back from the arena!).\n\nRestaurant/Food Service:\n\nWe didn't eat at the restaurant or indulge in food service, but apparently the breakfast buffet isn$25 per person! If you're here on a Sunday like we were, check out Pike's Soda Shop (a five-minute drive away in South End) for their amazing breakfast and breakfast buffet for $8.95 (before 10am--after that it's $13.95, but they add more food).\n\nRoom:\n\nWe booked a corner Superior room on the 23rd floor with gorgeous views of Uptown. It faced north and east, so the sunrise was absolutely beautiful. There is a nice-sized TV, individual thermostat, a desk with chair, an armchair with ottoman, a mini-fridge, and a coffeemaker with Starbucks coffee. They even threw in two free bottles of water (but don't consume the third, or it's $3.95). We didn't hair any noise from neighbors besides one instance of dogs barking (yes, the Westin is pet friendly). If you choose no housekeeping each day you're there (excluding day of departure), you get hooked up with a $5 dining voucher you can keep (or you can exchange that for 500 Starwood points when you check out). We initially had a problem with a non-functioning remote for the TV, but they sent someone up within 15 minutes and took care of it. Also beware that Wifi isn't free, but I believe if you're an SPG member you may not have to pay.\n\nBed:\n\nThe Heavenly Bed definitely lived up to its name! It was extremely comfortable and hard to get out of. The pillows were a little too soft for my taste, but if you love very soft pillows you're in for a treat! The duvet and sheets are comfortable as well. If you have a corner room, be aware there is a window right behind the bed. It wasn't a big deal with the blackout curtains.\n\nBathroom:\n\nThe bathroom was a standard hotel bathroom (no exhaust fan, unfortunately). The Heavenly Shower was awesome! It's both a rainfall-type shower, and there is a nice handheld component to it. My only gripe was the bathtub didn't drain well.\n\nConclusion:\n\nAll in all we had an amazing stay! I highly recommend this hotel. This was our second time staying here, and we will definitely return. :)", "business_id": "4nFqPL-glgDm9v7bZptskQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-02-17", "type": "review"}

He didn't apologize or even acknowledge almost doing it.  We had to slam on our breaks so hard it shifted many things around in the car and screeched the tires.\n\n2)  When checking out of the hotel on Sunday morning, our car (which was a rental car, might I add), had the fresh smell of cigarette smoke in it, as if someone had been smoking and put out their cigarette as they were getting in the car and blew the smoke in the car.  We had to roll the windows down in the very cold weather to get the stench out on the way to the airport.\n\n3)  The same valet man gave us wrong directions to the airport, sending us north of Charlotte.  Luckily, I was somewhat familiar with the area and could tell that we weren't going the right way, and turned us around.  This, however, made me have to get more gas in the car - which we had pre-paid for gas and had it set to deliver it back very close to empty.  Instead, I had to pay for more gas to ensure that we didn't run out because of the 20 miles off track we were.  ALSO, this made us almost miss our flight.  Thankfully, security was moving people fairly fast on Sunday.\n\n4)  When I have tried to contact valet management, I continue to get voicemail.  I tried to speak with one of the hotel managers, but the operator kept sending me to a answering machine.  After a while, I finally told the operator, 'I want to speak to a frigging manager - quit sending me to voicemail!'.  HOWEVER - after saying this, she transferred me to a lady who answered saying - 'Hello - this is one of the F'ING managers - how's your day?' in a very smirky tone.\n\n5)  Finally, after e-mailing the man that continues to ask that people on this site e-mail him directly with their issues about all of this, I never received any sort of reply.", "business_id": "4nFqPL-glgDm9v7bZptskQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-12-23", "type": "review"}

They move us, give us keys to a filthy room.  We bring that up and leave for the day for them to clean it.\n\nWe get back to the room, and I check my bank account and find a significant amount of money missing - $329.  After spending about an hour on the phone with my bank, we trace the charges to the Holiday Inn I am staying at via the card that I have left for incidentals.\n\nDespite prepaying for the room, we've now given the Holiday Inn about $600 for a two-night stay in a $110 / night room.\n\nFurthermore, the banks had closed so I couldn't transfer more money into my checking account until after the weekend.  It wasn't that I didn't have access to cash, but I had financial fraud to deal with on what was supposed to be a fun weekend with the guys.\n\nWhen I bring it up at the front desk, I am immediately given run around.  They pull up my info on their computer, and gasp as they see their error.  The staff wouldn't take ownership of their mistake, they simply blamed a computer error.  I finally get a manger who says he'll deal with the issue, and I don't receive any further communication, as I'm pretty sure he wasn't planning on working during the weekend.\n\nThe next day of my stay I call the front desk again, and demand answers.  This manager was a bit more assertive in handling the issue.  She spent time on the phone with my bank, and then my bank conferenced me in as we searched for a way to overcome Holiday Inn's costly error.\n\nAfter dealing with this issue for about 5 total hours, it becomes apparent that there is no way my money will be returned until after the weekend.  I demand to only pay half of my hotel bill, which is immediately granted.  By then I was tired of dealing with the issue and took their bill reduction as adequate compensation.\n\nUltimately, don't use a debit card to pay for incidentals on a hotel room, because hotel systems may automatically withdraw an egregious amount of funds from your account, which could cash screw you for the weekend.  \n\nAlso, DON'T STAY AT HOLIDAY INNS because the staff and management is comprised of lazy, lying, and incompetent thieves.\n\nThat is all.", "business_id": "Fi5sQxROyTLp5qDuYKz6bQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2008-12-15", "type": "review"}

The staff is very friendly and helpful, the restaurants pretty decent, and the location is great! I've stayed here before and had a good experience so when I came back the second time I expected the same.\nUnfortunately, I had to try three rooms before I found one that worked that didn't have weird stenches! The first one had a very strong musty odor, the second one smelled like rotten curry, and the third was OK.\nAlthough they were very accommodating, this place is seriously lacking on a few fronts. The rooms are a little bit small, which is a problem with most hotels in uptown. The rooftop pool doesn't have a great ambience, but a rather industrial feel. \nBreakfast is not included the way it is in many other Holiday Inn properties. You have to go to the restaurant, which doesn't open until 630 in the morning. If you were here for business, that's a problem. It also cost 15 bucks to eat the breakfast buffet which isn't  anything special. \nThere is some kind of executive lounge, which for some reason I did not qualify for even though I'm an elite IHG rewards member. \nI'm never impressed with fitness centers in hotels, but this one is particularly lacking! You do have the option of paying $10 per day to work out at GoldsGym across the street, but who wants to do that after paying $200+ per night for an average hotel!\nThe parking is a bit wonky, and it isn't very clear how and where to park if you haven't been here before. Unfortunately this is at the corner of two one-way streets so if you miss the turn you have to go several blocks out of your way in order to make it happen. The valets were very nice and helpful, but the whole process seems like a bit of a pain in the ass. You can get your parking validated and placed on your room bill, but why don't they just give you a card like they do at the Hilton? Instead you have to bring your parking pass with you, get it validated at the front desk, and then go to your car.\nAll in all I'm sure he would stay here again, but I will definitely check other places first. I would definitely recommend other properties here in the uptown.", "business_id": "Fi5sQxROyTLp5qDuYKz6bQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-12-15", "type": "review"}

The staff was very helpful and the business center provides free Internet access in case you want to print out your boarding pass without incurring a fee. \n\nThe parking lot was confusing. I am certain that there were more than the 12 spots that I saw when I tried to park. It is my own fault for not following up with the staff to ascertain how to access the other sections of the parking lot, so I won' t hold that against the hotel. \n\nSince I obtained this booking via priceline.com, the rate was very good, probably due to the construction.

I finally got in but then I didn't want to leave again. So I ordered room service seeing as there was not too much around for dinner at 10:00 on Sunday anyway without getting an uber.

Just very nice attention to detail, clean, friendly and helpful staff (I gave numerous generous tips, far more than I typically would).\n\nSo, why 5 stars?  I was here with a colleague for a VERY important business event.  Our booth was shipped to the hotel, along with some VERY expensive electronics.  It was all there, safely stored for me upon arrival.  Our booth case somehow became misplaced.  HUGE WHOOPS!  I thought theft.  The manager and concierge turned the hotel upside down to find it, including security tapes, room keys, and brought in the police.  Turns out, it was delivered to the wrong room (numbers were transposed - could have been my fault) and the guest in the other room didn't report it right away.  But, the staff did an incredible job to resolve it.\n\nAnother reason(s) - we had a number of client meetings and the concierge took EXCELLENT care of us - arranging reservations, transportation, and limo service.\n\nThe rooms were very clean, well attended, and quite comfortable.  Another reviewer mentioned noise - we didn't have any negative experiences from that.  You can see the stadium outside the hotel window but, it's not right next door.  We could certainly here stadium noise outside.  It might be a matter of room selection....\n\nHINT:  whenever making a hotel reservation, be SURE to explicitly ask for a QUIET room.  The staff know which rooms have the most quiet locations.  If you don't ask, they'll put you in any old room.\n\nAlso - price wise - this place was quite reasonable compared to other venues around the convention center.\n\nNote, I was so happy, I am returning for my next trip to Charlotte in March - will provide a review update at that time.", "business_id": "cBoFcjuNaWDQ2MP7GgeSBA", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-02-13", "type": "review"}

It is free to join online.  You will be rewarded at any Omni you stay in, and it will help you become an instant FAN.  \n\n   In our experience, Omni's are often old (often historical) hotels that have excellent service.  Such was our experience here.  \n\n   Pluses: Loved that you have to have a room key to get up the elevator.  Security is a good thing.  Loved the friendly staff from front desk to room service.  Bed was very comfortable, as were our robes.  Truly love the free morning drinks that come with the loyalty program membership.  (see pic) Coffee for Husband, Tea for me, delivered promptly as requested to be delivered with a knock and \"leave it\".  We certainly made sure to call and have gratuity added on, as hopefully everyone does.    It is such a wonderful Omni feature, and the hard-workers that make it happen deserve to be rewarded!  \n\n   Slight negatives:  a bit complicated to order a movie (had to call downstairs and tell them what movie, etc.  Not a big deal, but it would be nice to be able to just do it from the room without involving anyone else)....Musty smell...I do believe it was coming from the piece of furniture that our tv was on.  Especially when we opened the cabinet to get to the fridge, an unpleasant smell wafted out.  One that was also noticed every time we entered the room.\n\n   Am a Priceline gal, and this was a very good \"win\"...really enjoyed our stay!  \n\nNote:  You can't beat this location if you want to be in the center of Downtown!", "business_id": "QThlnQ7AvzZwXHKD5DjdCw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-12-25", "type": "review"}

The ride and total experience was again wonderful, I love Amtrak. However I am focusing my review here on the Amtrak station itself in CLT and my couple of brief interactions there on this trip.\n\nThe platform itself is nice, a large area for boarding and disembarking. A nice ramp takes you down (or up if leaving the depot) from the platform area to the main depot area itself. It seemed a bit dark down in the area from the ramp to the depot though. The staff, as always, nice and helpful. I have not had problems with service.\n\nThe main impression from inside the depot itself is that it does the job. It is a full service depot, as that it is a manned station with staff at the desk. By no means is it run down as in horrible condition, but it seems while it is functional the years have taken a bit of a toll on it. It looks a bit worn and beat up but not run down...maybe it is time for a little revamping or major clean up. There are seats in the waiting area but it appears to be a bit small for serving an area such as CLT. The parking lot is showing its age as well but there appears to be plenty of parking available, a plus.\n\nI noticed there were many people coming down on the train to go to the home Panthers game (I rode down on a Sunday)...what a great idea! They even have a bus ready at the depot for fans to take them to the game area and then back to catch the train out, I think the price for the bus is only around $1.75 a trip, which is a great deal to me and no driving, woot! \n\nIn all, the Charlotte Amtrak depot does the job. Maybe it needs a bit of sprucing up, but it certainly is functional.

Presences by Delta, United, American Airlines is also noted.

I would probably agree.  However, in comparing it with all the other airports that I have flown through in the past few years Charlotte-Douglas continues to be a pleasurable stress free place to connect.  I connect through here often and choose it (if I can) over other places to connect through.  What makes it so nice?  Well I have tried to sum it up like this:\n\n1 The people:  Maybe it's the South.  I don't know.  But the people here all seem to be pretty nice, even the people at customs.  I was in an awful mood the last time I went through customs here and the lady that checked me through was just so super nice and cool it really made what can be a traumatizing experience (IE Dulles) a pleasurable one.  Everybody just seems to have taken their happy pills or something.  I never have one of those rude traveler encounters here ever.  The food service people and airport staff all seem to be very nice as well.  They are efficient and quick but they have this laid back calm friendly vibe that is nice to be around.\n\n2  The building itself:  This airport is relatively new.  It is clean and well designed and gets a lot a light.  The central food court area is nicely arranged and there is plenty of seating.  There are rocking chairs to sit where you can enjoy (what I think is free) wi-fi.  There are ample outlets everywhere to plug in your computer too. [If you don't have a computer you can rent one.] There is TONS of NATURAL LIGHT in this main area as well.   It really is quite pleasant when you compare it to most other airports on the planet.\n\n3. Getting around is super easy on the people movers that go everywhere.  They have them any time there is a long distance that you would have to walk.  Outstanding!\n\n4 Lot's of Air Clubs\n\n5 They have a Jamba Juice!!!\n\nWhat more could you want from an airport (that you could realistically end up getting)?", "business_id": "3Q0QQPnHcJuX1DLCL9G9Cg", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-12-11", "type": "review"}

Pretty amazing with all those people thumping, thomping and thudging though it. \n\nThe inside of the the airport is actually fun to explore and walk around, with line of trees, some very cool rocking chairs and little airplanes hanging overhead. Lots of corners to hang out in and plenty of little restaurants and shops scattered about. Even a people mover and escalators to play on although the things move too slowly to really have fun on. \n\nSure it's an airport and everyone is in a hurry, some people are grumpy and the typical airport chaos does happen, but overall the folks I have meet here were are friendly and very hospitable. A nice contrast to the abrupt hostility sometimes found in employees of other airports. I'm always happy to see that my flight has a stop over in Charlotte- Douglas because I know I can have fun and will have no trouble killing a few hours here while waiting for another flight.

You can also park across from the airport in the lot there for $16/day (I think) and walk across the street to the airport. On your return home, you'll find the shuttles outside of baggage claim in the middle island.  Look for the white shuttle buses and find the shuttle marked \"Long Term A\", \"Long Term B\" or \"Daily\" to take you back to your vehicle.\n\nInside the airport, ticketing is on the top level.  If the airport is crowded, go to the ends to go through security. Checkpoint A is usually a bit less crowded, and checkpoint D/E is usually never crowded. This will save you a few minutes of standing in line.\n\nAfter security, you'll find the middle of the airport has the food court, ATM's, a few shops and the infamous rocking chairs. If you need to power up and have some time, there's outlets near the rocking chairs. For food, I'd recommend the Carolina BBQ- its not the best in the area but is a better option than the other fast food joints. Enjoy your fried pickle!\n\nIf you need a coffee, there's Starbucks on both sides of the central area of the airport and there's one in the Gate C area.\n\nThe US Airways lounge is between the Gate C and Gate D/E concourses and you can enter/leave on either side.\n\nIf you need someone to pick you up, have them wait in the Cell Lot. Once you alert them its only 2 minutes or so until you'll see them outside of Baggage Claim.\n\nAs far as airports go, Charlotte Douglas is probably one of the nicer ones you'll visit. If you have some time to kill, roam around a bit and enjoy the shops or just relax in a rocking chair and watch the world go by.", "business_id": "3Q0QQPnHcJuX1DLCL9G9Cg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-02-05", "type": "review"}

I thought I may have been imaging how busy the airport is just due to being impatient, but it is one of the busiest in the US.  After Chiquita decided to moved their HQ to Charlotte because of more flights, I looked it up.  Charlotte is the 7th busiest airport in the US for scheduled flights and 17th busiest US airport based on passenger traffic.  It is definitely not a sleepy southern airport and it can get hectic.  I arrived for a 7am weekend flight, had to park a good distance away and take a shuttle in to the terminal.  The long term perking was cheap at $4 a day.  \n\nUpon being dropped off in front of the terminal, I checked my bag with the skycap which was quick and painless.  I did what I always did which is walk to the least busy checkpoint.  The Charlotte airport is still not very big, so all gates and concourses can be accessed easily from any checkpoint.  The main checkpoint had a very long line as usual.  Charlotte has the body scanners so you will need to remove EVERYTHING from your pockets, including your wallet and any paper.The concourses were also busy, and the gates were crowded with passengers - mostly transplants going to Buffalo, Philly,NYC but a few going to places like Florida.   \n\nThere are some nice food options here, but the only thing I have ever bought here is Jamba Juice.  I used to think it was better than Smoothie King and wanted other accessible locations in Charlotte, but the smoothie I got this time wasn't very good so I am happy with Smoothie King.\n\nAfter I landed in Buffalo, the airport there was surprisingly calm, and was also calm when I left.  Charlotte's airport is reflective of what the city is today - no longer a slow southern city but rather a fast paced city with people in a hurry to get everywhere.  The city of Buffalo itself had a much slower pace than Charlotte with a lot less traffic.  It took no longer than 20 minutes to get anywhere - even to the outer burbs.  When returning, there were at least a dozen TSA agents at BUF doing nothing, so each person was  able to get into their own line.\n\nCLT is definitely a nice airport, but don't let those rocking chairs fool you.

I've been stuck here many a-times between domestic and international layovers.  The layout is pretty easy to understand - you do have to walk a lot between terminals so wear comfy shoes and have good wheels on your suitcase.  Most if not all the terminals are connected via walking so you don't need to catch a shuttle. However this means you are walking a lot - as I said above.\n\nThe main hub area that connects a lot of the terminals together has a good selection of restaurants.  I've hung out there a few times - once during my layover in 2005 from Nicaragua where I watched the Superbowl at a Chili's or something similar.  There are definitely a few vegan options around for food.\n\nThere are some good stores for shopping too if you have more time to kill after that first or second Bloody Mary.\n\nIt's not the best airport but it's pretty good as far as navigation, food quality and choices, and cleanliness goes.", "business_id": "3Q0QQPnHcJuX1DLCL9G9Cg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-01-04", "type": "review"}

The center court in the middle is best known for its cluster of shoppes, restaurants and (best loved) row of white rocking chairs that ironically back up to the people-mover walkways.  People watching, alone, is worth the price of admission and the vast open space feels busy and energetic during prime time, but never stuffy.\n\nE Terminal is they newest and definitely feels so. If you fly international from Charlotte, you will be there.  Seems there is a bigger selection of stores here but all terminals have some options.\n\nFor those parking at Charlotte, you've got the usual choices of hourly, daily, long-tern and remote- each with successive price decreases but increasing distances from the terminal.  A flurry of busses constantly circuits from the lots to the terminal and, unless you arrive late at night, are plentiful and well-marked.  After hours we have much better success contacting an airport employee to let them know which bus we fare looking for.  Just remember where you park- long term one is very different from long term 2!\n\nFor those wanting a higher level of service, there is also terminal level valet and business valet.  While I get the convenience of pulling up to the terminal and dropping off they keys, I do not understand the business valet- it is further away than remote parking and you still have to ride a bus.  Yes, they will change your oil and clean the car (for an additional price) but the premium you pay here does not justify the product.  My advice: skip business valet entirely.\n\nOtherwise, CLT is a typical airport but modern, clean, and open enough to make your time there easier to enjoy.", "business_id": "3Q0QQPnHcJuX1DLCL9G9Cg", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-01-08", "type": "review"}

Yeah.. no specific information, just delays. Little did we know it would get worse..\n\nWe arrive in Charlotte with 45 minutes to get off the plane, collect our luggage, recheck our luggage,  go through security and board before our connecting flight takes off. It's one crazy mad dash which we amazingly make in time but not before the a$$holes at security deliberately pick out all of those in rush and send us through the full body scanner! Pi$$ed off is an understatement. Should we have had time we would have told them ''hell no!''. I guess they have targets to hit and knew we really had no choice - it was go through or miss our flight. Or so we thought..\n\nAfter the sprint through the airport and board the plane with minutes spare we got told the flight would then be delayed at least an hour. The pilot said it could be 2-3 due to ''bad weather in San Francisco'' but would see if he could get the time down.\nReally? There was no bad weather in San Francisco. Apart from being a bit cold it was actually a very still and fog free night (I checked on my cell). Passing the blame for the airport effing up is not cool. \n\nAn hour went by and it's declared we're ok for take off but then proceed to sit on the runway for almost another hour! I don't know what the problem was but they didn't even bother to tell us, it's like they had just given up trying to make excuses. \nWe finally got back to SFO almost 2 and a half hours later than we were meant to thanx to whatever issues Charlotte were clearly having that night.\n\nOne bad experience out of 4 or 5 isn't so bad though, generally the airport is pretty good. \nSeating in the terminals is ample but the chairs are not so comfortable so I recommend heading to the center of the airport where all the terminals meet. That's where they keep the comfy rocking chairs and where all the eateries and shops are. Places to eat include Chilis, Burger King, Papa Johns and Pinkberry.\nRestrooms here are nice too and is one of the few airports I have visited that still have assistants.

My favorite is the sushi spot in the main food court area, it's an awesome spot for people watching.

I've spent the past 2.5 years flying out of my little puddle-jumper airport of TVC and although lovely, new, small and clean, it basically just flies to Detroit and Chicago (and other places nobody goes, like Ohio)- so I'm thrilled to be living in CLT for a bit and have a real, actual, international airport.\n\nI flew in a couple of weeks ago and flew out yesterday- only to fly back on Friday to return to Charlotte. No complains during my arrival- luggage came relatively quick and my boyfriend illegally parked to pick me up with no problems at all. Hooray for illegal parking.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised to find myself qualified for \"TSA pre-check\" or whatever during my Tuesday morning departure, which was great since I didn't have to take off my shoes, coat, or take out my laptop. Apparently I am a \"low risk\" traveler, maybe because I never beep when I go through security, fly several times every month or two and am a tiny blonde female. Who really knows.\n\nIn any case, security was a breeze and I quickly found my gate, right next to a couple of restaurants. I passed a Starbucks and other various breakfast spots on my way there, but was glad to find a breakfast sandwich place right next to where I was flying out of. Don't you hate when you find your gate and then realize all the good coffee and food spots are way way down the concourse? Me too.\n\nI like this airport. It's not crazy big like ORD, it isn't spread out ridiculously like DTW and is not filthy like LGA. I think it's safe to say Charlotte Douglas is a little gem in the south east- not to mention only 10-15 minutes away from my current place.\n\nKnocking a star because everyone keeps talking about free Wifi, but I couldn't connect.

It's the biggest airport in North and South Carolina, so it offers the most options when it comes to flights.  This typically means lower airfare, more scheduling flexibility, and a larger number of non-stop flights.  CLT to SFO, FTW.\n\nGrowing up in High Point, our family's \"home\" airport was naturally Greensboro's Piedmont Triad International Airport (PTI).  It's a fine airport if you're making a short regional/east coast trip.  However, more often than not, you will have to connect somewhere if your itinerary originates or ends at PTI.  That can be an inconvenience.\n\nMore often these days, if flying into or out of North Carolina and trying to get to the Triad, we'll bypass PTI altogether and instead use CLT (and in some instances, RDU - Raleigh/Durham International Airport).  The less-than-1.5-hour drive from the Triad to CLT is worth the time savings and hassle of having to connect in Chicago, DC, Dallas, Houston, etc.\n\nCurrently, the Charlotte airport is in the midst of major expansion/renovation.  Passenger traffic is growing and the airport is trying to keep up.  While the airport is a hub for US Airways, it still feels relatively small.  No need for people movers.  You can walk in a straight line and cover all the terminals in a short amount of time.  This is good and bad - no need to navigate/walk long distances, but when it's packed, it's packed (not a whole lot of space).  There are multiple security checkpoints and you can easily go from one to another to find shorter lines.\n\nThe airport has many years on it, but it's well maintained and feels comparatively modern and clean.  One of the best things about Charlotte's airport are the inexpensive parking fees.  Unfortunately, parking fees will be increasing soon, but will remain at reasonable levels.  Long-term lots will increase to $7 a day from $5 a day and daily parking will increase to $10 a day from $7 a day.  The hourly deck and valet prices are set to increase too.  All parking at CLT requires shuttle access to the terminals.\n\nOverall, Charlotte Douglas is a solid airport for the Carolinas.", "business_id": "3Q0QQPnHcJuX1DLCL9G9Cg", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-02-08", "type": "review"}

The food options at CLT are also very good, and it helps to have a Starbucks in each concourse. \n\nThe only down-side about CLT is that, since it's all one large terminal, you have to do a lot of walking if you're coming off a flight in one concourse and headed to a connection in another.

Big, white wooden rocking chairs are everywhere, which is such a nice, Southern touch.\n\nThe restrooms are so clean, and have attendants at all times.  \n\nThe ends of the concourses where there are multiple gates can get very crowded near boarding.

My experience is based entirely on what happens after you go through security or while you're wandering around waiting on your next flight.\n\nFirst, if you're flying out of the E gates, stop reading this review and start walking now. Seriously.. even if you aren't flying out for 2 weeks, you better start walking now because it takes FOREVER to get there, especially if you're walking there from the A concourse. Your best bet is to start limping and find one of the hospitality golf carts (you can't miss them.. just listen for the annoying beeping sound) and look pitiful enough until they pick you up. Do this and you just might make your flight afterall.\n\nThe airport has a really nice central area with a food court, shops and a sit down Chili's. I typically head over to the BBQ place in the food court and grab a beef brisket sandwich, fried okra and a fried pickle spear, but if I have enough time, the Chili's isn't bad. There's a guy in the food court that plays piano in the evenings, and you can sit in one of the rockers and listen to him while people watching - or turn your chair around and watch the US Airways planes on the ramp.\n\nThis really is one of my favorite airports to connect through. It's small enough that you can wander around a bit unless you're going out of E.. and if you are, what are you doing still reading?! You're going to miss your flight.

The lack of a tram is also a real problem. The near constant beeping of golf carts is utterly unacceptable. Finally, it is unbelievably congested. I should not have to walk down a concourse and run into clueless travelers and get run over by beeping golf cars carrying the myriad old people who frequent this hellacious airport.

Absolutely worst customer service for a hotel EVER! With the winter storm hitting the east coast, our flight delayed, and since we knew we were going to get in late, we contacted the hotel to inform them and asked if the shuttle would still come pick us up. Marie answered the phone and reassured us that they would absolutely send the shuttle out to pick us up from the airport, just to call when we land. We landed a few minutes past midnight, and we contacted the hotel again asking if the shuttle could pick us up. This time, however, we were told quite rudely by Leslie the shuttle stops running at midnight and if we wanted to get to the hotel, we would have to take a cab... Why the policy/story/rules changed so quickly, I'm not sure, but I hope the manager, Bill, is reading this so you can appropriately train your staff members as to not give customers misleading information. \n\nWe arrive and go to the front desk to check in and we're \"greeted\" by Leslie with a rude attitude as if we were inconveniencing her as now she had to check us in... Imagine that -- As a front desk staff member at a hotel, you actually have to check people into their rooms!!! Preposterous! We gave her our reservation numbers (note the \"s\" indicating that we were to have more than one room), and very matter-of-factly she states that there is only one reservation and proceeded to check us in. Our group discussed among ourselves what we should do -- if we should get a last-minute room where they rape you on the prices, or if we should just all share the one room, and we decided to all share one room. Well, Leslie checks us into a master bedroom suite and proceeds to tell us our amenities. I asked her how she proposes 3 people sleep in one bed... to which she just shrugged her shoulders. I asked if she had another room available as my original reservations had 2 double beds, and with an attitude and annoyance, huffing and puffing, she states she can put us in a room with double beds. We accepted the room, thanked her and went to our room.\n\nWhen we walked in, the room looked like it was in mid-contruction. The carpet was pulled off the ground, the wall was newly patched with drywall and painted two different colors, the bathroom looked like someone tinkled all over the floor and it hadn't been cleaned in months, and there was literally an inch of dust on the furniture, which was extremely outdated. (I took a few pics so there's no he-said, she-said). This was the last straw... We went downstairs to ask if there were any other rooms available. Leslie was once again annoyed with our presence and began giving us pricing for a room and stated we would have to get another room (again, the logic behind this -- there is none). \n\nWell we kept the room with two double beds, and decided we would make the best of it as it was a one-night stay... Worst hotel experience I've ever had! Not to mention, in the morning we asked to speak with the hotel manager, Bill, and informed him of the terrible customer service and unacceptable room conditions, to which he just nodded and apologized. He stated he would issue us a refund as the room that Leslie gave us required repairs and was not even supposed to have been occupied at all... Unbelievable! I'm still waiting for my refund on this stay... and I will make sure I will NEVER stay here again. Hard to believe they're in the same chain of hotels where I've had amazing experiences.

I had paid in full for a economy car @ $12.99 per day. Got to the counter and he told me he was giving me a car with more leg room. No mention of an upgrade cost. I thanked him and mentioned i get upgraded often because they do not have the car I have paid for. The upgrade cost for the next bigger size car was $10 per day, almost a 100% up charge. I was never shown anything of told about the $10 per day charge. He printed up the paperwork, folded it up and put it in a folder and wrote the space number on the outside. The next morning I got an alert that my AMEX card was charged $304. I then looked inside the folder and saw the additional charge of $10 per day upgrade charge. I immediately called the 800 number and was told he could do nothing while I still had the car, but would have someone from the corporate office call me back. That never happened...The next day I called and was told I had to call the location where i rented the car. Over the next 2 days I call the airport location 8 times, never had someone answer the phone, and i left a message to please call me. no body ever called me. I then called the 800 number again and got a lady from ???? country. And she told me I had to take the car back to where I rented it. 3 hours away, or take it to a local office that has an economy car. I asked if she could tell me if one of the 4 locations within an hour of me had an economy car and she said she could not and it was my responsibility to look up the locations and call each one to find out if they had a car. I spent 45 minutes doing that and none had an economy car. I called the 800 number got someone from ?????? country and asked a very specific question. Is there anyone at hertz I could talk to that had the authority to help me,,,and was told NO,,,I asked again and was told NO I had to deal with the office i rented from. When I returned my car to the airport it was 4:45 am and my flight left at 6 am. I was told no one would be at the counter until 5:30. My plane was boarding at 5:30 so that would not work. I called hertz when i got home and told my long story to a lady and she said that she could only give me a 50% refund. I told her i was going to file a dispute with AMEX and she said if i did that i might have a problem renting from hertz again. I told her there are plenty of other car rental companies and I would not be using hertz again...Soooooooooooooooooo if you are ever upgrade and they make it sound like they are doing you a favor ask if you are being charged for the courtesy upgrade and ask to see paperwork before you sign anything....Sorry for the long story....I left out some more phone calls talking to people that could do nothing to help....", "business_id": "eThu9hCL8NOjOxswQ-cFSg", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-12-18", "type": "review"}

It was only a two night stay.  I gave it 3 stars rather than 2 because of the effort of front desk manager and the nice housekeeping staff I encountered on a few occasions.  One, when my iron or the iron of my colleague did not work thereby housekeeping brought another.  That one didn't work either but later that day I did return to the room with the iron on.  Must have been a ten minute delay to start...  The second occasion was when I requested additional towels. Housekeeping was here within two minutes.  My main complaints or about the rooms themselves. I checked in to room 205. Holes on the wall, dust on top of the cabinets, crumbs of some sort on the corners near the bed, and the toilet was not clean with visible urine stains.  I checked in very late therefore I did not change rooms that night rather I waited until the next day. The next day I was transferred to room 307.  307 was not that much better either.  This room too had holes on the walls and a very sloppy vacuuming job, dust on the cabinets,  but on the bright side the bathroom was clean.  There is construction going on in the hotel which is why there was a tool cart in the hallway in the morning. Carpeting is being installed therefore it is evidently displayed by rolls of carpet at the end of the halls and unfinished carpet edging by the doors of the rooms.  It is a smoke-free hotel however the smell of smoke, cigarette and marijuana, are noticeable in the guest halls.  There is much to be desired in the complementary breakfast area. Hot pockets and other microwavable \"junk food\" is available. There is a waffle house I thousand feet away though.  Not an overall good first impression.  These rooms should have been placed in the \"out of order\" list and not have guest go through this.  The next morning, there was no hot water for at least a few hours either.  On my last day I called or tried to call the front desk but the phone wasn't working. I called the 800 number because I was my only option on my phone when I googled it, and they gave me the wrong number.

The cost, just for reference, was almost $300 a week. For starters, this isn't even a full service hotel/extended-stay. They open at 11am and close at 7pm. That should tell you enough right there. If you lock yourself out or lose your room key they charge you $10 bucks to call someone living on the property to come & unlock your door. Noise level is unreal. I had a family of 5 literally \"living\" next door, but they weren't the worst of my problems. Housekeeping is non-existent. They come once a week & they don't replace your towels--all 2 of them. Did I mention the smell? If you like smoking you'll fit in great here bc the 2 rooms I used reeked of cigarettes. Upon returning home, all of my unworn clothes smelled like an old, smoky bar. I honestly cannot find a positive thing to say and I'm trying very hard to find something. There are multiple locations which could be good I guess, but I wouldn't advise staying in any of them. I tried the S Tryon location the week before and it, too, was awful. Each location charges a $50 dollar deposit and it takes about a week to be returned to your bank account if paying w/ a card. Cash is returned at the end of your stay. Bottom Line: If you're looking for an extended stay, keep looking. There's nothing positive to be gained from your stay here.

If I reviewed my first stay if probably would have been 2 or 3 stars. Lucky for them.  \n\nBack to my most recent stay.  It was the best experience ever.  (Second to the Double Tree in Carmel, IN.)  I walked in the lobby around 1PM and was greeted by Bobbie.  He was handling the desk by himself and I explained that we would wait in the lobby until they had a room ready (since we were 2 hours early for check in).  \n\nMy husband was anxious to watch the Bears game so he found a spot in the cozy waiting area with a big screen TV.  Bobbie offered to check us in early and I asked about our accommation request to be near the elevator or an area that would require very little walking.  It appeared that he may have had a challenge with our request.\n\nI explained the huge inconvenience with our last visit.  The lady that checked us in, sent us to one of the farthest rooms along the zig zag cooridor.  AFTER we requested a room that required very little walking (due to traveling with a family member on oxygen) and THAT was the best they could do for us?  My husband was exhausted before he was half way to the room.  Needless to say, he didn't want me to request a \"closer\" room after that.  This is why I give them my request when I book the room.\n\nFortunately for all of us, the extra planning helped. An extra bonus was that Bobbie ask if I was Priority Club Rewards member.  Well I wasn't, but I planned on asking...and of course it slipped my mind.  Thankfully, because Bobbie asked me about it, I am now a Priority Club member! This is great because we will be coming here a few times a year.  Bobbie was really good about explaining the details of the membership and even let me know how I can get extra points online.\n\nDid I say how great Bobbie was?  Well...he was everywhere!  He hand-delivered our new membership information to our room (with chocolate and a beverage). Whenever he saw me in the lobby, he always asked if there was anything I needed.  He also helped out with the breakfast buffet in the morning.  He literaly was everywhere!  It's not like he was leaning on the counter when I saw him.  No, he was very proactive in genuinely making his guests feel comfortable.  He's definitely a keeper.  \n\nWhenever I'm in the Madison area, I will continue to book at this Staybridge because of my experience and the excellent service that Bobbie provided.", "business_id": "rKNtd_M2kWDW8sQKYzetKA", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-12-13", "type": "review"}

Check-in was simple and the employees seemed to enjoy our enthusiasm and joking around. They even welcomed us with fresh cookies. How can you hate on a hotel with cookies?

I took full advantage of stocking up on anything I might have missed by going to the local Erehwon and running shop. That was incredibly convenient.

BUT there are a few things that are just deal breakers for me. I've had to stay here multiple times because my employer has a contract with the hotel to house our employees while we're in Madison training at Epic or I would never stay here again. \n\nThe air units in the rooms are basically large window units that don't actually heat or cool to the temp that you set them at. If you set it on heat, it heats the room to near 80F which is obviously WAY too hot. If you set it for cooling, then no matter what temp you set the unit it just randomly kicks on and cools for about 5min every hour or so. The rooms stay uncomfortably warm all the time and I'm constantly exhausted during my trips here because I can't sleep at night due to how warm the room is.\n\nAlso, the walls are paper thin and I can hear everything going on in the lobby from anywhere on the first floor. \n\nIn addition, the rooms don't have fridges in them. This is kind of ridiculous as this should be a MUST HAVE for many reasons other than my own preference for cold water. I'm certainly glad I'm not diabetic and need to keep my insulin supply refrigerated. \n\nAnd last but not least for me, their \"gym\" is a complete joke. They have 3 treadmills, a flat bench, and a set of dumbells up to 40lbs packed tightly into a room half the size of their guest rooms. It's absolutely pathetic and borderline useless. \n\nAlso, random complaint, there is no \"in-hotel\" room service and the hotel lacks a bar. This is literally the first hotel I have ever stayed in that doesn't have some sort of bar, no matter how crappy it may be.\n\nThe only redeeming qualities about this hotel are the staff who really are freaking awesome and will bend over backwards to help you and the breakfast.

Overall I had a really good experience and experienced none of the negative issues noted in other reviews.

I stayed a Saturday night and there was a wedding at the hotel, but I had absolutely no issues with noise. Overall I was quite satisfied. I should also mention that they have a free shuttle van that will take you anywhere within a 3-mile radius. It leaves every hour or half hour.  I have never stayed in a hotel with that service before.

Very very very dirty, maybe a local party motel for the university nearby. The carpets in the hallways were covered in dark stains, and there was an odor in the air. We researched this motel before we checked in so we had an idea in mind to what we were getting ourselves into. We had a standard room with a king sized bed. Our room unfortunately did not have a fridge or microwave, unlike some of our friends who asked for the same thing (they had a microwave+fridge, we did not) We throughly checked under the bedsheets for bugs and also around the room, but we actually didn't have any problem with that. The room itself was okay, we expected just that with the price we paid. The next morning, the wife from the family we saw the night before was cleaning all of the rooms.

Price for a ONE WAY ticket has gone up yet again to $37.00!!!!!  \n\nThanks to a slow day at work, I decided to do the math on this to see exactly how much of a ripoff Amtrak really is.  At $1.70 a gallon for gas, even if you were to drive a Hummer H2 to Chicago, it would only cost $21.00 in gas to get there.  If you've got a Prius, driving would run you less than $5.00.  A 38 foot Winnebago would cost about $32.00.  In fact, you would need a vehicle that gets only 6.2 MPG for Amtrak to be the less expensive option.  Did I mention I'm having a slow day at work?\n\nMoral of the story:  Don't waste your time looking at Amtrak as an alternative to driving.  Even if you have a vehicle large enough comfortably sleep 6, it's still cheaper to drive.  I also don't imagine Amtrak's reliability issues have been resolved by the price increases, so the extra cost really doesn't get you anything other than a strong likelihood of a 90+ minute delay in reaching your destination.", "business_id": "PDkUYSaYK6pAJysaOe2FnQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2009-02-26", "type": "review"}

Grab a book or something in case you wait from 30 minutes to two hours for the train to arrive so you can board it. It's because the railroads are prioritized for shipping cargo, so the train will stop and wait for long periods of time for them to pass. This means you, the passenger, will most certainly be delayed. I do not recommend taking the train if you have to connect to another ride or be somewhere at a specific time.\n\nRegarding ticket prices, it competes with Greyhound in terms of cheapness. Usually buying tickets a month in advance will give you the lowest price of $15. Then a week later, it pops up to $22, then $29, and finally anywhere from $30-159 on the week or day of your travel day. Once the normal seats sell out, your only option is to buy a ticket for the bedroom style compartment (which is in the $100s). It is ridiculously expensive, so I suggest buying a ticket from Peoria Charter or Greyhound if you miss the $15/$22 prices. It goes to Union Station and from there, $5.25 will take you via Metra to the suburbs. Hence you pay less then a bus ticket if you plan accordingly.\n\nThe train itself is really nice and clean. Pick a nice smelling passenger to sit with and you'll be fine. My only bad experience was this creepy old guy who kept talking on the phone then fell asleep on me. Ughhh. They have a cafe with tables in the back of the train that sells lots of food like donuts, Starbucks coffee, Redbull, fruit, etc. It also has a bar where a nice man in a suit and tie will mix you a drink or give you a beer. The wifi sucks though and is not reliable in my opinion.

My boyfriend and I had ended up here after our 15 hour drive from Delaware to Illinois. We were going apartment hunting in Champaign the next day and completely forgot to book a hotel room for the night. Of course the next day was move-in day for the Illini so everything was booked for the night. When we went to book a room, the night manager informed us that the cost was going to be $85 instead of the typical price since it was a \"busy week and the price should meet the demand\" (thanks for basically saying your screwing us over just because you can?). When we opened the door to our hotel room I was greeted with the lovely smell of cat pee and mold. I think we were in our room for 2 minutes before I saw a cockroach on the desk in the room. I screamed, my boyfriend squished it with a napkin. After that I refused to sleep there so we went to ask the manager for our money back. The manager inspects our room and says he can't refund us because we already \"used\" the room (I had pulled back the covers of the bed to check for more bugs) and that he needed to see the cockroach to prove we were telling the truth. My poor boyfriend had to dig through the trash to show the manager the dead bug. The guy then told us to re-make the bed and we would get our money back. Seriously? Oh and he also informed us that the roaches are usually downstairs and he had an upstairs room available if we wanted it. No. Thank.

I explained after a trip all I had was a credit card and he went on to complain about how he was going to get paid less if I used credit.\n\nOkay, that's annoying but hardly the beginning of it. I live about 2 miles from the airport. The driver kept his meter covered by paper. When I asked why, he said I'd be paying $16, which was the minimum.

Well, I wasn't arguing to begin with, but that was enough for me to shut up.

She promised the my information could stay anonymous from the driver upon my request.\n\nAbout an hour later, at nearly 10pm, the supervisor called and asked me to repeat the situation to him.

Hotel San Carlos had sweet rates, so this was the spot. \n\nBefore coming here I knew nothing about the history of it.. so I wasn't in it for the ghosts, although my wallet went missing, so could it be the spirit of Leone Jensen that was to blame? I will never know. I ended up getting the King Suite, for the same price as a regular room. Blame it on my abilities to get whatever the hell I want is up to you, but the guy at the front desk was more than happy to upgrade. Score.\n\nOnce inside the room, I was taken aback by the beautiful crown molding, Victorian decor, original radiators heating the room, vintage bed canopy and of course, the antiques that were scattered about. It reminded me of one of my old apartments in Boston, plenty of history to give me that sweet sweet feeling of being back in New England. This was what I dug most. I am not sure how big a normal room is, but the King Suite was pretty spacious. A loaded bar, with stools and all, living room area with a pull out couch, tv and footrests,  an armoir for hanging my clothes, which I didn't use obviously..  I snooped through every nook because it was all so old and interesting and mostly because im nosey. The bed was friggin' huge.. assuming they named the room after the bed would not be totally out of the question. \n\nHere come the complaints...\nThe pillows.. my god, they were so hard and gigantic (that's what she said). I ended up having to use a throw pillow from the couch to rest my head comfortably for I am a small human being with a tiny neck. The bathroom entrance has a step up that is about 10\" high which I am surprised I did not stumble over and fall face first into the toilet followed by a broken nose and bleeding knees in the middle of the night. And lastly, had I of slept in 10 minutes more than I did, I would have been awoken by the sound of the maids vacuuming through the paper thin walls.. There is very little privacy in that sense. \n\nOther than that, the staff were so nice, and it was decorated beautifully for the holiday season.

Kennedy and one of my faves..  Clark Gable. How cool is that! \n\nCome to think of it.. I did hear the sound of little children talking and laughing as I was leaving that morning, which I blamed on something outside not knowing the story about it being built on the first schoolhouse in Phx and over some sacred wishing well?

I wanted to be able to walk back and fourth for a couple days. Upon check in I was greeted with zero smiles, and made to feel more like he was doing me a huge favor. The older gentlemen with white hair was very very clear that this was not a \"party\" motel. And that we will get removed immediately if there was even 1 complaint? I found this interesting since I am a mellow 45 year old who does not appear to be a partier in the least bit. He then went over the no smoking policy and that we'd be charged $150.00 cleaning deposit if we smoked. Even though the office smelled of cigarette smoke. LoL....  And nobody in my family smokes. I simply smiled and looked at my wife and said, \"Well, looks like we came to the right place honey\"'\n\nI was utterly disgusted at the layer of filth on the outside of the building. I wiped my finger on the outside windowsill and it turned black. Old gum, some kind of splash stains, trash, all in view on the way to the room.  Every outside plastic trash can within view was barely holding together like they had been run over and stood back up. They are cracked to death and appear to be very old as they are faded? \n\nOne of our rooms (we have older kids with us) reeked of cigarette smoke as we entered. I immediately opened the door and cranked the fan to try and air it out. I noticed the batteries were missing in the smoke alarm. I went to the office to report this and was met with apathy from now a female attendant. She told me she could swap out a room and would call me in 20 minutes. I told her that I did not want to get charged with a smoking violation. We went back and hung out in our other room. DISGUSTING. The corners of the rooms floors are filled with lint, dust, and food particles where it looks to never to have been vacuumed.  Stains on the carpet and chair seating area. There were small chunks of seat cushion under the chair in the corner as if had not been moved or cleaned under in a long time.  When I looked behind the tv cabinet in search for an outlet I saw a former tenants Old Spice deodorant covered in dust along with numerous crumpled kleenex? Seriously?  After walking around the room in my socks for about 30 minutes they were black on the bottom. Gross. I can only guess that the cleaning crew blows through each room doing the least amount of work they can. We found evidence that one of our beds sheets had not been changed. \n\nAfter an hour I had never received a phone call that was promised. I went back to the front office for some coffee. The same lady was there and I told her to forget changing our room. And that it had aired out pretty good. I actually just gave up and decided to just try and help my family enjoy our few days here. After dealing with the manager who was very clear that we were here for them, and the condition of the room, I knew trying to get them to see reality would be more frustrating that just letting it go.  So I did. I figured I'd inform possible customers of what they might be getting into. And I honestly hope Super 8 contacts the management here and tries to fix these easily remedied issues. \n\nLater that night after two of my kids showered. their tub (in room 108, the stinking smoke room that still stunk) did not drain. I walked back to the front office and met the lady again. She told me that they only had 1 plunger and that they had given it to another room and that they were asleep already. I now asked for a new room. She told me she would see what she could do and that she would let me know and call me back at my room. I never heard back from them the entire stay. Not to see if we were ok? Not to offer to replace the missing batteries (code violation)?  \n\nThe next morning we tried to enjoy the free breakfast. Ok at least they are trying I guess. But when the OJ ran out the white haired guy fixed it but did not say a word to us as we said thank you. He really makes it clear that he just does not enjoy people. \n\nWe will never stay her again. And I feel like we should get a partial refund. I understand things happen. But this place is a joke. I would be embarrassed to work here. And I refuse to believe management doesn't know what is going on. Just hard to believe people can just not care.\n\nUPDATED JANUARY 26TH.\n    After returning home 3 outta4 of my kids developed little red bites along the backs of their necks, on their sides and on our 2 yr old under his diaper on his belly. We determined that they were in fact bed bug bites.  Fortunitely they did not make it back to our house.

Wow, what a city.  It's beautiful and in the middle of HELL.  Paradise lost, one might say.\n\nI made my reservations to the Rodeway Inn Airport after consulting the internet for a place to stay.  I made a few considerations, such as brand name.  I've been a big fan of Clarion Brand hotels, since I've stayed at Comfort Inn and Suites in a variety of cities over the years.  I concluded my internet reservation the day before and decided this was in a great spot due to airport proximity and brand name.\n\nWhat...a...mistake...\n\nApparently, Phoenix is abnormal compared to many cities I've stayed in.  The airport is beautiful but the surrounding area is not.  The hotel chain has a great reputation, but this place was not beautiful. \n\nHere, let me explain!\n\nI arrived at 0500 (5am for y'all) in Phoenix.  My reservation was made, but apparently the Clarion website differs from their policy.  My room was given away since I hadn't checked in by 6am, even though the Clarion website has a Room Guarantee that says they'll hold the room until 7am the next day.  I had a bit of kick back from the onside employee that night.\n\nHotel is rather nasty. It's old.  It's dilapidated.  It was all locked up (more to follow on that).  It was grungy.  Not pleasant, nor reminiscent of the Clarion brand.\n\nRoom was freezing, and appeared sloppily put together.  Curtains were ill fitting, going over the window A/C Heater system and blowing.  Also, the heat didn't work too well, but that's neither here nor there.\n\nBelow the heater though, that's where the magic was found.  A used Trojan Magnum condom and wrapper.  Now THAT'S good times.\n\nApparently, this hotel, this area, this side of the airport is known to locals for the strip clubs, prostitution and drug dealers.  Yup.  It's all that.  \n\nNot gonna be staying here again.  Sorry Clarion.  You've lost me on this one.", "business_id": "GF95bWp-19I5YbNtr9VluQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-01-13", "type": "review"}

HDTV's are so cheap these days ... there is no excuse for ANY hotel having a CRT set. I didn't think those things even worked anymore. And I didn't turn it on to find out. \n\nStill, I gave it 2-starts to his one because while Jay was up all night due to the paper thin walls, I took a triple dose of melatonin to escape the misery of this wretched room and PTFO'd.

I kept coming back on business trips for a few reasons:\n\nThe location is terrific. At Thomas and Central you are walking distance to some of the best Thai, barbeque, burger, ice-cream, breakfast, steak and deli restaurants the valley has to offer. What's more important is that a light rail stop is right at the corner. Buy a day-pass and you can go downtown to the sports stadiums and concert halls, or even down to old-town Tempe, up to the George and Dragon, Hulu, Maizies, Doc's place or Chars has the Blues, or out to one of my favorite Vietnamese pho place on Apache Blvd.\n\nAdd to this the quality of the rooms, bedding, and furnishings. All are good enough to make me feel I was being coddled, and good enough to consistently impress.\n\nThe atrium design of the hotel combined with the breakfast buffet means that at about 6:30 to 7:00 each morning you are softly, sweetly awakened to the aroma of eggs and bacon. There is no sweeter feeling. It's like waking up in your mother's arms.\n\nThe bar has a cast of regulars who provide local color. They also have bartenders who remember what you had last time, even if you were there only once a month before.\n\nThe waitstaff is attentive (usually) though there were times at the breakfast buffet when I needed to get my own coffee. By the time that happened i was comfortable doing it myself.\n\nSo what are the cons? Parking costs about $12 per day in the nearby structure, and getting from there to the elevator can be a bit awkward.  There is also no place to lay out in the sun if that's what you like doing. \n\nOtherwise, I could easily consider buying one of the rooms and retiring there.", "business_id": "urBWfXQjyyWIO5B7FvnOpg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-01-21", "type": "review"}

That said, the bed was very comfortable. \n\nRed flag number two were the little cards around the room that asked us to participate in their environmental program and expect the room to be turned over once every other day and to reuse towels/etc. So, no fresh towels the following day. \n\nI thought this wasn't a big deal as they had a locker room off of the fitness center. However, to call this a \"center\" is laughable. I'd call it a fitness boutique. Two showers, two sinks, a sauna and by far the cheapest complimentary products to use. $1 White Rain on a marble counter top isn't classy. \n\nNo spa, no salon (I was told I could leave the property and go across the street if I were looking these types of services). Not very helpful if you are traveling and need to get ready for a wedding or other formal event. \n\nThe over-the-top moment occurred when I reviewed my bill to find that they were going to charge $27 per night for overnight parking.

This is the worst hotel experience, by far.\n\nThis is an older Embassy Suites but I thought that its location in the tony Biltmore area of Phoenix would assure that it's well-kept.  Incorrect assumption.  This is the filthiest hotel I've ever seen.\n\nI should have known I was in for utter disappointment when I arrived for my stay around 12:45 am.  I am dead tired and fumbling with two bags when I happen upon a security guard standing in front of the hotel taking a smoke.  Instead of holding the door for me, he watched me balance my bags and purse with an amused grin, as I struggled with the the hotel door.  Thanks for nothing.  I get to the front desk and the check-in process is fairly smooth.  I'm booked into a room that is on a far end of the hotel.  I hike over there and proceed to get ready for bed when more problems ensue. The bathroom wall has what appears to be a streak of blood running down it.  I was too grossed out to investigate further.  There is also a bent wire hanger on the picture frame over the toilet.  The wallpaper is peeling and the ceiling is showing signs of a bad leak from upstairs.  Really?  I am appalled at this point but since it's after 1 am, I reason that I can just get a little shut-eye and change rooms first thing in the morning.  My plans quickly changed when I turned down the bed covers to find lint and make-up on them.  I can't do this.  I call the front desk and request an immediate room change.  The lady I spoke too was extremely apologetic and offered to move me right away.  She said she'd send up a security guard to help with my bags and get me into a better room/area of the hotel.  You know where this is going, right?  Yes, approximately 10 minutes later the grinning smoker appears at the door.  He hands me a key for a room on the opposite side of the hotel and makes the assessment that I have a pretty good handle on my bags so he'll just point me in the direction of where I should go.  The new room looks exactly like the first one, albeit a little cleaner.  The bathroom looked acceptable and the bed covers were free of foreign substances.  It was past my bedtime, I needed sleep.\n\nWith a little rest and fresh eyes, the hotel didn't get any better for me.  I'm sure in its heyday this was THE place to stay.  Sadly, it is just neglected and doesn't warrant the nightly room charges (it's not cheap).  The common areas are filthy.  I promise that I'm not a germaphobe.  I really didn't want to touch anything in this hotel.  The elevator buttons and door handles were dirty.  I had to carry napkins with me so I wouldn't have to touch them.  The carpet in the lobby and elevators looked like a ton of toddlers had had their way with a box of Ritz crackers.  And, no, I didn't catch them on an off day.  It looked like this for my entire three-day stay.  I failed to mention the ceiling fan in my new and improved \"clean\" room.  The dust hanging off of it was so thick.  It clearly hadn't been touched in ages.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the hotel lobby also has an off-putting stench, probably due to the fountains/ponds inside?  I don't know but it's unpleasant.\n\nIf the filth wasn't bad enough, on the last day of my stay I was jarred from sleep at 4 am by a blaring fire alarm.  I pulled the curtain back and saw other guests milling about.  Apparently, there is no intercom system to let guests know what they should do.  When I saw another guest return to her room, I took the gamble that I'd burn in this cess pool and went back to bed.  It was a short-lived nap.  A few hours later, the alarm is blaring again!  I'm deliriously tired and in the process of the pulling on a pair of jeans to exit when housekeeping opens the door.  Really?  The alarm is going off,  it's still early in the a.m. and you're coming in the room to clean?  What in the hell?  What do you clean, anyway?  At this point, I knew it was time to part ways.  I quickly packed and made my exit.  Unbelievable and unforgivable.  Never again.", "business_id": "FQudBiBiz9bGQLF_kK8UCg", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-02-26", "type": "review"}

I cannot believe this is an Embassy Suite, it did not impress me one bit.  Dirty beyond belief.

I have never reviewed a hotel room until this moment and now I will never stay in another hotel with out reading reviews.  \n\nPool was filthy and lots of missing tile, cracks and leaves in water.

I mean, at least that's what I'm collecting from the name of the restaurant being Squaw Peak, the name of the reviewer being Squaw Peak, and the review being 5 stars.\n\nAnyway, let the reviewing begin. I'll start with the best parts and slowly but surely make my to the less desirable attributes of this below-par hotel/motel. First of all, despite being suspicious of said Squaw Peak reviewer, the restaurant is actually really good. I had a tuna salad as well as a vegetable stir fry, and they were both very tasty and hit the spot. The view from up there isn't really like some spectacular thing, but I guess it is a view of Phoenix. \n\nAs for the hotel, I've stayed at many Embassy Suites and this one was by far the most disappointing one I've ever rested my head at. First of all, it was definitely some motel changed into an Embassy Suites. All the rooms have doors that are outside and face a courtyard. That wouldn't be that big of a deal if the area that the hotel is in wasn't so sketchy looking. \n\nThe actual suite itself was alright. The paint and doors of my room seemed as if someone had drank too many free drinks at the complimentary happy hour they have there and just decided to use the room as a one enormous punching bag. The beds are comfortable but I didn't feel the safest when i was going to sleep because of the whole door on the outside thing. \n\nIf I return to Phoenix, I will definitely be looking to stay elsewhere.

It was pretty typical as far a business trip hotel stay goes, but here are my high points and low points of the experience:\n\nGood: \n\n-The gym had state-of-the art Precor treadmills and elliptical trainers with TV screens, just like the ones at my 24 Hour Fitness. There was also a water cooler and a bathroom in the fitness center, which was very convenient. I found this gym to be a lifesaver when I was too pressed for time to drive to a different neighborhood to run outside. \n\n-The two flat screen TV's in the room are a nice touch, as are the microwave and mini-fridge. \n\n-The staff who cooks the made to order breakfast! There was a man and a woman working, I believe the man's name was Mikey, and he was the nicest man! They mistakenly gave me the wrong omelette (some doofus got out of line and messed up the whole flow) and Mikey came running after me and made me a fresh one within minutes! He even remembered to bring me my side of salsa. \n\n-The pool was nice, although I didn't get a chance to use it.\n\nBad: \n\n-Pricey for what you get. It was $149/night plus $5/night for parking. Tack on internet access charges and room taxes and it's close to $200 a night. More than I would pay for what is essentially a glorified motel in a sketchy neighborhood. I expect more for 200 bones a night.\n\n-The neighborhood is sketchy and the hotel sits right on Thomas Road, which is VERY busy. If you need to get on Hwy 51, making a left turn out of the parking lot can be a nightmare. \n\nIf this hotel was closer to the $150/night range (including internet and parking) then I would probably give four stars.

We arrived at 11:15 and sat down for a 2.5 hour buffet enjoyed in their sunny side patio. This was my first time here and it's amazing to know that their renovations are fairly recent because you would never guess it! The Spanish style tile roofs, huge trees and beautiful overhanging Bouganvilla really set the tone for this place. It has so much character and thought put into the layout, you can't help but feel relaxed.\n\nThanksgiving Day brunch was wonderful! (If only you could take some home for leftovers!) Although I did miss doing some cooking of my own, I have to admit it was nice to skip out on grocery store madness and be pampered for a change! We finished 4-6 plates (the guys ate more!) from their cutting station: turkey, of course, pesto topped salmon, and prime rib, made to order omelettes, salads, and desserts. My only critique is 3 of us got a bowl of squash soup and it was so salty none of us could eat it. Must have been a fluke because the rest of the meal was delicious. They definitely have hired the best. Everyone we came in contact with was friendly, gracious and made us feel right at home. And in case you missed their Thanksgiving buffet or you want a repeat performance of their awesome spread, you can go a month later for their Christmas smorgasbord. \n\nI would love to stay here next time.

[cue angelic voices...**ahhhhhh**] \n\nThe lovely presented me with a spa gift cert for three services. When I arranged the appointment, I asked if I could increase the massage time from 60 to 90 minutes in lieu of the second service and was told 'of course'. So I booked a 90 minute stone massage and a pedicure. \n\nThe day of the appointment - my birthday - I was greeted with a 'happy birthday' and shown to the women's shower/changing/steam room. Its not fair to call it a locker room, its simply too lovely for that. There is a second 'relaxation room' where you can sip tea an enjoy small bites while you wait. Delightful.\n\nAs for the massage itself, may I just say that it was the most relaxing 90 minutes of my life?? It was one of those times where time goes by much more quickly than you want. I didn't want it to end. The room has a vaulted ceiling with what look to be the original beams. It has two tables and shower heads above each for the citrus scrubs [yikes did that sound sexy...] The woman [you can ask for gender preference if you like] who worked on me - Carol, I think - was great. I was kept warm the whole time either by her hands holding the smooth warm stones or by the perfect weight of the covers over the rest of me. I felt perfectly taken care of. My 5x operated shoulders have never felt so relaxed. I walked out of there and into the ahhhhmaaaazing not-locker room [stocked with everything - and I do mean everything - you might need, right down to qtips, shave cream and disposable razors] where an out of town guest asked me what I had done and she told me I looked stoned. All of that without drugs!! The showers, walk in and large enough for a family of 5, are similarly equipped with all of the spa products to use and enjoy. Lovely. \n\nAs an aside, I don't mean to short-change the pedi but I am a girl who has frequent pedi's, so this was less of a treat than the massage which I'm less likely to get for myself. It was pleasant, in a nice atmosphere but nothing seriously out of the ordinary. And sorry my lovely, but not worth 80+ dollars. \n\nThere are nooks outdoors - each with lounge chairs and fireplaces - where you can relax and unwind further. Or you can have lunch there with your book - which I did. Menu, lunch, it all comes to you quickly, sweetly, happily. Makes me wish I lived there. Its quiet and lovely and is a great match to the experience itself.

I don't enjoy writing bad reviews, however, we feel that people need to hear about the experience we had here. In summary, we would not return due to their poor customer service and have shared the following experience w/ our friends and family.  My husband thought it would be nice for us to go out and do something special before NYE to help us decide if we should spend NYE there. He did a whole lot of internet research and found that according to the website, the Lounge area of this hotel had flamenco entertainment once a month.  He called to verify and to see if we needed reservations, the woman who answered was quite nice, he said, and confirmed the start time of the entertainment. How fun, we thought! We dressed for the occasion and were very excited to go to this Lounge; we went wednesday december 28, 2011 and arrived at 6pm. The grounds are absolutely beautiful-we were even more excited as we were pointed towards the back area to The Lounge.  First off, we walked in, there was no hostess/host, no one to greet us- not knowing if we were in the right place, we looked around and at that time a waitress (or maybe the bus girl?) practically ran past us, clearly not wanting to be side tracked.  My husband asked her if this was the place where they had the flamenco entertainment and as she was walking away/running away, she said that there wasn't any flamenco there and pointed to the bar and told us to ask the \"bar supervisor\". My husband and I looked at each other wondering, huh? So we both walked over to the bar where there was a bartender and one of the waitresses, Kathryn and i think another bar person. We stood there waiting for them to agknowledge us, which they didn't, so after a few awkward seconds my  husband  asked them if this was the place, etc...Truly we felt like we were interrupting their conversation; we felt, at this point, very unwelcome and it hadn't even been 5 minutes since we arrived. We were pretty sure that we were in the wrong place and there's no flamenco entertainment here.  They all looked at each other to ask themselves, is there flamenco entertainment here? One said no, the other one had no idea and Kathryn the waitress said that they did but that it would be outside. All this while, no one was speaking to us, there were speaking amongst themselves. We found this to be extremely rude, impolite and uninviting. I think my husband asked if food was served there, Kathryn at this point said yes and informed us that there was also a restaurant down the hall (TCooks) that served food.  We felt pretty uninvited there, like she was shooing us away, actually now that i think about it, so we walked to TCooks and realized that we weren't in the mood for formal dining and returned grudgingly to The Lounge. We didn't get a 'welcome back' or any greeting that could turn the previous experience around but yet we decided to sit. The waitress Kathryn was dutifully pleasant while taking our order. The hors d'hoerves were good, but I have to mention this: when the \"bus girl'? I didn't get her name served us the food, not a word from her. My husband politely said, \"Thank you\" as she served us the food and still not a word back from her. She's the one that nearly ran us over -i noted her above. All in all,  I'm not sure what was going on w/ their service staff,  I really feel they just didn't want to be there and secondly,  they have been inadequately trained in providing excellent customer service.\nRude, impolite, unwelcoming and not knowledgeable about entertainment provided there. Definately not a place we will return to-that includes the resort.   We did not stay for the originally much anticipated flamenco entertainment which ended up being inside and not outside like were told-we felt too unwelcomed.", "business_id": "rLAeltELaGdQKh_LYIllEA", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-01-07", "type": "review"}

It was an awesome time, so glad we went. We met in Fountain Hills and clambered into the Hummer. There are 2 sections - one open air on top and 4 seats in the back. Our guide Robby was excellent. Great job on pointing out the various cactuses, the many amazing features of the hummer, and he didn't sound like he had done it a million times before. \n\nHe had a lot of experience with the vehicle, which helped make it pretty comfortable. I was nervous it would be bumpy and painful (since I have RA) and I was absolutely fine. Although there were moments I squeezed my eyes tight shut when he did the thrill part of the ride - going down and up the steep hill ... but at all times I felt perfectly safe. \n\nBeware of the teddy cactus - it blew on my shoe but Robbie & MH got it all off. Scenery beautiful - lake beautiful - you really get a sense of how difficult the land is to traverse and survive in. Good tips on the nutritional value of cactus. You will get dusty and there's no bathroom break for at least 2 hours so be prepared. But it's so worth it. \n\nWater and snacks were provided, and he even offered them to us again at the end for our ride home. Also he took photos of us, and presented each group with a photo tour CD which included the ones he took of us. All made unobtrusively from the car. \n\nHe does ATV-ing too.

It's your average motel (since the doors face outside, not a hallway), and the breakfast buffet is okay (scrambled eggs, hash browns, sausage links, bacon, cereal, batter to make waffles,   and toast provided). The walls are REALLY thin, so thin that the guy snoring next door kept us awake all night. \n\nThe room was clean and equipped with a mini fridge (like the kind you'd keep in your dorm room) and microwave, although lacking a safety deposit box. If you want to keep your items safe, you have to bring your items to the front desk, make a list of what you're dropping off, and then sign. I was uncomfortable making a list, so I decided to forgo this process.\n\nFYI if you call the front desk to order you a taxi, they actually order a car service. The car is an unmarked, dark-colored Lincoln sedan. To go to the 16th Street Sports Bar down the street cost us about $10 vs $6 for an actual taxi (which we ended up taking later). We didn't want to drink and drive, so not bad, but just know that the hotels in the area do not order taxis.\n\nMy main complaint is that we didn't have housekeeping service the entire time, hence the two stars. We left for lunch from 10:30AM - 1:30PM, returned, but housekeeping never arrived. We left again at 3PM for the rest of the day, and housekeeping, upon arrival back at the room after midnight, hadn't come. I called the front desk for someone to bring towels, but since there was no one to cover the front desk, we had to go get the towels ourselves. I also wanted an extra pillow, but the front desk person couldn't leave the front desk to get a pillow out of the housekeeping room. I thought this was very strange.\n\nI guess for less than $100/night (Hilton resort down the street much more expensive), it's not too bad. I would probably stay here again for the mere fact that the location is conducing to our activities. But, if I could find another hotel close by with a similar price, I wouldn't mind staying somewhere else.", "business_id": "6Ckmrpp6OW1pJ-3Pjg7VaQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-02-09", "type": "review"}

Every single tour company we called (we went to tripadvisor and started with the highest rated) was still operating tours to the Grand Canyon but many of them were full.  We finally managed to snag the last 2 spots with another company and there were absolutely NO visibility issues at all.  In fact, the day was extremely clear and the Grand Canyon was spectacular.\n\nOpen Road Tours was extremely unprofessional in not helping us find an alternate way to see the Grand Canyon after we expressed that it was our whole purpose in visiting Phoenix and the day we booked was the only day we could go.  Rather than call peers to secure us spots, they told us there was nothing they could do unless we wanted to book on another day (impossible since we were leaving the next day).  Given that there were absolutely no actual weather issues, and they had actually already attempted to reschedule the tour prior to the \"weather cancellation\" due to insufficient bookings on Monday, the entire experience leaves a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nPARTING THOUGHT: Why take a chance with your vacation and book with an unreliable tour company when there are so many excellent options in the area?", "business_id": "TGJaChsRa6M87guv6Q57dQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-01-18", "type": "review"}

The people are pretty cool that I've met while staying here but that is the only good thing I can say about this place. We stayed here because it is close to our house that is being remodeled. The management is horrible they will never take ANY responsibility if something happens! We moved in and we had to sleep on a beat up mattress and a box spring that had wheels screwed into it. After 2 nights we started getting bit, it turns out the box spring had bed bugs in it. When we complained the awesome management and they accused us of bringing them in.  These cheap people would not get rid of the box spring so we threw it out. Went and bought a bed and used that for the rest of our stay.

Huge roach on top of the Microwave. The second room was so dusty. I had a miserable night. When we addressed our issues to Sandra at the front desk ; she told me that I needed to reserve a non-allergic room. Translations: Rooms they actually dust and clean. I was sneezing all night. I don't have this problem under typical conditions. The first room also had trash and hair clips left behind from the previous patrons. Sandra did not offer a solution or seemed too concern. Later that night I voiced a concern to a man at the desk and he offered an additional night. That was kind of him, though the problem was I couldn't breath and was sneezing.. Needless, to say we didn't take the offer. Before I forget to mention, one of the sofa chairs upholstery was torn. I do have pics to back up my claims. After our second room was re-cleaned we had to dust our selves. The last night I couldn't sleep because I'm certain I felt bed bugs. I googled them from my phone. After seeing the huge cock roach I was to scared to check for the bed bugs in the mattress as advised from the website. Which brings me to, their wi-fi. You have to pay for it. Pretty, chinsey to charge for wi-fi. (about $14.95/day) However some of the down stairs desk computers face the windows entering the Hotel. They use their wifi for staying on Facebook all day. There wasn't one time as I was entering & leaving for the day that I did not see an Embassy Suite's staff Face Book page up. lol I guess the wifi is for their staff. \nOther then the rooms the overall stay was o.k. Restaurant service was very kind and friendly. They have a nice serve to order breakfast bar. Manager's reception at night with snacks and drinks.

He talked to us during the entire drive from the moment we got into the van, which in itself was very roomy & comfortable. He shared facts about each town we passed, little tidbits you probably won't find in tour guidebooks, and told us all about the different animals, plants & cactus we saw while on the road. \n\nThe group we were with was a small group of 5 people so it had a really nice, cozy feeling. Lee was very accomodating whenever we needed to make an emergency bathroom stop, which happened somewhat frequently with all the complimentary water they gave us! Haha. We made many stops along the southern rim of Grand Canyon & we were taken down on a few trails that were away from where most of the visitors usually congregate & with spectacular views so we got a chance to enjoy the beauty of nature in a peaceful environment.\n\nI highly recommend Southwest Tours & would definitely consider using them again the next time we go out there for a visit.", "business_id": "b8Bkm7-a1FNRjZGB-szEzg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-02-24", "type": "review"}

Luckily, after making some calls, we were incredibly lucky to snag the last two spots on a tour with Vaughan's!\n\nOur tour guide, Tim, picked us up from our hotel lobby promptly at 7am, and we were off!  The scenery was captivating and ever changing on the way to the canyon.  The entire way, Tim kept up an interesting commentary about the history, the culture and the flora and fauna of Arizona.  \n\nThere were plenty of bathroom breaks along the way.  We stopped about an hour and a half in for coffee and then continued another few hours to reach a Navajo trading post, where we had a tasty lunch and a chance to see some genuine reservation-made crafts.  I found the prices and quality to be better than Scottsdale/Phoenix, so you may want to hold off on purchases until you see the stuff at the trading post!\n\nThere was an accident in front of the Park entrance that wound up costing us quite a bit of time, but Tim was a consummate professional and still made sure that we had plenty of time at the park even though it added about 2 hours to his workday.  He took us to the best parts of the park and even pointed out some wildlife.  It was absolutely gorgeous, and we even got to see sunset in the Grand Canyon, which was a real treat!\n\nPARTING THOUGHT: If you are trying to decide on a tour company for the Grand Canyon, look no further!

On the way to the Grand Canyon Howard even took a detour for us to drive over a beautiful waterfall where people were fishing.  We made 5 different viewing stops on the south rim of the Grand Canyon including ones that were not stopped at by the large tour buses which gave us ample oppurtunity to take photos.  Our final stop at the Grand Canyon was at Yavapai Point where we visited a beautiful hotel and the Hopi House Gift Store which I highly recommend both if you want to buy a gift and also just to view the beautiful building both inside and out.

I had never gone on a day tour before and had no idea what to expect-it ended up to be the best thing I could have chosen for this trip!\n\nThings that I was especially happy with:  I was staying outside of the pick up area for the tour, and on the phone, I was offered a 10% discount since I would have to arrange travel to the closest hotel.  The pick up was incredibly punctual.  Our tour guide was great-knowledgeable about all kinds of things, and not many questions he couldn't answer.  The van was equipped with a microphone system so all were able to hear his descriptions.  He seemed genuinely happy to be taking the trip (as opposed to jaded that he had done it many times).  The weather was REALLY windy and cold and he took us to viewing areas of the Canyon that were indoors.  Finally, our guide was very willing to take photos for everyone and also noted that he had an extra camera in case anyone's wasn't working.\n\nAreas for improvement:  A 15% Yelp check-in offer was posted on the website, but on the phone, they said it was no longer valid.

Truth be told I wouldn't have booked a room if it weren't for the convenient location to the Rock 'n' Roll Half Marathon.  We arrived to check in on Saturday evening.  We were \"upgraded\" to a room on the Hilton Honor's level, but probably because the place is completely booked up.  The room on the HH level comes with the same amenities as the regular level.  However, we received the following unexpected bonuses: 2 breakfast vouchers, a $5 off coupon to the bar/restaurant, and 2 drinks with appetizers vouchers.  \n\nThe front desk didn't seem too welcoming, but I'll let that one slide since he gave us freebies.  The room is pretty good in size with space for a couch and desk.  I thought it was clean, and I felt comfortable resting my body there for a night.  The only thing that irked me about the room is the lack of ventilation in the bathroom.  The smoke detector came on 10 minutes after I had taken a shower.  We tried calling the front desk for help, but no one answered the phone.  The neighbors came out to see what's going on.  I had to open up the patio door and luckily the alarm went off after five minutes.  No other fiasco encountered after that.\n\nThere is not much going on, especially walking distance around the hotel.  But if you have a car, I would highly suggest checking out Cornish Pasty Co. (http://www.yelp.com/biz/cornish-pasty-company-tempe#hrid:GP2bQkUnrTR7UYrexM4kBA) about 2 miles away.  You can thank me later.

Really old!\n\nIf you don't travel often and rarely stay in hotels, you won't notice how bad this place is.\n\nHowever for you business travelers and especially you Hhonors Diamond members, you'll leave wondering how this hotel retains it's Hilton status!\n\nI mean COME ON.  In the Hilton family, only Waldorf-Astoria is supposedly superior to a Hilton branded property.  I suspect that this hotel is owned by a franchisee and not Hilton Group.  It's so poorly managed it's laughable.\n\nI wandered in unsuspecting but questioned the landscaping outside as I passed by.  The bark in the landscaped areas was almost completely gone and what was left was so badly faded and destroyed by the sun it should be removed.  Bare dirt would look better.  Or better yet, put in some landscape rock.\n\nThe lobby, upon first glance, appears clean and modern.  However, since my check in took over 20 minutes due to the 'trainee' assigned to me, I had time to look around.  A lot of repair work needed to walls, carpet, tile, etc.\n\nOne of the elevator doors was severely dented... as if kicked in by an unruly bar patron from the lobby restaurant.\n\nMy room was OLD!  The bathroom is old school TINY and barely enough room for one person.  The door to the bathroom covers 3/4 of the shower so maneuvering around is difficult and can be dangerous getting out of the shower.\n\nOne good thing about these old hotels is PLENTY of shower pressure and water volume.  Hot water in the morning remains limited.  Shower early!\n\nThe room is scuffed up pretty good and could use new wall paper and a paint job.\n\nDresser drawers slide open and will not remain closed.  Having to use the bathroom in the middle of night and running into an open drawer is extremely frustrating.  Especially when it happens a 2nd time.\n\nNewspaper outside the door in the morning a nice touch as many Hilton properties have quit doing this.\n\nAirport shuttle runs every half hour.  Don't be alarmed if you wander out there early to find 30 people seemingly waiting on the shuttle.  They scoot people back and forth to the University of Phoenix campus at about 20 after the hour in the morning.  A surly, overweight retiree who only speaks in grunts and barks will be happy to tell you how stupid you are for trying to board the shuttle to the college instead of waiting 10 minutes for the airport shuttle.\n\nThe nice thing was when he returned to take me to airport.  More grunts of dissatisfaction when I responded with \"Terminal 2\" to his question \"Which airlines\"?  I knew right then I was going to save a few dollars in tip money when he dropped me off.\n\nThere's 5 Hilton properties surrounding the Phoenix airport.  All of them are better than this one.\n\nAVOID!", "business_id": "KnRRMCqQQqlyMphif6cTaA", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-12-12", "type": "review"}

The lady quoted around $240 or $245.  I then told her that their Budget listing on the Southwest Airlines Web site showed a smaller daily fee, and she lowered it to $217 for 7 days, which I agreed to.  Before I hung up, I asked several times if this \"$217\" was the total that would be billed to my credit card or if taxes and various other fees would be added on.  The lady at the Budget call center said that was the total, with taxes everything included.\n\nWhen I actually showed up at the Phoenix Sky Harbor rental window for Budget and gave them my reservation confirmation number, the printout showed a total of $271.   My first thought was \"WTF!!??!?!\"   I told the tight-lipped guy at the Budget rental counter that I was quoted $217, but then all he did was to point out on the printout all of the this-and-that fees added on.  I had declined all other rental options such as other insurance, fuel service, GPS, etc, etc.  After griping at the guy and crying \"Foul\" for 15 minutes, I ended up renting the car... it was 11:40PM and I was too tired to go shopping at the other car rental companies. \n\nSeven days later, I fueled up the rental car in the early afternoon, drove around Scottsdale to run some errands and returned the car later in the afternoon.  The fuel gauge was still about near the full mark.  But when I turned the car in, the guy turned on the ignition, and added about $34 to my $271 bill for a total of $305.  This was for an Economy car that was originally reserved for $217!!!   The Budget idiot said that the gas tank was not totally full and billed me extra at the rate of $8 per gallon, or adding on another 4 gallons to my bill.  With that small rental car, there was NO WAY that I drove 100+ miles during the few hours that I had the car in Scottsdale!!!!\n\nBUDGET IS A BUNCH OF BAIT-AND-SWITCH CROOKS!!!!!!!\n\nOn the Budget Web site http://www.budget.com/budgetWeb/html/en/customer/commonquestions/index.html  , they give the alibi to justify a $8/gallon fuel charge of:\n\nWhy do you charge so much to refuel the car? \nAnswer:  Unless a customer has chosen the Fuel Service Option, which is competitive with local gas prices, we prefer that renters stop at a local station and refuel the car before returning it. If the customer chooses not to do so, we charge a premium for providing this refueling service to them. That charge takes into account both direct and indirect costs of having to refuel and maintain our refueling infrastructure for customers who prefer this service. The charge also is intended to strongly motivate customers to save by refueling the car themselves. \n\n\nBut that BS is just a veil to prevent Budget from getting sued even more.    Budget has a long history of infractions and penalties imposed by the Federal Trade Commission:\n\nhttp://www.ftc.gov/opa/2007/11/budget.shtm\n\nhttp://www.ftc.gov/os/caselist/0623042/index.shtm\n\nhttp://www.ftc.gov/opa/1996/03/budget.shtm\n\nAnd Budget has been very unethical with their sneaky handling of fuel charges, imposing damage fees, and sneaking other fees to screw their customers as much as possible. \n\nI did not uncover all of this Budget shit until my $217 rental experience turned into $305.  But I guess that I learned my lesson to NEVER RENT FROM BUDGET AGAIN.  Maybe misery loves company, but there are other accounts from people who had their Budget bill inflate from $300 to more than $600.\n\nAnd if you complain about the bill, either to Budget personnel on the phone or to the car inspector or rental counter person at Sky Harbor, they are all assholes who treat you like shit once they know that they have your credit card number tied up with a rental.", "business_id": "FYCVF_1qYm3x5DYCbmmK1g", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-12-27", "type": "review"}

It is about 5-10 minutes from Downtown Phoenix. The only terminal I can review is Terminal 2 because it's the only terminal I've been in. I fly to Phoenix at least once a year from Cleveland and always take Continental. Continental flies in and out of Terminal 2 to it's hubs in Cleveland, Newark, and Houston. Terminal 2 is a very bland terminal that needs a lot of updating. Also, the Continental gates are always extremely crowded, leaving you pressed for seating if you don't arrive early. Terminal 2 also has a lack of stores and places to get food, although they are there. Overall, despite the bashing, Sky Harbor is a decent airport.

If you are going to shunt your rental car center to some godforsaken corner of the valley, couldn't you at least arrange a dedicated skyway for the buses or a tram or monorail or train that whisks arriving passengers there?  This is one of the few things SFO has done well, while Cleveland Hopkins and Sky Harbor have done it poorly.\n\n2)  The food options are not all that great, and as one other reviewer noted, the best bits are outside security!  Who has the cool and collected psyche to sit there idling away over a meal while gigantic queues may be forming, unseen, at the security gate while you linger?  When I arrive at an airport, my goal is to get through security at the earliest possible moment to avoid any nasty, nerve-wracking surprise death marches.

It was definitely  not designed to be \"post-911\" friendly.

We get off the plane and walk...and walk...and then walk some more, looking around trying to find where to go to in order to catch this bus. Finally, we found someone who told us where to go. We walked and walked, and then walked some more until we finally caught the bus. We then had to find the correct gate and go through security again... \n\nFlash forward 8 days. We fly in and go through customs. (This, BTW, was a great experience because we were the only international flight going through customs.) We rechecked our luggage and are told that we have to go to another building. Yep, you know what I am about to say...we floundered around, having to ask where to go several times. Finally, we found the right place and got on the bus. It then proceeded to go to various parking lots, dropping off and picking up other passengers. My husband and I looked at each other, worried that we were on the wrong bus. Since it was already 4 p.m. and we had not had lunch, we were getting very worried that we would not have time to grab lunch. \n\nFinally, my husband asked the driver and he indicated that we were indeed on the right bus. We continued going around parking lots until we came upon another bus. The driver told everyone on our bus that we could sit around and wait for 10-15 minutes, or we could get on the next bus and get there quicker. Of course, we all grabbed our suitcases and boarded the next bus, which proceeded to take us to the correct stop (after picking up additional passengers along the way.) \n\nNext ,we entered the terminal and jumped on an elevator to take us to the security line. There were only 2 lines and of course, we got in the line with the family who had to go back 6 or 7 times because they kept trying to go through the security line with belts on, shoes on, liquids in  their suitcases...you get the picture! \n\nAnyway, we finally got to our gate and were able to grab a slice of pizza before boarding our plane (not before enduring the antics of a 70-year-old United Airlines power-hungry granny who couldn't seem to get her act together, but was determined to show everyone who was boss...)", "business_id": "hW0Ne_HTHEAgGF1rAdmR-g", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-12-07", "type": "review"}

I read some reviews and I think a lot of people have no concept of what makes a good airport.  Oh, and complaining about the security searches?  Not PHX's fault...complain to the TSA.  \n\nSo, here's the good.\n\n1.  It's in the middle of the city.  I go to Denver a lot.  The airport is beautiful but it's so far out of the city.  I pity those on the SW side of the city.  But here in Phoenix, you can get to the airport in no more than 30 minutes even from the furthest fringes of the city.  From my house at 32nd & Camelback it's  a 10 minute drive over city streets.\n\n2.  It's easy to get around.  If you complain about this place, have you been to other major airports?  DFW compares nicely (entry from both sides, main thoroughfare with branches to terminals) but most are atrocious.  You can come in from the East or West...all airports don't have that.  Signage is very clear.  There are a lot of them, but they tell you exactly where to go if you just pay attention.  \n\n3.  Terminals are nice.  I'll admit, I only have small experience with Terminal 2 for a few United flights and I go to Terminal 4 for Southwest at least once a month.  Terminal 4 has nice new tile throughout, plenty of restaurant options with lots of space to eat.  Even Terminal 2 is comfortable even though it's older.  \n\n4.  Free WiFi.  Guess what...most don't have this.  DIA has it, but it's so slow it's worthless.  At PHX, it's fast and free and easy to connect. \n\n5.  Workstations.  At Terminal 4 at least (and maybe this is a Southwest thing) there are tables with AC and USB chargers for those of us that need to work while at the airport.  Very useful.  \n\nIn summary, if some of you used other major airports often you'd have a greater appreciation for PHX.

Not so much that I love spending a lot of time here, but in the fact that it gets me to where I want to go with less hassle than other places. In fact, in 2009, it ranked 3rd in the nation in on-time arrivals and 11th in on-time departures (out of the 31 major US airports).\n\nI tend to fly through Skyharbor a lot for someone who lives in the Northwest corner of the country. Some of this is due to my strategy of only connecting through warm-weather airports during the winter. This tends to avoid the episodes of being out on the tarmac and having the captain announce: \"We're going to wait here a few minutes because I think we could use a second coat of de-icer.\" Or being delayed by freak snowstorms. Or icestorms. I've got a second correlary to this which reads about not connecting through coastal airports during hurricane season, but that's not really relevant for this review...\n\nAnyways, I'm going with four stars since this is the first time I've dealt with the check-in routine at Skyharbor. I have two minor complaints: the first is the actual check-in and the second was security.\n\nAs for the check-in, it could just be an airline thing, but I saw this at several counters. They have the echeck-in booths, but were having people with luggage and carry-on both using these things with only a few counter people. What this does is make everyone wait while the (overworked) counter person tries to run around and check everyones' luggage in. I guess I'm used to having separate lines for those of us with carry-on only. Waiting in line behind the guys and girls with eight suitcases sort of defeats the purpose of travelling light (at least in this sense).\n\nThe second complaint is security. Hardly a new complaint, but it seems a bit tighter here than at most other airports I've been through. In the x-ray line, the person working the machine was very slow and was calling for a bag check on every other person. I considered even jumping into another line to see if it improved, but figured that might be considered suspicious behavoir and get pulled out for some sort of horrific interrogation (*light shining in my face as a person in the shadows asks questions* \"Doug C., I couldn't help but notice that you had a receipt from Taco Bell in your luggage.\" *slams fists on counter* \"ARE YOU A MEXICAN SPY? DO YOU WORK FOR THE FEDERALES?\")\n\nAs it turns out, staying in line didn't really work much better. Despite not setting off the alarm on the walk through, I got pulled aside for a pat-down. (And, yes, I have been working out. Thanks for noticing buddy.) Then the x-ray watcher stopped my bags to have them inspect the fluids that were clearly dangerous*. But after listening to a lecture and promising to floss three times a day, I was finally allowed to leave and exit for my flight.\n\nI only have one experience with this, but I guess I could sum it up with: nice airport, but arrive early.\n\n-----------------\n\n*As shown in the equation: 1/2 sample tube crest + 1 oz.

It's bright and open (at least the gates I've been to), and I recall a lot of nice carpeting being involved. Nothing wrong with that.\n\nThere's also an indescribably long moving sidewalk which I quite enjoyed. One of those strips of moving traction that Ellen DeGeneres said is like a ride in the middle of nowhere. Truth. In a moment of blissful immaturity, my friend and I tried running backwards on them. It may have ended in bumping into foreign businessmen, but it was worth it.\n\nI haven't been to an extensive area of the airport, just a few different gates and restaurants which were in a reasonable vicinity.

Sky Harbor is a very busy airport.  Everything makes sense when you follow the signs posted.  The layout of the airport is pretty simple as well.  It has three levels in terminal 4 where I was.  One bizarre thing I did notice was that you take an escalator down from level 3 to level 1, but must take an elevator to get back up.  And the elevators are not right next to escalator.  They're close.  You just have to search.  The information booths were very helpful in helping me locate them.\n\nThe only bad experience I had was at baggage claim.  Some of the baggage staff were barking curses and behaving like gangsters.  It definitely reflected poorly on the airport.  At one point, I thought they were going to fight each other over a lunch break.  I also heard some older baggage claim staff complaining openly about how the passengers do not care at all about the way they operate.  They seemed very disgruntled.\n\nSecurity was pretty tight.  In Orlando, I had to remove my shoes to go through security.  At Sky Harbor, everyone kept their shoes on.  I was randomly asked by a security guard to hold out my hands so they could pass a wand over them to look for signs of chemicals.  I've never experienced that before at any other airport.  It wasn't a bad experience.  I thought all airports had the same procedures for checking passengers, but I guess not.\n\nOverall, it was a good experience.  It was A-OK.  I know they can make it better.  There was a lot of construction going on outside the airport.  Maybe those improvements will help with traffic and parking?  Next they might want to look at hiring some new staff or taking better care of the current staff at baggage claim.", "business_id": "hW0Ne_HTHEAgGF1rAdmR-g", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-02-24", "type": "review"}

Thank you, Phoenix, for not implementing annoying security guards to tell me I can't wait at the curb 2 minutes for my arriving guests when i know theyre on their way out like some airports do (Indianapolis International is horrible about this practice).

The moving sidewalks are great for long treks and I've never waited longer than 10 mins in security lines even the day before Thanksgiving!!!\n\nMy only beef is that recently, they've removed more affordable fast food restaurants from the Southwest concourses.

I feel like they update it alot because it doesn't look old like alot of the other air ports do. They also have many different places to eat in the air port that are not ridiculously expensive like every other air port. I've never had a problem flying in or out and all of my flights have been on time. My favorite thing about this airport is that you CANNOT get lost. The airport kind of just flows so you get where your supposed to be. One more cool thing about Sky Harbor is the ceiling when you go down into baggage claim. It's the coolest mosaic of colored glass.

Well because I like the air port so much I won't give it one star. I'll give it two. This is why.\n\nI'm one of those people who has a really bad food allergy. So I have to travel everywhere with my epipen. Being the paranoid traveler I am, I called TSA and asked them what their policy was regarding an epipen. They told me that I could get it hand inspected and everything would be fine. So before I went on my trip I got a note from my doctor and had my prescription on it just in case I got hassled. \n\nSo when I left Hawaii everything was cool. They hand inspected it and I was through security within five minutes. It was super easy and not a big deal. When I went through Sky Harbor I had it out and separate from my bags and I calmed explained the situation to the TSA agent. He then proceeded to tell me that they could not hand inspected it and it had to go through the X-ray.  I then told them that it couldn't be X-rayed and it needed to be hand inspected. He then called 3 other TSA agents to surround me. While this was happening I kept being told it could not and WOULD not be hand inspected. And if I didn't let my EPIPEN get X-Rayed I would get strip searched and my bags would be hand searched for weapons and I would miss my plane. \n\nI finally got tired of being bullied and harassed and let them X-ray my epipen.

It is a very busy airport, indeed...but it is efficient, nonetheless. Also, before reading, keep in mind that TSA, across the board, is always a crapshoot of crapiness. I leave them out of my reviews, because we all know how \"lovely\" they are.\n\n~The Good~\nSky Harbor is one of the busiest airports in the world, and they are very efficient. I have never waited on the tarmac to take off, in my 27 years of flying out of the place. As air trends have evolved, so has Sky Harbor. We as a society locally have trended to hip and fun food joints, so what did Sky Harbor do? They brough in local popular  merchants like LGO and gave them their own stores in terminals. SCORE! I hate feeling like I am trapped in a cookie cutter food joint, so being able to attend an airport, and STILL eat local, that is full of win. Another nice thing is that Sky Harbor has volunteers that roam the terminals to guide aimless travelers. I have never used them, but they are always gracious and kind, and seem ready to help. \n\nBeing a big airport, you would think its a mess getting through the TSA. But since weather isn't a big issue, we can always count on arriving at a set time prior to flight to get ready for pre-boarding. I am a planner, so knowing I do not have to plan random variables is a big plus. The airport is right in the middle of all the action, and is 15 minutes away from most cities in Phoenix Metro. How much else can I say? They really did it right when they built this airport...and they continue to provide great service.\n\n~The Bad~\nI have no real complaints...The parking rates are goofy, but that's the same way it is at most airports...If you are parking and leaving your car for an extended period of time, there are vendors who can provide much cheaper options, so problemo solved! I think my only beef is with some of the expansions they have done, which seem  to not really have helped much. The people-mover they built seems to try to make us more of a tech-savvy or next-generation airport, but we aren't an inner-city kind of town, so the mover was, in my mind, a big waste of money. Oh well. Nice airport, just wish they would put money in the right spots.\n\n~The Down Low~\nGreat airport. No complaints. 5 stars for customer service, flight success rate, updated restaurant/amenity selections, location, and general ease of travel. Do not hesitate flying in to this airport, Phoenix is an awesome city with an awesome-sauce airport.

They also have ample parking...even during the holidays, when everybody and their Momma is at Sky Harbor, we can ALL find a place to put the car! Yeah!\n\n3. Getting through security is generally fast. (Note this comment is about speed...still have problems with the friendliness of the TSA staff. Most of the TSA staff around America, though, is the same...meh...However, in Kona, HI, you will find the most helpful TSA around: friendly, kind and helpful.)\n\n4. The selection/variety of eateries in the terminals has exploded. I saw also that they are now building a nice upscale restaurant as well.\n\n5. Bathrooms are always clean. Have yet to find a messy stall.\n\n6. Someone brillant allowed art galleries and gallery-like gift shops to exist. AMEN. So tired of airport crap shops. \n\nAnd I really DISLIKE this airport for a few reasons:\n\n1. Although the gastronomic selection is huge, why does the price tag of the meal have to be huge (and the size of the meal, small)? My son had an unexpected flight delay of 2+hours so I got him a grilled cheese sandwich at Paradise Bakery.....it was pitifully small. I was woefully unhappy to learn that we paid $10 for a sandwich, cookie and a drink. The sandwich was the size of two business cards.\n\n2. To be such a busy hub, I think we need more folks with the motorized carts\n\n3. We are in the digital age...can we have more places to plug in and charge up? This issue becomes really obvious when flights are delayed...\n\n4. What needs to be done to have faster wi-fi? I mean really, what needs to be done? This also painfully obvious when the airport is packed and there are 1000's of us logged on trying to connect with folks through our devices.\n\nThis place has come a long way...and yet still has some ways to go.

This airport ranks near the bottom for me, mainly due to the lack of outlets.  They've got a few of those standalone charging stations around, but every time I've gone through here, I see people playing the charger shuffle - walk around the concrete columns to see if there's an outlet, look along the walls, see someone else charging and grab a seat near them so you can take the outlet when they leave.\n\nThe seating and the like feel to be very dated - this is the kind of airport design I'd have expected to see in the 90s, not today.  \n\nWhile some gripe about the design of Terminal 4, I'm okay with it.  I've never had trouble making connections, but it does feel like I see more people running through this airport than others.\n\nOne benefit of the large distance between gates in Terminal 4 is that if you do have time to kill, there's plenty of opportunity to walk - everyone seems to stick to the people movers, so the aisle in the middle is super long - they've even branded this as the Sky Harbor Fitness Trail, and it's a little over a mile from end to end.\n\nIn any case, it's not like I have too much choice about what airport I end up going through, as I tend to go for the cheapest flight the four or so times I fly a year.  I just really wish they'd upgrade the gates so the seating was more modern, and put in outlets at the seats like every other airport seems to have done . . .", "business_id": "hW0Ne_HTHEAgGF1rAdmR-g", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-02-02", "type": "review"}

Easy TSA process\n2. Fabulous restaurants\n3. Easy navigation around entire airport including parking outside\n4. Extremely efficient pick up/drop off areas with plenty of space for everyone\n\n\nTo expand on each thing that I really enjoy...\n\nTSA Process:\nI frequently travel with just one carry on item and it's generally a process. I'm a frequent flier so I know how to breeze through the lines, if the airport recognizes this and lets me.  By that I mean doesn't stick me in a super long line behind people with a ton of baggage (or kids). (Sorry but it's true!)  Sky Harbor seems to \"get\" this more than other airports and frequently sends me and other people who don't have many items into a smaller, more quickly moving line.  Perhaps I'm totally wrong about this and it's just luck but it's something I've noticed after flying out of PHX dozens fo times.  \n\nAwesome Restaurants:\nNormally airports suck at food- they'll try to have options but instead of offering great restaurants they give you shitty options.  (I'm not sure which I'd rather have- no options or shitty options... probably shitty options.) Sky Harbor has a lot of options that are not shitty- not at all!  For example, last year they put in a Matt's Big Breakfast- if you're not from Phx or haven't visited or lived there for a period of time you probably don't know about the gem downtown that is Matt's big breakfast.  It is an awesome breakfast spot with bacon that is almost a half of an inch thick.  YEAH.  There are awesome food places in Sky Harbor and I always try to get there early just to eat.  A funny tidbit.... last year I was flying on Thanksgiving day and ended up having my Thanksgiving dinner at Chelsea's Kitchen outside of the TSA checkpoint at Sky Harbor- haha!\n\nEasy Navigation: \n\nThis one is pretty straightforward so the point I'll focus on here is that they are a stop on the light rail that runs all across the Valley.  I have frequently used this system and have found it foolproof.  Rarely to I trust public transportation when trying to get somewhere with a tight timeframe but I absolutely trust the light rail system with the Sky Harbor drop off points.  \n\nPick Up/ Drop Off Areas:\n\nLong story short (I've already written a novel- about an AIRPORT - I'm crazy.) they have really easy pick up drop off areas that are heavily monitored for stalling and it makes it really easy to get space to get in or out of the airport quickly! \n\nIf you need to have a long layover this is the airport to have it in!", "business_id": "hW0Ne_HTHEAgGF1rAdmR-g", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-12-30", "type": "review"}

She had an attitude and I knew didn't want to be there.\n\nThis time around I flew with Southwest and their gating area is actually split. It goes C1 to I think C8 was in one area and from C9 to C17 was in another. I'm sorry I forgot how many gates there were, and where it stopped from, but I remember that cuz I was supposed be @ gate C4 and then I got moved to gate C16 which was in another part. Well they have those comfy leather chairs that has outlets connected to them which made my wait time better.\n\nAlso getting to terminals 3 & 4 you have to take what they call the train to it. It's short travel time on it. I went on it and it was fun lol. It's all still connected but you do need to take it if need be.\n\nOverall I really like this airport.

For a large airport that is a hub for both US Air and Southwest, I guess it could be worse. Here is the breakdown:\n\nArrivals: All of the terminals connect to the main hub. You'll head downstairs for baggage claim and rental cars. If you're picking up someone curbside, be prepared to be frustrated because it's pretty much chaos during busy times.\n\nDepartures: If you have a rental car, make sure you arrive extra early to account for taking the shuttle and the long hike to whichever terminal you are flying from. Food options are okay - the airport is slowly moving from boring chains to more local places. The seating areas are usually pretty cramped and outlets can be found (especially in the Southwest terminals) but you're better off preparing for standing and no outlets.\n\nConnections: I always allow at least 45 minutes for a connection here. You may be tricked by thinking your connection is close because it is in the same terminal but there are a few spokes for each terminal so getting from C12 to C1 (for example) requires you to get to the end of your arriving terminal and then head to the other part of the terminal over the length of two moving walkways and then to the end of the next part of the terminal. Hope that paints a pretty enough picture. \n\nPro-tips: weather usually isn't an issue here so if you're flying in the winter, this is a good airport to use (just be aware of your connection time!)", "business_id": "hW0Ne_HTHEAgGF1rAdmR-g", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-02-23", "type": "review"}

The drop-off/pick-up at the Amtrak is conveniently located to the downtown area of Flagstaff - great restaurants/cafes and shops within walking distance as I waited for the next shuttle to Grand Canyon.

Much to my surprise, I experienced neither of the two.  The bus was perfectly on time and the staff was very helpful.  They must have been cheery due to the holidays.  I even had my own seat on the bus!!  The driver was very professional and hell-bent on sticking to the time schedule, which I liked a lot.  I'd say my experience on the LA Greyhound was good enough to try again.  I'd rate 5-stars but I don't think the experience was perfect.", "business_id": "MXFcSmW3m-9IXQEA_7l62g", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-01-03", "type": "review"}

Bought his ticket online and showed up at the Phoenix terminal this morning.\n\nHe was standing in line to get his bagged tagged and the woman in front of him was arguing with the tagger that she couldn't carry her own bag to the bus.  After a bit of back and forth, the tagger carried the bag for her, creating a few minute delay. During this time, several people without checked bags walked up to the counter, purchased tickets and boarded.  My husband finally got his bag tagged, went to board and was told nope, bus was full.  He, as well as the people behind him who had purchased advanced tickets, were not amused.\n\nThe next bus out was at 2:30AM (this was at 9AM) or they could route him a on a super scenic route that wouldn't get in until 11PM - well past when anyone could pick him up.  So, we'll try this again tomorrow, cutting his time with his family member by a day.\n\nI contacted Greyhound via FB and was told they don't have a reservation system basically it's first come, first serve, even if you're standing in line with your ticket while they sell tickets to more people.\n\nOkay, I can understand first come, first serve, but why on earth would they then sell tickets online with the date, time and bus number on them?  I'm pretty sure if my husband had missed this bus because of his error they wouldn't honor that ticket tomorrow so to me it seems like that ticket was for a seat on that bus and by issuing it, Greyhound needs to provide a seat.\n\nAm I missing something?  Because their explanation made no sense.  If it's going to be first come, first serve then the ticket I bought should be good for one fare from Phoenix to Point B on any day at any time ~ first come, first serve!\n\nWe have no choice but to go this route this time if my husband wants to see this family member he hasn't seen in years, but for future trips, I'll consider all other options ~ heck, hitchhiking might have got him there faster with less frustration (not to mention the time lost from work getting him to/from the bus station!).", "business_id": "MXFcSmW3m-9IXQEA_7l62g", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-12-18", "type": "review"}

I don't even know where to begin - and wish I could give ZERO stars!  One star is entirely too many!!!  Paid for my son to come from Amarillo, Texas, to Indio, California (I have a copy of the entire schedule) - again AMARILLO to INDIO!  The bus got to Phoenix, and there my son stayed!  There WAS NO BUS going to Indio, and he could receive no answers from the lady working behind the desk - evidently she was busy \"chatting\" with the security guard.  The bus my son was on, turned around and went to Tucson - not California!!!  While my son stood there, I tried to call the Phoenix bus station, and there was no answer.  I simply wanted to know when my son could board a bus to complete the rest of his trip, of which I paid for.  My son literally saw the lady ignore many incoming phone calls (5 of which were mine, before I finally gave up)!  As a result, my husband and I had to make a 9 hour round-trip \"road trip\" to pick up my son at the Phoenix bus station.  Will I be calling the main office of Greyhound demanding a partial refund?  YOU KNOW IT!!  Absolutely worthless organization!  People...trust me when I say the cost of flying might be a bit more expensive, but in the long run, worth every single dime!!!  Won't be using Greyhound again!!!!  Pathetic!!!!!", "business_id": "MXFcSmW3m-9IXQEA_7l62g", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-02-08", "type": "review"}

I've had great experiences in the past but this place is full of staff and bus drivers that are just not knowledgeable of anything.\n\nFirst, I called ahead to make sure I got priority seating. They confirm what it's true on the website; that they had priority seating for the bus ride I was taking, which is an express ride. When I got there, the gentleman working the counter said there is no priority seating, and that my bag would not need a tag when I asked for one, saying it was super full. Her told me I didn't need one.\n\nSo I got in line and I asked the guy loading the cargo if he thought it would be better to throw it under. He also confirmed it would fit up top. I got on the bus, but wasn't priority seated, even with my stamped \"A\" ticket told me I should be one of the first people on the bus. I was 3rd to last. Yay for being next to the smelly piss for 16 hours.\n\nOn the bus I couldn't fit my bag on the overheas bin so I put it on the seat next to me. Tai, the bus driver, came over to argue with me to make sure it went up top despite the fact that he let another gentleman keep his bag on his accompanying seat. When I told him the desk clerk and the baggage loader both told me I didn't need a tag and that it would fit, and of course that it was my responsibility to get a tag, he called me \"sweety\" derogatorily. Thanks for your sexism, but I don't identify as female asshole. He then shoved my bag up top and made it fit by damaging the contents, stating, \"See it does fit.\"\n\nThen I found out only half of the electricity works on the bus and of course it's the half of the bus I'm sitting on. Didn't I pay for this wifi?! Icing on this shit cake.\n\nSeriously difficult to deal with these people. They just really need to figure their shit out, so they don't lie to costumers one second just to have another employee say the opposite thing.", "business_id": "MXFcSmW3m-9IXQEA_7l62g", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-12-15", "type": "review"}
