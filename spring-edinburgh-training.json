You can also buy frozen if it suits your needs.\n\nI have been in many times now and have been more than happy with both their fish and shellfish - their uncooked king prawns (sourced from Spain) are of excellent quality and size (avg 12-14 prawns / kg) and given the quality, reasonably priced (about \u00a314/kg).", "business_id": "W3THJEcoHZZKgdJJdiFIWw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-03-12", "type": "review"}

From the tiny restaurant space, which feels intimate (and occasionally far too hot when it's busy) to the French waiters to the truly authentic menu, it really is like visiting a mini Paris in the inauspicious looking Grassmarket.\n\nThe food is excellent: for main course, I had the coq au vin, my companion had the sausage, and for appetiser the terrine and the escargots.  We were blown away by the food - although it is heavy so definitely go hungry!  The wine was also great - recommended by our waiter, whose service was attentive but not overbearing.\n\nIn general, highly recommend.
