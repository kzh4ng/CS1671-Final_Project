He has always taken the time to listen to our concerns and make sure we understand what is going on with our sons health. And as first time parents, my wife and I have had a ton of questions and concerns! \n\nMy wife and I will see any provider that is available and have never been disappointed. Recently, I saw their new Nurse Practitioner, Maureen, and was very pleased with her integrative and holistic approach, which is one thing my family likes the most about this office.  They aren't pill pushers, they don't just throw some antibiotics at you and send you on your way. They try to get to the root of the problem. We have never felt like we were just a number or like they were rushing through the appointment so they could meet their quota like at some of the other offices we have been to.\n\nOverall, my family has been thoroughly pleased with our experiences at Carolina Family Healthcare. My in-laws are patients there as well and they have never had a negative thing to say either. I would recommend this office to anyone and everyone.

I met my significant other there for her appointment, she arrived 12 minutes early I got there on time, she had called ahead to confirm that her appointment was on time knowing that she had a sales call 2 hours later. we waited in one of the many rooms to be seen, about 30 min goes by and the door doesn't open, she sticks her head out to ask how much longer it would be and they did not know, we got the line\"he is with other patients\". 5 min later a guy in a football jersey walks in to talk with us,some kind of assistant, no tags, nothing, he is not the doctor we find out, she explains she has been sitting in their office for 50 min and wants to be seen by the doctor because the steroids he put her on are not helping with major skin irritations, shes suffering and it obvious. The football jersey guy says \" this is medicine we don't know how long it will take each patient and that this is probably not the office for you\", cant make this stuff up, now remember she called 15 min prior and confirmed there was no delays. she asked to speak to the doctor and he said the doc would be in in 5 min, 5 minutes later 2 women walk in, no uniforms, ones in old jeans and again an old football jersey the other i don't know what to say, it was surreal, they tell the patient they have a referral for her and they don't want to treat her because they felt she was being rude.

Not only is the staff incompetent, but they are very rude and treat you with disrespect. Their main concern is collecting money from patients and do not care about how the patient is feeling. Today I took a friend of mine, who has been sick for 3 days with a high temperature of 103, to visit  this office because he didn't have health insurance and I wanted to pay for him in order for him to receive care. They charged me $200 and we waited to be seen. Our regular doctor, Dr. Chris was unavailable and Dr. Dino was busy, so we were forced to see Dr. Kristen Spratt. Anybody who has has ever used Dr. Kristen Spratt would understand when I say she is incompetent. I guess these days anyone can become a doctor since a letter score of C in medical school is considered to be passing. That's not my point anyway. So Dr. Kristen Spratt checked my friend, if that's what you want to call it, and said that even though you have a high temperature and are very sick I cannot give you any medicine and you will have to wait and if you are still sick by the end of the week come back Monday. I explained to this genius doctor that my friend is very sick and can't wait and needs medicine and cannot come back because he does not have health insurance and can't afford to come back. So she got very emotional and denied giving him medicine. I asked to speak to Dr. Dino regarding this matter and he refused to see me. After my friend and I left, I recieved a call from the office saying that I am no longer welcomed at their office and I was in effect kicked out. Not to mention my family and I have been patients of theirs for a long time and we have brought Dr. Dino a lot of business over the past years.  I am a very sick man and need doctor care and it is very bad for Dr. Dino to refuse to see me. I am very disappointed by the way I was treated and would like for everyone to know about his office and to not go visit this very poor example of a medical establishment.

After being kicked out of the office last week and told that I am not allowed to return, I received a letter from them explaining their reasoning. It stated that their reason for kicking me out of their practice was because I used offensive language and raised my voice at the staff. This is a complete lie and false accusations since I never raised my voice at any of the staff or doctors in the office or used\u00a0offensive language. All I did was ask the doctor to give medicine to my sick friend, who had a high temperature and was about to pass out. I didn't use any offensive language or raise my voice. I spoke in a very calm and nice way and only urged the doctor to give my friend some medicine in order for him to get better.

Next, we went down to the lobby area to eat dinner. When we tried to order, we were told that they were \"out\" of both items we requested. Then, the items we did order tasted like the equivalent of a Stouffer's microwave dinner and the dessert was rubbery and a waste of money.\n\nNext, in the morning, when we went to get ready, we had to bathe in our own dirt because the shower drain was clogged. I literally filled the tub with shower water that didn't go down all the way until we were almost ready to check out.

I had not had a Dominos pizza for a while so I wanted to see if they had improved the quality of their product. I went online to place the order and the process for that was pretty basic and simple. Pretty good site. A large Brooklyn style half extra cheese, half cheese and hamburger for my 8 year old. Also had to try some little chicken/bacon/cheese bites just because. \n\nOk, I've got to tell you, when the \"pizza tracker\" popped up I had to give them credit for making me feel better about waiting.  Very inventive. I placed the order at 5:01 and got a message that at 5:02 Jason had begun making my order. nice Jason. The tracker told me my order was being prepped, then they were firing up my pizza. A little while later when someone yelled, \"Is the pizza here,\" I said, \"No, the pizza tracker says at 5:16 it was finishing baking and Jason was double checking it for perfection.\" Nice.  \n\nThen at 5:25PM. when I'm in the other room watching the playoff game, my computer starting talking to me telling me to be on the lookout for the driver as she, Rachel, had left the store. Oh wait, 5:32PM and Rachel arrived.  That's awesome!! super fast accurate delivery. They crushed everyone else by a long shot.\n\nSo for the important stuff.  How did it taste?. Well out of the gate there is really no way any fast food, mass produced company can really make the best pizza for the prices they sell at so that is just a given for me.  That said, while it is not Vinnies neighborhood pizza from Brooklyn, it is pretty great.  The Brooklyn style was a hand tossed much thinner and much more like a NY style pizza. Not a bready as the normal pizza so a plus in my eyes.  They also slice them in larger slices like un north so one big piece almost has you full.  The extra cheese side was better than the regular cheese and hamburger but overall it was much better than I ever remembered and I will use the online service again.

Perhaps better than even this amazing features is the fact that if you find the right floor, you do not even have to set foot on the street below - you can cross directly into the building of your choice by way of the Overstreet Mall, moving from one building to the next (assuming of course that your building is actually connected in this way).

This was so refreshing after a very long day of multiple flight connections and shoddy treatment by surly American Airlines staff.\n\nThe price was very reasonable - less than $90 (online special) for one of the nights near Thanksgiving.  The location is perfect should you wish to explore downtown Charlotte - you are smack dab in the heart of things, close to bars, restaurants, and coffeeshops, but far away enough that the noise of the grittier downtown nightclub scene doesn't infringe on your sleeping experience.\n\nSo why the three stars?  \n\nThe bed in our room was the most uncomfortable bed I have ever encountered in my life.  There was a really deep pit in the very middle that kept my husband and I awake all night as we kept fighting our way out of the sunken pit and over to the edge.  There was no relief.  We both have bad backs - I'm actually in physical therapy for mine - and the bed really set our trip off badly, as it re-injured my fragile muscles and caused me to be in pain for the week of Thanksgiving.  My husband ended up sleeping on the floor.  \n\nIf the bed had been even remotely comfortable this would be a five-star hotel.", "business_id": "zwwmnQXk8jhFs4wwU8I4Ow", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-01-07", "type": "review"}

There was 5 of us in our party and we had this beautiful Old Victorian House to ourselves!! We were the only reservation they had that evening the server insisted they were fully booked the rest of the week though!\n\nIf you have never been or never heard of them before, they ask for you and your party to call in how many courses and what entree choice you would like the day before so that they can plan a menu specifically for your party. We opted for the \"Premiere\" which was the 5 courses for $79 each.\n\nThe house was beautifully decorated with a Christmas tree in each room each with a different theme. Very warm and of course a lot of history! \n\nI chose the Braised Coq au Vin  wrapped in Prosciutto served with couscous and a mushroom reduction...it was dry edible but dry. I only got that so that everyone was eating something different! I should have chosen the Osso Bucco!! Everyone else loved their entrees!!  I really enjoyed everything that they served before it.

I actually feel bad about giving them a negative review because they seem like really nice people.  \n\nAnd the house is very old and interesting but that's not the definition of four star. Grandma's china and chilled forks and old fashioned service was adequate but certain things just put it off; like the dingy rugs in the bathroom and the shabby landscaping and I don't know what all actually.  Just felt a little amateurish.\n\nI did really enjoy the pear salad but the mushroom soup starter was cold and what really loses the stars for me is the mediocre entree of undercooked pork and tough steak.  Really disappointing.  I loved the sweet potato puree that came with it but it was the only flavor on the plate.  And that undercooked pork was inedible and I don't even mind a little pink.  This was raw in the center and mine wasn't the only one.  No one wanted to complain as it was a customer event.  But I would have sent it back if I were on my own.\n\nThe desert was your typical banquet style flourless chocolate cake but no coffee was offered.  Which may have been the planners fault but I really could have used some.\n\nOverall, a pleasant experience but doesn't live up to the reviews or the price tag.

I know what works and what doesnt, and what i should expect when eatting at places. With that being said.\n\nMy wife and dined here and i was very disappionted with the over all experiance.  I think the thing that bothered me the most was the wine manager, after saying that we would be hving a 6 course dinner and would not be pairing it with the wine but would be ordering individual glasses of wine and cocktails he just lost all interest in providing an enjoyable experiance.\n After ordering our first drinks and finishing it, a manhattan for myself and champagne for her i was asked if we would like another drink; which i agreed to. instead of bringing out the wine menu again i was made to just state what type of wine i would like, the sommelier brought a glass of cab and just dropped it at the table- no mention of year, make, and region, just a heres a glass of wine, i didnt know if it was a 5 dollar a bottle wine or a 35 dollar a glass wine, nothing. And on top of it all it was corked. \nLuckally they removed it and took it off the bill, they brought out another and the som just dropped it off again, i had to stop him before he walked away and ask what he just gave us, he repllied a cabernet. I litterally had to prompt him with \" where does it come from, when was it made, who makes it.\"\n\nIf i could grade just the som i would give him a zero, the man has given up on even trying to provide for his clients.\n\nGetting into the food, it was ok not worth what we paid for, the amuse was enjoyable, as well as the duck which was cooked perfectly, but the other 4 courss were average. The smoked sweet potato puree, coupled with the beef and sauce was just way too sweet, totally killed the meat.\n\nI think what put the nail in the coffin while eatting here was the check at the end.  They automatically add 20% gratutity to the bill, it doesnt matter what type of service you get. With the staff already nowing they are getting theirs is it any wonder they could care less.\nFour star 4 diamond yea right.", "business_id": "USdRzNk14UdjZWFgBJb0wA", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-02-14", "type": "review"}

Located in a beautiful Fourth Ward Victorian house, you are dining in an elegant setting. Make sure that you really like the person you're with because an evening at McNinch House is an investment in time. Enjoy yourself - do not feel rushed - pace your beverages - dinner will definitely take a while.\n\nMy dining partner and I chose the four course dinner. There are options that offer additional courses as well as wine parings if you wish. Wine is also available by the glass, bottle and as flights. \n\nWe chose crab cakes as our first course. When the plates were served, I thought I was seeing two small biscuits on the plate (yes, the lighting is somewhat dim.) The crab cakes were beautiful and wonderful. The two crab cakes were predominantly chunks of crab with very little seasoning, dusted with a soft flour and very lightly browned. They were served with a lightly dressed slaw and the combination was right on. Perfect. \n\nBeing in a crab state of mind, we chose she crab soup for our second course. The creme fraiche made in house really added to the flavor of this dish. The small addition of sherry was just right.\n\nMy companion and I parted company with the entree. She had the rack of lamb and I chose the duck breast. The rack of lamb was cooked to perfection, nicely displayed and exactly what she expected. My duck breast was also perfectly cooked. It was served with a cherry reduction and sweet potato hash. \n\nFor dessert, we chose their evening's cheesecake. Thinking I would receive the normal size portion, I thought I would be wasting much of my dessert. When the plates arrived, I was very pleased to see a beautiful, small portion. The flavor was wonderful. I ate the whole thing! It was just right.\n\nWith one exception, the food was five stars. Unfortunately I detected a slight burned flavor in the cherry reduction. It was about 30 seconds too cooked. But that was not enough to ruin the whole food experience.\n\nMy greater concern involved service. McNinch House is a first class restaurant. I didn't feel like the service was first class for these reasons: we arrived about 10 minutes before our reservation time. The door was locked and after a while we were met at the door by one of the servers. We felt awkward when he said for us to wait and look around if we wished. I would have preferred him to take my coat then and offer to take a drink order. The waiting was not a problem, the awkwardness was. Secondly, the servers did not stick with the tried and true rules of which side to serve and from which side to remove plates. In several instances the servers crossed in front of us to remove something from the table in spite of the fact there was plenty of room behind both of us. Lastly, I don't mind an automatic gratuity and I don't object to a 20% gratuity since I normally tip that amount anyway. What I do object to is tipping on the taxed amount. This means I am tipping on more than 20% and I don't think that is right at all.\n\nI hope to someday return to McNinch House.

We sat down & were checked on very regularly by whom I assuming is one of the owners.  Real cool laid back kind of guy.  \n\nAs per usual, we got an order of wings (wild flavor) & I had my mind all made up to try something different today off of the menu (usually eat a burger or London broil sandwich), but was told of two specials that both sounded incredible.  The first one, grilled cheese with hearty chicken stew, is what I had.  My friend and his brother had the other special, meatloaf w/ onions on rye bread.  Everything was tasty and great as always.  The wings are hands down some of my favorite anywhere.  My friend also got some crab soup which he said was very good.  \n\nHands down one of my favorite places in Charlotte and can say without a doubt have never even had a mediocre experience here, let alone a bad one.

From the beautiful wooden ceiling to the lovingly salvaged bar, to the incredibly awesome beer fridge, everything inside says \"Welcome. Stay awhile.\"\n\nsecond Ace: a lovingly selected beer list. Small, but thoughtful, this one had a few surprises even for me! There's big names like Duvel and Sierra Nevada, local beers from Asheville, Mooresville, and Charlotte, and even a few Germans you might not expect - Neumarkt and Moos are usually not beer producing cities you see in the US. Well, not Chicago anyway.\n\nthird ace: the food. Since the restaurant industry is label-obsessed, I'll make one up: upgraded comfort pub grub. Could a few of the ingredients benefit from the upgrade? Sure. But this is not a \"blow your mind with something new\" kind of place. It is a \"let you know that everything is right with the world by doing the simple things well\" kind of place. For example: The meatloaf is tender and meaty. The Reuben -- a sandwich invented at the Blackstone Hotel in Omaha, NE, yeah, that's right NYC, take your 'We invented everything' God complex and stuff it! -- is solid with rye bread that leaves seeds in your teeth, an unabashed amount of salty sauerkraut, and just enough 1000 Island to moisten the affair.\n\nFourth ace: Did I mention the beer fridge?

You can't turn down 9th from Tryon, as 9th is split into two sections and you won't be able to drive direct. Also, parking is sparse. Find a place around the neighborhood and walk a few blocks. There is plenty of residential 2hr parking on the streets. \n\nSat at the bar and loved every creek and crack of the old floors and pillars. It's kind of tight quarters, but it gives it a cool pub feel. The taps coming directly out of the old cabinet style system is just gorgeous. Tons of local brews and some other fine beer choices were available. Didn't indulge as it was a 1pm lunch. I ended up order the london broil sandwich. Goodness gracious I'm glad I did, too.

Years ago, this was a regular spot. I remembered the room was dark, food was good, and the infamous pole in the lady's room. So on a recent cold winter night, while Melissa & I were trying to figure out where to eat, knowing this is her regular spot, I said Alexander Michael's!\n\nParking is always a challenge. Luckily we got a spot down the road off the side street. However the darkness is a little creepy... I feel like I need a buddy system to park there (find a friend, hold hands, and walk together like we were in grade school).  The embiance was perfect for a cold night with the lit candles and closely spaced seatings. We got a table very quickly, but that's as much service as we got that night. There wasn't any incident. The waitress wasn't rude, but she just wasn't there. For a small place like this, it should be pretty easy to take good care of every table.  \n\nThe food was ok as well. I ordered the london broil sandwich with the soup as side. I forgot the \"crab\" soup was made with fake crab, which I think should be illegal to be called crab. My sandwich had enough meat on it that I pretty much just ate all the meat, which was average. Tender enough, not too much taste to it.  I guess for $9.50 I couldn't complain. Years later, I felt that their menu was limited, a little overpriced, and seems to be lacking a spark in general with food and service.\n\nI will give it a 2nd chance and visit again, maybe not anytime soon.", "business_id": "ePP0Eqz8JKSbtdt2phiB4A", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-02-24", "type": "review"}

Please, pass on it.\n\nThe London Broil arrived medium well, instead of medium rare.  Figured it was my error at being maybe misunderstood.  No, the waiter was quick to tell me I ordered medium rare.  Took it back and returned with medium rare on the rare side, just the way I like it.  By now, my companions had finished eating.  The meat was so tough, I gave up after a few pieces.  Nothing to write home about.\n\nParking issue.  There is a parking lot two doors before the restaurant. There is street parking all around if you arrive early enough.  Personally it won't be an issue because I won't be venturing back anytime soon.  \n\nDon't understand the hype. It a neat place.

No different here at this location.

I grabbed a seat at the counter to watch the chaos in the Kitchen, and to watch the ONE waitress bust her tail in order to make her customers happy. I also find it amazing how very hard Latino cooks work back in the kitchen, and how quickly they can switch from getting their orders in English yet speak Spanish back there among each other. Their head cook was about as hard working an Expeditor as I've seen, repeating every order and making sure his line cooks get it done right.\n\nMy little blonde waitress was filling in for someone who apparently called in sick, and she was uber busy yet kept me happy with coffee and getting my order in and to me very quickly (like 5 minutes). \n\nSo I'd say the STAFF here easily gets 5 STARS. Very hard working and efficient.\n\nNow that I've painted the picture on how this place operates, let me tell you about my Greek Omelet. I got it with Gyro meat and grilled onions, and it was very good! Hash browns and English Muffin were acceptable and average. But the Greek Omelet was filled with tomatoes, feta cheese, gyro meat, grilled onions and some Greek spices. Not overcooked and quite tasty overall. Good size too.\n\nI got about the most expensive thing on the menu and had a coffee and it came out to just over $10. They have MANY breakfast items that hover around $5 if you didn't want to get one of their \"signature\" dishes.\n\nSo if you're Uptown and want a good, home cooked meal, come to Showmars....just don't expect Dean and Deluca quality (nor their prices).", "business_id": "ASwN3Ih0Eh1oH0npLbzVjA", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-01-30", "type": "review"}

I ordered my first $47.00 fillet mignon and I was eager to see if it really was that much better than what you would get at Outback Steakhouse.  It was  better but not proportionately better than what you would pay at Outback.  We had a 9:00PM reservation and they told us to wait in the bar and they would come and get us when the table was ready.  We waited about 15 minuets and saw tables empty and then we went and asked if our table ready.  So I think they forgot about us.  We ordered the chopped salad for $10.00 and it was nothing special, my wife ordered the salmon which was not as good as I could cook on the grill at home.  The New York Cheesecake for desert was no better than anything I would buy in a grocery store.  I guess if I am going to drop $150.00 for dinner I expect outstanding food and service.  Neither of which I think we received.

She had been there before and told me to prepare myself for probably the best meal I will ever eat.  And as much as I hate to admit this .....\n\n......she was right.\n\nLike other reviewers had stated, valet parking is a must unless you know of a perfect hidden gem of a parking lot.\n\nThe food.  Oh the food.  I was unsure what cut of steak to go with and my server recommended his favorite cut.  To be honest, I can't tell you what it was, but it was beautiful and perfectly cooked.  We ordered two sides to split.  The server told us that both of these are on their new menu which hadn't been printed yet by the time we were there.  One was a scalloped potato that was phenomenal.  But my favorite of the two sides was the creamed corn with tasso ham.  I was so enamored with it, I jotted down what was in it so I could try to replicate it at home!  Haven't tried to yet, and I'm sure my culinary prowess will get me CLOSE, but I would rather get it from Morton's.\n\nFor dessert I HAD to go with the molten lava cake which is apparently their best dessert and for just cause.  It was incredible!  If only I weren't so full on my sensational steak and sides (pardon the alliteration!), I could have finished it all.  \n\nAll in all, I WILL go back to Morton's, and I really really hope they have the creamed corn again!", "business_id": "Lt9o2RmacVY2L-IWLA8uTg", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-01-03", "type": "review"}

My wife, daughter, and I live here now, and while yes, it's a mixed-income community, we absolutely love it.  We live two short blocks from Imaginon and 7th Street Public Market, three blocks from the TWC Arena, and a short walk to the center of Uptown.  The whole Uptown loop is walkable from here.\n\nThe maintenance guys are all super friendly, the leasing office does what they can (they're often overworked and overwhelmed with all the joys that come with managing a mixed-income development), and we couldn't be happier with our decision to move in here.\n\nAll that said, know what you're getting into! This property is not a $2000 per month place with all the amenities.  It's not an all-white, upper class enclave.  It's a diverse (both ethnically and socio-economically) community that has a little bit of crime, a little bit of wear-and-tear, and a little bit of noise.  We've called 911 a few times since moving in to report things happening out on 8th street late at night, but we've never felt in danger ourselves. There isn't a secured parking garage, but there is a security company that patrols and cops respond in less than 5 minutes to any sort of call.  And our oven has gone out in our apartment, but other than that our place has been great. There's a pool for resident use in the summer, and when First Ward Park is finished later this year, it'll be a near-perfect place to live.\n\nThis is city living at an affordable price.

Not once have I had a bad seat. I love the location and it's proximity to parking and restaurants. It makes for a great girls night out. \n\nAll of the staff are very nice and willing to help. The theater can be hot at times, but the staff is usually very aware and will turn on extra ac if it gets too warm for the majority. Also the staff does a fantastic job at intermission with the ladies bathroom. They usually have 2-3 attendants pointing where to go and which stall is unoccupied. It makes the line go very quick, which I am appreciative. I like that they have drinks and snacks available to buy. $7 for a single pour mixed drink $10 for a double.  You can have your drinks in the theater but no food. \n\nWith all of this being said, and of the around 10 shows I have been to I  have never had a problem... until Rock of Ages last Friday. There was an obnoxious group of drunk people who would not stop talking and singing louder than the actors. At one point yelling a profanity so loud (from the Mezzanine section) the actor looked up at her. After about 10 minutes I pulled aside the door person looking over the section to make sure people didn't have phones or food and asked her to say something. These people were on the end of the row literally right in front of her so I thought she would say something before I asked her. She told me she would go to her supervisor to ask him to say something. Totally cool, you only have so much authority. So we waited... and waited and listened to these people ruin the show. Nobody said a word. Not. One. I watched other employees come in and stare at them. I watched other people around get upset their experience was being ruined. And I watched the drunk group go in and out and get more and more drinks, apparently nobody stopped serving them. \n\nThis was totally unacceptable. The staff did nothing and said nothing. Continued to serve these people, and watched idly as they dumped at least 4 drinks all over the floor.\n\nSad, that I will have to rethink the next time I come to the Belk Theater.", "business_id": "IFwRwGoz4B7glSzA84NWcg", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-02-26", "type": "review"}

Granted, the place only offers sandwiches (and salads too I guess) at noon, but they are absolutely, positively, worth the trip. \n\nAlmost everdyday the lunch menu offers a \"special,\" which tends to be the most succulent sandwich filler one could ever conjure up in their kitchen. They take a perfectly roasted pork loin, for example, and carve thick slices, which are then layered on top of a freshly baked roll. These rolls are never crunchy or stale; they don't cut the roof of your mouth when you bite in (ouch!), nor do they get soggy when adding condoments. I'm not quite sure how this phenomenon is achieved, but it's kudos-worthy. I hate when my tomato becomes part of the bread. BLEAGH. These rolls on the contrary, are so fresh and soft, they're practically falling apart, until glued in place by the panini grill. Unlike other delis/lunch spots, you should keep your sandwich simple, because the ingredients and toppings are so fresh and flavorful it would be a shame to spoil the fun. The special pork sandwich with mustard, cheese, lettuce, and tomato is mind-bogglingly good, and I have often heard that the turkey with cranberry being referred to as \"Christmas in a bun.\" You decide.\n\nAND YOU GET A PICKLE!! I mean seriously, just when you thought life couldn't get any better, you get a pickle for the win. \n\nI'll definitely be filling out my loyalty card here (8 sandwiches, get one free).

I digress.....Anyway, I ordered their Fish and Chips, not necessarily a \"safe bet\" here in Charlotte, because most use fishy Cod. But thankfully, the fish here was HADDOCK! Which is a mild and yummy fish, much like Halibut. And Haddock is what the BEST Fish and Chips are made from, especially in England.\n\nWell, suffice it to say, these were the BEST Fish and Chips I had here in Charlotte! The batter was LIGHT, and not overly done which most tend to do. And it was very tasty too. Combine that with the quality of the fish, and the yummy Tartar Sauce, and it was a GREAT meal!\n\nMy wife had the Guiness Beef Stew, which also was yummy. A little small for me (I'm a big guy), but perfect for her petite frame.\n\nThey had a great premium/microbrew list. I had the Allagash Stout from Maine, and it was a 750ml bottle! Wow, and it cost $18.00 too. Not really bad, but my ONLY complaint that I did share with them was that they did NOT list any prices on their liquor list. I didn't realize that 1) the beer was 750ml and 2) it cost $18.00! You would figure that a Restaurant actually publish their prices (except for the really high end places which employ the snobby tactic of, \"if you have to ask, you can't afford it\" BS.)\n\nOverall, this was a great meal. I come here for lunch all the time as I work down the street in Uptown. And if you go here for lunch, try their burgers, which are great. One of the ONLY places here in Charlotte that actually know HOW to make CRISPY bacon! I HATE, repeat, HATE, soggy bacon!", "business_id": "WuCcv_Dyd_1B_1-4jwK7sQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-02-12", "type": "review"}

However, I hate the uptown (parking makes me anxious), so my visits, unfortunately, are too few and too far between.  In 2009 when I read that they had a fire and would be closing down for a bit for renovations, I am fairly certain a tear or two rolled down my cheek.  My arteries opened a lil bit, but I was mildly distraught.  Thank goodness they did the renovation and re-opened!\n\nRecently before an event at Blumenthal, my date and I schlepped it over to the Ri Ra.  After parking at the BoA deck, it was a short walk, and was only a few quick steps away from our final destination of Blumenthal/Belk to see a concert.\n\nWant to sit at the bar?  There are 2 beautiful dark wood bars to park your rump at to slurp down syrupy beers and shots.  High tables with stools?  Got those.  Tables that you can get up and down from without flashing your stuff if you have on a skirt?  Have those too.  2 floors of seating, all dark and lovely, give you plenty of room to pop a squat and enjoy some Irish/bar food at it's finest.  There is even a small terrace/patio upstairs for enjoying Carolina blue days when it is a little warmer out.\n\nMy secret dream in life is to find a nice Irish boy to move to the green, green Irish countryside with to spend my days waiting for his liver to pickle/fail.  I LOVE corned beef and cabbage - it's a sickness really.  And while I love to make it, it stinks up the house, so it's always nice to be able to find this delicious dish where it stinks up someone else's kitchen.  The corned beef and cabbage at Ri Ra is delicious.  The corned beef is tender and not terribly stringy.  Well flavored.  the cabbage is... well... cabbage.  Cabbage-y.  Cabbage-ish.  Nothing fancy, just good.  The mashed potatoes that go with are creamy without being runny.  Hearty Irish fair for a green-eyed girl.  \n\nFor an appetizer, we ordered the Spinach and Artichoke dip which is served with a portion of sliced baguette.  YUM!  Creamy, cheesy, good.  When it hits the table, resist the urge to dig in immediately, or you will be peeling the top layer of skin in your mouth off for the rest of the night.  HOT.  Molten hot.  I previously had the corned beef/cabbage/mashed potato egg rolls, but I didn't see those on the menu.  That was a bummer because they were off the hook good.\n\nI followed the dip with the corned beef and cabbage.  Happy tummy.\n\nWe decided to split a dessert and got the peach pie.  That was not a winner.  I don't know where on the pie our slice was, but it was the part with no peaches in it.  I think I accidentally ate one, but I may be mistaken.  Normally I am too full to eat dessert anyway, so this isn't a deal breaker, but I won't be getting that again.\n\nOn previous visits I have had the Reuben, which is stuffed with tender corned beef and served with a side. The colcannon side is tasty(mashed potatoes with cabbage mixed in).  The macaroni and cheese is creamy with a crumb topping.  So many things on the menu look delicious, but I almost always stick to my standard Spinach dip and then corned beef and cabbage.  \n\nGreat bar/restaurant, awesome ambiance and great food!", "business_id": "WuCcv_Dyd_1B_1-4jwK7sQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-12-04", "type": "review"}

It's always a guessing game when you pick a restaurant in a strange city. Even with reviews to check out, you never know what you might get. Ri Ra had good solid reviews, however, and was within walking distance of our hotel, which was a deciding factor!\n\nIt was fairly busy when we got there and there was a trivia round going, which was slightly annoying, since it echoed through the whole restaurant, but we were there early and once the game ended, it was much better.\n\nWe were impressed with the selection of import and local beers. I stuck with Smithwick's but my partner was a little more adventurous and tried several local NC beers, all of which were good. \n\nWe started with the hummus appeitzer, expecting the usual bowl of hummus and sliced pita. We were more than pleasantly surprised when what we got was the hummus, toasted pita, and a selection of roasted red peppers, olives, marinated artichokes, and cucumber and celery for dipping. The hummus itself was excellent, garlicky and spicy. \n\nI had the Irish curried chicken over rice and it was quite good. The curry was sweetish, but still had a nice bite to the finish. The chicken was all white meat and nicely tender, and the peppers and onions that were in the curry were delicious.\n\nMy partner had the Guinness beef and veggie stew, which was also really good. There was lots of beef in the stew and the Guinness added a really different (and delicious) flavor. \n\nOnce the trivia game was over, the atmosphere was great. Music was fun but not too loud for conversation. Our server was friendly and helpful. She made great food and drink suggestions, and even gave us info on places to check out during the rest of our trip. \n\nRi Ra is definitely a solid 4* and we'll be back the next time we're in Charlotte.", "business_id": "WuCcv_Dyd_1B_1-4jwK7sQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-12-13", "type": "review"}

My Reuben was the same price as my dang appetizer!  Haha. The Reuben was sadly not that great, the bread was soggy, and it was missing some more much needed sauerkraut. It just didn't have the tang or crunch I was looking for. The meat was a bit dry and bland as well.\n\nMy friend had the Fish & Chips Regular portion ($13.95). He said they were good, but could've been crispier. I'm not sure if the batter was exactly his favorite.\n\nThe first time I went to Ri Ra's with a group I had the Guinness BBQ Burger ($10.95) I liked this - yummy onion rings and Guinness BBQ sauce on top.\n\nSo overall - okay food good vibes.

The waitress was practically all but ignoring us.  We only got offered one round of drinks, never asked if we wanted a second round.  We had to ask for our silverware/napkins after our food came, and did not get it until at least 10 minutes later about halfway through the meal. All the while watching the group of guys next to us get service repeatedly (when they asked her to get something, she would immediately come back to their table, not disappear for 10 minutes then have to be asked again when she did finally return). Aside from just being terrible, she was also unfriendly.  \n\nAs for the food, all my friends seemed to enjoy/appreciate their meals.  For about 8-10$, you get a huge sandwich/burger and a side of fries.  Except $8 for a basket of chip and cheese dip is ridiculously overpriced to me.\n\nAs a vegetarian, it was entirely another matter for me.  Not wanting a \"veggie\" burger, I ordered the buffalo blue cheese dip + potato wedges/chips + vegetables off the appetizer menu.  What was delivered was a basket of chips and cheese dip. When I asked the waitress if I was correct that the menu listed vegetables as well, she said \"yeah, it should come with it\" as if I was asking too much for the kitchen to produce what the menu says.  It wasn't actually until I explained the vegetable part was the reason I ordered this dish that she \"offered\" to get them for me.  She disappears. Ten minutes later, my friends halfway through their meal, no vegetables in sight, but at least we have silverware and napkins now.  Five minutes later, she hears us loudly complaining, and says shes told the kitchen twice now.. yeah right. Another ten minutes later, we're complaining real loud now, to ourselves because no staff member is in sight.  Soon the manager appears and says the vegetables will be out soon and apologizes.  My cheese dip and potato chips are not semi-warm, at best. He returns, and in a pretentiously apologetic manner sets done a plate and gets ready to scurry off before I can complain about: THREE 6-inch cuts of celery, and TWO 4-inch by 1-inch hunks of a carrot, completely RAW.  It took them 25 minutes to bring this out to me, and then act as if this would suffice without any compensation.  We immediately asked for a box and a discount. \n\nYes, he discounted us 10% of our final bill, which I think came out to deducting my cheese dip and chips, plus half of my beer.  The waitress brought it out as one check too, not asking if us 2 men and 2 women (obviously 2 couples), would have wanted the check split.\n\nThe kicker: the sidewalk sign outside their door read \"Charlotte's Finest\" ...

I'm here on business from Oregon and not only don't smoke cigars, but it wouldn't dawn on me that a hotel would support a cigar bar.  But then, this is the South, and we're in tobacco country (sadly).  I'm a public health professional, and am pretty mortified that the National Association of Public Health Institutes would choose to hold a conference in a hotel that not only had a cigar bar, but reeked of stale cigar smoke.  But, to give them the benefit of the doubt, I'm sure they never thought to ask.\n\nSo, you get where this is going, right?  Walking into the hotel, it smelled stale.  They sent me to a room (on the 8th floor) that smelled totally moldy - I kept wondering if they had been involved in a flood - did Hurricane Sandy hit here?  I thought another room might help.

It's a pretty filling order and I'd say a good 800 calories after licking up the remaining crumbs. \n\nIf you're into gorging at lunch time, they have a number of \"cutlet\" sandwiches which are basically fried filets of chicken in sandwich form. Chicken Parm and Popeye's are pretty delicioso. \n\nI don't see the need to comment on service since it's not a sit down place.

As we embarked on our quest, we ended up near the Arboretum, and as we drove through the parking lot, we were amazed to find a whole new section of the shopping center that neither of us had even known existed.  \n\nWe were shocked to see a row of restaurants representing all different cuisines from standard American fare like Chili's to Chinese (Cherry Blossom), quick Mexican (Qdoba), Asian (Malaya Kitchen), Breakfast (Le Peep), to many others...As we both mocked each other for not knowing about this \"bizarro Arboretum\", our eyes simultaneously came upon a Sushi restaurant called Sushiya, so we chalked it up to fate and decided to venture inside to give it a shot, as you shouldn't go against fate right???\n\nAs we entered the unassuming storefront, we were greeted with a huge welcome from the staff, a la Norm from Cheers, and the hostess/waitress said we could sit wherever we liked.  Not much in the way of ambiance, as there was a small Christmas tree at the front and a few assorted decorative pieces scattered about, but we weren't there for the decor, we were there for the sushi, so we didn't mind at all.\n\nTo put it mildly, the sushi menu is HUGE..about three pages worth of \"house rolls\" and \"specialty rolls\", and no pencil and paper was provided to mark selections, so it was a true test of our collective memories to keep track of all the various rolls we wanted to try, since we have nothing to note our choices on.  After multiple times through the extensive menu, we settled on a total of 6 rolls so we could try a little of everything.  Solid value on some of the specialty rolls by the way, as a lot of places these days price most of their specialty rolls in the $12-$25 range, but Sushiya had some creative rolls under 10 bucks, which was a definite plus.\n\nThe server was friendly throughout and did a nice job of making sure to ask if we wanted our waters refilled before they even got down to 1/2 full.   She was around just enough without being overly intrusive on our meal, and she was personable enough without being irritating if that makes any sense.\n\nThe sushi was fresh and overall I would say that 4 out of the 6 were hits while 2 were misses.  One of the misses was just devoid of flavor, while the other was overly drenched in a sweet mango sauce that was just too much in our opinion.  The hits were all solid but not spectacular.  I would say overall the sushi was better than what we found at Koishi, 18 Asian, Liu Liu, and other similar places, but a notch below some of the selections at Nikkos, Cowfish, NZ Cafe, etc.  \n\nDefinitely solid and worth a trip to check out for yourself as this place to me would be the definition of a 3.5 star yelp selection, but I decided to round up to 4 stars instead of rounding down to 3, because of the variety of options available from a specialty roll perspective.  Again, if you are looking for decor and ambiance, this probably isn't the right place to find those things, but if you are looking for a solid place to get sushi on a Saturday night that you can walk into at 7pm on a Saturday night, get a table of your choosing, and not spend triple digits for 6 specialty rolls, then definitely give it a shot.", "business_id": "4glD2-evDFddHjQaEVpCPQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-12-09", "type": "review"}

That was rather delicious.  I would say, give it a try but know.. There are much better places in the city.  Enjoy!\n\n-Ian M.", "business_id": "ym9QwkmB5ZKTyj7q5huTDw", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-02-20", "type": "review"}

We ended up getting there around 7:45pm on a Friday night to find the place very alive with people, both young and old, carousing, socializing and being merry.  \n\nMy friends and the party I was attending were stationed in the bar area, to the left as you walk in.  Though there was a jumble of people standing around drinking and talking, a server promptly noticed we were new to the scene and took our drink orders and provided us with a menu to look over.  I ordered a \"light lager\" for my girlfriend and a \"Brown Ale\" draft for myself.  Draft beers were running $4 per pint on Friday night; which certainly isn't bad, but isn't a deal by any means. \n\nAs evening turned into a chilly night, the people I was with found a few tables in the bar area and placed food orders.  I ordered, the BBQ pulled pork sliders as an appetizer, and some sort of lobster and shrimp rolled into a black corn enchiladas.  As a devout BBQ lover, I found the sliders to be an extreme disappointment.  The BBQ was border-line cold and there was very little BBQ on each of the sliders.  As for the enchiladas, the appeal of my meal was more in the uniqueness of the dish than its actual taste.  It's not that the enchiladas were bad, they just left me wanting more.  My girlfriend got the steak with mashed-potatoes and green-beans.  I thought the steak was above par.  My girl friend said it was cooked to her specifications.  \n\nOverall, I felt the food was good not great, and the BBQ sliders were not up to BBQ code.  However, Rock Bottom offered the perfect ambiance to enjoy myself and my friend's birthday in splendid fashion.  The service WAS GREAT!  I wish I could recall my server's name, because I would love to give her a shot-out.  Despite the chaotic atmosphere that reigned throughout the bar, she was prompt, polite and accurate with everything.\n\nTIPS: *Nice, classy atmosphere, *Nice seating area outside  *Parking can be found by turning either way on 7th street, including in the garage attached to Rock Bottom itself (KEEP YOUR TICKET!!  BRING IT IN WITH YOU!  ROCK BOTTOM VALIDATES PARKING, SEE THE HOSTESS.)  *Stay away from the BBQ Sliders  *Great, friendly service  *Good for parties or pre-gaming before going out somewhere else", "business_id": "ym9QwkmB5ZKTyj7q5huTDw", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-12-04", "type": "review"}

First, my rating of 2/5 stars is based primarily on the food, not the service.  \n\nI dined with a friend on a week night.  The restaurant was pretty empty, no wait for a table.  Our server was friendly and adequate, not magnificent.\n\nI decided to give Presto a try since they had a groupon coupon a while back.  So I had some money to spend, and Iwas able to taste quite a few dishes.  We started off with two appetizers: calamari and crab dip.  Calamari was very good; however, the sauce was, well, gross.  It was overly sweet and had an odd flavor.  We just ignored this and ate the calamari, as is.  The crab dip was another disappointment.  We were given plenty of chips, way more than we had dip for, which is never a great sign.  The cheese had a Velveeta consistency which I absolutely despise!  The cheese was loaded on the top with almost no crab flavor.  Toward the bottom there were whole chunks of crab...and you guessed it...now without any cheese!  \n\nI ordered the lasagna which came with a salad.  I ordered the Caesar salad.  Wow, this was just embarrassing (for them).  It was literally chopped Romaine with bottled dressing (I'd bet all my money - Ken's Steakhouse non-creamy kind).  I had about 4 bites and just put it aside.\n\nThe lasagna.  Well, remember that sauce with the calamari?  That's what is in the lasagna!  I actually had to send the dish back.  I was so disturbed by this sauce that I HAD to ask what was in it.  Well, tell me what you think - tomato sauce with cinnamon, and brown sugar.  \n\nI traded it in for a sandwich.  I just didn't know what to do.  I got a veggie sandwich with fries.  As a PS - bread was over saturated with oil but veggies tasted good.  Fries were under seasoned.  \n\nNot going back, but I think this place may be better as a lunch destination.", "business_id": "9fxTX1uyyYF4ugx68AG2sg", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-01-12", "type": "review"}

I've seen about 10-15 different rooms and we've hung out in the lobby spaces extensively, especially since we tend to start our runs from here on Sundays.\n\nI'm a big fan of this Westin.  As others have mentioned, the lounge is very modern and chic, lots of marble and a really cool Zen fountain running the length of the bar seating area.  The conference rooms are also on two separate floors adjacent to the lobby- great for easy access and they have separate elevator service that runs straight down into the parking garage.\n\nThe restaurant downstairs does a really mean breakfast buffet and their lunch menu is far from an after-thought- tasty grilled flatbreads.\n\nThe rooms are what you expect in any newer Westin- heavenly bed with mainly modern style furniture- clean lines and neutral earth tone colors.  Bathrooms are done in marble with large mirrors and glass enclosed showers.  Here's a hint for you- try to get a room or suite on the ends of the hallways- the showers have an extra window that looks out onto uptown- but the tinted glass makes sure others don't see in.  The square footage in these bathrooms is also quite a bit bigger than a standard room.\n\nI also like the views from any of the upper floors of this hotel.  Due to it's location on the edge of the uptown sky scrapers, rooms that face town have a great ariel view of uptown and/or Panthers Stadium.  But even the rooms facing the opposite direction look out towards the light rail line and South End- on clear days you can see out to Carowinds at the state line.  Really no terrible views here.\n\nMy only downgrade here is for the weekend crowds that flock into this hotel.  Interesting people watching, to say the least, but the circular driveway gets way too crowded at times and entry/exit becomes a  game of trying to move the puzzle pieces around until it all fits.  Parking is also quite expensive unless you have elite status here, but then that's pretty much anywhere in uptown.\n\nExpect larger crowds for the bigger conventions in town as this hotel is literally across the street from the convention center.

Also, the driveway can get a bit crowded when trying to pick up, drop off or just get into the self-park area.   During our last visit,  Michael Jordan was staying here.  The hotel staff parked his car in the drive next to the bellman, so it could be watched around the clock, which made the small driveway to pick up & drop off guests even smaller.

The employee stated she would send someone from security up.  A few minutes later, the guitar music briefly stopped.  However, it started up again soon after. Again, we called down to the front desk, explained the issue at hand, & was given the same response. The music continued.  Around 4:15, my boyfriend got out of bed, went downstairs & pleaded for some assistance.  Again, he was told that security would come.  No one came.  Around 4:30 / 4:45 AM, he called the front desk again & was told the issue was \"pending & that meant it was taken care of\". Unfortunately, \"pending\" in normal circumstances does not mean \"taken care of\".  My boyfriend waited at our door to ensure someone was in fact coming to handle this noise complaint.  Finally at around 5 AM, security came, knocked on their door & asked them to \"keep it down\". It was at that point, there was silence.\n\nWas it necessary we had to go through all this?  Therefore, my perfect NYE hopes did not end on a high note.", "business_id": "4nFqPL-glgDm9v7bZptskQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-01-02", "type": "review"}

I must say it was hard to leave! \n\nHotel:\n\nThe Westin is right in Uptown located across from the Convention Center and next to a light rail station, The Epicentre is only a 10-minute walk away (yes, we braved the cold, but it was nice!), and the arena is another few minutes from there. You can pay $25 for valet parking or $18 to self-park (which we did).\n\nThe lobby area was nice, and check-in was smooth. There is a mini-Starbucks there and a gift/sundries shop around the corner. The elevator bank has six elevators, so we didn't have to wait long (except when we ran into the ACN International Convention attendants coming back from the arena!).\n\nRestaurant/Food Service:\n\nWe didn't eat at the restaurant or indulge in food service, but apparently the breakfast buffet isn$25 per person! If you're here on a Sunday like we were, check out Pike's Soda Shop (a five-minute drive away in South End) for their amazing breakfast and breakfast buffet for $8.95 (before 10am--after that it's $13.95, but they add more food).\n\nRoom:\n\nWe booked a corner Superior room on the 23rd floor with gorgeous views of Uptown. It faced north and east, so the sunrise was absolutely beautiful. There is a nice-sized TV, individual thermostat, a desk with chair, an armchair with ottoman, a mini-fridge, and a coffeemaker with Starbucks coffee. They even threw in two free bottles of water (but don't consume the third, or it's $3.95). We didn't hair any noise from neighbors besides one instance of dogs barking (yes, the Westin is pet friendly). If you choose no housekeeping each day you're there (excluding day of departure), you get hooked up with a $5 dining voucher you can keep (or you can exchange that for 500 Starwood points when you check out). We initially had a problem with a non-functioning remote for the TV, but they sent someone up within 15 minutes and took care of it. Also beware that Wifi isn't free, but I believe if you're an SPG member you may not have to pay.\n\nBed:\n\nThe Heavenly Bed definitely lived up to its name! It was extremely comfortable and hard to get out of. The pillows were a little too soft for my taste, but if you love very soft pillows you're in for a treat! The duvet and sheets are comfortable as well. If you have a corner room, be aware there is a window right behind the bed. It wasn't a big deal with the blackout curtains.\n\nBathroom:\n\nThe bathroom was a standard hotel bathroom (no exhaust fan, unfortunately). The Heavenly Shower was awesome! It's both a rainfall-type shower, and there is a nice handheld component to it. My only gripe was the bathtub didn't drain well.\n\nConclusion:\n\nAll in all we had an amazing stay!

We had to slam on our breaks so hard it shifted many things around in the car and screeched the tires.\n\n2)  When checking out of the hotel on Sunday morning, our car (which was a rental car, might I add), had the fresh smell of cigarette smoke in it, as if someone had been smoking and put out their cigarette as they were getting in the car and blew the smoke in the car.  We had to roll the windows down in the very cold weather to get the stench out on the way to the airport.\n\n3)  The same valet man gave us wrong directions to the airport, sending us north of Charlotte.  Luckily, I was somewhat familiar with the area and could tell that we weren't going the right way, and turned us around.

After spending about an hour on the phone with my bank, we trace the charges to the Holiday Inn I am staying at via the card that I have left for incidentals.\n\nDespite prepaying for the room, we've now given the Holiday Inn about $600 for a two-night stay in a $110 / night room.\n\nFurthermore, the banks had closed so I couldn't transfer more money into my checking account until after the weekend.  It wasn't that I didn't have access to cash, but I had financial fraud to deal with on what was supposed to be a fun weekend with the guys.\n\nWhen I bring it up at the front desk, I am immediately given run around.  They pull up my info on their computer, and gasp as they see their error.  The staff wouldn't take ownership of their mistake, they simply blamed a computer error.  I finally get a manger who says he'll deal with the issue, and I don't receive any further communication, as I'm pretty sure he wasn't planning on working during the weekend.\n\nThe next day of my stay I call the front desk again, and demand answers.  This manager was a bit more assertive in handling the issue.  She spent time on the phone with my bank, and then my bank conferenced me in as we searched for a way to overcome Holiday Inn's costly error.\n\nAfter dealing with this issue for about 5 total hours, it becomes apparent that there is no way my money will be returned until after the weekend.  I demand to only pay half of my hotel bill, which is immediately granted.  By then I was tired of dealing with the issue and took their bill reduction as adequate compensation.\n\nUltimately, don't use a debit card to pay for incidentals on a hotel room, because hotel systems may automatically withdraw an egregious amount of funds from your account, which could cash screw you for the weekend.  \n\nAlso, DON'T STAY AT HOLIDAY INNS because the staff and management is comprised of lazy, lying, and incompetent thieves.\n\nThat is all.", "business_id": "Fi5sQxROyTLp5qDuYKz6bQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2008-12-15", "type": "review"}

The first one had a very strong musty odor, the second one smelled like rotten curry, and the third was OK.\nAlthough they were very accommodating, this place is seriously lacking on a few fronts. The rooms are a little bit small, which is a problem with most hotels in uptown. The rooftop pool doesn't have a great ambience, but a rather industrial feel. \nBreakfast is not included the way it is in many other Holiday Inn properties. You have to go to the restaurant, which doesn't open until 630 in the morning. If you were here for business, that's a problem. It also cost 15 bucks to eat the breakfast buffet which isn't  anything special. \nThere is some kind of executive lounge, which for some reason I did not qualify for even though I'm an elite IHG rewards member. \nI'm never impressed with fitness centers in hotels, but this one is particularly lacking!

You have to call to change appointment times.  BLERGH!  Back on the phone again, voice maze, stupid ads... I finally had to get back to my life after 20 more minutes on hold and gave up for the day.  \n\nSo here I am... again... on hold... we are now at the 12 minute mark to change my appointment time.  In all of my moves, the techs have been terribly pleasant (with one exception that I got my pepper spray out for just in case - he was an odd bird), generally on time (within the window) and if you manage to get a human on the phone for support or assistance, they are always helpful and polite as well.  Since they apparently hire good people, HIRE MORE!", "business_id": "vKtMsWeAaThimXGo9Ic_Og", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-01-03", "type": "review"}

I booked a reservation for 12 almost two weeks in advance of the date we wanted to dine.  I explained it was a going away party for a member of our team and that we wanted a large table.  I was told that would be no problem.  I was then told I had to give a credit card number to hold the table.  I questioned this as I have made numerous reservations and have never had to do this previously.  Chris stated he would not be able to hold without the information so I reluctantly gave it to him.  We arrived as a group a few minutes early for our reservation at 11:30am.  We were immediately greeted and seated as one of only two occupied tables in the entire restaurant.  The problem is that five (5) of us were at one round table and five (5) of us were at another.  We requested a different table or to push the two together.  We were told by our waiter that it was not possible to do this as the tables were not made to fit together and they had a full booking.  We had one waiter and the other table had a different waiter.  Our waiter was awful.  We had to request drink refills two separate times during our 45 minute wait on our food and he never came back to check on us once he served our food. When I eat out at a supposed \"fine dining\" establishment and pay $16 and change for a 6 ounce filet, I expect it to be superb. It wasn't.  I would have sent the dish back, but the waiter never returned.  Since it was a business group we couldn't wait another 45 minutes.  A lady at my table ordered the white bean dish and it was so salty she couldn't finish it.  Another diner at my table got the macaroni and cheese as an entree.  The noodles were under done and a bit chewy.  We requested our separate checks the next time we saw the waiter as we needed to get back to work.  When he brought the checks, they had charged us a 20% gratuity.  I asked why and was told because we were in a large party.  I explained to him that I did not feel we should have to pay the gratuity as my reservation was not honored and our service was lacking.  He said it was policy.  I asked for the manager who introduced himself as Eric.  I explained the situation to him.  Having to ask for refills, the long wait, the waiter not coming back ,etc.  He stated we are a large party and it is policy.  I told him we were treated as separate parties.  We were not seated together, did not share the same waiter and did not get served at the same time.  He refused to budge but said he would ask the owner.  I was then approached by the owner/chef.  It was apparent from the look on his face when he approached me that he was ready for battle. His opening words were, \"You got great service and great food so you should pay for it.\"  I told him the service was not great, the food was not great.  I tried to explain the situation.  He told me I should just pay my bill.  I told him we were treated as two separate parties and not seated at the same table.  He stated, \"Well, you walked in the door together.\"  I told him if the $ was that important to him, I would pay it, but that I work for a large corporation within 2 blocks of his restaurant and that I would have thought repeat business and keeping a good relationship with his diners would be worth more than that to him.  He said he didn't appreciate me threatening him (???!!??!) and for me to pay my bill and get out.  I gave the waiter my credit card assuming he meant to pay it without the gratuity, which I was more than willing to do.  When the bill came back, they had charged me the gratuity so I refused to sign it.  Another lady in my party of 5 paid her bill with a 10% tip.  The waiter brought the check back and said it was short.  She said she meant to only tip 10%.  He told her that they had had people ARRESTED FOR REFUSING TO PAY THEIR TIPS BEFORE.  She became frightened and put another $5 bill in the folder and left the restaurant.  Did I mention this lady is in her 60's?  When I refused to sign my check the manager, Eric, told me that by refusing to sign I was refusing to pay and that they would call the police.  I told him to go ahead, but wanted to see the written policy.  He told me it was on the website.   ??? Everyone checks a website before making a reservation?  Then told me it was my lucky day & they wouldn't be calling the cops, but would be taking it up with the credit card company.  Good luck.  Hope that $60 is worth the report to the BBB!", "business_id": "df7cda6f5lMADGnoVHd8pg", "stars": 1, "date": "2009-12-30", "type": "review"}

Happily in a coma after being satisfied by a taste I could only once wonder about I got myself the check. I didn't care how much it was, it was good, the service was astounding, and I was so comfortable at this point I could not even set a price on this kind of experience. Popped it open and to my surprise I walked out of there paying less than $100 for two people+Wines +Appitizers+Desserts. \n\nAfter stumbling to the door trying to shake off my coma I gave one glance back at the place of magic and thought to myself I'll be back here before I know it to take on a new adventure for my taste buds.", "business_id": "df7cda6f5lMADGnoVHd8pg", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-01-21", "type": "review"}

It wasn't until after I already paid for the service, gave her a tip and went home, that I started thinking in retrospect... then got mad that I actually paid for something that made me feel WORSE. It was some time ago, so I will have to call them to see if her name's on record, so I can recommend not using her. I don't think she listened to a word I said. I had the 1-hour massage, and I explained to her before hand, that I wanted her to mainly focus on my upper back & neck, because I had a lot of pain in the area from working on the computer 24/7 until finishing a job that week. I also told her I prefer harder pressure. I have never had a \"massage\" like that before. She did nothing but tickle me. I told her at least twice that she can use more pressure, but I guess she didn't care... then she ends up paying the LEAST amount of attention to my problem areas I asked her to focus on. I guess I was being too nice? I should have asked for someone else, but I didn't want to hurt her feelings. \n\nI haven't had a massage there since then, but I love getting my haircuts there.

Although you may call a specific location, that location might not be the one that answers the phone, so from the get-go, we had a bit of scheduling confusion.  I had perused the services menu online prior to calling, and had selected the Fresh Face Facial.  As I scheduled my appointment, the receptionist mentioned that it was typically for teenagers, but given that I felt this was best for my needs, she booked it for me anyway, no questions asked.\n\nWhen I showed up, I was pleasantly greeted and quickly ushered back to the waiting room, where I was asked if I wanted anything to drink (from reading other Yelp reviews, apparently they have wine?).  The chairs were comfy, the lighting moodful, and there were a few magazines to read while passing the time.  Once I was called back to my room, it got awkward.  Apparently the service I'd booked was ONLY available for teenagers, although neither the website nor the receptionist indicated this restriction when I booked my appointment.  The aesthetician and I played an awkward cat and mouse game as she tried to upsell me to another facial.  Given that price was one of the factors I'd used in not only selecting my facial choice, but also one of the reasons I'd chosen Modern over another spa, I was a bit peeved.  My face is the same size as a teenager, and I'm breaking out like it's the mid-90s all over again, so I don't see why there should be a $15 upcharge (which she told me was the standard price difference between the Fresh Face Facial for teenagers and the comparable offering for adults).  Finally, she said that since I hadn't been told this during the reservation, they would honor the appointment as scheduled.  Nice outcome, but making your clients uncomfortable from the get-go is not the best customer service experience.\n\nWe began the facial, and I told her I had been having some skin problems over the last few months.  Instead of generally asking me what products I use, she immediately said \"do you use Aveda products?\"  Here, we go - informercial central; time to sell some product.  Luckily that was the only sales push I got, but again - an impact to the customer experience.\n\nOnce we got over those hurdles, it was actually a very pleasant experience.  My aesthetician was easy to talk to, and what she did felt great on my face.  Ultimately, I was pleased with the service (product-related) I received but felt there were some challenges with how the service (customer-focused) was delivered.

This one seems like it might be a little bigger with more books, but it's also older (which isn't necessarily a bad thing) and tends to be overrun with teenages when school's out (which definitely can be a bad thing).  Also, the coffee shop is right smack dab in the middle of the store, which is a bit exposed for my taste.  I know that's a personal issue, but I imagine there are at least a few other people who don't like being set on a pedastal in the middle of a huge store when drinking coffee.\n\nThat being said, I do visit this store, and I usually get good service, and that makes it solidly A-OK.", "business_id": "fHovFhbYJcy6y4oosMhM_A", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-01-04", "type": "review"}

Worst experience of my life.  Tried to buy a book and have it shipped as a Christmas present.  After joining as a member on 11/23/15.  I place my first and LAST on-line order on Dec 1st.  Next day I get an email saying the order audit department has cancelled the order.  I call them and they say it was their mistake, but all good now.  Next day 12/3/15 they charge my visa for $21.87 and were done.  I later get confirming emails that order was shipped and tracking number confirms delivery.  I call today and find the delivery was NEVER made!!! So I call Customer Service at 1-800-843-2665.  I talk to 3 different people from India, English is not their 1st language.  The first representative named, Juju gives me the wrong reference before passing me to Nicole in Sales Order Audit.  Juju gives me reference number 151214-008 and order number 4003274933.  Juju now says he can't help me and must now transfer me to the sales order audit department where I am now speaking with Nicole.  Nicole says Juju was wrong, my reference number is really 151214-008922 and order number is really 4003297431 and can't help me so she transfers me BACK to Customer Service where after giving my name, address, and email for the THIRD time and 35 minutes later, i get cut off.

Get there early enough to get your choice seating.  \n\nThen I found out about the Pay What You Can Night, which is normally a Wednesday.  That night you will get to enjoy the same show for whatever you can scrap up from your couch (or $10 is suggested).  For people who are on tight budget (hmm... me & lots of my friends), it's a great opportunity and I am very very appreciative of it.  (Check their website for PWYC date for each show)  Drinks & snacks (aka chips & cookies) priced reasonably, $3-5 for beer/wine, $1 for a snack pack.  Parking is free and plentiful in the lot next to the building.  \n\nSince then I've seen 39 Steps (hilarious... though I don't think that's the original intention) and Every Christmas Story Ever Told (not growing up in the US, I totally missed all the references... so not as funny for me).

I read on a Chowhound article that Mert's was a good place for a solo diner to get some good local food without feeling weird for eating alone, plus it was Southern Soul Food. The experience started off on a high note with quick, friendly service producing a Carolina Blonde Beer (not local, btw, from Wilkes-Barre, PA) and the pinnacle of the experience: cornbread. The rest of the meal (my shrimp and grits) didn't live up to the hype and so I have to give this place an overall mediocre review.\n\nPros\n-Cornbread- this stuff is the truth. But I felt it set the bar high as my first  taste of Mert's capabilities. Thus while satisfying enormously with its crumbly sweet goodness and soft buttery mouth feel, it paradoxically set the table for disappointment.\n-Good Service and Atmosphere - again I was a solo diner and it didn't feel awkward at all. The place is casual, upbeat and friendly. Good for dropping in alone and unannounced.\n\nCons\n-Salad - the 'garden salad' is billed on the menu as a $2 add-on to your entree. I make a point of regular ruffage while traveling, so I took the bait. What I got was literally a bread plate with about an inch-deep layer of iceberg lettuce, a single slice of cucumber and a plastic cup of ranch dressing. I ordered honey mustard. This was about as 'gardeny' as a plastic-wrapped airplane salad and way too much money for what I got. I usually won't mind paying upwards of $10 for a properly vegetated salad, but for $2 this was wickedly overpriced considering an entire head of this lettuce costs about $1 retail. \n-Shrimp and Grits - just ok, bordering on the meh. I wanted to like this so badly, to have the Soul Food experience I've been dreaming of. Sadly, this wasn't it. Too much grits, small shrimp lacking freshness and watery sauce throughout.", "business_id": "mpDxBBGywUE6GRRKja3sBA", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-02-04", "type": "review"}

Now I know you're probably saying well look what you ordered and perhaps that is true, but I have had fried chicken and mashed potatoes that felt decadent yet somehow less like my mouth was taking a grease bath.  If I went again I would order something MUCH lighter...lesson learned. \n\nOn a positive note the service was fast and friendly and the restaurant itself has a lot of memorabilia that makes for interesting conversation pieces. So for me Mert's is just ok.", "business_id": "mpDxBBGywUE6GRRKja3sBA", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-02-06", "type": "review"}

It definitely delivered on my craving for a buttery, salty hot meal. Oh, and some cheese.\n\nThe hubs and I rolled up on a Saturday around 2:30 p.m., fearing that no Uptown kitchen is open at such an in-between hour. Au contraire. Mert's was packed. Inside this low-ceilinged nook with couple dozen tables, colorful accents and storied photographs lining the walls, we found couples, families and friends of all ages going to town on some comfort food.\n\nI had the Carolina chopped BBQ, swimming in a sweet, \"secret\" sauce. Served in a side-dish bowl, the Q portion left plenty of room for gooey mac and cheese and a substantial serving of collard greens with the right amount of tang. The hubs had the lowcountry omelette, which was OK for him; he said he'd go for something more fried and/or savory next time (atta boy).\n\nWe shared an appetizer of fried green tomatoes--tasty though a tad too bready and lukewarm upon arrival. The app came out after our entrees, but honestly when you've come to indulge in this kind of hearty goodness, does it matter?\n\nAnd then there was the cornbread. There was a wait for it. Our server was repeatedly apologetic. But oh, was it worth it.\n\nOur server was so very friendly and kept us happy with regular check-ins and refills on sweet tea. My only random nit was the vinyl table covering. I trust it's clean, but there's something kinda sticky about those things still. Otherwise, Mert's is a good-for-all destination for a casual feast of stick-to-your-ribs Southern cookin'.", "business_id": "mpDxBBGywUE6GRRKja3sBA", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-02-22", "type": "review"}

Disappointing, as they were touted as a featured menu item on their website.  I wonder if I just got them on a bad day??  They were mushy, with no discernible salmon chunks, and flavorless, desperately needing spices or at least salt.  I saw and tasted no evidence of the mirepoix and Cajun spices described as part of the dish.  Hubs didn't like his green beans (too sweet) and home fries (too bland, not fried long enough).  \n\nI like the vibe of the space a lot.  But it does seem a little dirty.  Also our server was very friendly but repeatedly sneezed into the crook of her arm and just kept on serving.  Um, kinda gross from a customer perspective.  She also mixed our ticket up with another tables, but then let us know that she would cover the extra on their ticket for us.  They were busy.

The sandwich was very good.  Jersey Mikes uses finely shredded lettuce which I prefer.  The meats are cut on a meat slicer as your sandwich is made so they are not sitting around in a cooler.  If the regular prices weren't so high I'd go to Jersey Mike's instead of the $5 footlong place. but as another reviewer mentioned you can take your receipt from Tuesday back and get the same $5.99 deal which is definitely worth it.  I'm going to give them 4 stars on Tuesdays.", "business_id": "6ICGve6UyGPuLaGrKQBVuw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-12-07", "type": "review"}

We had reservations and were promptly seated next to a window that looked out on a beautiful city view. The restaurant is warm, inviting and cozy... yet its a decently large area. I had really high hopes for this meal and there were hits and misses throughout. Either way I had a fabulous birthday.\n\nStarting out with the service... WOW! Its been a while since I had that good of service, especially in North Carolina for that matter! Our server was a dashing fellow by the name of Adam and he definatly made our night. I think that his great attitude and subtle humor made my review jump up a star. Our water was always filled, food was coursed very well, and Adam showed great knowledge in the menu.\n\nNow getting to the menu, which in itself was a bit of a cluster-F. I like more of a structure in a menu, perferably with no advertisements or noncense. I like Structured menus I guess. Maybe I am just nit-picky. At any rate we started off our meal with all recomandations from our server. The trio of Pear Salad was first. Three applications of pears were showcased, the only one that needed to be on there was the savory cheese cake with pears. The other two were nice but the cheese cake was rad. Then we enjoyed the blt Belly Sliders and the stuffed hushpuppies. I think the Belly Sliders were good... but I think they required salt, I felt that belly fat plus fried tomato could definatly benefit. The hushpuppies... no complaints. \nNow the thing I was looking forward too was this pork chop with foraged mushroom mac and braised greens. We ordered our porkchop medium/rare and what we got was... well nicely seared but the inside was so bloody red it looked like seared ahi! We sent it back and by then there was no hope left... Alas! an overdone chop. If something is sent back I would be sure to watch it like a hawk! While the mac was good I really wanted a good porkchop. \n\nThe meal as a whole was good, save the chop.

We went for Sunday brunch and were seated in the bar with the bartender as our server even though the place had many seats open. We started by ordering drinks off of their specialty cocktail menu. They had advertised a Jalapeno Margherita. After about 10 minutes and well after my dining companion had received their drink, the bartender came over and said that I needed to choose another drink because she could not find the vodka. We ordered shrimp and grits which were served with a film layer on top of the gravy as if it had been sitting an excessive amount of time in the kitchen and a minuscule portion of grits. The dish had fine flavor but was nothing special. My dish was the Mimosa Eggs Benedict special but unfortunately the eggs in the benedict were cooked hard so no delicious yolk to ooze onto the dish as intended. The bartender forgot we were there for awhile and our drinks were empty and then appeared to be caught up in eating some pizza and talking to other employees and we had to walk over just to pay and get out of there. I might give this place another try during a busy night but was very disappointed. This may be one of those places that is living off of a good start and good reviews but has suffered a major decline in both quality and service. Oh and by the way, if you are going to advertise a drink and don't have the ingredients then please offer the person a cocktail of their choice complimentary as an apology.

Bar Bites menu is so enticing we had a hard time narrowing it down:  Decided on: Nduja Sausage & Pimento Cheese Dip with house tortilla chips for $8.  And:  Fennel Sausage Flatbread charred peppers - caramelized onions - ricotta for $12.  Both of these were exceptional!  Full of flavor and perfectly executed!\n\nAs much as we loved our drinks and food here, I have to say that we felt like we were sort of/kind of in the way of them preparing for the REAL guests that were yet to arrive...We felt like we were trying hard for them to WANT us to be there.

I recently decided to revisit this club and had a bad experience .  I saw a dancer that caught my eye. I offered her a drink and a dance. After her canoodling me  I gave in and said i'll take  one ( 30 dollar)  dance.\n\nAfter some pleasant conversation over the drink( I treated her to),  the dance began .  After four minutes the song was over and I reached in my pocket to give her the 30 + 5 dollars for a tip, when she explained I actually owed her 60 dollars  because it was 2 songs.  By my count it was one dance. Apparently she decided to count the 5 minutes of  time we spent talking over the drinks i bought her as part of the dance as well.   I thought she was kidding and gave her the $ 35. This  beautiful little angel suddenly became a crazy little devil. She called her manager and made me out to be some kind of lunatic lowlife cheapskate.   I politely explained the situation to the  manager but he insisted i pay up which i promptly did .  After wards i made a quick exit.   \n\nThere was no mistaken that I was being blatantly scammed here.  I was in the club for less then 10 minutes and hadn't even finished my first beer, and was not drunk in the least.   Unless you don't mind being scammed by a dancer, and paying 60 dollars for a 4 minute dance I would  steer clear from this establishment .  A night I was hoping to relax over a beer and a beautiful dancer cost me 80 dollars for less then 10 minutes of harassment and aggravation.  It appears to be a pretty good club and i couldn't say if they regularly scam the patrons,  but  they sure as hell scammed me.  On principle I'll avoid this place  and I'll tell my friends to go elsewhere as well. The are  a ton of clubs in the area with gorgeous girls  that even have signs on the table that you will never pay for a dancer's time or for  her simply talking to you.\n\nYou've  been warned .\n\nJay", "business_id": "qxaoJ2cd7-cvEPTmSgBAyA", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-01-12", "type": "review"}

Parking is quite easy if you park in the Hearst Tower parking garage (Luce validates). \n\nLuce is a very nice looking restaurant. It is on the small side as far as the number of tables, but the space has high ceilings and they've decorated it so that it feels quite spacious. We were seated right away based on our reservation--no waiting.\n\nOne interesting thing is about Luce is that you can order wine by the glass or by the glass-and-a-half (which our entire table went for).\n\nI ordered the butternut squash soup appetizer, the linguine del mar for the entree, and the tiramasu for dessert. I thought it was all rather average given Luce's reputation and the way they present themselves. The butternut squash soup came out piping hot, which was nice, but it tasted basically like the butternut squash soup you can get in a box from the grocery store. The linguine was better, but again, it was really average given the expectations I had for Luce. The tiramisu was really good.\n\nWe were sort of rushed out of the place after our meal, but it was done politely and I suppose they may have been very busy due to Queen's Feast.\n\nI've heard there are several options for good Italian food in CLT, and I'd be surprised if Luce is among the best of them.", "business_id": "z24h6ZYnZiWjlDTuLXG9jw", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-01-26", "type": "review"}

I lived in NYC for years, and tasted some of the finest thin crust on the planet.  (for the record, my favorites are DiFara's in Brooklyn and Coalfire, a relatively young pizza joint in Chicago).\n\nBrixx does a fine job of the thin crust.  We had a wild mushroom pie and their pear and gorgonzola variety for kicks.  Both were pretty tasty.    I'll go back for more whenever the opportunity arises.\n\nBut here's what they could do a little better:\n\nGet that oven hotter, and change the flour blend so that there's a crispness to the bottom and edges of the crust.  There's an axiom for thin crust pizza that goes something like, \"if that shit don't crack, that shit is whack.\"  So, when the pizza is folded, the bottom of the crust should crack.  Ditto for the edge of the crust.  (Allowances can be made for pizzas that have been ordered with soggy ingredients that necessarily soak through the crust, like spinach, ricotta, etc.)\n\nBrixx's pizza did not exhibit cracking anywhere.  It was cooked only to the point of being bread-like.  Still tasty enough, but not quite there.  I hate to sound snotty about this, but I think it really adds to the pizza when parts of the crust have been cooked almost to the point of burning.  That crunch and underlying chewiness is irresistible.\n\nAlso, the mushroom pizza was finished with a sprinkling of what appeared to be shaved romano and a tossing of arugula, but when that was added, the pizza had been allowed to cool to the point where the romano didn't melt at all, and the arugula didn't wilt.  The result was a bit like having a salad on top of a pizza.\n\nPizza aside, they offer local beers, at least one NC wine, and have eco-friendly waterless urinals in the men's room (I applaud the effort, though that probably won't be the highlight of the review).\n\nNext time I go in, I'll see it they can crispify my pie.", "business_id": "kAid56AY_laxGYslMdsYJw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-01-21", "type": "review"}

My pizza preferences are mid-western and Buffalo style - not too thin, not too thick, nice and greasy, and baked in a deck oven.  However, I love Brixx pizza.  I have been to this location at least 50 times, usually before or after Checkers games.  The menu is simple.  It's mostly personal size woodfired pizzas which can be altered.  You can get their pies on wheat crust, you can get vegan cheese, and they now even have gluten free pizza.  The pizza and toppings are delicious and are fresh cooked.  I really like the pear and Gorgonzola one, although it's not always on the menu.  \n\nThe rest of the menu offers some very good salads, some decent wraps, and a few pasta dishes.  I tend not to order the pasta before going to games because it's too much to eat - the pizas, sandwiches, and salads are perfect.  They have a small but respectable beer slection with different specials every day.  They usually have something from Olde Mecklenburg Brewery which is good too.  They have beer flights too if you want to try several different beers.\n\nThe service has always been good to excellent here (last time it was excellent).  The manager who has worked here for the past year or so seems to know how to run this place and is a nice guy.  Even if you're not a fan of this style of pizza, Brixx is a cool place to have a decent meal.", "business_id": "kAid56AY_laxGYslMdsYJw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-12-21", "type": "review"}

Despite the extended time between visits, i always considered it a 3-star establishment. However, i've changed quite a bit over this time and upon my return to Brixx, i found they have always had what i never knew i would someday want. For one, they have a solid beer selection. i've always drank beer and they always have some beer on special for $3 (New Castle last time in)  which used to be all i require. Nowadays i'm a little craftier than i used to be and they satisfy with a good selection of local beers along with some nationwide favorites. Also, $1.95 domestic drafts on Monday.\n\nThe other great thing about Brixx is the fact that they offer Vegan cheese. After trying vegan pizza one time at Mellow Mushroom, i was kind of turned off. Fortunately i tried again because i think i've had it probably 5 times in the past month. Love it here. We've done the wood-roasted vegetable and a modified Mexican and will order both again. With the wood-roasted vegetable, i like to get a side of marinara for some crust dipping action. This might be why they don't get 5 stars. i don't think i've had a server remember to bring my side of marinara. Not a huge deal, but every time? \n\ni also recommend the hummus plate as a starter. Their black bean hummus is really good.  \n\nYou can park in the 7th street garage and they will validate at the hostess stand, so no need to fret about finding parking. \n\nApparently vegan options and good beer is all i need in life these days.", "business_id": "kAid56AY_laxGYslMdsYJw", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-01-08", "type": "review"}

Let's go somewhere new, downtown (uptown as they call it in Charlotte), some place fancy.  The capital grille fits this criteria.  From walking into the place with the dark woods, white linen table cloths, well dressed patrons.  It all works.  The waiter approaches our table and we are ready to start the experience.  He recommends a wine from the extensive wine list.  Lets talk about that.  I am a wanna-be when it comes to choosing a wine.  When I see a list as big as this, my first thought is wow, I think I'll get a beer!  Our waiter was an expert.  After a couple more visits we learned that pretty much everyone there had an excellent grasp on choosing wine and familiarity with the wine selection.  Our selection was a white which was absolutley perfect.  Started with the Lettuce wedge, nice giant piece of iceburg lettuce, ice cold, plenty of blue cheese and bacon and perfectly ripe tomotes.  \nThings were looking good.  We went light on the apps the first time since we had a feeling that the meal was going to be huge and we wanted to survive!  Our steaks came, filet au poivre, of course!  Done perfectly, rare, cream sauce was out of this world.  Meat so juicy and tender you don't need the fancy knife they give you.  We had the mashed potatoes and the au gratin potatoes for sides.  These were to die for.  Low fat I'm sure.  For dessert the recommendation was made to order the cheese cake.  Wow, I had no idea.  So rich and creamy we ate the whole thing.  Uncommon considering how much food was consumed this night.  \nSince that first visit we had been back several times.  I highly recommend the Capital Grille, prices are high as you would expect.  But the food and service are well worth it.", "business_id": "CChwRoYVXA3QZulS8a6xOQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2006-01-11", "type": "review"}

There are too many people who write these food reviews trying to sound like they're a foodie, or at least knowledgeable about food, and then it turns out they only go out like four times a year!\n\nI like Capital Grille. I like it as much as Morton's. I like both better than Smith and Wollensky, Butcher and Singer, Ruth's Chris, Sullivan's, and The Palm. I get my steaks medium rare. On rare occasion, such as when I order prime rib at S&W, I get it rare. This is the ONLY way to eat quality meat.

Supermarket meat needs to be cooked well done because the supermarket butcher probably rarely washes his hands.\n\nI've tried the sliced filet mignon, the filet \"cooked to order\", the lobster bisque, and the crab cocktail at Capital. The lobster bisque needed more lobster, but the bisque was quite good and not too strong. My filet entrees were awesome.

In other words, this place oozes of old money, but you don't have to dress to the nines in order to enjoy service here; as long as you don't dress like you're about to attend a GWAR concert, you won't be denied service.\n\nOur attentive waitress, Beth, could not have been more instrumental in helping us decide what to eat. I was jonesing for a good red wine, but I wasn't much in the mood to down an entire bottle on my own (my wife doesn't like red wine, and I don't like white, so that negates our wine choosing); she recommended a rich and full-bodied Rioja by the glass, so smooth and elegant that I would have enjoyed another glass were I more inclined to do so.\n\nWe started with the prosciutto-wrapped mozzarella, lightly sauteed and garnished with fresh basil and vine tomatoes. Absolutely lovely, and the prosciutto is from Parma, and not the poser variety most restaurants and delis try to pawn off on you. The crostinis were a delight as well. My wife also enjoyed a wedge salad with a tangy blue cheese dressing.\n\nAs for the main event, my wife chose the lobster and crab-stuffed shrimp; think of this as looking akin to a stuffed tomato, lightly glazed and very delicious. I went for the steak Au Poivre, rubbed with peppercorns and served with a cognac (Courvoisier?) sauce. Oh. My. GOODNESS! Tender, with a swift bite to it, thanks to the peppercorns. We shared a neatly-prepped side of sauteed spinach, and the parmesan truffle fries; this was perhaps the only disappointment, as the fries seemed to lack the prerequisite amount of parmesan so as to not make the fries taste like, well, fries.\n\nWe topped off our gastric orgy with an off-the-menu layered carrot cake, large enough for two. There was no way we could finish it, but, man, we gave it our best.\n\n$180 for dinner? Yeah, so what?

So delish. That said, why not have two and really kick up your heels?\n\nStarters: I realize that shrimp cocktail might be considered a boring choice, but with jumbo shrimp and cocktail sauce with a kick, you'll be happy you choose this route. The mixed green salad with champagne vinegarette and the tomato mozzarella salad are also great starters (but you may want to split the later as it's quite large).\n\nMain course: I don't eat red meat, but everyone I've dined with says that Capital Grille has the best steaks around. The salmon is also very good, and the portion size ridiculous; you'll definitely have some to take home.\n\nSides: you must have the creamed spinach. Even if you abhor spinach you will love this dish (which tells you just how healthy it is). The asparagus and mashed potatos are also solid side choices.\n\nDessert (my favorite course): get the cheesecake; you will not regret it. The top is torched like creme brulee and it comes with whip cream and berries. I've also had some of their  homemade ice cream (mint), and it was very good as well. The chocolate cake is very rich, but with a bit of ice cream on top, the perfect chocolately end to your evening.\n\nThey have a very helpful slew of valet attendants out front for free parking, so defintiely plan to use them. It's just not worth it to try to find a spot on your own, especially if you're going uptown on the weekend for dinner (at which point, you should definitely make a reservation). \n\nIf you're looking for great food, service, and to save a little money, this is the place to choose when perusing the restaurant week menu.

The creamed spinach however, tasted like soap, bleh.  Our server replaced them when we told her they tasted funny, but the 2nd batch just had a milder soapy flavor.  Still this was not enough to ruin an otherwise perfect meal.  Creme brulee to finish up and the chocolate espresso cake to go since my friend doesn't care for dessert, was a great ending to the meal.\n\nWith the gift card and the restaurant week pricing it made this meal with 4 glasses of wine and 2 cocktail about $43 pre tip.

This time around we made reservations to partake in their Restaurant Week menu, and it is the most affordable way to experience one of the better restaurants in the area.\n\nThe Capital Grill may be a chain, but it definitely doesn't feel like it. From the interior decor to the service to the actual food, everything screams upscale fancy-smancy...not something that is usually associated with a chain. We made reservations (highly recommended) and were seated almost immediately.\n\nOur server was very friendly and brutally honest. I guess she was forced to try to upsell us a $17 glass of wine but then told us how ridiculous it is and we shouldn't bother with it. When we did choose a bottle of wine she detoured us to a different bottle that was the same price but was more well-received. I'm glad we went with her recommendation because it ended up being an awesome bottle that we would have overlooked otherwise. \n\nFor the first course of the Restaurant Week menu I had the New England Clam Chowder. I am a sucker for clam chowda and this stuff was great. It wasn't overly heavy with cream and had a ridiculous amount of succulent clam chunks in it. This chowda definitely didn't skimp on the seafood, and the clams, potatoes and bacon were all melded nicely for some of the best I've had in awhile. The missus got the field green salad which was very nice, and came with an excellent champagne dressing that worked very well with the veggies. I was almost a little jealous of her salad, but I had chowder in front of me, so that feeling didn't last long.\n\nThe Restaurant Week menu was decent for entrees, with a few steak options as well as a chicken and salmon. I ordered the 14oz bone-in sirloin and this was one of the most magnificent steaks I've had in the Queen City. It was cooked to a perfect medium rare just as I ordered it, and it was a tender, juicy, tasty steak with an excellent beef flavor. It was such a huge steak that I only ate half and saved the rest for a leftover dinner the next night! \n\nThe missus had the Citrus Glazed Seared Salmon. It was a very nice piece of salmon that wasn't overpowering, and the glaze was really tasty. Her plate also came with some roasted asparagus that were cooked perfectly and had a nice sauce drizzled on top. Our table was also served shared side dishes of mashed potatoes and green beans. The potatoes were crazy rich, creamy and delicious, and there were still a few nice lumps mixed within the majority of the velvety mass, making these potatoes freaking awesome. The green beans were also tasty, and were tossed with tomatoes to give it a little extra pop.\n\nFor dessert we both shared the Cheesecake and Flourless Chocolate Espresso Cake. The cheesecake was actually more like a mousse, and so it was light as opposed to dense. It tasted wonderful and the top is caramelized to give it a crisp bite. It was served alongside a few berries and strawberry glaze, which made one delicious mouthful. The chocolate cake was just as good, if not slightly better. The espresso flavor is very light so if you're not a coffee fan don't be afraid to give this a whirl. The consistency of the cake was more like a chewy fudge, making it extremely decadent. \n\nThe Capital Grill is the place to go, so long as you have to cash. The food is all excellent and I would love to go back and try some other stuff out. The ambiance, service and food all scream swank, and it definitely feels like it warrants the extravagant price tag.", "business_id": "CChwRoYVXA3QZulS8a6xOQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-01-19", "type": "review"}

They are about half the price, but more importantly the quality of the meat is superior. Fresh Market filets are tender, almost buttery (not to mention consistent, we've grilled a good half dozen times with similar results). It's nice to have someone cook for you once in awhile, but really I'd choose quality every time over being served something that's just OK while being overcharged.  My husband enjoyed his lobster bisque and the lobster mac and cheese had several large chunks of lobster that were tender and perfect. My tomato salad came with underripe overly thick slices of tomato on top (which generally made the whole thing look unnappetizing). I'd say it's a reasonable request that if a tomato salad is offered you'd better have ripe tomato, otherwise perhaps not bother offering as a menu item. Under the thick slices there were some very tasty red, gold, and chocolate colored grape tomatoes that had marinated in the balsamic nicely- those were really good and I did enjoy that part. Overall the reason we went to Capital Grille in the first place was to enjoy some steak, they fell squarely in the category of mediocre.

Let's check it out, eh!\"  (John's Canadian so I thought I'd make him feel at home by speaking like a McKenzie Brother.) \"Right on!\" John exclaimed.\n\nThe Graduate amply filled our gustatory and cultural needs.  The place was clean if self-consciously dingy; the barmaids were hot.  A college cover band performed a passable rendition of a Green Day anthem before segueing into a more challenging Sublime ballad.  The buffalo tenders were hot, spicy and cheap, and the beer was even cheaper.\n\nJohn asked me to recommend an \"American\" beer and once I ascertained that Rolling Rock, Brubaker, and 'Gansett were not on the menu, and being kind of a jerk, I suggested Pabst Blue Ribbon: An American favorite if you happen to spend eight hours a day at General Motors, stamping pieces of metal with a drill press and need a refreshing pick-me-up before smacking around your wife and kids.\n\nThe cute little waitress gave John a look bordering on horror, \"You want PBR?\" she asked incredulously.  \n\n\"What's wrong with her?\" John asked.  \n\nI murmured something about his choice offending her collegiate aesthetic.  \"She's probably not used to real men ordering real beer,\" said I.\n\nAs it turned out, John developed a liking for good old American PBR and asked for it wherever he went.  Boy was he pissed when someone explained where Pabst fell on the beer chain!\n\nWhat does this story have to do with the Graduate?  Not a hell of a lot but it was a good evening.  We got pretty smashed, ended up with something like a fifty dollar bill--including the tip--and were in fine shape for the start of our conference the next morning, where the evening cocktail reception contained a NASCAR theme and an open bar.

Service was attentive but not intrusive and kept the evening moving along.\n\nWe enjoyed cocktails in the small bar area and it felt like a private club.  Deanna answered questions knowledgably and provided great suggestions when requested.\n\nDinner was served (and the entire room reserved for us) in the space used for breakfast - but you'd never have known it from the feel.  It was candlelit and intimate without being close and claustrophobic.  Can't wait for next year when we have enough people to take over the intimate dining room!\n\nWhere do I begin with the food?  Creative, unique menu that I've never seen anywhere else in Charlotte.  Heavily focused on meat, chicken and seafood (sorry, my vegetarian friends) and all executed to perfection.

Since they were owned by the Marriott hotel that houses it, there wasn't much influence I could have over their wine list, and we already pretty much dominated it with some of our larger corporate profile wines. It's a shame really, because after dining there over the holidays I had a very good meal that would definitely warrant a second visit.\n\nAlthough the hotel was a bustle with energy after a recently ended football game (Meineke Car Care Bowl, or whatever the hell it's called now), the restaurant itself was virtually dead for dinner service on a Saturday night. This did give me a better chance to take in the surroundings, and notice the ornate chandelier (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4385725507/), along with a beautiful but non-functioning water display, and plates and silverware which seemed entirely too old-fashioned Southern elegant than necessary, including captain's chairs which didn't quite mesh with the tables. On the plus side, a virtually empty dining room caused service to be very attentive, and the food came out without delay.\n\nThe chef decided to start out with an amuse bouche of crab stuffed pastry (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4386490332/) with a homemade remoulade sauce. It was interesting, because I honestly wasn't even expecting an amuse here, but it was a nice surprise. The remoulade was a bit weak (I tend to like a little more spice), but the crab was nice in texture and flavor. It didn't take me long after those 2 bites to dive right into the sweet cornbread biscuits, thanks to the very soft butter. The biscuits were delicious, and were it not for a huge food order coming, I could have easily downed a dozen right then.\n\nThe first real course of the night was a lobster \"cobbler\", prepared as an \u00e9touff\u00e9e inside a phyllo tart (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4385726467/), with a side of saffron ice cream and topped with fresh chive. This was very close to my favorite dish of the night. The lobster flavor was fantastic, and although the saffron ice cream seemed strange at this point in the meal it really paired well with the strong flavors of the main component. The phyllo was perfectly flaky and taken as a whole bite just melts in your mouth. The next starter, braised beef short ribs served over gingerbread cookies (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4386491172/) was a little more disappointing, but still decent. The sweetness of the cookies was too much, and didn't mix well with the soy in the beef glaze, but at least the meat was extremely tender.\n\nThe soup course was next, and both options were frankly somewhat forgettable. The butternut squash soup (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4386491456/) was a bit bland, as it can often be, but usually chefs will do something the kick a little flavor in. Not so much here. But perhaps the biggest let down of the night was the pork belly stew (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4385727231/), which I had very high hopes for. It all became sort of a runny tomato mess, and the texture on the pork belly was very odd and somehow tough...almost like it had been in a freezer too long.\n\nAfter an intermezzo of chilled citrus sorbet, which acted as a wonderful palate cleanser, the main courses got them back on the road to redemption, both delivering solid flavors. The Scottish salmon (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4385727849/) was a very large portion, and cooked perfectly, flaking apart very nicely. The one downside was a general lack of seasoning in the dish, but at least the fish seemed pretty fresh so those flavors were enough to carry it as a whole. The duo of duck (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4385727613/), while looking a bit sloppy, was easily the best dish of the night, and something worth returning to Savannah Red to taste again. The breast portion was seared nicely, and very juicy, and the sauce on top really helped bring out the flavors of the meat as well as adding a hint of sweetness. The confit part was huge, as I would prefer it to be, and just fell apart under the fork, a really well cooked piece of meat.\n\nSince I've left Charlotte I'm a bit out of touch with the dining scene there, but it's nice to see good places like this still around, despite a very challenging location. Granted, most places would kill for the prime real estate downtown, but I have a feeling a lot of its presence is lost by the hotel towering above it, and a lobby that is completely distracting with all the other options. I love that they try to maintain some sense of Southern cuisine in their menu, and that every time I've checked the menu since dining there a year ago they are constantly updating it with new, fresh additions.", "business_id": "C9CF7p53Y0L5ErKRhhFhng", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-02-15", "type": "review"}

It was a friend's 30th birthday so we wanted to go somewhere and light up a cigar to celebrate. Given Cutters is one of the few (if not only) indoor cigar smoking bars/options, your hands are kind of tied if you like cigars. I called (at 11pm) before going and was told last call was at 12:30 and the bar closes at 1am. At midnight, the waitress comes around for last call. When I ask what happened to 12:30 for last call, she says that the food and beverage director wants to shut down early - no other reason for the early closing. \n\n20 minutes later, a waitress comes over while we are finishing our cigar and drinks and says, \"Alright guys, you have to leave now\" and opens the door. If this is customer service, I'd hate to see what customer disservice looks like. I guess paying $15 worth of cutting fees for the cigars we brought with us and purchasing several drinks was not enough to buy good customer service. \n\nWe were clearly unhappy about the way we were being treated but left anyway. On the way out, the waitress holding the door makes unnecessary comments about our slowness in leaving the bar at 12:20 (which should be open until 1am). The waitress and the food and beverage director proceed to follow us out of the hotel, ask if we were staying there and threatened to have us kicked off the property. The sad part is we had not spoken with the food and beverage director up until this point so instead of inquiring about our displeasure and what happened, he immediately jumps to conclusions. Needless to say, Marriott Charlotte City Center and Marriott's Corporate Customer Service center will be receiving letters regarding this incident and the customer service of its staff. \n\nI personally hope Cutters gets what it deserves and closes up. It gives Charlotte entertainment options a bad name and the customer service was the worst I've experienced in a long time. \nCutters does not have to worry about my patronage going forward and Marriott should be ashamed to have such poor customer service associated with its brand.", "business_id": "7BVCmaxhvXgEpx7J-SQ4QA", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-12-10", "type": "review"}

As a Broncos fan, I felt it was important to really make myself seen, thus I wore a bright orange Broncos jersey in awesome Panther's seats.\n\nDespite my overt disregard for the home team, all the comments that I received from rival fans were in good spirits, and never abrasive or threatening (perhaps this was due to the fact that the Broncos got destroyed by the Panthers, and further embarrassment was not necessary).\n\nBeers and food are expensive as hell, but hey its a pro sports game.\n\nComparatively, ticket prices are not ridiculous.  The face value of my amazing seats was $90, while at a home Broncos game these would have easily been $200+.  Thus you can be an NFL fan in Charlotte without needing the corner office.\n\nAll in all, I was impressed with the experience.

It feels trendy, but isn't pretentious like some Uptown restaurants.  It's a great place to casually go before or after an Uptown show or event, especially if you can get there between 5:00 and 7:00 p.m. during the week because their tapas/appetizers are half-price!  Woo hoo!   And if we're lucky enough to go on a Wednesday evening, we can combine the half-price apps with half-price martinis.  You can really fill up on some gourmet food and classy, flavorful martinis...for cheap!   It does tend to get pretty crowded, though, on Wednesdays, so allow yourself enough time to be seated and get served all within that timeframe.  \n\nTheir regular menu is excellent, too.  They have gourmet American items, as well as a full sushi menu.  Their sushi is excellent and that's usually what I get if we're not there during happy hour.  The sushi can't beat places like Ru-San's or Nikko, but it's still pretty darn good...and very reasonably priced!  \n\nMy only disappointment with Cosmos Cafe would be that we went there once for my birthday (because that's where I wanted to go).  One of my friends made a reservation in advance and we were seated in a room by ourselves off to the side (their party room, I'm assuming).  Being in there  lost the atmosphere of Cosmos, but that wasn't all that went wrong.  We were handed limited menus.  There was some kind of event or show going on that night in Uptown (when isn't there anymore?) and Cosmos was providing a limited menu with only a few simple items (not even their gourmet options) so they could get people in and out quicker.

We had the upstairs reserved just for us. The atmosphere was comfortable. The downstairs [outside of our group] was dead. The physical layout of this place is impressive. On the outside, it looks like a corner business. But its really a full restaurant with an upstairs area. \n\nAnyways back to the actual experience. They served food upstairs for our group, which was cool, but you had to put your credit card down as a tab. [Not an issue]. The bar selection is ok. The food was ok. \n\nThe issue I have with this place is that when you go to pay out, they give you a post swiped transaction. This is the receipt that shows the total, card transaction details, tip, and total. They did not give a receipt detailing the full itemized service. After requesting the receipt and giving a quick look at it I paid, and put down a tip. \n\nAfter looking at the receipt later, it turns out that there was a gratuity charge already added to the receipt. I find this to be very deceptive and FRAUDULENT. Adding grautity to a bill doesn't bother me. It bothers me when 1. it was never stated that would be there, 2. when you don't have sitdown service with a waiter [the social group I was with was more of freeflowing in the bar area] \n\nTo add insult to injury, they try to play the club vibe outside. They put up velvet ropes, and use a door man. There was no line, and secondly, giving an impression of an \"exclusive club\" is a joke when there is only a handful of people at the bar downstairs. \n\nVibe: Dead\nFood: Decent\nDrinks: Typical selection\nDrink price: $5 for a beer.

There were also stations where employees had different reptiles and sea creatures that the kids could touch and ask questions about. There was a small area of sea life on display as well as a really cool frog/toad exhibit on the floor above. While were there they had a moving dinosaur display, which was by far on of the coolest things I've seen in one of these kid museums. There were these giant metal sculptures that you could move with remotes, levers, and pulleys. They had lights and sounds to go with them too. Just incredible, especially for my super curious button pushing son. They have a 3-D theater that shows 20min films for free with your day pass, perfect amount of time for little attention spans but still fun to watch.

My kids give it five stars and I give it three.  Average out to 4 stars. For those who like a little more meat on the bone, here goes. Everything here seems to be clean and in good working order (but with all the kids running around sneezing, this place is bacterial/viral city). Areas to build with blocks and learn about architecture. Quite a few interactive exhibits teaching everything from air pressure, different forces/physics  and animation. A science theatre area where experiments are performed. Additionally small carts go around with smaller participatory experiments. A small rainforest area and exhibit with frogs. Downstairs there is a small aquarium and a hands on area, where you can view items under a microscope or pet a horseshoe crab. Most people know that there is an IMAX as well, but that is a separate fee from the General Admission fee. Kids love this place.  Now my gripe. Admission for two adults and two kids is about $60. For 1.5 floors of exhibits I did not find much value. There was nothing for me as a parent other than enjoying the smiles on my children's faces. Really guys? I pay you to chaperone my own children. Either charge the adults and not the kids, or charge the kids and not the adults. And children's admission starts at age 2. Even Disney will cut you a better break than that. My interactions with the ticket counter made me feel like this place was a little bit \"money centered\"; they were very \"huffy\" and impatient with me.

Wow, how time changes a place.  My kids were bored...I mean INSANELY bored, and I have very inquisitive and intelligent children!  The very few exhibits that were interesting were covered over by kids who didn't know the meaning of the words \"taking turns\", whose parents were over in the corner on their assorted electronic devices.  This place is little more than a overhyped daycare now.  All the cool things I did and enjoyed as an adolescent were replaced with \"rooms\" that had microscopes that barely worked, a hands-on exhibit of water creatures that for some strange reason my kids weren't allowed to touch for more than two seconds by the employee manning the exhibit, despite some of the other children splashing around in the water and making a mess.  We severely overpaid for a grand total of ninety minutes of sheer boredom.  We honestly tried, but other than the building blocks in a supposed \"architecture\" exhibit that was taken over by adult Frank Lloyd Wright-wannabes, leaving few bricks for the actual kids to use, there was little to do.

The second time, we visited in the afternoon for lunch. We were pleased to see that there were people actually dining in there, several empty tables, and only one couple waiting to be seated. We watched as the first couple were seated. Needless to say, the one hostess on duty never returned. Having watched her every step of the way in seating the last couple, it seemed like she was just wandering through the restaurant aimlessly, not doing much of anything. And she never acknowledged us previously either. We waited for about five minutes, watching her, not doing much of anything. That's when I took action and walked over to her to remind her that we were waiting to be seated. She unenthusiastically walked back to the hostess stand with me.

The menu is a standardized but plentiful list of fruit-based smoothies broken down by general category of what you might be looking for.  For example, if you are looking for a sweet splurge, try the Indulgence category.  Want something lighter?  Try the Trim Down category.  \n\nAlong with your mix of fruits and juices you can also add on any of an number of supplements or 'enhancers.'  All the usual suspects here- vitamins, caffeine, anti-oxidants, fiber-blend.  If this is your bag, you can pump up the nutritional value (and price) of your smoothie.  You can also ask to have any smoothie made \"skinny\" whereby they leave out the honey and/or turbinado.  I actually prefer this, as you can taste the actual fruit in the drinks and they are not so cloyingly sweet.  \n\nFor those a little more hard-core, they also offer smoothies with the powdered supplement packages such as MetRx meal replacements.  You have a choice among three different sizes and the prices go up as you go bigger and the hike is not a good deal till you get to the biggest monster, a 40 oz. but then what single person needs a 2.5 pound smoothie?\n\nBesides smoothies, the store also has a small bulk food set-up with snacks such as gummies, yogurt covered pretzels and a number of fruit and nut mixes.  Prices are by the ounce and can get a little pricey as there is no nearby scale to check your purchase till you get to the register.  They also sell of host of supplement bars and others snacks, many vegan or low carb.  \n\nAll preparation is quick and, unless there is a line, I am rarely in the store more than 5 minutes.  Nice and snappy, and the staff doesn't spend time trying to up-sell anything.  \n\nJust know that even the small size smoothie is going to run you about $4.50.  At about $2,00 to step up to a medium.  Prices of other snacks are also a little higher than you might find elsewhere.  This tends to be the going rate, however, at other smoothie shops in the area.

It is free to join online.  You will be rewarded at any Omni you stay in, and it will help you become an instant FAN.  \n\n   In our experience, Omni's are often old (often historical) hotels that have excellent service.  Such was our experience here.  \n\n   Pluses: Loved that you have to have a room key to get up the elevator.  Security is a good thing.  Loved the friendly staff from front desk to room service.  Bed was very comfortable, as were our robes.  Truly love the free morning drinks that come with the loyalty program membership.  (see pic) Coffee for Husband, Tea for me, delivered promptly as requested to be delivered with a knock and \"leave it\".  We certainly made sure to call and have gratuity added on, as hopefully everyone does.    It is such a wonderful Omni feature, and the hard-workers that make it happen deserve to be rewarded!  \n\n   Slight negatives:  a bit complicated to order a movie (had to call downstairs and tell them what movie, etc.  Not a big deal, but it would be nice to be able to just do it from the room without involving anyone else)....Musty smell...I do believe it was coming from the piece of furniture that our tv was on.

One that was also noticed every time we entered the room.\n\n   Am a Priceline gal, and this was a very good \"win\"...really enjoyed our stay!  \n\nNote:  You can't beat this location if you want to be in the center of Downtown!", "business_id": "QThlnQ7AvzZwXHKD5DjdCw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-12-25", "type": "review"}

Restaurant not crowded, I noticed only Jody with a trainee.  Jody was our server, professional attire and attitude, however energetic.  She seemed happy with her job.  Immediately upon coming to the table she introduced herself and her trainee, asked if it was our first time at the restaurant, I explained yes, and she stated that the restaurant was a Steakhouse/Seafood restaurant, and proceeded to mention some of the more popular item on the menu in addition to 1 or 2 that happen to be her favorites.  She also asked if we what type of water we would like to drink (Pellegrino, bottle, or tap).  I opted for the Pellegrino water and she asked if I would like a small or large bottle.  I opted for the large, and she proceeded to bring it with some lime wedges, which I think adds a little bit of flavor to it.  \n\n     We proceed to order other non-alcoholic drinks and then started in on the menu.  Menu layout is easy to read to prices are stated next to the menu item.  On a couple places on the menu they've made comments about the dangers of eating raw or undercooked foods, which I thought was nice to see.  Both my friend and I ordered the Surf & Turf.  The Surf & Turf comes with an 8oz Filet Mignon and a 7 oz. lobster tail, with whipped potatoes and asparagus for sides all over a red wine demi glaze.  After a while Jody brought some warm bread and Olive Oil with oregano and balsamic vinegar to the table.  What can I say other than perfection.  The crust on the outside was like a hard bread, but the inside was soft and light.  To mix it with the olive oil combination was just perfection.  The flavors just all come together to give you this burst of flavor with our being too strong.  We waited some time for our dinners, and Jody had come back to the table 2 or 3 times apologizing about the wait, explaining that the lobster tails are taking a little bit longer.  A few moments after finishing our bread out came our Surf & Turf.   I've not had a lobster tail before, and WOW was I surprised.  The lobster tail was huge. I learned that they had substituted their normal 7oz lobster tail for a 12oz lobster tail.  Which made the dinner that more special for us.  I ordered mine Medium and wow was it tender.  It seemed to just melt in my mouth.  Well-seasoned and cooked to medium perfection.  The whipped potatoes with some demi glaze slightly drizzled over the top just enhanced them.  The asparagus where cooked to al dente and had their nice dark green color and firm texture, also along with some of the demi glaze on them it was like a party in my mouth.  Throughout dinner Jody had stopped to check on us and see how we were enjoying everything, and refilling our drinks.  I think there was really only 1 time that I needed to worry about a refill of my tea, other times Jody was one the ball making sure I had more tea before I was empty.  \n\n     Overall the service, food, and atmosphere was superb.  The only professional objection was there was one time the Jody went to fill my glass, and instead of bringing the glass to her or asking me to do so, she just reached in front of me to finish of the bottle of Pellegrino.  One of the first rules in good service is you never stretch yourself in front of the guest.  If you cannot reach the glass then you politely request the guest to move it towards you.  This I think was just an oversight, on Jody's part.  It was also difficult coming from the garage elevator to know where to go for the restaurant.  I understand that the establishment is at the mercy of the landlord regarding any type of signage, so this I cannot fault the restaurant for.  In conclusion, I would hold definitely hold these up to some of the caliper of The Capital Grill and other precarious restaurant's in uptown Charlotte.

It's been 35 minutes since I first ordered.\n\n One egg is borderline ok, the other is hard boiled again, the Hollandaise is dry and starting to curdle, the English muffins are not toasted properly and they're chewy as hell, the hash browns are absolutely tasteless. Not a micro-gram of salt, pepper, paprika, onions nothing to give it any flavor. \n\nNo waitress anywhere, not only mine but all the ladies wearing black tee-shirts are anywhere but in the dining room. After a few more minutes I lose patience, go to the counter find a waitress and ask her for my check.\n\nThe girl at the cash register asks me how was my meal and I tell her exactly how it went.... in detail. She is very very very sorry but doesn't offer to comp even the coffee. For maybe only the second or third time in my whole life I don't leave a tip. \n\nThe worst Eggs Benny I've ever had, coupled with ridiculously bad service: $15 and some change including a cup of coffee. That's right, over FIFTEEN DOLLARS for this.\n\nedit: check out the review that was filtered, I don't see why it was.  It reports a very similar experience to the one I had with the kitchen unable to cook the food right and the customer still being charged for it.", "business_id": "b856Q36EWKbwbm_XdJER8Q", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-01-22", "type": "review"}

They didn't have any openings in their schedule, so they referred us to Carolina Appliance Service. We called on Monday, 12/17/12 and were told the technician would call us the morning of Friday, 12/21 between 7:00 and 7:30 am to inform us when he would arrive. My wife then confirmed her day off from work.\n\nBy 9:00, she had not received a phone call, so she called the company. The person answering the phone said he would find out what was going on and call back in 20 minutes. 40 minutes later, having not received a phone call, my wife called back, to be told that the technician had called in sick. She asked who would be taking his place for the service call, and was informed that no one would, since he is the only one who serves this area (Steele Creek, southwest Mecklenburg County) and that we would have to reschedule.\n\nIn summary:\n\n- Carolina Appliance Service set up a day to service our washing machine and failed to provide service on the day agreed upon.\n- Carolina Appliance Service did not call us to inform us that the technician was out sick, and apparently didn't even know their technician wasn't working until we called.\n- Carolina Appliance Service did not make an attempt to replace the technician with another, and placed the responsibility of handling the situation caused by this technician's illness onto us.\n\nIn addition, the representative on the phone (my wife spoke with the same man with each phone call) treated her as if it was a great inconvenience to him that he had to deal with her. When my wife asked if he had planned to call her to tell her that they would not be servicing our washing machine, he said, \"Well, he's sick,\" as if the technician's illness absolves them of all responsibility of contacting their customers.\n\nEach interaction with this company suggests that they are an amateur organization who only deals with their customers when it is convenient to them to do so. I would love to comment on their actual service prowess, but given the difficulty we had in getting them to simply answer our questions on the phone, I doubt the day will ever come when we give them the chance to prove themselves in that category.", "business_id": "pbuSIs6lEKkDpFCQbpOcbA", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-12-21", "type": "review"}

The sliced pork (which I asked to be chopped) was good too.

Quail Corners has gone through a major facelift, as did Tropical Tan (they just finished construction recently and since it's winter, I have not been there to check out the new digs).  \n\nThey have three levels of beds, all kinds of packages, stand-up beds, spray tans, every kind of lotion imaginable, etc.  The facility and beds are exceptionally clean.  Caitlin is usually working when I go in and she is awesome, but I have found all of the staff to be friendly, helpful and knowledgeable.  The beds are big (I am chubby, so it's important to know that I am not going to go crashing through the plastic of some cheap, poorly made bed) and the fans in them are great.  Music plays, which is generally genre neutral, so you just bop along for the 5-10 minutes you are laying there.  They run great specials all of the time that I receive via email or even on their Facebook page.

I met her on her first day at work there at MMG Uptown office.  She was young and full of energy.  That has never charged.  She has helped me through minor ailments and major chronic diseases that I have experienced.  She is very smart, energetic, caring, compassionate and professional.  I left out one important fact.  She is extremely bright and keeps abreast of all the new information and procedures that become available on human physical and mental health issues.  She volunteers every year to help the needy and works several times a year in the hospitals to keep informed on the regular procedures and problems that arise there.\n\nOne of the things I like most about her is she is a Christian.  She prays for her patients regularly and cares about their families and how things are going at home and at work.  In my opinion,  you will not find a better doctor here in Charlotte,  North Carolina.  She is a Family Practitioner / Internist and has been rated one of the Best Doctors In America year after year.  That speaks volumes.\n\nI think it is important to recognize Doctor's who are making a difference in the world and Doctor Robinson is one of those Doctors.  I feel lucky to call her my Doctor.\n\nNew Comment. (UPDATE)\nI have been with MMG for about 20 years now.  When I call in to get an appointment now days my Primary Doctor, Dr. Robinson has No appointments available for sometimes 6-8 weeks.  The staff encourages me to go to her Nurse Practitioner or another available doctor.  I say no I want to see my doctor.  I guess when you get your quota of patients you are assigned a Nurse Practitioner.  I don't know?  You build up a familiarity  with your doctor and a history of all of your tests, past issues, current issues and then you can't see your own doctor it doesn't suit well with me.  Maybe a small, more family style of doctor/practice is the best way to go. They would perhaps be more available to the patients they see. It seems like in a large practice like MMG, you seem  to get thrown around a lot over the years. I truly feel bad for leading the readers of YELP to possibly be unable to get an appointment with her, their new recommended, doctor and then be unhappy with the service.   What bothers me the most is if you can't get an appointment with your doctor they will suggest that you see another available doctor.  When you are late for an appointment if it is more than 15 minutes late you may as well turn around and go home. If you go up to see your doctor after being 15 minutes late, they don't offer any options.   No one will care why you're late,  what happened to you on the way, or anything.  They just put you down on the books as a no show.  This happened to me recently and I had a broken ankle was using a new cane to get around,  had to walk a long way in the parking deck and I was walking very slowly. When I got up to the receptionist no one cared if I was in a tragic accident on the way to the appointment, if I got pulled over for some reason, if my child got sick at school and I had to pick him up on the way which put me behind some, or if I was sick as a dog and had to pull over in order to vomit several times, or couldn't find a close enough parking space and had to ride around looking and looking for a handicap space to park. No excuses mattered that was obvious because they didn't care why I was late.  All I got was reschedule.

I saw them get into their car and drive off - so much for waiting for their \"friend\"!\n\nAs I'm watching them leave, another guy who left at the same time as me and was headed home or to work or something says to me,\n\n\"I can't believe it - they were definitely here looking to get into people's lockers\"\n\"Yea, definitely, I'm surprised\", I reply\nThe guy says to me \"I actually had my locker broken into here not too long ago, my wallet was stolen...\"\n\nThe moral of the story is this - either bring a freakin masterlock with you, or don't change at the gym and just enjoy the facilities!\n\nOh and one more thing - for the money?  the Y charges you based on your income, so if you make decent money, you'll spend $100 a month for 2 people.  That to me is a bit on the pricey side...", "business_id": "b3u-GK6_xj2fJkinzLk_jQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-02-02", "type": "review"}

Normally I'm a regular at the south Charlotte Y's (Morrison, Harris & Siskey) but since it's a new year, I figured I'd try my hand at visiting this Y after work, since it's only about 1.5 miles from my office. The reviews here helped to convince me to give it a try, so I figured I'd write my own review as well to add to the information.\n\nI showed up around 4:45 and managed to find a spot. As soon as I walked through the turnstile I went to the guest relations desk and asked the woman behind the counter if she could direct me to the women's locker rooms. She offered right there to give me a full tour, so I took her up on the offer.\n\nThe facility is large, and as others have remarked, bustling. There were multiple basketball courts, two sets of lap lanes in the swimming pool (one warm, one cold), and all the other features you'd expect at a gym: spin room, tons of cardio machines just about everywhere you turned, machined weights and free weights. They had several stretch assisting machines and devices throughout the main gym area as well.\n\nThe women's locker room is indeed huge, and it's overwhelming at first. Lockers abound (I think there are almost too many, there's no way these fill up at 100%). I only found two toilet stalls in the women's locker room, but I'm pretty sure I must have missed another set somewhere. \n\nOne thing to note: You need a full-sized padlock for these lockers. I have used a small luggage style combo lock at the Harris for a long time, but it doesn't fit the lockers at the Dowd. Fortunately, they'll let you borrow a keyed lock with a driver's license.\n\nThere are a limited number of machines (perhaps a dozen or two, treadmills, ellipticals, stair steppers, recumbent bikes and rowing machines) and free weights in the women's locker room, and most of them were in use. I opted to climb onto one of the stair stepping machines for 20 minutes to start. After that I wandered the rest of the gym and hopped on a treadmill for a few more minutes. The stair stepper action (it's been awhile since I've used a stair stepper) caused my calf to tighten up uncomfortably, so I only spent another 20 minutes on the treadmill. It's January and as you can imagine, the place is packed to the gills.\n\nI decided to ease off and hit the steam room, which let's face it, is the real reason I go to the Y (well, this one and Harris, at least). I just force myself to exercise before I get to the \"reward\".\n\nAnd this is where the Dowd Y fell short for me. The steam room was the driest steam room I've used, and the full, bright lighting made it  less relaxing than the one at the Harris. It's not serene and quiet, people chat and talk loudly in this steam room. \n\nBoth the Dowd & the Harris Y have spray bottles of eucalyptus from a \"Club Aroma\" spa supply place. The eucalyptus bottle at the Harris Y is occasionally running on empty, but when it's filled it is good stuff. The \"eucalyptus\" at the Dowd was non-existent. They're cutting it so much with water (I presume) that it smells like nothing. The eucalyptus not only helps with opening nasal passages, it also makes the steam rooms smell nice, and this one - since there's no real eucalyptus to spray - smelled decidedly NOT nice.\n\nFinally, there's something else others have touched on a bit: the rampant nudity in the locker rooms. Here's the thing - I'm a bit of a prude about nakedness, being as I was raised in the south and taught the naked human form was an evil tool of the devil and all. But in a locker room, I realize that's mostly MY problem, and that the occasional flash of full frontal or a butt is the price you pay for dressing and undressing around other women. \n\nThere's a difference between flashes of nudity, and the women walking around the Dowd Y locker room for two hours, acting like they're in a nudist colony. Seriously, not a stitch on one particular older woman for two hours, as she stretched, dried her hair, lounged in chairs, and rubbed lotion on her face. I'm real glad for her that she's comfortable with the body she's got, but *I'M* not comfortable with it, and seeing her with her legs kicked up on the chair outside the steam room every time I entered it, just letting it all hang out, was disturbing. And it's not just about looks, I don't care how aesthetically pleasing your naked form might be, at least show a little courtesy and a slight amount of modesty.\n\nI didn't find the steam room or the locker room relaxing after my workout at all last night. I saw things no human should have to see, frankly. I appreciate it's close to my office, but I've heard Childress-Klein is too, and a little better about these sorts of things. I'd recommend the Dowd Y, but only to people who really honestly don't care about having strange women exhibitionists waving stuff around in their faces while in the locker room. As for me - I care - probably too much to return.", "business_id": "b3u-GK6_xj2fJkinzLk_jQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-01-04", "type": "review"}

We made an Open Table reservation thanks to Yelp (recognizing my boyfriend under his first-name-last-name-initial Yelp alias when we arrived at the host stand) and discussed where they would seat us amongst themselves for what seemed to be a solid 5 minutes. The host finally walked us to a table, realized the table wasn't available, and walked us across the very large restaurant to a little two-top nook. Not a bad table, but it always makes me laugh when hosts/hostesses are confused about where to take the table. I mean, I know how it is from my college days as a hostess in fine dining, having servers whine about not having equal tables and blah blah.\n\nSo we're seated and we look over the menus. It's supposedly Mediterranean but there are dishes from all over the world, with the origin of the dish and suggested wine pairing accompanying the description. We were torn between the crab/lobster cakes and the hummus, but opted for the cakes because LOBSTER. Always go for lobster. We ordered our main courses (venison for him, scallops/pork medallions/pasta for me) off of the \"seasonal\" menu section... shortly after, our appetizer arrived. Absolutely delicious cakes, however there were two and very small. I suppose for something so rich you only need a bite. My pasta dish was good and not cream-based- it mostly got its flavor from  the scallops and pork. Very good, a lot of pasta which I didn't finish. We always share bits of our meals whenever we go out, though this time I didn't try the venison- maybe it's the \"I grew up in Michigan and I protest against deer hunters\" thing, maybe it's because venison is just too gamey. He liked it though.\n\nThat said, we go out several times a week and haven't been totally blown away with any Charlotte dinners until this weekend- 2/2 nights out this weekend were solid- and I'm glad my friend recommended Blue to us. For the food, we'll definitely be back.", "business_id": "eaqJQP6bp7rQJQt5KqfvxQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-02-09", "type": "review"}

Through Open table we were able to get a reservation in 15 min to blue. The table all started off with a beverage my husband and I shared a bottle of meiomi pinot noir which was so good ( one of our friends suggested it). We also had crab cakes, scallops, and a cheese plate for appetizers- all great! I had the wild boar for dinner it was also served with the pork short ribs, I would have preferred if I could have just gotten more of the wild boar, a very tender meat that resembles more of a beef than pork. For dessert we had creme brule, which pretty much no one can mess that up and also a blueberry port that was outstanding! We went well over our budget and be aware that a party of 6 is already charged gratuity. You can eat here for around $35 per person if you want to but you can quickly start adding things up with drinks and other add ons. The wait staff was very helpful and the live music was good when they were playing, it seems the band that night decided they would play 2 songs then go on a 15 min break.

We try to go somewhere new every time this event rolls around to see if we find any little unexpected gems. Food was pretty good, service was absolutely disappointing, & prices matched the quality of food for the most part. Nothing earth shattering here but it is certainly a decent place to eat on the high end.\n\nWe started with the Arrancini and the Hummus & Dolmada. Both of which were excellent. The Arrancini was really excellent. Could sit around and get fat on that one. Mmmm. \n\nNext we ordered Trout a la Navarra and Chicken Tagine. The menu description of the Chicken Tagine says \"a fiery harrisa sauce\". Yes. It. Is. My husband likes things that set my face on fire and he mentioned it was nearly too fiery for him! This dish, IMO, is over priced by about 5-7 dollars. Other than the price though, he had no complaint (it was Queen's Feast so everything was a flat rate from the offering menu so no bigs). The Trout a la Navarra was very well prepared. The trout cooked, skin on, perfectly. This is a plate I would absolutely order again. There wasn't a trace of it left on my plate when I was done. \n\nWe finished off the meal with Sticky Toffee Pudding and Amaretto Cheesecake. The sticky toffee pudding was absolutely delicious. Nectar of the sugar addicted gods. I can't speak toward the cheesecake because, well, yuck. But the hubs said it was pretty good. He's the cheesecake man, not I.\n\nThe service? Was seriously lacking and well below par for a place of this sort. Yes, it was very busy. Since when did that become and excuse for poor service IN a service based industry?? Our waitress was inattentive, slow, and we clearly had just half of her already fractured attention. Also.......a personality to be rivaled only by moldy driftwood. I get that it was Queen's Feast and there are alot of \"po folk\" out living the good life for half the price so tips are going to be lacking. However, I tip extremely generously when you have earned it, regardless. Do your job, do it well or go home. \n\nAll in all, would eat there again for a special occasion. Some of the dishes are a bit over priced, the food was good, the place itself had a nice vibe, but service left alot to be desired.", "business_id": "eaqJQP6bp7rQJQt5KqfvxQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-02-25", "type": "review"}

No explanation why or substitutes, just less than what was advertised.\n\nBeyond the disappointing breach with regard to the menu our waitress was rude.  Our waitress was Ronda (Rhonda?), she had blonde hair and was a smoker.  I don't know if she still works there but she treated our entire table as if she was too dignified to serve us, not to serve in general just that we must be beneath her.  I don't know if it was because of my race, or some of my in-laws are heavy set, or a combination of everything.\n\nShe was so rude I wrote down her name and made sure to remember to let the manager know (I couldn't find the manager the day of).  The manager, Scott Daniel, swore up and down how sorry he was etc., he even promised to send a gift card for $100 (or was it $75) so we could go back out to Blue on the house.  At the time I didn't really care because I didn't live in Charlotte and driving down from Richmond, VA just to give another chance to a restaurant seemed beyond me.  Combine that with I would only be in town for a special family occasion and who in her right mind would chance another terrible experience at Blue on such a cherished occasion?

JWU Student Assistants to help you. They provide knives and all the cooking tools that the Students use. Oh, and this includes a Sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord of food that IS provided to you.....you just have to prepare it. And THAT is why I take these classes! More often than not you leave STUFFED. And sometimes, IF they have the disposable containers, they will let you take your leftovers home.\n\nFolks, this is SO TOTALLY WORTH EVERY PENNY I'VE INVESTED! Yes, I view this as a LIFE investment! I've always thought I've been a pretty damn good cook my whole life. Now after taking these courses, I know that I REALLY know SO VERY LITTLE! I'm humbled by what I have learned, and I have become a 100000000% BETTER home chef because of it! I've learned how to make Tuscan Braised Pork Belly, Pomme de Terre Dauphinois (French Custard/Cheese Potatoes), Mushroom Tart appetizers, Bourbon Pecan Tarts....God I don't know WHERE to stop! I've learned a TON!\n\nAnd I've met some amazing people! I've become good friends with one of my instructors and his wife (who also teaches there).\n\nI'm telling you that this is a DEAL of DEALs. Go to the Johnson & Wales website, click on the Charlotte section, and look up \"Chef's Choice.\" My strong recommendation is to sign up for the 5 week Bootcamp. I learned SOOOOOOO much in that class. But if $650 is too much for you to handle, you can take ANY class offered. Boot camp is NOT a pre-requisite for any course. It WOULD help if you have SOME knife skills and know a LITTLE of how to cook. But trust me I've seen some people who could barely boil water so that shouldn't stop you.\n\nIF you want to improve your cooking skills in any area, take some Chef's Choice courses at JWU. You'll thank me later.\n\nCiao!", "business_id": "Ytiiyv0BtcURxRCa4WbP1g", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-12-13", "type": "review"}

I didn't make it very far without sneaking a bite, and in the future I'll know not to press my luck and just enjoy my food with the others parked out front.\n\nThere are definitely no frills here, I walked in the doors to a long counter with a woman standing behind it, a series of reach-in coolers behind her filled with assorted jamaican drinks amoung other things I didn't catch, and a fairly open kitchen with a stove, a steam table, a warmer, and some equipment around the corner I couldn't see. As noted in another review it was (refreshingly) very clean. The menu is posted on the window as you walk in, along the wall on the inside, and also on a chalk board inside. I don't know if the chalkboard changes at all, but it seemed to have the same items on it as the printed menus.\n\nI was a little torn by the options: red snapper, oxtail, curry, a stew, goat, jerk chicken... but I went with the jerk chicken. And then comes the decision on the sides... mac n cheese, cabbage, more rice n beans, greens.. I went with cabbage. A small plate is a whole to go container of rice & beans, chicken, and cabbage - so I have no idea what kind of food you get in a large plate. The desserts sounded fantastic, I almost got a rum cake but stopped myself. (That was the one moment I was happy I couldn't sit down and eat, because I knew if I had more time to debate with myself the rum cake would have been purchased.) My small plate and a ting came to around $11. Not bad. \n\nAfter I ordered, the box was assembled as I stood there, everything either sitting hot on the stove or warm in the steam table. I was a little surprised as she flashed the filled container to me in approval before she shut it, but looking back it was nice touch to be able to check my order right there instead of getting to my car (or home) and being disappointed. I got to my car and noticed a few others eating, took a few bites myself, and then continued home. (windows down, windows up made it too tempting to nosh at every stop light)\n\nThe jerk was really nice, very mild and sweet. I almost wished it had a little bit more heat to it, but very good. The cabbage was a little on the salty side but once you start mixing it in with the perfectly cooked rice and beans it all evens out. \n\nI definitely want to try a few other items on the menu, and if they are anywhere near the caliber of the jerk, I know I'll be very happy with them as well.", "business_id": "CDH2dyRcJUDPM1xj4AD0lQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-02-28", "type": "review"}

Loving all things carbs, I checked online and they were open early. Such a nice change for a morning person like me since many things in Charlotte don't seem to be open early on the wknd! I walked in there and this place is HUGE! Of course the other thing I noticed was the smell of fresh breads being baked, so many flavors, so little time. IHowever, it was filled not only with bread but an inventory of dips, chutneys, sauces, etc. They also have a cart with dry soup mix that is gluten free and looked pretty tasty. \n\nI wasn't sure what to get there so I went with Rosemary Garlic loaf to get something with flavor. This girl cooks a lot of Italian food so I am sure I can incorporate it in a meal somewhere. They have toaster and round loaves-which just mean the size of the loaf (I had no clue what they meant when they asked this so I just said toasted in an inquisitive way). Their bread has no artificial ingredients or preservatives and according to their website, shouldn't be refrigerated but can be frozen (they gave me extra bags when I told them I want to freeze mine). \n\nThey also have a bread card where you buy 12 loaves, you get one free. When I saw others put three $$$ for price on here, I don't agree. The loaves are about $5 a pop and most bread at the supermarket is an average of $3 so I don't think the price is too high, especially for freshly baked bread without preservatives or artificial ingredients. I dig how they have the nutritional info on their website so you can see what you're taking in. They also have sandwiches there besides bread so if you're looking for a quick treat, you should stop on in! \n\nTwo Citipass coupons--one for a free loaf, the other is for BOGO sandwich.", "business_id": "q6liXMxYTMYx7evcgz1eQQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-01-22", "type": "review"}

Besides a small and rotating selections of freshly baked breads, this shop also offers a number of sweet treats and other baked goods, all of which deserve a try.  They also offer lunch sandwiches, made with their bread and your choice of meat and/or veggies.  \n\nFor me, this is usually a breakfast time stop, especially on Saturdays.  They make some of the biggest cinnamon rolls I have ever seen- in both a low fat and a fully-leaded version.  If you're not feeling so sweet, their scuffins (that's a mix between a muffin and a scone) are a solid choice.  Add in a cup of their fresh-brewed counter culture coffee and you're all set to start the day in the right way.\n\nDo check their web site or stop in and pick up a monthly calendar to see what their baking for that month.  Speciality breads change monthly, but there are standards that remain- such as Friday's cinnamon chip and their honey wheat loaves.  On certain days they also do gluten free breads, for those who need it.  \n\nBe aware that on some baking days breads may not be available until about noon  You can always stop in and place your order early to make sure you have it waiting for you.  You can call in your order too.\n\nPrice wise, you'll pay a little more than your average supermarket, but then I think you are getting a better product that you know was made locally and fresh.  Their speciality breads are also things you won't find at the average market (cherry and white chocolate chip anyone?).  \n\nI also love that the owners are big supporters of the local running scene.

Now it is just the chapel, which is used for weddings - I suppose other events could take place there as well, but weddings are far and away the most popular event at the chapel.\n\nTake note of that if you plan to get married there (as we did).  We went in late January and they were booked through August.  This means that every possible slot was filled - in two-hour increments - more than seven months in advance.  In other words, plan ahead.\n\nAs luck would have it, browsing one page at a time, we managed to find a single slot that had been canceled, so we grabbed it, and that lone factor is what sealed our wedding date (a mere two months from our engagement date, rather less than that from the time we went to find a venue).  But we are very glad it did, because the location itself rocks.\n\nNestled just outside the 277 loop, on the grounds of Thompson Park (also the site of the Vietnam Veterans memorial), the chapel and the park offers a nice respite from the busy-ness of Uptown while being close to everything.  The trees provide great cover, so you barely know you are so close to the city, and inside it is like you have stepped back in time.  You can even have your organist play a harpsichord (if they are able).\n\nSince our wedding party was intimate - just the immediate family - we had the whole group entirely on the raised dais, which provided a nice treat to everyone, rather than scattering them in the pews, which would have separated everyone far too much (for larger parties, it would certainly be fine).

But then you also want to branch out and try something new? Yeah... so, this was my inner dialogue: \"Dude, you should try a new place for lunch.\" \"But Crisp down the street is really good and consistent.\" \"Yeah, but this place has good reviews on Yelp.\" \"Fuck. Alright, fine. I'll give it a shot.\"\n\nI should have listened to the side that wanted to go to Crisp. You walk into 7th Steet Market and the first thing that will probably cross your mind is: wow this place looks like a giant Subway. I mean, seriously, the furniture is old and kinda beat up to crap, the menu is unoriginal and it just looks like a bunch of shit has been thrown together to look like a deli. In short, it has no character.\n\nOn the plus side, the service is great and the Greek Salad with chicken that I ordered was very good. They pre-make the salad veggies and leave them in the case, but the chicken itself was freshly grilled and came with a really nice Greek dressing with chunks of feta cheese.\n\nHaving said that, Adams 7th Street Market is not my jam. They're just slapping together some Boar's Head meats and cheeses and throwing them onto bread; you might as well go to Harris Teeter if that's what you're looking for. However, if it's more your kind of thing and you want to support local business, then I would recommend it.

A group of 6 of us went last night for Restaurant Week (which I highly recommend - $30 per person for 4 courses).  I have always heard great things about the Melting Pot and have been wanting to try it out for the longest time.  The hostess and the waitresses were both amazing.  They were really good and patient with us considering it was our first time there, and we all had no clue what we were doing.  \n\nWe started out with the Appetizer course.  We got to pick 2 types of cheeses for dipping our Bread, apples, and fresh vegetables.  We chose the Wisconsin Trio & the Fondue a la France.  I think the consensus was that the Wisconsin Trio was better, but they both were delightful. Next we all got to pick a salad.  I chose the Caesar.  Next we moved onto our Entrees.  We either got to choose between... \n\nThe Coastal which included blackened scallops, cedar plank salmon, breast of chicken, teriyaki sirloin, white shrimp, and spinach & artichoke ravioli  \n\nor\n\nThe French which included filet mignon, chicken Provencal, roasted garlic shrimp, peppercorn NY Strip, ratatouille & goat cheese ravioli, and asparagus\n\nSince there was 6 of us in the party, 3 of us chose The Coastal, and 3 of us chose The French so we could just taste and mis-match them all.\n\nThey give you the choice of two kinds of dipping broth to use to cook all of your entrees.  We chose the Coq au Vin and Court Bouillon. I personally enjoyed the filet mignon, chicken Provencal, goat cheese ravioli, teriyaki sirloin, and spinach & artichoke ravioli.\n\nAfter all this, we moved on to the Dessert course. We got to choose two types of Chocolate dipping sauces.  First was the DISARONNO\u00ae Meltdown which is Silky white chocolate swirled with Disaronno\u00ae Originale Amaretto and second was the Flaming Turtle which is Milk chocolate, caramel and chopped pecans.  Yum Yum and more Yum!!!  They are served with cheesecake, pound cake, brownies, marshmallows, Rice Krispies treats, bananas and strawberries.\n\nAfter all that I think we were all ready to take a big nap.... and were busting at the seams of our pants!!! Haha.  I have to say I highly recommend this place, not just for the amazing food, but the experience.  This was a 3 hour dinner that seemed like an hour.  The laughing and the fun of cooking and dipping your own food was so enjoyable.  This place is great for a good group of friends or even a date night between two people.\n\nAnd just one more thing... Since your cooking the food right at your table, your going to smell like your food, so I highly recommend not wearing clothing that isn't easy to wash into the Melting Pot, and also leave your jacket in your car..... lol.", "business_id": "uDoTFFud2mXE3VT1Jt9L5A", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-01-22", "type": "review"}

That may be standard here, but when I went to another Melting Pot in New Mexico, it wasn't...so that was really nice. They sat us in a back room, at a 4-person, 2-pot table which was perfect for us! We wanted to try EVERYTHING! We had the Boston Beer Cheese Fondue and the Wisconsin Trio - The Boston Cheddar was not my personal favorite, I tend to go for the Wisconsin or Swiss fondues...but the Boston complimented the apples very well. Then we went with the Seafood and Chicken platter (no red meat for our friend) and the 2nd we chose was the land and sea...plenty of red meat there. Our cooking styles were Coq Au Vin and Mojo...I find the Mojo a little lacking in flavor and always have...but that's just my personal taste. The Coq Au Vin was very robust and added a great depth of flavor. Then on to the Creme Brulee white chocolate and a Turtle Dark Chocolate. Both were wonderful! They even gave us an extra dessert plate full of everything! \n\nThe Melting Pot is a 3-hour experience when you do The Big Night Out and add a glass of wine or two...however the experience is well worth it.

On this occasion we went with another couple who have never been to the Melting Pot before. We were super excited because we always leave full and happy. \n\nWe made a reservation for 5 pm, on Saturday, the first weekend of restaurant week. It took 15 minutes to be seated, which is a bit out of character for them, but considering the day and the weekend, it was understandable. \n\nWe were seated In a booth upstairs with one burner, which is a mistake with two parties - if you are going with two couples request two burners, it will make your life so much easier. \n\nWe got the cheddar cheese fondue, the pacific meal, and we made our own chocolate, the dark chocolate swirled with peanut butter. The food itself was very good, but I think our waiter was new and did not know how to balance all of his tables. \n\nWe had to ask for more food several times. You can ask for more bread and apples for example until all of your cheese is gone and vegetables and dips during the dinner (meat) portion. We were getting enough of the main part of each course but only enough of the secondary parts like the vegetables and bread and such for half of our group. During the meat part we had to ask another Melting Pot employee for more vegetables and dip because we had given up on our waiter ever bring anything back...we had asked him 20 minutes prior. \n\nOur waiter also turned the burner on too high the entire time, and very rarely explained anything to us, including the dips and the batter during our meat course. I understand that we had been there before, but our friends hadn't. And they didn't get to hear all of the fun things to do with dips like fill the mushrooms with the green goddess, or that the plums sauce is good on the shrimp, or if you mix curry and plum it makes a delicious new sauce. \n\nI think the takeaways from this meal was to 1. Always get at least one burner per couple, 2. Make sure your burners are always on the appropriate heat setting because it will burn your food, and 3. If you are going during prime dining time during restaurant week be prepared to be patient.\n\n***Update. Not even an hour after this review the manager, Steven called me to go over my review and to chat in order to improve their business. I think this is awesome! Remember how I said we had asked another employee for more veggies and dips? It was him! He was amazing and had even tried to see if they had an extra two burner table at the beginning of the meal. With people like him the Melting Pot will always be in business.", "business_id": "uDoTFFud2mXE3VT1Jt9L5A", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-01-20", "type": "review"}

And for the prices charged, this is as it should be.  My only complaint is the hostess took a phone call that apparently involved a complicated reservation and we were left standing for several minutes without a greeting or other recognition.  A small point, but couldn't the caller have been put on hold till we were whisked off to our own reservation?\n\nI got to try a couple of different cheese dips, broths and meats for the main course, and no less than 4 different types of chocolate fondue.  All came with plenty of accompanying items to drop into the fondues.  Vegetables were basic: broccoli, cauliflower and carrots.  Apples and grapes were a nice twist.  With the chocolate we had fresh bananas and strawberries that were a bit less fresh.  We also had squares of poundcake and rice crispy treats.  They brought more of what was popular, as much as we asked for.  No one should suffer for a lack of food here.\n\nMy issue really centers around the meats.  We had an endless deal, so I got to try a lot of different things, but here's the way it generally works: you get a meat (sometimes pre-seasoned) and cook it in a broth or an oil.  That broth may have a plain base of might be flavored with another set of seasonings. Once done, you put your meat on a small plate that has room for up to 6 different dipping sauces, all with another set of seasonings.  That's up to 3 different seasonings in the finished project.  Muddled and confusing?  Yeah, to say the least.  Can you narrow it down?  Of course, but that's hardly discouraged at the time you order.\n\nI like the concept, especially if you have a long time to sit down for dinner.  Our complete dinner lasted just over 3 hours.  It makes for great conversation with a small group.  However, when paying a minimum of $30 a head for dinner I'd like to think I'm paying for a chef's skill and training in producing good food.  Here you get all the basic building blocks and do the final work yourself.  I know it's novel, and some folks get excited for the change, but it's a off-putting to me.  If that's what you go for, however, this location will give you the full experience and make sure you are comfortable and served with care.  I'd easily go back for dessert, and maybe that alone.", "business_id": "uDoTFFud2mXE3VT1Jt9L5A", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-12-11", "type": "review"}

First, I met with Dr. Moore in July 2011 and she was great. She was friendly, knowledgeable. I liked her a lot. I don't think it's appropriate to get into detail, but it was the least painful woman check up ever. If you're local and plan to stay local, I highly recommend. \n\nHowever, in December of 2012 my parents got a certified letter saying I failed to keep my follow up appointment (which I never made) to check on my diagnosis of dysplasia. Uhm WHAT? I assumed my results were normal since I heard nothing for a year and a half. When I called to figure out what on earth happened, I found out that my results were abnormal. When I didn't come back in July of 2012 (because I moved to Boston) it flagged them to follow up with me. I guess that took 6 months because the letter came when I was home for Christmas. \n\nSo not only was the letter misleading (it insinuated I was pre-cancerous when I was not) and my results were not communicated with me, but on top of that the nurse I spoke to was outrageously rude to me. She seemed annoyed with me for being worked up about the letter and tried to intimate that it was my fault for not coming back in July 2012. She didn't seem to understand that I had no knowledge of the abnormal results or why I would be upset about a certified letter saying I could get cancer if I continue to ignore this diagnosis. \n\nNow my blood tests are exhibiting discrepancies consistent with some leukemias and I remembered this. I called the office again to ask about my medical records (the receptionist was very helpful and great!) and to have someone call me back to refresh my memory on my abnormal results. Once again, the nurse's attitude was inexcusable. She started interrogating me on my follow up care, asking why I hadn't been back since 2011 and why I thought I had two, normal results consecutively if I didn't. I had to once again explain that her office didn't notify me until DECEMBER 2012 and my last pap was in JULY 2012. \n\nLast, and this is the best part, she started questioning my current sexual information (Do you have a boyfriend? Do you use condoms?). I felt it was highly inappropriate, not least of all because I don't know actually who I'm speaking with. I'm still not entirely clear on how someone can be so rude to a scared patient, and I don't understand their follow up policies at all.

One of my best friends worked here during my first years of college so logically (with the food discounts and everything), we would come here for lunch or dinner a lot. If I could fall in love with a restaurant, it'd be true love between  me and Mama Ricotta's. Apparently a lot of others feel the same way so maybe Mama's is cheating on me. Oh well. I'll tolerate it this time- I'm still in that infatuated stage and I don't think it's ending any time soon. I always have a ton of options here and everything is always absolutely perfect. I usually hate eating pasta with only tomato sauce and no grated cheese, but I was forced to try their angel hair pasta with tomato basil sauce WITHOUT parmesan cheese and it was perfect. I was truly amazed. Who knew tomato sauce could be so good that you don't need or even WANT cheese?! And the tiramisu? In the past, I've personally described it as the equivalent of a tiramisu-flavored cloud. Perfect texture, perfect combination of flavors and perfect density. Best tiramisu 've ever had by far.\n\nHowever, with that said, I am bummed about two things. First off, their Mama's Pasta is NOT on the  menu anymore. Apparently they can still make it, but it's by special request only. Also, the tiramisu has been lacking in cloud-like quality the last two times I've gone in to eat. It could be that I'm just getting the last slice of it or maybe they just changed their recipe. Either way, I've been slightly disappointed. Hopefully it'll be back to the same thing next time I go. *fingers crossed*", "business_id": "MQnNtW1lHS-eid3QNUoUIw", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-01-23", "type": "review"}

Maybe I'm weird. Maybe I've got a very sensitive palette. Maybe I'm just not average, but I find Mama Ricotta's well below average and very very very salty.  I'm not someone who shies away from salt- I always have it on my eggs, etc.  But it seems like recently, everything at Mama's is over seasoned.  A lot of the dishes like the Pasta Primavera is very unremarkable so generally I like the chicken carciofi the best, but perhaps because of the capers it is so salty I can never finish it. I went there for a business lunch (basically the only reason I'll go) and had a roasted beet salad. I thought I was in the clear with a salad, but no- it was so salty too! A salad?? And not a nicoise salad?? It was very strange and it was very overdressed. Perhaps next time I'm forced to go, maybe I should try a sandwich? \n\nThe other complaint i have about this place is the service. One time recently the server was really inattentive. The second time, the server was really bitchy (and it was a guy). I've never understood how someone who relies on tips is smug and rude.

It's not really in my hood but decided I wanted some Rigatoni, Yelp'd it, and these guys came up. I've driven by it dozens of times and to be honest, thought it may be a sandwich/sub shop or some other take out type strip mall joint. DON\"T BE FOOLED by the unassuming street front. Go inside and check it out!! I literally stopped at the reception (yes, I was greeted and welcomed) and had to smile. While taking in the inviting, Italian Chalet ambience that looks like it should be situated on some Mediterranean bluff, I was directed over to the bar to pick up my take away order. The kind gent behind the bar, who was on the horn taking other orders, glanced over with a quick smile to let me know he knew I was there. This is something I always notice in a restaurant or anywhere customer service is important - does that staff look past you or do they make an effort for eye contact? Based on the time frame from order to when I actually arrived (10 min) he was able to guess who I was and promptly went to packaging my order. Needless to say I was already excited - it smelled like my Auntie Rita's (not really my aunt) kitchen on Sunday afternoon. An oversized handled bag (re-usable) was filled with what appeared to be my order plus maybe another 2 patrons orders. Everything was kept in a warmer cabinet (not under a heat lamp) until I arrived which was also housing baking sheets full of tear apart rolls...they'll change your life, for sure. I had a moment to look around their bar/lounge area which I will certainly be back to. I didn't see the wine list but it appears you'll most definitely be able to find something you like - I saw lots of good opened bottles meaning you can get it by the glass. There is a wood fired pizza oven as soon as you walk in and I saw a few being carried out by the staff that looked really nice. The bar keep thanked me, wished me Happy New Year and off I went.\nI ordered the Rigatoni with Meat Sauce and the Chopped Salad. Absolutely amazing!\nThe pasta was cooked perfectly - great texture and flavor. The gravy was bright red and full of fresh tomato flavor. The meat was tender and possibly rough chopped meatballs. The wife thought there should be more gravy but I thought it was just perfect. The salad was certainly a masterpiece. Chopped is certainly the right name for this salad. Everything in it was chopped so that it blended all of the flavors of the salad in every bight.  Olives, Pepperoncini, Tomatoes, Blue Cheese, Nuts (Walnuts??), Lettuce, Kale, Carrot, Onion, Chick Pea.....all I can say is, Damn!\nNeedless to say, I'll be back, lots - Can't wait to work my way through their menu. \nThanks, Mama!", "business_id": "MQnNtW1lHS-eid3QNUoUIw", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-12-31", "type": "review"}

The food is watered-down and bland, Americanized 'fake Italian' dishes that cater to those patrons with unsophisticated palates who don't know the difference. \n\nI ordered the Pasta Carbonara when we are here, and I have no idea how they classify what was placed in front of me as 'Carbonara'.... It was basically a fake from-the-jar Alfredo sauce on top of undercooked vermicelli with some frozen peas and bacon thrown in.  In order to be Carbonara, the dish must have a sauce comprised mostly of whisked eggs, pasta water, Parmesan, and seasoning.  Calling what was served \"Carbonara\" is just wrong, and is an unfair representation of Italian food.\n\nThe wine was actually fairly good (I think we ordered a Pinot and a Riesling), and our waitress was very kind.

Despite an onslaught of $1 kiosks and the advent of internet media streaming, I'm happy to say that the store has recently been acquired by a new owner who is also local and committed to keeping the business going.  But it needs support.  Here are the reasons why Visart is worth an actual drive and stop in:\n\n1.  This is the local hub to find out about arts happenings in the community.  Local bands, small theater productions, neighborhood festivals- they all advertise on the community board posted up front.  Take some time and read about what's going on around you!\n\n2.  Flipping thru movie titles on a computer screen still pales in comparison to scanning movie box titles across a tightly-packed shelf.  Visart is packed to the gills with movies from just about any genre you can imagine.  There's something about discovering that flick that will be \"the one\" for the night that you otherwise would never have seen coming.  This is hard to do when a computer program effectively censors what movies it shows you based on your past browsing history.  Down with the artificial intelligence !\n\n3.  Not everything is digital.  If there are some movies you can't stream online, it's likely Visart has them.  Foreign flicks, exploitation films and others I can't even name have a section here.  If you are a film student or movie buff, this is your Shangri la.  \n\nMaybe this is the start of me becoming an old-fogie?  If so, I'll play the part- when I was a kid, we went to the real movie store and found our flicks the honest way- scanning the shelves and reading the actual jacket cover- and we liked it.", "business_id": "STcLx0y_X89TsC0m2gVgHw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-01-12", "type": "review"}

Case in point: I renewed my membership a few months ago after letting it lapse for a while, to contribute some $ the cause. The girl at the counter barely broke her conversation w/a girlfriend to say 2 words to me--no thank for coming back, idle chit-chat, nothing. And that's the norm at VisArt-absolutely no attempt at any sort of customer service beyond \"hey, we got great movies, we don't have to be nice!\" (wasn't that the gist of an old SNL sketch w/Lily Tomlin about AT&T?) Its all that stops me from a 5 star review, and its the same \"cooler than thou\" hipster/elitest vibe that made me quit going to Boris & Natasha's and feel like I was unwanted and trying to shoplift something. In fact the employee attitudes at both places are almost identical\n\nI won't take the extreme stand of passing up all these great titles because of crappy attitudes but it seems that some folks do, and as this arena of video gets more competitive, I think that Mickey Alberman ought to address this w/his folks. In this market u need every single person you can get to be a happy customer. You don't have to be overly gushy and super/duper perky and unctious like at a Southpark store, but you do have to have people at least acknowledge you and thank you for renting something. If it pains some of the folks there to have to raise their head from shoegazing and say a cpl of words, then go to Boris's & ask if they're hiring...", "business_id": "STcLx0y_X89TsC0m2gVgHw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-01-20", "type": "review"}

There have also been a few changes in staff in the past couple months, so anyone that has had a negative experience at VisArt because of rude, or unfriendly staff members, this should no longer be a problem because all of the current staff members are super-friendly and incredibly helpful. The staff there is almost family-like, and they welcome you with much enthusiasm, and will be happy to help you find any movie you are looking for, and if they do not have it, they will gladly order it for you! \n\nThe bottom line is this: VisArt is quite possibly the best video rental store in the world. Put aside the thousands of movies, and you still have an establishment that feels like home, and a staff that you could be best friends with. I love this store, my wife loves this store.

The setting is cool, a large space with an intimate vibe that offers a variety of standing/seating options and multiple levels - you can check out the act from various spots in the room until you find your favorite. Drinks are reasonable, though nothing special (and I have often ended up with a withered lime slice perched on the edge of my plastic cup). I can't really assess the beer selection since I always go with liquor drinks at the Visulite, but it seems like they have several drafts and lots of bottles that include microbrews. One thing I tend to take for granted but which I must commend - there are so many stalls in the women's bathroom that I've never had to wait in a line no matter how crowded the venue... a rarity at live shows! Back to the music - there are always a good variety of artists/bands playing the Visulite during a given month, tending toward AAA, jam-bands and Americana acts - but they're always willing to mix it up a bit with other genres as long as the music is solid. Also they're supportive of good local acts (offering them opening spots, showcases and shows of their own from time to time).", "business_id": "eNIDbboNe7W_rAnNHoveEA", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-01-18", "type": "review"}

I bought tickets online 2 days prior to the show. It was listed as a headliner and that the doors opened at 8pm with 2 opening acts. We got there right on time and were denied entrance. Jam Base had listed it as one show and when I bought tickets on the Visulite website it was for 1 show. We were aggressively all told that we would have to pay for the first person on stage or we would have to come back later. What? Then we were told, \"it was made very clear on the website\" at which point the guy whipped out his clip board and showed us some piece of paper and was like, \"don't make me pull up the website.\" If it was made so clear... why were we having this discussion? To say the least, the guy taking/selling tickets was a jerk and the door guy was a total bully. He not only told said, \"are you talking about MY ticket guy in there? you better watch yourself or you won't be coming back!\" Really? First of all, I'm a hard working polite female that does not deserve to be bullied around by some oaf that thinks HIS job is that important to keep squirrely little girls like me out of there. What am i going to do? kick him in the shins? tell him he's a meanie? there are better ways to handle a situation. Second, I was not talking back to this guy or arguing. I was trying to figure out why on earth I would have to buy separate tickets for 1 nights worth of music at the same venue. We ended up going to Crown Station (which is an awesome spot with very nice people) and headed back in time for the show. Again, the door guy was a bully saying, \"looks like you came back for a 2nd try, huh? you better watch yourself this time.\" To say the least, I asked the bartender to speak to a manager and apparently there was not one there on this particular evening. I have to say, the bartender was extremely nice and apologized about 3 times over. This used to be my FAVORITE venue in Charlotte to see music, but after this terrible experience, I will not be returning. I remain very upset about this situation and can't imagine the band would be very happy knowing their fans are being bullied and talked down to at the front door. As for the sound... once we finally made it in, it was extremely loud and impossible to hear any words that the guys were actually singing. Super bummed about the whole evening... but would also be very willing to talk to a manager...", "business_id": "eNIDbboNe7W_rAnNHoveEA", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-02-06", "type": "review"}

I was taught to eat Indian food by a Sri Lankan, which means I eat with my hands. I'm not used to having to pick up a giant wedge of potato and figuring out how to eat it cleanly. The mutter paneer was also alright, but the paneer was kind of tough and not soft like I'm used to. \n\nLike I said, it hit the spot, but I wouldn't order the vindaloo again, and I'm iffy on the paneer. Maybe it needs to be more fresh? I don't know how paneer works. The biggest issue was the salt level in the food. There was WAY. TOO. MUCH. SALT. If you are one of those people who loves to add salt, then this is all for you. I will give it another try, but only if they might agree to ease up on the salt... a lot.", "business_id": "nuCgH96Tfe6CFXznvmKdhA", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-12-18", "type": "review"}

Orchids hang in boxes on the wall, there is a bar to sit at where the sushi chef rolls his art, and pop music plays on the speakers. \n\n Once seated, we were almost immediately welcomed by our server Ian. Ladies and gentlemen, if you can request Ian upon arriving, DO IT! He is Malaysian and gives you a rundown of all of the cultures that contribute to Malay cuisine. This gives you an idea of some of the items that you would like to try. He also brought a sample of curry to gauge our tastes. After the sample, we practically put our faith in his hands and let him suggest whatever.\n\n My friend and I decided to go with the beef rendang (which is so good it will make you scream BOOYAH!) and  the basil duck. The basil duck was off the menu. It came with stir-fry style veggies and the duck on the side. Warning! This dish may make you moan like Homer Simpson. The duck is that good.
