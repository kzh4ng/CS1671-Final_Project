I've found other places that come close, but for me, this is the place I like to spend my money when it comes to hibachi cuisine. \n\nSapporo is an unassuming place right next to Steubenville Pike's hottest tourist attraction, the Pittsburgh Motel. But don't let the location fool you. Step inside and enjoy a cozy atmosphere. There's a bar at the front, some tables to the right, and the main dining area to the left. There's also that karaoke machine I've never seen used in all the years I've gone here.\n\nUnlike other Japanese restaurants like Saga (great stuff) and Ichiban, the cooks at Sapporo aren't all about giving an extensive show while cooking. Each of the chefs have a few of the basic crowd pleasers, such as the knife and spatula toss and the onion volcano, etc., but really it's all about the food, which is fine by me. I do sometimes miss when the chefs toss the pieces of shrimp up in the air towards your mouth to catch, but only because no one ever likes to participate in that but me and it's fun to look like a goofball while trying, but that's neither here nor there.\n\nThe food here is excellent. They've introduced a new look to their menu recently. I don't know if they scaled it down, as I often always order from the same section. I did notice they have a couple of sushi options available. They used to have a full sushi bar, and you can still see that when you walk in, but I'm not sure if they're using it for anything other than just what's on the main menu, which would be a shame if so, as their sushi was always great and you could order it from a separate menu. Again, this may be something they still have that I'm not aware of.\n\nAt any rate, the starter soup and salad is great. I love the bits of onion in the soup. It's a very strong broth, but not overpowering. The ginger dressing on the salad is something you either like or loathe at any Japanese restaurant, and here I really love it, but I tend to like it everywhere I've had it, so I'm not a real stickler when it comes to that.\n\nUsually I order the filet mignon and shrimp with fried rice for my main meal, though last time I got the deluxe version of the dish which also includes lobster tail and ice cream for dessert. Either way, it's a great dish. I've also had the chicken and shrimp and have enjoyed it as well.\n\nNow, my favorite thing here is the shrimp sauce. I call it the \"magic sauce.\" It's of the light pink variety and thin consistency. I'm always disappointed when I go to other Japanese steakhouses and they either don't have shrimp sauce altogether or they have the thicker, mayonnaise-based version, which is OK, but doesn't come close to the awesomeness that is the magic sauce. Apparently it's a secret as to just what goes into it. On one visit our chef joked that its main base was strawberry Quik, which one of the fellow diners at my table believed.\n\nSo if you get the fried rice here, dump some of the magic sauce on there. It's amazing. Use it for your steak or chicken as well. I find myself doing that and then saving the darker sauce for my grilled veggies, which are also top notch here. Terrific grilled onions and ripe zucchini as well as mushrooms and broccoli. I don't care for broccoli personally, but the rest is excellent.\n\nSapporo has also started throwing in noodles to the mix. According to the owner this is because other restaurants started doing it, so patrons who came in started asking why Sapporo didn't have them as well. I think they were doing fine without them, as it just adds even more to an already large amount of food, but they are good, if unnecessary.\n\nThe steak here is great. I've had the sirloin as well as the filet. I always get mine cooked rare, and it is of the melt in your mouth caliber. The shrimp never taste fishy, and the lobster tail is similarly excellent. All around, you get a great meal here for the price.\n\nI'm not sure which nights are more crowded than not anymore. Sapporo's a funny place in that some weeknights you'll drive by and it's packed and then other nights it will be quiet. I'd suppose weekends draw the biggest crowds. Yet even when it was \"packed\" I've never had to wait long to be seated at a table.\n\nSo if you haven't been, give Sapporo a try. It's been there forever. The owner and staff are super nice and they really do care about serving you great food when you visit. They don't do lunches anymore, so it's strictly dinner meals, so be looking at spending at least 20-30 dollars on up for adults, and around 10 or so for kids' meals. It's not some place you would go frequently if you're on a budget, but that makes it all the more a treat when you do go.", "business_id": "8Nm_jcCYtMXYW0ODSHDiXA", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-07-26", "type": "review"}

This and Little Tokyo are, to my knowledge, the only sushi restaurants in Mt. Lebanon.\n\nSushi Three has an extensive menu that seems to have expanded since the last time I visited, and has lots more than just sushi.  There is a long list of appetizers, tempuras and teriyaki dishes, and some Chinese offerings.  The main focus, the sushi, takes up a large portion of the menu, and there are many different rolls, ranging from the basic kappa rolls to the complex southside roll (shrimp, smoked eel, fish flakes, cucumber, spinach, mushrooms, egg and caviar).  As a vegetarian, I appreciate the vegetable sushi platter, which I have never seen anywhere else and only costs $12.  There is even a separate vegetarian menu.\n\nWhile I do appreciate the wide-ranging menu, I just can't like the atmosphere.  It's always very quiet and dark inside, and I always get the feeling of being in a cave.  I prefer to get take-out or delivery.\n\nOverall, I prefer Little Tokyo, but with Sushi Three's improved menu and large number of vegetarian options, my rating may change soon.", "business_id": "QnyzlVMyx0Exri-Lay10cA", "stars": 3, "date": "2007-08-01", "type": "review"}

No, unfortunately not.at.all...anymore.  From hence forth, all mentions of Benihana are likely to cause anxiety in my usually calm heart.  I hate complaining like this. I really do. But sometimes, you just have to, ya know?\n\nTuesday evening I met a group of friends for a birthday dinner.  The reservation for our party of nine was for 7:00pm.  All but one of our party arrived prior to 7:00, but the hostess was curt in explaining that all party members needed to be present before we were seated, as our chef would be ready to begin meal preparation as soon as we were seated.  Fortunately, the final member of our party arrived shortly and we were seated at 7:05pm.  It was not until 7:40pm that first contact with our server was made. Without any apology for the delay she took our drink orders.  She (name withheld because I don't want to be rude) returned more than 10 minutes later with our drinks, but waited another 10-15 minutes after that to take our dinner orders.  As I was waiting I looked over at the table next to us, who were also clearly celebrating a child's birthday.  At one point the mother (I'm assuming) smiled at me and said, \"I hope you get out before midnight. We've been here over two hours.  We're taking our cake and getting out of here.\"\n\nUpon taking our orders, one of our guests explained that due to a shrimp allergy it was necessary to cook any shrimp ordered by our group in another area (a neighboring grill, etc.).  Our server said that she would have to ask the manager, who came to our table shortly thereafter.  When the manager arrived at the table my guest explained her allergy and his response was that it might be in her best interest to leave.  I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt that he meant leaving the table, not the restaurant, but I'm not certain of this. Following this recommendation he mentioned that she could wait in the bar as the rest of us dined table-side.  I asked him why it was not an option to prepare the shrimp at a neighboring table, but he expressed concern that other customers may require the use of the other available tables.  I understand his point, but the restaurant was near-empty as the hour quickly approached 8:30pm.  Finally, he offered to prepare the shrimp portions of our meals in the kitchen.  I'm not sure why this wasn't initially mentioned as an option, but I'll leave it at that.  \n\nOur chef Tom eventually arrived at our table. He was very pleasant and efficient during the course of our meal preparation.  During his time at the table my Emperor's Salad was delivered, as were the majority of my table's sushi orders.  However, two of our guests that ordered sushi were not served at this time.  In fact, they were not served until a full 10 minutes after the rest of our party finished our meals.  At one point, they inquired about the delay to she-whose-name-shall-not-be-mentioned, who responded that they were \"waiting for the rice.\"  When she delivered their food there was not a single mention of the delay.  \n\nTwo hours and thirty+ minutes after we arrived at Benihana, we left.  From start to finish, the entire evening was a terrible experience.  It was ridiculous to the point that there was not even soap or toilet paper available in the restroom.  Were it not for the kindness and professionalism of Tom (and the awesome company of friends), the night would have been a complete waste.  \n\nMy final thought is this. The food was fine, but because I was feeling particularly piggish on this Tuesday evening, I enjoyed two California rolls from my stash of Costco sushi at home before departing for the restaurant. The difference between Costco's rolls and Benihana's...a toss up - just sayin.  The good news is, this will give my friends something to whine about for YEARS to come...", "business_id": "1vQLTKwmcmZXtNzfKEvMmA", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-07-15", "type": "review"}

This little gem is nestled in the heart of Mt. Lebanon.  My husband was raised in MtL and has been eating at this place for as long as he can remember.  He introduced me to it when we were dating and it has become our go-to place. \n\nWe've learned the hard way that sushi in Pittsburgh is best served HERE.  The fish is flavorful and bright and the sushi is artfully crafted.  I've sampled a few non-sushi dishes, but stick with the raw stuff because, well, it's pure heaven.  We have our favorites - black marlin and yellow tail sashimi, eel nigiri and the spicy tuna and philly (fresh salmon, only!) rolls.  We just discovered the spicy scallop in seaweed and it is to die for.  \n\nWe went through a phase during which we celebrated milestones (birthdays, promotions, etc) at different \"hot spots\" around the city and were always left a bit disappointed.  Don't get me wrong, we certainly eat elsewhere, but our celebratory dinners are always with Frank, et al @ LT. \n\nNow, I'm not wearing blinders and certainly recognize that the place on Ellsworth in SHY is higher end and offers a more elegant experience, but the quality of the fish really isn't that different... not to mention, who splurges for that on a regular basis?  \n\nLook no further (and skip the craziness and mediocrity of Nakama) and go to LT.

I think this is both if you are a roll person or if you are a sashimi person - which is not the case everywhere.  Some places make awesome rolls, but that seems to be to hide the not-freshness of the fish.  Others have great fresh fish, but can't make a roll to save their lives.\n\nThis place does it all.  J and I went here on a Friday night around 6 and were sat immediately - no wait, but the place was pretty packed.  I started with some hot sake and a green salad.  Their ginger dressing is delish!  I was practically licking the bowl.  I considered asking for more lettuce to soak up the rest of the dressing when our shrimp shumai came.  J and I try to get shrimp shumai everywhere we go as a barometer and this was by far the best.  The wrappings were complete and held in all the very fresh shrimp goodness.  Then came the sushi.  We ordered the First Date roll, the David, the black marlin, the spicy tuna and the spicy scallop.  What can I say, we like sushi.  The black marlin is amazing - mild, fresh, not chewy.  The spicy scallop is not something you see everywhere and definitely a plus here.  However, where they really shine is the spicy tuna.  Everyone does a spicy tuna.  At most places, you can barely taste the tuna in the mayo-based spicy sauce that is slathered all around.  Here the tuna is front and center with spices mixed into the pureed tuna.  No mayo needed to hold it together and all the better for it.  The David and First Date were a bit pricier and also awesome.  One was tempura shrimp with spicy tuna on the outside and the other was more like a rainbow roll.  Both excellent.  \n\nWhile I do also love me some Katana in Dormont, this place has the best sushi in the city and in a charming location in downtown Mt Lebanon.", "business_id": "mPlWLIA4pkHMRtlQDm6UyQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-08-05", "type": "review"}

Umi, a Big Burrito joint, is much more expensive than other sushi places in town. That said, if you have the dough, go for the $75/person omakase. We enjoyed eight courses (7 dinner + 1 dessert course), each one subtle and well-seasoned and incredibly fresh. (Now we're broke, but that's my cross to bear.)

However, if I'm looking for a fine dining experience, one where the ingredients are creative and innovative, I'll definitely return here.

But actually, in retrospect, its just a sign that people are not aware of the quality of sushi that can be found elsewhere in Pittsburgh. It was sad, really.\nWe began with the miso soup, which was some of the\nbest we have had. Nice and hot, and perfectly seasoned. But it was downhill from there.\nThe salad was just ok. Mixed greens were wilted, but the dressing was tasty.\nWe then moved on to the \"good stuff,\" or so we thought...\nWe began with the highly-recommended \"yellowtail sashimi with yuzu jalape\u00f1o sauce\" -- it was overly ceviche'd, and lost its freshness, replaced by a tough, dried-out quality. While a small sliver of jalapeno was a nice touch for sharpness, it didn't compensate for the poor quality preparation of the fish itself. We next had a spicy tuna roll (which, I think, is a barometer for sushi quality in any restaurant). It was dry and average, at best. Nothing special, but no egregious mistakes either. We moved on to the \"sushi entree (assorted)\", which had 8 pieces of assorted sushi, each consisting of a piece of fish: yellowtail prepared exactly like the previous dish but with rice this time; two pieces of salmon topped with (of all things) cream cheese and a cherry tomato (come on, this was so disappointingly reminiscent of brunch -- where's the caper and english muffin?; mackarel which was less-than-tasty, again topped with a dollup of something indistinct and non-complementary; tuna (average); red snapper maybe; and a paper-thin piece of mild whitefish, which tasted like rice, owing to its diminutive portioning; and a tuna maki roll, which was dry and shriveled and appeared limp, like it was prepared earlier that day.\nI was expecting an artful presentation, but was shocked at the lack of playful creativity that I, at that point, assumed might account for the inflated prices compared to other restaurants in the area (since the quality of flavor was actually MUCH poorer than other local places).\nNext to us was seated a couple on a date, where the man was clearly trying to impress his lady (both dressed very nicely and timidly fascinated by each other's every word and expression). I felt sorry for him, because he was either going to be disappointed with the meal itself, or oblivious to the fresh japanese seafood delights he could be exposing her to just a short drive away. THIS IS NOT A PLACE TO TAKE YOUR LOVE INTEREST, unless she is impressed simply by the magnitude of a check and a mere patina of fine dining.\nOur waitress was sweet, patient, and knowledgeable, and I couldn't help but wonder if she would recommend Umi to her family. I doubt it.\nWe concluded with a dessert that was simply delicious, playful and contemporary -- and weren't surprised to find that the desserts are actually part of the menu of their \"sister-restaurant,\" Soba (which is a WONDERFUL place). It was the Soba Banana Split - an unusual and tantalizing update of the original (which, I believe, was originally invented in Pittsburgh).\nOverall, the portions were small and unsatisfying, which would've been ok if the flavors were outstanding, but they were not. Not at all! I was shocked, and realized that a restaurant that should be credited with exposing the local eaters to fine Japanese cuisine years ago, has fallen from its lofty perch atop Pittsburgh's international dining choices. And fallen far.\nSo insular a chef can become when his cuisine is lauded for so long, that he can become ignorant of the ever-rising quality of his competition. I suggest Umi's chefs explore other restaurants and realize that they no longer have a monopoly on daily freshness, and that their creativity, like their salad, has become stale.\nTo people seeking high-quality sushi in the area, I must strongly recommend Ichiban (in Aspinwall), and before you question my credibility in recommending a restaurant nestled in a strip mall, think about what makes sushi wonderful. If unwavering freshness, playful inventiveness and sense of fun mixed with elegant presentation and even nice wine pairings, exactness in execution and preparation, thoughtful proportions as well as portions are qualities that not only enhance experience but even define Japanese cuisine, then Ichiban gets it right. Umi, I'm afraid, is way past its prime.\nIt's not that Umi is so bad. It's just not that good. Nothing special.\nI can say I have tried several other places in Pittsburgh, trying to find a suitable place to satisfy my frequent cravings for fresh raw seafood with a characteristically Japanese seriousness in its execution and levity of presentation and flavor combinations. Ichiban is the place that is consistently able to capture this \"essence\" of Japanese cuisine. But there are others that are also better than Umi, which should no longer, by any means, be considered a standard.", "business_id": "Cy9XgM3ZG2jZ1ganvolb6Q", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-08-19", "type": "review"}

Even if I could stop thinking about that dinner, I'll be reminded of it every time I check my bank account balance because Umi must be the Japanese word for \"you think you can afford this, but you cannot.\"\n\nI will absolutely dine at Umi again.\n\nI wish I'd ordered the Omakase, which is $85 but provides a sampling of everything and from the other reviews here it looks like a lot of people recommend it.  I advise ordering the Omakase because while $85 seems pricey, you're bil is going to be close that anyway.\n\nI know I keep talking about money and it makes me sound like a peasant, but having abject sticker shock at the end of any dining experience is never fun.\n\nIt was, however, worth it.

We decided to come here since it was the last of the Big Burrito restaurants that my girlfriend had not tried.  The inside of the restaurant is quaint with a sushi bar on one side where you can watch Mr. Shu ply his craft and many tables on the other longer side of the restaurant.  There are also a decent amount of sheet metal fish sculptures throughout the restaurant which I enjoyed looking at.\n\nWhenever our server came over, we queried him about a few of the Umi specials and in addition to the information about the dishes he told us that they were essentially big appetizers which was good to know.  After hearing that we decided to start off our meals with the sawara with garlic ponzu and squid pasta with garlic sauce.  Since we had also both ordered entrees with my girlfriend getting the terayaki salmon and myself the seafood tempura with a side spicy tuna maki, our meals actually started with a miso soup and ginger dressing salad.  There was nothing special with either although I do always enjoy both at many sushi places. Soon after we finished those the sawara came out and it was a Spanish Mackeral cut into 7 pieces with a tiny sliver of raw garlic on top surrounding the garlic ponzu.  We were instructed to wrap the fish around the garlic and dip it into the sauce which we both did.  The combined flavors were very enjoyable with the standout being the sauce.  After that our squid pasta came out which was some squid that looked julienned and then seared with some shitaki mushrooms and asparagus on top of a bed of garlic sauce.  This dish was interesting for me as I was not a big fan of having the squid in the sauce alone but really enjoyed it whenever I combined it with some of the vegetables.  The Shitake mushrooms might actually have been the best that I have ever had as they seemed to melt in your mouth.  After we had finished the plate our server ended up bringing out a side of rice onto which he poured the sauce from our now empty dish.  In doing so he explained that the sauce was too good to waste.  After trying the sauce covered rice my girlfriend and I both readily agreed with him.  Finally after making our way through all of the other courses, our entrees came out.  My seafood tempura ended up consisting of broccoli, asparagus, crab, fake crab and a single piece of fish all breaded in tempura with a side of soy sauce.  This dish was actually the biggest disappointment of the evening for me for a few reasons including the single piece of fish and also that it seemed to lack the depth of flavors that the rest of the dishes so nicely displayed.  Thankfully my maki was delivered at the same time and had a flavor punch that diverted me from the much more vanilla tempura.  Since I am not a huge fan of salmon I did not try my girlfriends dish but she did assure me that she enjoyed it whenever I asked her about it.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would definitely be back in the future.  I am not so sure that I would order an entree again but I would certainly love to try more of their creations and could probably make a meal of their maki and sushi.", "business_id": "Cy9XgM3ZG2jZ1ganvolb6Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-08-13", "type": "review"}

The katsudon is how it should be, hot, eggy, with just the right amount of gravy to flavor the rice.

By 8pm (1.5 hours past sun down) I decided on Musashi after a colleague reccomended it earlier, she had told me of a secret japanese menu, and fresh fish.\n\nWell I can tell you this place has BOTH! And the best part, is the head chef there and owner, is quite japanese, and began his career in my home city's (Toronto) first ever sushi restaurant in the early 80s. Suffice to say, I was pretty sold after talking to this guy \n\nThe japanese menu is off the chain and features japanese favourites like broth meat and raw egg in a hot pot (not sure what the name of that is),  they are a little hesitant to let you order off of it but I've been 3 times and just asked the waitress what she reccomended and have never had a bad item. \n\nProbably one of the best Sushi places in the city along with sushi guru, yet to try new zealand which i also heard was great.", "business_id": "Y_OeiGhTm6ZEfZ1UQgM_wA", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-07-09", "type": "review"}

The same can be applied to other ethnic cuisines; I mean if you were on vacation in France, would you honestly eat French food in France that is prepared by an American? No.\n\nRanting aside, Musashi has the best bowl of Ramen I've had since leaving Japan. Period. The wife's \u00e0 la carte selections were also equally as tasty including the homemade dipping sauces - the effort they put in really makes the difference. \n\nI've seen another review here on Yelp and I'll echo it here - you have to flag down your waitress and this is to be expected as it is how Japanese restaurants operate.  Don't knock them on service without understanding the culture. \n\nI'll end the review with this: if you think Hibachi is Japanese food, then Musashi may not be for you; however, if you are seeking an authentic Japanese experience Izakaya  style, then look no further.", "business_id": "Y_OeiGhTm6ZEfZ1UQgM_wA", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-07-30", "type": "review"}

My Japanese teachers would tell me to go here and a lot of people who knew about the culture would recommend here. I remember my first time at Musashi I saw the most Japanese people in Charlotte ever and I started to believe that it must be the closest one to have the authentic taste.\n\nWell so from my old memories I visited again with my mom but only to prove myself wrong.\n\nThe lady wasn't so friendly but I don't mind she was like that all the time. We sat ourselves at the bar and ordered a spider roll and another roll I don't remember, a tempura udon, and a chicken katsu. \n\nI got to see the sushi guy making my rolls and thought to myself wtf is he making? There was no delicacy. I was surprised when he handed me the dish. I obviously wasn't happy to see the result. The rolls were warm like there was no sushi rice. It was just regular white rice so it pretty much tasted awful especially with not much crab. The amount of rice was ridiculous I thought I was eating onigiri, or rice ball.\n\nThen my chicken katsu and my mom's udon came out. The chicken katsu was just what I was expecting, nothing more nor nothing less. Rice, chicken, salad, additional side item and this time was tuna pasta salad? and miso soup. It was good. Just normal chicken katsu. Not so crispy this time. The portion is pretty big. My mom liked the udon. The broth was clear and light color, the tempuras came out on a separate plate. Tempuras were just ok. \n\nThe sushi was very disappointing but the rest was fine. I don't know if I'll comeback when I'm in town again. Maybe to get the katsu if I crave some teishoku style meal bc its my comfort food. But definitely no sushi at Musashi.

When we started going to this location over 3 years ago, we only went once in a while for a nice fun dinner. Eventually, we learned about their express lunch special which made it affordable for us to go a lot more often! For the express lunch, you will get smaller portions than you do at dinner, but you're paying less, too. I, for one, love the express lunch portions because they're perfect for me! I can rarely clean my plate of all of the food at a full dinner. As with any place, you never know who you're going to get as a chef. Some of the chefs are laid back and fun to casually chat with or joke with while they prepare your food. Some go through the motions of the showmanship and some simply come, cook, and leave. I will admit that the express lunch service hasn't been as efficient lately as it's been in the past (it used to be seated, orders, food, check, out and now has a lot of down time and waiting). Sometimes you'll go a while without a drink refill which is a bit of a pain with how small the glasses are and how much ice is in them. Sometimes it gets difficult to flag someone down. You can still be in and out in about 45-60 mins which isn't bad for a freshly-cooked lunch mid-workday. We hope to be checking out the fairly new express dinner next week as we'll have family in town who will be on a budget.\n\nTip: If you get your salad with ginger dressing, hold on to your bowl when you're done and dip your meats in the ginger dressing. It's tasty.\n\nTip: Chopsticks and ginger dipping sauce must be asked for. You will only be provided with one sauce instead of the two that most other places provide.\n\nTip: If you are having trouble flagging someone down, (nicely) tell your chef what you need. The waitstaff are quick to respond to a request from the chef and they're usually a lot better at getting the attention of the runners.", "business_id": "P0aKJw8rb0DKLaGottHEAw", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-06-03", "type": "review"}

And being that the Yolk of an egg is too rich for me and immediately upsets my stomach, I find myself always picking the egg out of my rice. I do enjoy that they give you noodles, which was new to me. The noodles are actually pretty tasty. The shrimp are small in comparison to what you get at other Hibachi restaurants. Also all they cook in is Soy Sauce. No other sauce choices. Ot at least none have been offered to me. The manager that they always get when there is an issue and seats people from time to time, is a bit short & rude when you're not kissing her butt. The wait staff has short memories.

I had a bowl of the Onion Soup, a side of Edammame and the Tuna Tataki appetizer (portion was entree-sized!).  All of it was very good!  My family had the steak and chicken hibachi meals and loved it all.  My son especially loves the \"Yum Yum\" sauce (the pink sauce) and has me convinced that he would eat \"anything\" if he could dip it in Yum Yum sauce!  \n\nWe opted for the $10.00 birthday package.

The food is outstanding, the wait staff is friendly and accommodating, and the seating doesn't make you feel like you have to rub elbows with your neighbor. \n\nThe place is divided into 2 sections. The hibachi grills and the sushi bar. You have a choice of sitting in chairs at the hibachi grills or going into 1 of their rooms where you have to take your shoes off and sit down on the floor (they provide pillows). I haven't had the chance to sit on the floor yet, so I won't include that in my review.\n\nYou make your selections off the menu and have some time to sit and chat with other people at the table. Their iced tea is always perfect (whether you get sweet or not), and your glass is always full. \n\nThe 1st items to come out are the ginger salad and soup. I normally pass on the soup, but I love their ginger salad. It's not over powering with ginger like most dressings that are in this category.\n\nNext comes the appetizers and sushi. I would recommend the calamari steaks (but don't take left overs home, they don't save well) and for the sushi, try the one that has \"Pacific or Pacifica\" in the name (sorry, I can't remember what it's called). Every time my husband and I have their sushi, it's always fresh and tastes wonderful. \n\nThe entertainment begins when the chef comes out to cook your meal. I like how they confirm your order and they pay special attention to any modifications that you've made to your order. This part is great for kids. They cut the tails off of the shrimp and throw them in their hat, light an onion stack on fire and make a train noise with the spatula, and they do an egg roll before throwing it in the air and breaking it in half on the spatula! The meal portions are reasonable and get extra shrimp sauce (it's the pink stuff)! Of course, everything is nice and hot when it hits your plate and fresh because it's cooked right there in front of you. On my first trip there, I was pleasantly surprised that I wasn't hot from the grill (yes, I've been to some places where I was sweating when the cooking was finished).\n\nIf you have a birthday, this is a great place to go! You get your meal like always and they give you a cake (that is so sweet, your teeth will rot with 1 bite), they sing to you in Japanese, and you get your picture taken and it is framed (a paper frame, but hey it's still cool lookin).\n\nI can keep going on and on about how great this place is. I will keep going back until they close! I do have to point out, if you're not careful, the bill can get a bit high if you keep adding all the goodies they offer.

Once I opened the front doors, it was like stepping into a whole new world. It was very pretty, neat, and tidy inside. I particularly liked the booths with glass tables. They have decorative cloths covering the windows that gave the place a dim, kind of romantic lighting. It complimented the shades of blues on the booths. Another cute detail was the mini Japanese statues and figurines on the wall opposite of the windows. It helped to show a little bit of culture.\n \nThere were 3 different menus, one for drinks, sushi, and Teppanyaki (Hibachi) and Teriyaki dishes. Their menus were detailed which helped a lot especially on their drinks menu. I do not find too many menus that define what flavors to expect with their sakes and wines. Although I did eye the Japanese dish menus, I was set on sushi. \n\nWe ended up waiting over an hour for the sushi. They were short staffed. Only one waiter was going around taking orders and delivering the food. I saw two hostesses when I walked in which was strange to me because why would they need two hostesses when they needed more waiters. Then again it is a small restaurant and the sushi had a bit of a twist.\n\nMy friend got miso soup, eel roll, and tempura salmon roll. I got a spicy scallop roll, Philadelphia roll, and spicy salmon roll. The miso was a bit salty. The eel roll was tasty. The tempura salmon roll was really cute. It looked like little tofu squares. The spicy scallop roll was so spicy that it covered the taste of the Philly roll. I made a mistake by eating that first. I thought that the pieces of fish in the sushi were a good size. Also I have never seen a spicy salmon roll made the way they made it. It has a piece of salmon in the roll and then spices on the outside. To me, I like heat so this roll was not spicy enough for me. This is where the abundance of spicy sauce on the spicy scallop roll helped out.

The sign isn't flashy, but this place is definitely worth noticing. I've always made reservations in advance for the teppanyaki grills, have never had to wait more than 10 minutes for a table to be cleared from an overstaying party, and have always had excellent service from both the waiters and the chefs. \n\nEvery time I dine here, I order the Three Samurai meal to get chicken, steak, and shrimp. The quality of each of those is fine and I have never had a problem with steak being overcooked or chicken being undercooked. I also recommend the house dressing with the salad and a bowl of clear soup, although if you must insist on having miso you still won't go wrong. I've only ordered sushi a few times, and I never felt there was anything wrong with their sushi. I don't eat sushi often, but I definitely feel that the rest of the restaurant is their strong point.\n\nThe bar inside is also well stocked and tended by someone who knows their way around drinks. The chefs are all experts in their general teppan-grill-tricks, with some learning new techniques and others inviting the guests in on some of the fun (usually breaking an egg, not throwing knives!). \n\nReading some of the other reviews for this place, I have to wonder why people judge a restaurant based on the occupants. There is only 4 teppanyaki grills and at least 4 chefs. This is not Benihana. This is not a place for screaming children, although the restaurant should not be held responsible for a family that does not know otherwise. Sometimes if you have a very low number in your party and you choose to come on a busy weekend, you may be placed at a table with another family so that everyone can eat when they would like rather than waiting hours and being denied reservations at all for lack of grill space. Of course if you have some type of allergy to something your grill-neighbor is ordering, you should mention something so that the restaurant may make accommodations.\n\nI repeat, this is not Benihana. This is a nicer place. If you come in wearing sweats and work clothing, don't be surprised if a staff member looks at you the way you would look at someone else wearing the same outfit to a wedding. You don't have to wear the nicest of clothing, but at least don't look like you got out of bed!\n\nIf food temperature is your problem, remember that they don't mind if you eat the vegetables while they're finishing cooking the meat.

Not only do I find the teriyaki sauce that Japanese places typically use to be too sweet, but there is always so much - sushi, edamame, seaweed salads - at good Japanese places that I would rather spend my money on and fill my stomach with. Going forward, Blue Fin will be an exception to this no-teriyaki rule of mine. In fact, I may even go there *because* of the teriyaki. \n\nMy husband and I stopped in for lunch. We both ordered the teriyaki combos (served with salad and rice) - he got beef and I got the white-meat chicken. Both were priced around $6. The food took a while to come out, and there were no seats left inside, so we had to sit outside, but the owner/manager was super nice, offering to re-seat us inside when tables became available and to bring us our food when it was ready. \n\nWhen she brought our plates, we were shocked at how huge the portions were. Yes, there was tons of salad (with a delicious sesame dressing) and white rice, but there was also a *lot* of meat. My husband and I believe ourselves to have larger-than-average appetites, but we could barely finish one plate and vowed to split one next time. So, the portions were huge, but the teriyaki flavor was also amazing. It was subtle and flavorful but not too sweet, serving to bring out the flavor of the meat and not just provide a sticky and overwhelming glaze. The black sesame seeds and spicy powder they put on the table were nice add-ons but weren't even necessary since the sauce was so flavorful. I am, however, docking The Blue Fin a star because the quality of my husband's beef wasn't as high as that of the chicken; it was fatty and hard to chew. \n\nAfter years of avoiding teriyaki, The Blue Fin makes me actually crave it. Plus, it's affordable and has a super-friendly staff. I will definitely be back.", "business_id": "kaIue7GRCmkPzDeHDBTttQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-08-27", "type": "review"}

The place itself is nothing special, although they do have a big patio for when the weather is cooler. However, the food is very good and super cheap. Their daily special is quite the bargain - $6.75 gets you chicken teriyaki (all white meat, if you prefer, at no extra cost) over white rice with a side salad and two mini spring rolls. The spring rolls were very good, although a little greasy. The salad was good, although a little warm. The chicken teriyaki was great, but not your traditional teriyaki. Unlike most places, it seems like they cook the chicken in the sauce so that it's coated with the teriyaki flavor, rather tossing the chicken with the sauce or pouring sauce on top before serving it. That makes it a little more dry than I'm used to, but it also gives it a nice smokiness. Their sauce is a little less sweet than my Americanized Japanese palate is used to (Yoshi's, for instance, has a much sweeter sauce), but it's definitely more authentic.

Is The Blue Fin.\nI remeber thinking 30 years ago ,I wonder how long this place will be here.\n Yet here it stands in 2013 still going strong. Which makes me really happy.\n\nI love when local business can do great!  They have always been great ,very friendly service and fresh food. The panko breaded items are light and feel healthy. All the vegetables I get here are  always crisp and fresh.\nI guess it is because, they take pride in the place. Something you do not always see. I believe that they have lunch specials every week day.\nHowever , they do charge extra for the little things. Like making it extra spicy is like .35 extra and brown rice is a little extra, I mean barley enough to where you would even notice.\n\nThey have soup, and sushi, salad,etc.\nLots of nice cool drinks. If the weather is cooler(below 90) you can sit outside and enjoy the light rail going by.\nWhich also means that you can take the light rail here as well.\nIt is located in the same spot as always, right next to the Phoenix, Public Library.\nWhen in downtown Phoenix, give it a try.", "business_id": "kaIue7GRCmkPzDeHDBTttQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-08-27", "type": "review"}

I've seen it a hundred times when going to the library and I finally was in the area right about lunch time.\n\nI got the coconut shrimp plate which has the shrimp, salad, and white rice.  Add a massively large drink (with free refills) and the total was just over $10.  More than filling.  If you don't want the drink and get a smaller rice bowl instead of a plate then you can probably grab a fresh lunch for under $7.\n\nEverything just kind of works together.  I saw the salad on top of warm rice and my mind wasn't too excited, but there is something about the way they make it where it just mixes together well.  The dressing really makes it all come together.  The shrimp is hot, fresh, and isn't overly greasy; no oil splotches on the plate.  The dipping sauce is, like the dressing, a really good compliment to the shrimp.  Everything on the plate was good and a nice change of pace.\n\nReally friendly workers, nice mix of guests, very convenient parking.  It looks small but it can handle a lot of people and there is even a drive-thru window.  One minor negative, and this is kind of strange, but it's the fork size.  It's a small plastic fork and you can't really get rice and lettuce on it.

The noodle dishes here are eight or nine dollars and have huge portions.  I ordered the haruki yakisoba noodle stirfry with pork and shrimp - which came to me in a large bowl and steaming with soy and ginger flavors.  The Korean spicy noodle bowl also outdid itself with sliced beef strips and a wonderfully hot hot hot taste.  If that's not your thang, they have rice bowls, sushi, salads, about 20 Italian/Med dishes and several vegetarian and tofu dishes.\n\nYou'll find that they have an open kitchen so if you're close to it you can spy and  salivate over everyone else's food.  The servers were all very prompt and courteous after a slow start.  A solo diner next to us was raving about the place and how much he loves it. \n\nMy favorite part of the food was definitely the complimentary cinammon bread crisps and bread basket that came with BANANA BREAD?!?

VARIETY.\nMy boyfriend and I love this place because he can get REAL Chinese and I don't have to eat forture cookies and water.

They also have other Asian options such as a Japanese bento-box, sushi, edemame, etc.  It's weird that they come to your table with bread and they latter on you're eating tempura...but that's the appeal.  Great desserts too!\n\n3. AMBIANCE.\nI always describe it as Tokyo Disneyland.  It's like a Japanese take on European provincial.  There's a nice brick facade inside, nice fixtures, big, solid-hunk-of wood rustic tables, filagree metal light fixtures, etc.  It's just pleasant and romantic.\n\n4.

I have never seen a restaurant that is so eclectic... you have traditional noodle dishes, both hot and cold, from Japan, along with Sushi; pasta dishes from Italy, and some items from SouthEast Asia! There is more than enough diversity in their menu to satisfy the most discriminating palate. Despite their diversity, CherryBlossom Noodle Cafe does not stray from the basic tenant of Japanese Cuisine: food items are never too salty or too sweet, and are never bland; you can call it cooking subtlety.\n\nFor starters I ordered a California Summer Roll (Vietnamese) for my friend and myself. Unlike the Vietnamese Summer Roll spiced with mint, and usually accompanied by a lime dipping sauce; CherryBlossom's version was accompanied by a sauce comprised of sweet Sesame Seed / Soy Sauce dip. A Summer Roll contents include Shrimp, Rice Vermicelli, Crab strips, and Cabbage wrapped with a thin Rice Paper \"tortilla\". Anyone used to the Vietnamese version will see CherryBlossom's as probably a little bland... but you have to remember the philosophy behind Japanese cooking.\n\nMy friend also had Miso Soup with his meal. Unlike the soup yesterday evening, he said the Miso Soup was very good.\n\nWith every meal, you will also receive a bread basket ( http://cherryblossom-az.com/cherry-bread.gif ). The basket contains three types of breads: a soft and warm French Roll; a slice from a dark and sweet Blueberry bread; and a crispy Butter Biscuit. There is enough variety in texture from all the breads to satisfy anyone.\n\nMain dishes...\n\nI ordered for my friend Grilled Orange Roughy. The Orange Roughy was grilled to perfection and was accompanied by a sweet and salty dipping sauce concoction. Sides consisted of Japanese sticky rice.\n\nI ordered for myself the Beef Nanban Soup with thin Soba (Wheat) Noodles, rather than the Udon Noodles, accompanied by a bowl of Japanese Sticky Rice. \n\nMy friend does not drink, but I ordered the Rasperry Fruit Punch, a very good drink made from Raspberry Wine with Fruit Punch... essentially a Raspberry Wine Cooler (but stronger). This drink also had an umbrella \"thing\" spearing a whole strawberry! Very good and refreshing!\n\nI had my usual coffee after the meal which surprised me a little... an Amaretto laced coffee was brought out. The aroma was very enticing! Would make a coffee drinker out of anyone!\n\n100% of capacity, with 30% Asian; 20% Hispanic; rest Caucasian. First time I've been to a restaurant that was packed with NO seats left! A very popular spot!\n\nCherryBlossom is very heartily recommended so long as you remember the tenets of Japanese Cuisine... no extreme flavors... nothing will be extremely spicy, salty or sweet. This makes it easy to grab a little from this dish, and something from that dish without disrupting the flavor of either.\n\nThere was something that was a little disconcerting, though... The state of the men's room. For such a highly rated establishment, it seemed like no one had checked on the men's room for about two to three hours... toilet paper thrown around, stains around the wash basin. Nothing really objectionable, but a little surprising considering the number of staff for such a small establishment. This establishment has to be aware that a restaurant is judged by it's back-room as well as it's front room. Won't take anything off... but it is highly noticeable considering...\n\nAnd the diners of CherryBlossom has to share the same restrooms with Tokyo Express (right next door), both of the businesses are probably owned by the same management group. \n\nThe interesting tidbit is that we both spent MORE for a worse meal last night at Bamboo House... AMAZING! My friend said his dishes from the Summer Roll to the Grilled Fish was some of the freshest tasting dishes he ever had; good compliment from him. In fact, he wanted to go back to CherryBlossom the next evening... but this is my last night here in the Phoenix area.... sigh....\n\n(I really think everyone is reviewing CherryBlossom under the wrong spelling.... It's CherryBlossom, not \"Cherry Blossom\". Take a look at their sign or their website.)", "business_id": "AkOruz5CrCxUmXe1p_WoRg", "stars": 5, "date": "2007-08-15", "type": "review"}

I felt that we'd get to try alot of other things this way. My daughter had Penne and spicy marinara, I had the Nagasaki Sara Udon and my partner had a Curry dish. We shared a dessert despite saying we wouldn't try one again. I got a pineapple cooler despite saying I wasn't going to try the drinks again. Listening to myself next time on both desserts and drinks. Promise.\nFood: The Penne Marinara was not spicy, but it was good said the daughter. It was $7 and the serving was plenty. She was ok with it. She lamented that we didn't pick Pizza a Metro again. I think I may have spoiled my ability to grab just any old pasta to suit her after eating there.\nMy Nagasaki Udon had some good flavors, but there was a bit of burnt in it, sort of what happens some times at Panda Express with their noodles, but it was nice to have calamari and the shrimps. I added my sushi soy/wasabi sauce to it and the red pickled things from my partners curry dish and that livened it up. The sauce consistency was a bit ew at the end, so I didn't finish. The food was better than my previous visit. My partner did not enjoy the Curry, said it had no heat to it at all, was bland. \nNice service, though. We grabbed two sushi rolls for appetizer, one crunchy roll and a spicy yellow-tail. Both were fine, but again \"Spicy\" wasn't there. I think this place hedges itself on spice and for those that seek it, may feel disappointed.  Seating was difficult because they had a large party and I had to sit in a walkway in a door-frame on the edge and it was awkward.\nI upped my rating to a third star because our bread basket was tasty and because we were able to feed three diverse needs in one place, with better service this time.", "business_id": "AkOruz5CrCxUmXe1p_WoRg", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-08-17", "type": "review"}

We were then outside and I was left to fight off the queens who seriously considered going to Tokyo express instead! And then FINALLY our names were called and we were seated.\n\nOur waitress was very nice. I want to say that it's the little touches that make CBNC great. The fresh  thick lemon wedge and fresh sprig of mint in the water pitchers. The way the servers are so friendly. She even complimented on my Japanese pronunciation! :) I didn't want to tell her the origin of my great accent...  watching Kill Bill a thousand times. \n\nShe helped us order sushi. I wanted nigiri and they didn't have it. I was disappointed but still went with her suggested crispy rolls and alaskan rolls. They were AMAZING! I loved the crunch and the flavor. With the soy sauce was scrumptious. We wanted to cancel our orders and just get more sushi! The alaskan was great as well. I loved it. Even the queen who never had sushi before liked it. \n\nAfter devouring the sushi our food came. I ordered the beef soba noodle soup with tempura. It came with chicken instead. (boo!) but the tempura was perfect! (yay!) and I never had soba noodles, I usually get udon or chinese noodles. but I really liked the flavor and the fresh spniach that was wilting more and more as time went on. The slight flavor of the sliced green onions really made the dish something special. I loved it. I am just so sad that I couldn't finish it all! :(\n\nOne queen devoured the beef yakisoba noodles at once! I was able to sneak my chopsticks inbetween his bites and I got a taste. it was CRAZY yummy! each of the veggies had a great difinitive flavor and yet melded together amazingly. I loved it. \n\nThe other queen was pleasantly surprised at the taste of his Spicy beef rice plate. He couldn't finish his eaither but it was really. A lil too spicy for my tastes, but it was still awesome. \n\nWe then ordered a bottle of wine and a sip here and a sip there and we were all in heaven! Talking to our waitress about the Navajo sushi chef behind the sushi bar who she was trying to hook up with one of us... but we couldn't tell WHO she was trying to hook him up with! One of the queens or me?! Said chef never made it to our table - and it's just as well... we were in food heaven savoring our delights and wishing we had bigger stomachs to take it all in!

I'd forgotten about my one glorious trip to the Noodle Cafe until tonight, so it got my vote. (The Noodle Cafe is not forgettable - it's just that we're always trying new places so sometimes we forget to go back to places we love.)  \n\nJust like last time there were people waiting outside and we were told it'd be 20 minutes before we got a table.  It was really only about 15, but the food is SO worth the wait.\n\nTonight we ordered 3 sushi rolls: the crispy California, double crispy shrimp and the caterpillar roll.  All were super tasty! I love that they roll some of their rolls (the \"crispy\" ones) in panko crumbs - you seriously have to try one.  I think we may have ordered the same rolls last time because they're just that good! \n\nLast time we went I enjoyed the Spicy Korean Beef dish SO MUCH that it was really difficult for me to try something new this time.  I made a last minute decision to try the TanTan-Men Ramen dish which is a \"Sichuan Style Very Spicy Noodle Soup with Minced Pork.\"  I was worried about the \"very spicy\" part only because I'm not usually that tough when it comes to Asian spices.  However, since the Spicy Korean Beef had been that perfect amount of spicy - the kind that makes your lips numb but isn't painful - I decided to be brave.  I am not kidding you - this is the best Asian dish I've ever eaten!!!  Don't get me wrong, kids - it's SPICY.  My lips were numb, my tongue was tingly and my nose got a little runny.  At one point I may have told The Boy my stomach was on fire.  But I loved every minute of it!  And the best part is they gave me an enormous bowl full - so I had plenty to take home for a second round of yumminess!\n\nThe Boy has ordered the Pad Thai and Hakata Ramen - both tasty, but neither as tasty as my dishes! :) :)\n\nIn short - HA too late - DEFINITELY try  CherryBlossom Noodle Cafe.

In the past they had always given out their wonderfully delicious banana bread free with their bread baskets( worth the trip alone) but not today. I did get their little cinnamon toasts though. YEAH!) My Chicken Slaw Salad was fine, good, but again not great. So I guess I am not sure if they have changed the way they do things or maybe it was just an off day.

It has always been terrible and continues to be so. Sad. I waited ten minutes to even be acknowledged when I walked through the door. The food service wasn't great either. They have always needed more help so it confused me when they expanded several years back. I see they still don't get it. If you are a busy, popular establishment please staff accordingly.  \n   If you want to try dining here there are still some positives.

I was looking forward to trying the Bento Box because it seemed like a good deal for only $10. It's really busy at lunch time but they have a decent lunchtime menu. \nSadly, we were seated and had our drink order taken, but no one approached to take our order for another 25 minutes. Our waiter kept telling us he'd be back in 2 minutes but eventually we had to flag down a different waiter just to take our order. On the flipside, he gave our table comp. adamame and eel sauce, no charge to make up for our wait. We received our food promptly after that. I was impressed with how much you get on the Bento Box. The salad had like an ounce of dressing on it so that wasn't all the great. The rice stuck together and the steak had a little bit too much fat still on it. The sushi was great and I liked the soup too. The best part was the eel sauce everthing could be dipped in.\n\nI was so pretty bummed at the service, but I understood it was the lunchtime rush and the place was filled.

Nope, this was your standard frozen, then warmed chicken with a rubbery-coating-that-passes-as-real-fried-food. If I wanted frozen food, I would have just made it myself (no I wouldn't, that shit tastes terrible). \n\nThe sauce was uninspiring, but hey, does it matter if the chicken isn't worth it? \n\nThe ugly:  The ramen I ordered came out... and disappointment abounds. First, the noodles looked like what you buy at the supermarket. So... yeah, if I want supermarket food, I'll just go to the supermarket. Am I wrong to expect restaurants to actually prepare food from scratch? Oh but it's so hard to make noodles by hand/machine you say? THAT'S WHY I SPEND MONEY IN A RESTAURANT!!!!\n\nWhat about the broth? The life-sustaining broth that is cooked for hours if not days and ties the entire dish together ... well let's not get too excited because once again, it tastes more like powdered mix. \n\nAre we sensing a theme here? Lots of supermarket stuff, at a premium price. Sorry, that's not why I go to a restaurant.\n\nSo why did I even bother trying this place? Because Yelp had promised me a grand culinary experience (okay maybe not grand, but good at least).

My husband decided he would give it a shot one night, and it turns out that their Italian dishes are equally as good as their Asian dishes. \n\nHere are my favorites:\n- Hakata Ramen: a flavorful Ramen, with coconut milk and pork, one of the few places that offers Ramen in Phoenix, and also one of the best!\n\n- Pad Thai: This is pretty authentic, the sauce had great flavor and the portion is generous\n\n- Rei-Shabu: slices of rare beef, with noodles, and a flavorful sesame dressing, perfect for a hot day\n\n- Bolognese: This sauce is homemade and very flavorful with lots of meat\n\n- Chicken marsala: Not very traditional as it's more of a cream sauce, but it still tastes great, is full of flavor, and the spinach noodles add a nice touch\n\nThey offer reasonably priced lunch specials and sushi too. My only complaint is that the service can be a little slow, so don't come here if you're in a rush. However, they're always very friendly and nice.

We walked in at 8, two hours before close, and one hostess was hunched over the counter doodling.

She grabbed two menus and motioned for us to sit down at the closest table, which happened to be sandwiched in the corner of two other populated tables.

As for rice dishes, the katsu is decent, but avoid most of the appetizers:  shrimp shumai were mushy and flavorless, the Korean spicy rib lacked the spice, richness, and tenderness you'd want from a dish with that title, and the gyoza are less than noteworthy.\n\nThe lunch special is another great reason to come here:  for under $10, you can get a filling combination, like your choice of noodle soup with inari or a California roll.  Although the sushi isn't a reason to visit Cherryblossom and the California roll isn't something I'd jump at ordering even at my favorite sushi joint, it's a great deal.  And when you're really there for the noodles anyway, how can you beat that?", "business_id": "AkOruz5CrCxUmXe1p_WoRg", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-08-04", "type": "review"}

I've had the smoked salmon ramen and the udon stir fry. Neither were very good. Ramen was too salty and the udon was bland. The calamari salad is good after the first few bites, but the pieces of squid are huge and overly battered. The portion is huge, but you are left not wanting to eat the entire thing. The little scallop pasta appetizer was pretty good, and so is the bread they served complimentary when you are there at dinner (not happy hour). The sushi is about par with the grocery stores. Desserts look good in the dessert case, but I've never tried any. My biggest gripe is the terribly slow service! I've been there twice. Once on a Saturday around 3:30pm, once on a Friday night at 5:30pm. Both times, it took over 40-45 minutes to get our food. The last time I went, which will also be the last time I go, we waited close to 45 minutes and when I inquired with a waiter, he threw his hands up and in a joking tone,and said \"it's happy hour, there's always a wait.\" He didn't bother to check on the status of our food. His attitude was, \"Hey, we've got more business than we can handle...suck it up!\"  If you have time to wait for mediocre food -- be my guest!", "business_id": "AkOruz5CrCxUmXe1p_WoRg", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-08-05", "type": "review"}

We arrived at Moto and were seated promptly at a table by the bar.  The restaurant wasn't packed at all and we seemed to arrive at just the right time.  Our server, Lilia didn't great us for nearly 5 minutes then she took almost 10 minutes to bring us our iced teas.  She took our order of the all you can eat sushi and it wasn't too long before our sushi came out.  She never once came back in the middle of our meal to see how the sushi was and showed up as I was consuming my last piece of sushi.  Normally, the servers will come back a few minutes after dropping off the first round of sushi and from there they will take your next order to make sure you get prompt service.  Just as I was eating my last piece of sushi she showed up and took our second order.  Our ice teas were low and she never offered to refill them.  We were watching the time and noticed our movie was starting within 40 minutes so we were a little concerned.  After sitting there for 20 minutes after putting in our second order, we asked the bartender if we had an order waiting for us.  He informed us she put it in but it wasn't up yet.  Lilia was literally wondering around aimlessly and didn't look that busy so we were a little upset that she was giving us horrible service.  She finally decided to come over and give us an ETA of when our last order would be up and we asked for our bill so we could pay and leave after we ate.  We let her know we still wanted our last order but we were just trying to make a movie.  She grabbed us our bill then came back and took our plates and cleaned off the table.  We were absolutely confused and asked the bartender about our order.  He told us that she cancelled our last sushi order and we informed the bartender that we didn't tell her to do that.  At this point we were fuming mad and just ready to leave because I knew if I had spoken to the manager I would've blown up.  On top of that we missed our movie and just decided to go home.  We spent $49.70 on sushi and that included a 20% gratuity tip that they automatically put on for the all you can eat sushi.  She honestly wasn't worth the $8.28 tip that I was forced to pay.  I seriously feel like I've been ripped off and the server received a 20% tip for pretty much doing nothing.  I come here all the time and I've never had bad service like this before.  The girls are normally attentive and want to turn their tables so they make more money, which makes sense.  This was the second time Lilia was our server and both times we had horrible service.  The first time we let slide because it was a Friday night and they were doing their local brews so they were slammed.  I just thought she was overwhelmed the first time and I didn't let it bother me.  But to have poor service from the same girl twice in a row is unacceptable.  \n\nOverall, the food was excellent, the bartender was more attentive to us than our server, I just wish I could've enjoyed more.", "business_id": "c0RSs2KYK5Y-ZlSrNq9LyA", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-06-06", "type": "review"}

Well,  everything except for the staff who may as well change every other week explaining a lot about the service or lack thereof.\n\nMoto is run by both pretentious and puerile people who make the tragic mistake of thinking that they are either clever or fun. They are neither. Their menu is only half as ridiculous as their thinly veiled tantrums between employees about customers and co-workers. Well, depending on which menu you get, because a lot of their best puerile antics are in the phenomenally stupid act of hiding their food from their customers. \n\nNo joke, any one menu you see is incomplete because you have to get their \"secret\" menus to see what they really have. Often these same menus are woefully inaccurate anyway making any one menu pretty useless overall. You may as well cross your fingers when you order. My eyes rolled so hard they nearly popped out of my head when the staff explained this fun gimmick to me.\n\nThey burn through waiting staff like the place has a revolving door, so an all-too frequent sight is a woman sobbing her eyes out just outside the building because she got fired. Sometimes, if you're lucky, the boss will be out hollering at them making it even more attractive. Yeah, I want to eat THERE; where the women cry.\n\nFor the record, these guys bought a closed Japanese fast food restaurant (Formerly a Shogun Express), peeled off all the surfaces and then painted bricks red as they broke the lights making it incredibly dim to give it that east coast \"this place is condemned, but eat here anyway\" sort of look and feel. \n\nYou know what they say about eating in a low-lit environment, right? The prices are roughly on par with the vastly superior RA Sushi restaurant, but because they're both pretentious and puerile they will arbitrarily decide to tack on gratuity at a whim as well as various \"taxes\" to punish customers. \n\nI'm not kidding. I observed a guy who got hit with a \"Geek Tax\" for bringing in his child holding a McDonald's cup, he was less than happy for the remarkle expense for a bowl of Chicken. I asked about it later and they explained that they fine people for various reasons and sneak it onto their bills.\n\nIt's not a great place to spend time, but since you'll be waiting FOREVER for food or drink refills anyway, you'll also come to embrace the ugly, uncomfortable furniture, which is meant to compel you to leave. So it's ironic that everything takes so long.\n\nThe food is schizophrenic in its spastic variety and its minuscule sushi portions and variety (and stupid list of in-restaurant rules) are pathetic. The management is barking mad, the servers can't juggle tables and the prices are as reliable as the unreliable menus.\n\nIf you MUST try this place, try to do the take-out service if possible. It's the only way not to be disappointed. Eat in at your own risk. I don't drink so I can't speak for their alcohol, but I hear their beer selection isn't bad.", "business_id": "c0RSs2KYK5Y-ZlSrNq9LyA", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-08-11", "type": "review"}

The first thing I noticed was that my favorite, eel nigiri, was replaced by smoked salmon on the all-you-can eat menu; strike one. Despite this, we both ordered the special. I opted for the additional sake bomber while Karen had a bottle of Sapporo. Now, the sushi was never spectacular in past visits, but the price was reasonable for the limited selection. But it was hard to reconcile the three dollar increase since our last visit;strike two. On a positive note the smoked salmon nigiri was actually VERY good. Unfortunately, that was the ONLY positive to this experience. The server was attentive enough though we felt rushed (we didn't reorder anything). When I got the check, I discovered that A)While I was only charged an additional three dollars for the sake bomber (22oz. Sapporo and a small sake), I was charged the full $5.00 for Karen's lone 22oz Sapporo. B)There was a 20% gratuity included in the bill.(I don't know if it was policy or the server was feeling especially generous with my money):strike three. I did not raise the issue with the check because we didn't really miss the two bucks though Karen might have liked to have had the sake also, And I would've tipped 20% anyway as is usually my practice when I receive adequate service though it is very presumptuous to automatically assume we received adequate service. Ultimately, there are too many other places where we can go to get adequate sushi and adequate service without being milked for an extra few bucks. Therefore we will not be returning to Moto as it is no longer in competition for our dining dollars.", "business_id": "c0RSs2KYK5Y-ZlSrNq9LyA", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-08-20", "type": "review"}

I can't comment on how the sushi is at Moto. Instead, I decided to try the Pho. I have eaten Pho at many places around town and typically enjoy it. Not at Moto. The broth was a darker color than I am used to and had a funny after taste. I couldn't even get through about 1/4 of it before I lost my appetite. \n\nMost of the other members of my group didn't like the food much either.

In the back there is Zen Lounge for those who want to sit at the bar and eat with the T.V. going.\nWe were sat immediately at a booth/table and brought out waters by a busser.  While looking at the menu and drink list I noticed how dimly lit the place was and the music was some low playing repetitive Japanese flute music (better then house-trance I guess).

The bar service was also fantastic. Very prompt and not pushy.  The polka dot Riesling I first discovered at Fry's because of its name greeted me at the bar and we had a very happy gathering. The anime movies playing quietly off to the side. What a great touch!!\n\nThe food was pretty on point. I had some of the best sashimi I had ever had and some great rolls and nigiri also. I left the right amount of full (not overfull) and happy. Speaking of happy, happy hour prices started a little after we were seated and were accounted for as so on our bill.\n\nWhy the comedy of errors then? The first error was the staff completely ignoring us back in our little spot in the bar waiting to be seated. It took nearly an hour and us reminding them in order to get a table. \n\nSecond was the wine incident which was hilarious. I ordered a second glass of polka dot while we were at the table. Our waitress comes back with the Riesling and instead of starting to pour some in my empty wine glass, she adds a bit to my water. We thought it was super funny and were not really upset. I think a joke was even made about turning water into wine! :) Needless to say, she was embarrassed and promptly brought me back enough wine four twice the number of pours you usually get.  \n\nIt's a little out of the way, but I'll be back.

I was expecting some common sense from the chef/wank they picked up off the street, but even hope fails occasionally in an explosion of misery. The unagi roll was horrible. The rice was not fully cooked, the contents were soggy and tasted old. The sushi would have been better if the chef had taken the ingredients, put them down his pants, sat on them for 5 minutes while riding a bull, and then vomited on the resulting creation. Later the Panko Udon arrived, and it was even worse. I understand that it was panko breaded and not a tempura batter, but still it was absolutely horrendous. They could not have overcooked the vegetables, shrimp, and fish more.  It was greasy, bland, insipid cooking that could not have been made better even if it were served with a diamond ring.  The store bought, cheap as you can find udon was undercooked and had the texture of noodles that had been sitting for about 30 minutes in a colander. These little beauties were served in a pool of horrific bottled tsuyu sauce that left a lingering chemical aftertaste that was just a delight to behold.\n\nI would not eat here again even if my scrotum were stapled to a chair and I was chained to a table.

I was happy to see that not much had changed, and the sushi was as delicious as ever! I was, however, disappointed in the available sushi lunch specials--I was so spoiled in NYC with all of the cheap sushi lunch spots everywhere! \n\nThe lunch menu here is seriously lacking in sushi, so I opted for a bento box which was huge (and cost about $13). I liked just about everything involved, and you get choices for each section of the box. You do get sushi with the bento box, but the selection is limited-either one roll (I got the spicy tuna, which actually had a lot more to it than just tuna-yum!) or two pieces of nigiri. \n\nI also got teriyaki chicken, which was good but did not come with any rice...that was a bit unexpected, but because there's so much food in the bento box I didn't miss it. My friend ordered a side of it to go with hers and I don't think they charged us for it. For the \"salad\" option you can choose from sumunomo (probably butchered the spelling on that), turkey salad (sounds random but is actually really good), or seaweed salad (which I ordered). Seaweed was fresh and tasty, and the portion was definitely decent.\n\nYou can choose between shumai (shrimp dumplings), gyoza (pork dumplings) or something else that sounded calorie-bombish (I wanna say it was fried cheese? I didn't order it either way). My friend and I were steering clear of fried food so we got the shumai, which ended up being quite fried indeed! I haven't ever seen fried shumai, but I tried a small bite and it was decent but greasy. \n\nI was glad that the small amount of sushi I had with lunch was as tasty and fresh as ever-I will definitely be back for more!", "business_id": "r7Ge8_c5Y2TXthb4CSjzaA", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-06-21", "type": "review"}

The only thing that is a tad disappointing is that the wait staff there seems to have a high turnover rate, I sometimes see a couple of the sushi chefs who I can remember from as far back as six years, but other than that, as much as my family and friends and I go there, we never get recognized as \"regulars\" because there's always someone new working there!  I'd say that's their only downfall.... Other than that, this would be by far my favorite place to eat in Arizona ;)", "business_id": "0vzZ_Bcb02rJljeMU9XkBw", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-08-21", "type": "review"}

Sakana is thou the worst offender of doing this. My husband and I went the other evening and ordered what we thought were 7 different rolls...nope-they all tasted the same. \nFake \"krab\" minced up and doused in mayo- minced tuna..again doused in mayo-and what didn't have mayo had cream cheese or was deep fried-ick. \n\nEven when asking the waitress what was in the rolls (we like to try different things) she at no time said \"krab salad\"-she just said crab...so when I get rolls that have this stick all minced up with mayo you can certainly understand my frustration. The head chef came over and apologized-however stated that it was their \"style\" and that's how most of the rolls are. \nDinner was atrocious and you leave here with your clothes reeking of oil due to the teppan bar that they have. So money wasted on something I could have done myself with a jar of Hellmans and a package of VandDeKamp Krab and additional money wasted on a dry cleaning bill. \nSave your palette and your money and go elsewhere if you are looking for good, clean, sushi.

Also while visiting Arizona a while back was the first time I've ever had BAD sushi. BUT-how much longer could I have avoided such sushi cravings I've been having since I moved here? I need sushi in my life...\n\nAMBIANCE: \nIts interesting how sushi houses in Phoenix take orders by having a paper menu which the party can mark themselves. (Highly efficient btw.) \nLocated in a random shopping center, Sakana has a comfortable atmosphere with a little more real estate than you would figure this spot to be from the outside. Family & hip(ster-ish) oriented (patrons & servers alike) instead of the familiar K-pop cover ballads they played some 90's pop hits from MJ to Prince. Nothing like your 'HE HEEE'S!' & purple rain while you're scarfing down some good fish. Its casual.\n\nSUSHI & SERVICE: \nI went with a party of 5 on a Sunday with most of the tables occupied. Even so I was surprised we got our drinks & smoked salmon sashimi  within 5 minutes. We sampled 6 different rolls-from baked scallop to the tootsie roll to the fried Californian. All which I should say is pretty LEGIT. Not the straight out the water fresh but the THIS-IS-AS-GOOD-AS-IT-CAN-GET-SUSHI- WISE-OUT-HERE fresh. Which is all I can ask for! Really, it was DELICIOSO. \n-The rolls are your standard size for (Americanized) sushi about 4-6 pieces.\n-If you ever order the baked scallop roll they bless it with an abundance of crab meat/chopped up scallops & topped off with sprinkled fish eggs-no room for dissapointment here. \n\nThough Sakana has 2 other locations in the valley it does not have the flavor of 'chain' sushi. Also they mixed up an order of a massive sushi plater & placed it on our table then had to quickly take it back right when my cousin was about to pinch one with her chopsticks. Well 2 minutes later we were served a plate of another Vegas roll-on the house. To compensate for the possible emotional distress you may have caused taking away  that triple roll platter-compensate you did. NOTED.\n\nBRAVO Sakana for your timely & friendly service, being open on sunday & the complimentary sushi. I shall return to this sushi house in the desert!

Also, don't be afraid to ask what the sushi chefs recommend, they've never steered me wrong.\n\nFor my 27th (again) birthday, my friends & family joined me for dinner at their teppanyaki tables.

I've been going to Sakana since grad school in 2007, when we'd hit up the 59th Ave. location regularly.  When I moved, I was happy to find this location was close to the house and it became my 'take-out' sushi joint.  Probably went there 20 times in the past year - mostly with called in orders, but often dragging the (non-sushi-eating) boyfriend along for a dine in.  Rolls are big and stuffed with fish, esp. for the price, and the quality is pretty good.\n\nSo what happened? 2 terrible experiences in a row.  \n\nIn May, I had a hankerin' for take-out, called in my order, and got the usual \"It'll be ready in 30 minutes.\"  Perfect.  Enough time to drive over, stop at the Safeway and get some beer before picking up the delicious yumminess.  Did that, got the sushi, paid and was halfway home when it occurred to me that there were fewer boxes than usual.  Pulled over, did a check and... sure enough, they forgot my nigiri.  Darn.\n\nCalled them up, told them what happened, and headed over to pick up my food.  (I had been charged for it, I was going to get it.)  Head to the hostess, tell her who I am, \"Oh, ok.  We'll put that order in for you.\" Uh? You didn't already? \"You're going to expedite it, right?\" \"Oh, of course.\"\n\nSo I wait.  And wait.  And wait.  How long does it take to make up 8 rice balls, wasabi them and plop pre-cut fish?! Talk to the hostess... it is coming? My other sushi IS sitting in the car.  \"I'll go check.\"  Ok... so I wait some more.  I've been irritated for a while now, but apparently it is becoming visible.  It has been 30(!!) minutes since my \"expedited\" order was put in (70 minutes since my original order was phoned in).  The manager sees this and comes over, asking what is wrong.  I tell him.  To his credit, he gets the order handled and gives me a $10 coupon to come back.  Still annoyed, but mollified, I head out.\n\nFast forward to last night.  I have my coupon and a hankerin' for sushi, so wrassle up the boy and head back to give Sakana another chance.  I put our name on the list (30 minute wait) and, because it is crowded & noisy, head outside to wait.  There are several other folks out there and, periodically, the hostess comes out calling names.  Once. Twice.  Three times.  She comes out, calling names.  \n\nAfter a while, someone comes out and lights up a cigarette within smelling range (ew!!!), so the boy and I head inside to wait.  Names are called.  New people come in and get their names on the list.  More people are seated.  It can't be long now! Then the hostess goes out and fetches some of the new people, happily taking them to a table.  \n\nWTF?! The boy goes and looks at the list.  We've been crossed off.  WTFF?! Our name hadn't been called - we were in earshot the entire time; why was it crossed off? Forget this - I guess they don't want us to eat here.  So we got up and went across town to my true favorite sushi place.  (If it weren't such a long drive to Scottsdale, we'd always go there.)  Which worked out much better, since the staff recognize us, the fish is better, there is more non-sushi variety for the boy, and it is much less noisy and crowded.\n\nI'll be back to Sakana one more time.  I still have that coupon after all and $10 of sushi is $10 of sushi.  But now I'm on the prowl for a new sushi place close by to become my new \"take out\" place.  It's too bad... I DO like them a lot, but to receive execrable service two times in a row is unacceptable.", "business_id": "0vzZ_Bcb02rJljeMU9XkBw", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-07-13", "type": "review"}

Here's what I order EVERY time with my girlfriend:\n\nDrinks $14: Large Kirin and sake x2 \nAppetizers $2 ($1 each with Kirin purchase!):\n\nJalaccini (fried zucchini and jalapeno)\nFried mushrooms (best you'll ever have)\nBoth come with \"miso mayo\" the greatest sauce I've ever tasted!\n\nSushi $7.65:\n\nSpicy tuna roll (the biggest roll you will find, bar none. I kid you. not, these things are stuffed full of tuna)\n\nMexican Caliente roll (jalapeno goodness, just as gigantic as the spicy tuna!)\n\nGrand total for 2 sake bombs, 2 apps, and 2 giant rolls:\n \n$23.65 + $5 tip\n\nThis is the best of the best, and for a price that can't be beat. Oh and here's a bonus: they have gluten free soy sauce! \n\nOther tips: ask for the happy hour cocktail menu, they don't have it out, but most of the drinks are incredible and affordable.", "business_id": "0vzZ_Bcb02rJljeMU9XkBw", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-08-19", "type": "review"}

Great value for the happy menu items. The place filled up just a few minutes after opening at 11 am, which is a good sign. Free miso soup upon sitting down and free edamame with a yelp check in.

We had fried calamari with jalape\u00f1os which were great and came with a nice dipping sauce.  We also ordered two rolls off the \"happy hour\" menu. Very nice fish:rice ratio. Some places jipp you with a lot of rice and little fish.  We also ordered the sakana sushi special. Needless to say, we ordered too much food with our hungry eyes.  The sushi fish itself was ok. I felt that it was room temperature instead of cold and straight out of refrigerator. Not fishy yet but just about to go under.  Slices are decent size, but some cuts were a bit sloppy.

LET THE GOOD TIMES ROLL!\n\nI don't want to spoil the experience for anyone who has not yet been here, but I felt the inner child in me exploding in awe-inspiring wonder and hunger as the chef went through the motions of throwing eggs in the air, skillfully chopping veggies, making DELICIOUS fried rice, and finally the greatest moment ever - frying up the rib eye steak I ordered.  I wanted mine rare and that's exactly how I got it served!  Excellent food and an even more wonderful show to boot.\n\nI'm 100% sure that my buddy and I were at least 8000x more excited about the dinner experience than the lame-ass* kids sitting across from us.

I paid cash--the other two paid with credit/debit cards.  It took forever for the waitress to come back with their cards and my change.

One dish I particularly enjoyed were the mussels in this flavorful garlic and leek broth. I ordered extra white rice on the side and make a little soup and was stuffed. Super filling and delectable.\n\nAlso, their sashimi is nice, which I always find is the mark of fresh fish at a restaurant..\n\nHappy and pleased.

No, it's not the best sushi in the Valley, but they make it fresh for you on site. You can stand there and watch it being make, grab a soup or something else to munch on, or just sit at your table and chat awhile. Afterwards, you can head back for more sushi or veer over to the more traditional offerings of a Chinese buffet: sweet and sour chicken, fried rice, crab legs. \n\nNow let's review the not-so-shiny aspect: the price. Yes, it seems a little steep that we paid about $25 per person with tip (and I made only two rounds) but when you factor in the 2 hours we spent there, grazing, catching up, grazing, passing Lisette's daughter around, grazing and making plans to keep in touch, it's really not such an outrageous amount to pay. \n\nIf you find yourself in this part of town, craving Chinese and are wicked crazy hungry, give HKGB a shot.", "business_id": "-Ogv7rpcgUHkFaSy3vD8Sw", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-08-13", "type": "review"}

It's a typical chinese style buffet that you can find in LA dime a dozen ($14.99 for dinner which is little higher than the buffets here in LA)... The location was very clean, the dining time we went was completely empty....(maybe that made it look cleaner?)  There were 4 stations with about 6-8 hot trays with your typical food fares such as orange chicken, beef with brocolli, lemon salmon, fried wonton, crab rangoon, bbq ribs, prime rib, mayonaise covered mussels, simply steamed clams, string beans, fried noodles, fried rice, fruit salad, salad bar, and a very small selection of sushi bar that had like 3 types of sushi there...(Mongolian BBQ dude was on break or something....Not Available!)\n\nOverall the taste was half decent or was it because we were so hungry and that we had to finish up our meal fast because we still got another hour to go on the road?  Whatever it was the salmon was delicious and the ribs actually tasted really good.  Friend got the noodles with orange chicken, beef brocolli and thought idelicious as well....  I know for a fact that these chinese style buffets can't get any better or worse  (Unless you are Bamboo Garden then there is a great chance you can screw this up!), so as long as the food is not overly salty and has a respectable service, the experience should all be about the same...\n\n( I often wonder if all these chinese buffet chefs came out of a same buffet culinary school?  There's gotta be a hidden buffet university catering just to aspiring chinese buffet chefs!!!!  Seriously, how does buffet in CA taste the same as those in AZ?  or in face WA, OR, etc.?  )\n\nI'm guessing we were just really really hungry that is why it was so good.....Insanely 4 stars reviewed based on this one time visit....  hopefully I'm not too off.....  \n\nGood service though!

Back home there was a killer Chinese Buffet by my house so I was looking for a replacement, plus its right across the street, and had really good reviews so I had to check it out. \n\nWe went around 5:30 on a Wednesday..when we went in only a few other people were there our waitress came over and took our drink orders and off we went to get food. The first thing I ate was an egg roll which was pretty yummy, then I ate a small crab rangoon which was cold. Then when I went to eat my Orange chicken I noticed there was a black hair stuck in the chicken under the breading. Ew. I told our waitress and she apologized profusely, but by that time I had already lost my appetite. My boyfriend wasn't really impressed with his either (most of the food was barely lukewarm) but 'I told him we might as well try the sushi before we leave. At the sushi station you order your sushi and they make it fresh. There was a sign that said, \"Brown rice upon request\", so I asked for a spicy tuna roll with brown rice. The guy making the sushi responded with, \"Maybe we don't have brown rice\", avoiding eye contact with me. Awesome.\n\n So after that we told the waitress we wanted the check  and she could tell we weren't pleased. Since I had only eaten an egg roll and one of their little crab rangoons I asked to have my bill either discounted or to not get charged for my meal. The waitress said she would talk to the manager. They didn't charge me for my meal which was good since I wasn't about to spend $15 on an egg roll. I also wasn't thrilled that the manger didn't come over. Oh well.

The beef tendon was different.  Chewy as expected but it did have good flavor.  I am not so sure that anything really jumped out at my wife as \"OMG good\".  The deep fried calamari was very greasy as were the crab puffs (crab rangoon).

And most of the food looked and taste like they been sitting out for hours. The only decent dish we had was the fried rice and beef with broccoli and eggrolls. Everything else was hardly fresh and not good tasting at all. And another disgusting dish that I saw that they served were frog legs. Gross!!! No thanks! I'm sure the same grease that they used to fry them things in is the same one they use to fry everything else.

The first time we went there it was just undergoing some renovations, so we went again just yesterday afternoon (around 1 - 2 pm), with high expectations.\n\nOur first impression when entering the restaurant was: have it really renovated?! It looked old and...not renovated! But we understand that it's just a pop and mom restaurant from other reviewers so we kind of accepted it. \n\nI ordered maguro don and my hubby ordered beef curry, with a barley tea and a soft drink. When our drinks arrived, there were bits of mysterious black stuff on his ice and my barley tea seemed to have some weird taste. \n\nRegardless, we were still happily expecting our lunch combos and patiently waited...not long afterwards our lunch came and our meals looked nice. I couldn't wait to try the maguro on my rice but...nothing special? The maguro was cut in pieces of various lengths and shapes and they're salty without the soy sauce. I understand that Japanese chefs would add wasabi and soy sauce in the fish first so that you don't normally need to add soy sauce yourself but I think they added too much or marinated for too long. It's a big no-no to treat fish in my opinion, because you won't be able to taste the real taste or covered the freshness of the fish (and I think the fish was not fresh).\n\nI tried the miso soup and it was really salty too (I couldn't sense the taste of miso). \"It couldn't be!\" I thought, after seeing all the raves on Yelp, so I tried my hubby's beef curry and...still no surprise. It's quite tasteless even to my standard and I actually enjoy light flavored meals most of the time. The fried chicken on the side was unexpectedly the only thing I found OK. \n\nWell we thought we should never have such high expectations for a family restaurant but we were really extremely disappointed and regretted about our visit, and we both thought our lunch was over-priced (ended up paying almost $30 including tax and tips) for such standard of food.

Never again will i step foot after our first and last visit to this horrid establishment. Customer service in my eyes plays a HUGE Role. If you are treated poorly what is the purpose to come back with their food not being anything amazing as well. We had come to this establishment for sushi night and sake bombs for the boys.  Their small sake bottle they give you with a huge bottle of beer to match but doesnt match really because theres maybe 2-3 shots worth of sake and the beer with sake should be about 5-8 shots rather than 2-3.  After waiting for our food for a good amount of time passed our huge amount of food ordered came out and was decent but not for the price we paid.  Not A Deal! What so ever.  So as we are still having a good time eating and talking to one another about random things and what not, my boyfriend got up to look at something on the TV since it was close by but not close enough for him to see what the score was on a game so as he got up to look the restaraunt was closing up and we were the last 2 couples in the place putting money in their pockets for the day; the owner or manager in a little button up tommy bahama type looking short asian man had gone up to my boyfriend and said CAN I HELP YOU WITH SOMETHING?! Very rudely said, and my boyfriend responded No, i was just checking the score. The Manager basically cut him off and said WELL THEN LETS GO! so my boyfriend came back to the table and had said i think they want us to go so we closed our check and had hurried as fast as we could. I understand when establishments close it is time to go!  But if its a mom and pop shop or restaraunt i believe in more or better customer service in order to get a tip.  I do not believe i have to tip over 15% if i was treated poorly. My boyfriend is too nice when it comes to tips in my opinion i believe people need to work for their money and just not expect so much from people if they don't try hard enough.  You treat me poorly i don't return or i excpect an apology of some sort.  If not you can expect no more money from my bank account.  \n\nTheir food and service what we paid for was ridiculous. I Will Never Ever Return. I Hope they Shut down. I think if a wait staff is really nice we would have been treated better then this on our first time here.  For what we paid i could have gotten triple the food in other place i know of. And as far as portions go 3/4 of the people that went including myself were still hungry leaving.", "business_id": "42xKe5YcCIKmGiqW0i4aGw", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-08-05", "type": "review"}

Fresh, tasty and generous portions. However....\nMy brother stopped frequenting this place when he got home, realized he had received \"dark meat\" chicken when he specifically asked for white meat. I'm thinking.. No big deal. We're less than a mile away, quit bein a big baby and go have her change it. I'm sure it won't be a problem. WRONG. We return to the establishment only for the little old lady to get defensive when he tells her that he ordered something different. She actually \"argues\" with him telling him what he ordered instead of taking care of it. Me being completely self centered, every man for himself kinda guy (disgusting, I know) i shrug it off thinking..  We'll damn, glad they got my order right. He has refused to eat there since that day. I however continued to patronize the place like my dirty little secret, if the food wasn't so effing good and convenient. I kept it a secret to the brother knowing he was rioting then realized how much more enjoyable it was to just eat the delicious morsels in front of him slowly blowing the aroma his way and seeing his disgust.\nI frequented this place enough to the point of having a \"Yoko\" card in my wallet. I was super excited to have filled the card completely (10 previous meals) 11th free. I guarded this thing with my life like Smeagol in The Lord of the rings.  I couldn't give a flying f*** about the 6 bucks. Honestly. It was the fact I \"earned\" this meal and I wanted it so I drove out of my way to get it. I don't care who you are. \"Everybody\" loves something free especially when it is earned. \nI walk into this establishment, and peer over at the little old lady. I ask for a orange chicken bowl (all us white people eat the same shit) don't act like you don't know what I'm talking about.  I proceed to pull my golden ticket from my wallet glistening with 10 previous signatures of theirs awarding me my prize that's been nestled in my wallet. Little old lady looks at the card, doesn't say anything for 15 seconds then replies..  \"This guy that signed this box (points to the 3rd box) has been gone for 5 years.\" I'm thinking in my head..   \nThat's a shame, I don't care, I'm hungry, feed me. I made a comment how I must be getting old. Then realized she was being serious. I thought for a second maybe old lady enjoyed my company and threw a joke my way. Wrong again Preston. \nShe didn't like your lame joke, and she didn't like your sole being of existence standing before her like you just gave her a counterfeit 50 dollar bill.  She continued to exclaim that the card was of no use to me because I \"kept card in my wallet too long.\"  I explained to her that I have not even \"lived\" here for 5 years. I just discovered Yoko 1.5-2 years ago. She repeated the same thing several times which reminded me of when my DVD player freezes and repeats the same shit until you smack it. I slid my two $5 bills of the counter and proceeded to walk out while we continuously argued in front of other customers because she was determined to be the one in the right. \nIt's a shame, as I being a business owner would \"never\" handle a customer in the same fashion.  And the \"only\" reason I gave 3 stars is because the son that basically runs the place is top notch. Remembers your name, what you usually order etc. And did I forget to mention the food is terrific?\nHowever, now I shall live in a world with the Soup Natzi within walking distance from my house.  \nMy advice to anyone going there while she is on shift would be to walk in with your mouth shut, keep your head down, order, leave the corny jokes aside and be appreciative you get to eat that shit because she probably threw 10 other full grown men out of there that week so there would be room for you to enjoy your f****** meal.\n\nNo soup for you!", "business_id": "Js7xxK2D4Dc0W8XkAzc4cg", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-08-21", "type": "review"}

It is easily the best, locally owned, sushi place in Mesa.  It's in a large 20+year old strip mall and Sekai just recently celebrated their 10th anniversary.  Which shows you that they have a good base of fans to support their culinary efforts.  It's not the typical hip happening sushi joint of today's golden sushi bar age.  But that's just fine with me.  The TVs with the karaoke music does get a bit old, but that not why I eat here.  The owner is always there and she is very welcoming and nice.  She is a jack-of-all trades as well and I've seen her backing up the sushi chefs, waiting tables and running food.\n\nThey do enough business to keep the fish fresh and prices down which makes for a very good meal at what I consider value sushi prices.  Everything I have tried, which is just about all of it has been as good if not better than other more hyped sushi joints around town.\nWe make regular Friday night visits and it is a good place to meet up with our extended local family.  So, its great for groups. But call ahead on Fri-Sat to ensure you can get a large enough table.\nFavorites here are the Sushi Boat ($35) which has 4 rolls and a good selection of nigiri sushi making this the best value on the menu.  All the standards are excellent (hamachi, maguro, tako, etc.).  The spicy tuna handroll doesn't disappoint.\nOther non-sushi favorites include the Mackerel is wonderful and we have enjoyed the udon, gyoza and tempura.  Don't forget the edamame.\n\nThey have a full bar offering but I have never ordered a cocktail here.  Only beer and sake.  Good selection of Japanese bottles and they stock my favorite (Asahi Extra Dry).\n\nI'm all about the locally owned especially when it can compete and beat the chains.  Forget about the new Ra sushi on Val Vista and give this one a try. \n\nHighly Recommended", "business_id": "6syMU43FKGkcbX2957Ga8A", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-08-14", "type": "review"}

OK, so the fish isn't exactly what you'd get at Takashi in Manhattan, but it is always fresh and clean, making the $20 for all-you-can-eat one of the great bargains anywhere and the service was always quick, friendly, and helpful.\n\nUnfortunately that all ended a couple of months ago.  A sushi restaurant can only be as good as it sushi-yas and it seems that Ninja has been having staffing issues.\n\nMy wife and I went there as usual a few weeks ago on a Saturday night, and as usual, the place was packed.  What was different was that I didn't recognize any of the sushi chefs.  They only had 2 guys working the sushi bar.\n\nShortly after being seated, a large group came in for teppenyaki and what do you know? The 2 sushi chefs became 1 as the other guy left to do his Benihana routine.  All you can eat is only significant if you can actually get some food.  There is no way in the world 1 guy can supply a room of 40 or so.  Simply can't be done.\n\nI won't even go into how terrible our waitress was because she was new, avoided all contact with the tables because there was nothing she could do about the massive wait to get anything, and it is my understanding that she is no longer there.\n\nOK. So anyone can have a bad night.  My wife and I went there again last week.  This time it was a Thursday and the room was nearly empty.  A different two sushi-yas behind the bar.  Should be OK, I thought.  I was wrong.\n\nThe first plate took over 45 minutes.  The reason is that although they had 2 sushi chefs, only 1 was actually producing anything.  The second, a very large bearded white guy in a black nylon do-rag produced a grand total of 1 roll during my first 45 minutes there.  But he was having a grand old time talking to one of the busboys so I got the impression that he couldn't be bothered with customers.\n\nAnd in a repeat of our last visit, the service was also pathetic.  I sympathize with servers who are getting screwed by the kitchen, but that is no excuse for completely disappearing.  When our first plate finally did appear, it sat on the sushi bar for 10 minutes until my wife finally got fed up, got up and retrieved it herself.\n\nThat said, what we did get was great tasting as always.  If you go, you've got to try the 911 roll.  The fresh wasabi in it will make it hard to live with the powdered green horseradish ever again.\n\nCan Ninja be fixed? Absolutely.  It is a staffing problem, not a food problem.  Coincidentally, there have been numerous Help Wanted postings on their Facebook page recently.\n\nAlso please note that this review does not include anything about the teppanyaki.  In all these years, I've never had it there.  For all I know it may be the best thing on the planet.", "business_id": "5vgmIwBB48fwo_WC8vGiXA", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-07-21", "type": "review"}

I love sushi but its been so hard to find a place that has good enough fish where it reminds me of eating clouds (yes, good fish should taste more like clouds than fish!)\n\nAnyways, the 5 stars is not because it is the best fish I have ever had, but it is the closest thing I have gotten in the state. The price is higher than other sushi bars in the area, but once you try it, you'll understand why. The quality of fish it top notch and the sushi chefs will even tell you which fish is in season. I first ordered a sake bomber (large beer and small sake) for $6.50. We ordered the Agedashi tofu and mixed veggie tempura. The tofu had a great soft, almost custard like, texture and tasted perfect. The tempura was good, nothing exciting to note. For entree, we got the Chirashi bowl, a spicy yellowtail roll, crazy roll, yellowtail sashimi and albacore sashimi. The chirashi was a very pleasant surprise with the amount of fresh cut fish but what solidified our decision for best sushi in AZ thus far, was the sashimi. The albacor was PERFECT and made me reminisce about the best sushi I had in Seattle, which did taste like clouds in my mouth. The dessert special of the day was crepes and they made my mouth very happy and was a perfect end to the meal.\n\nOverall, with the Yelp Check-in and 10% off our bill, we got out of there for $81 including tax and tip. As a said before, not cheap but not a bad price considering all that was ordered. \n\nNote: if you plan to come here on a Friday, its best to make a reservation because it can get crowded.

Great things come in small packages, and I was excited to see what this charming little place had to offer. The place is clean, classy, and comfortingly familiar if you make a practice of seeking out the smaller guys. \n\nYoung kids behind the sushi bar, which I do my best not to sway my verdict...but does raise the question of experience. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that the twenty something ASU kids are incapable, but the classic sushi chefs are apprenticed for years, and don't even get to touch the fish for the entire first year. They spend that first year learning how to perfect the rice. I raise this point NOT in order to boast about my familiarity with the art of sushi, but because the rice was Shimogamos greatest failing. \n\nThe order: All sushi (nigiri)\n*Mackerel (Saba), Salmon Roe (Ikura), Tuna (Maguro), Eel (Unagi), Albacore (Shiro Maguro), Yellowtail (Hamachi)\n\nThe fish itself in all fairness was cut well, portions are modest and not atypical but the freshness seemed to take a hit on some of the less commonly ordered fish. Mackerel is an extremely \"fishy\" fish and spoils quickly and usually served salt cured and washed in rice vinegar, but this process often leads to over curing it or just letting it hang out for a little longer than it should which seemed to be the case. We usually save the Unagi, a cooked eel, with a sweet teriyaki like sauce for last, it's like a sushi dessert, like the cherry on top, the wonderful last bite to end your meal, this was not the case. The Unagi was dry, old, stringy, and tendon-y...not as hoped. Even the eel sauce failed to cover this up, which lets be honest, is so rich that it often can.. All of this, and the rice. That poor rice, embarrassingly flaunted around in its undercooked, flavorless garb, passed off and billed as sushi rice. This was not sushi rice...this was your college roommate's rice cooker at work, and though the maguro, and shiro maguro cuts of fish were cut just fine (and presumably because of their high order rate, kept fresh) the failing of that rice pulled the rug right out from under them....literally.  It was so undercooked and poorly packed that it fell apart as you gingerly lifted them up with your chopsticks. The irony here is that the fresh fish was great, the minor missteps happened in the details, the cooked or brined fish, and of course the rice. If we had skipped the mackerel and unagi and ordered everything sashimi instead, this could be a glowing 3 or even a 4 star review.\n\nTotal for the order came to $70, plus tip. The company from behind the bar was friendly which always makes this kind of review more difficult. Perhaps the rice was just off that night.

Not giving it 5 starts because it wasn't the best sushi I ever had, but for being so close to my house, I was extremely pleased.\n\nHappy to support a local Mom and Pop restaurant.

I had a good experience there 2 years ago. It was a 4 star sushi restaurant for me that time with good quality of food and service and that's why we went back there for our 3rd wedding anniversary. But our anniversary was totally ruined.\n\nTheir service was terrible, just terrible. The only thing they did right was taking order of our drinks and brought them quick. After that things just went wrong in every way. It was  like we were totally not served. \n\nFor starter, we ordered beer and they only brought the bottle, no glass although other tables got glasses. That was fine. We tried to get a glass but the waiter never came back to us, even to take orders. We couldn't find the waiter for about 10 mins so we decided to order things we could order directly to the chef at the sushi bar we were seating.\n\nThen they forgot to bring 2 out of 8 dishes we ordered including our appetizer. My husband got his dish around 20 mins after ordering and I had to wait another 15 minutes for mine. My husband finished his drink but had to wait for 20 minutes to get another drink. We again waited for 20 mins for just for the bill, etc.. And every time we needed something, we had to wave them as they never come by us. \"Waiting\" is the word that explains our experience at Shimogamo this time. \n\nIt seemed the chefs at the sushi bar and waiter/waitress were confused about orders all the time. They brought at least 3 dishes to wrong tables. We heard someone dropped dish(es) with a big noise in the kitchen.\n\nEven the quality of sushi was not good this time. The fish was totally not fresh and didn't taste almost at all. It's a fast food restaurant quality.\n\nI think this was our worst experience at a restaurant ever. Sometimes we get not-so-good service or they forget our order but I've never seen my husband so disappointed before. He is a sweet person and gives at least 20% tip even if they forget our order but this time, he only left 15% tip. But I understand that after seeing him waiting miserably for his drink for 20 mins trying to get attention from them without success. Yes, we just felt ignored and miserable. A waitress even got to the sushi bar and asked the chef in front of us whether he's thirsty and needed something to drink but my husband was totally left without any drink for too long.\n\nAnd for the first time, I heard my husband saying \"I will never go back to the restaurant.\"", "business_id": "un3KC2gyMrSG6yqjVRctXg", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-06-27", "type": "review"}

And not that trendy americanized sushi that seems so popular these days. I like fresh fish that's not drowning in sauce, which hides its flavor, that is true to Japanese style sushi. The vast majority of sushi places I have tried are americanized. \n\nNot this place. I am so glad I read thru the reviews of this place and that it's only a few miles away from me now.\n\nTucked into the corner of a strip mall, sharing a bathroom with the C-Fu Gourmet, this place is very unassuming looking and simple. We were surprised to show up at 515pm on a Tuesday (they open at 5) and already most tables were filled.\n\nThe decor and ambiance was perfect. Music was a jazzy fusion feel and it was nice and dark colored with light accents. \n\nWe sat in the back room, feeling like mobsters doing a business deal. The center of this room has a huge family style table with a classy beaded drape that could be used as separaters.\n\nOn the wall was a classy sign showing their specials. When I asked our server about it, she explained, without prompting, which fish was freshest and how a couple specials are cooked. Just with that, this place got 5 stars from me and I hadn't even tried their food yet.\n\nSide note for people with dietary restrictions: I have Celiac Disease and I am 100% gluten free so everything I ate or drank is gluten free. See the end of the review for my glowing gluten free/cross contamination review.\n\nI ordered a plum wine that came in a beautiful little glass that forces you to enjoy the wine, not suck it down. In other words, you refill this tiny thing from a carafe that holds the full glass. \n\nI also tried some of my husbands house sake he got with the expectation that it would be the normal bitter taste, like usual, and no. It wasn't bitter at all! It actually had a sweet ending! I was blown away.\n\nWe started with a nice fresh seaweed salad.\n\nWe ordered what was inherently gluten free, staying away from any imitation krab or breaded/fried items.\n\nWe ordered: \n\nAlaska roll - snow crab was used and copper river salmon - smoky, awesome crab with a slightly citrus taste. Not jam packed with a ton of ingredients or sauce. SO AMAZING. Expensive but damn worth it.\n\nSpicy salmon - smoky and spicy\n\nPhilly roll - strong cream cheese but good like that\n\nCitrus roll - very good balance of acidity and spice with a fresh ending\n\nUni was super fresh and creamy. Uni is normally creamy, but this was the ULTIMATE creamy. I don't think I've ever had such fresh uni.\n\nWe ended the evening with green tea ice cream for myself and red bean for the hubs. Excellent as usual.\n\nI have held off on writing this a couple days... I typically go to sushi with the expectation that I likely will get some sort of glutening due to how many places that use non-gluten free soy sauce in their sauce mixes. \n\nI was never glutened at all. No reaction. This could mean 2 things: 1) they use gluten free soy in their mixes or 2) they don't use soy sauce at all in their sauce mixes. I'm betting on that they don't use soy sauce at all and leave it to you to add it when eating if you wish. \n\nAdd all that together... amazing food, amazing ambiance, not getting glutened... I would give this place 10 stars if I could. \n\nTotally worth the cost. Go here if you love sushi.", "business_id": "un3KC2gyMrSG6yqjVRctXg", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-07-25", "type": "review"}

When I asked what one item meant, the man at the counter (the owner?) said the book would help...and handed me a small photo album with photos of quite a few of the menu items. It was funny and effective.\n\nI was surprised how busy the place is. While I was deciding what to order (3-4 minutes), the phone rang at least three times for take-out. In the half-hour I was in the dining area, at least 15 people picked up orders or sat down for a meal. It appears that they have a strong following, well-earned if the food I had was typical.\n\nI ordered a small shrimp yakisoba and a soda.

This is my favorite restaurant. They have the best Orange Chicken and Orange Beef in town and in my opinion the world. I have eaten in Los Angeles's China town and China Town's restaurants can't compete. When I order the Orange Chicken I substitute the white rice underneath for noodles. Its like having Orange Chicken on top of chow mien just with no vegetables. I'm sure they will add veggies if you request them. When I order their Orange Beef which is basically the same thing as Orange Chicken except its with beef, duh. A previous reviewer stated that the Orange Beef is enough the earn this place a 5 and he is 100% correct, it is amazing. The beef is breaded and is deliciously tender. When I order the Orange Beef I sometimes substitute the white rice for egg fried rice or noodles. The orange sauce is a huge part of the reason why they have the best Orange Chicken and Beef in the world. I have also eaten Tokyo House's chicken egg rolls, crab puffs, terayaki chicken, house chicken, house beef, sweet and sour pork, sweet and sour chicken, shrimp yakisoba. Tokyo House has never disappointed out of the more than 100 times I have visited in the past year. The employees are great, especially Foo the cashier.

Took half of our large size orders home.  Teriyaki Chicken had a great crispiness/smokiness to it.  The hot sauce or chili oil they have adds a lot of flavor but is quite mild on the hot category, it was quite good too.\n\nTo the infamous gentleman taking the order:  I read the reviews and saw he came highly regarded.  Even warned my gf that people love this guy so we were expecting a large personality.  This guy is a charmer.  Really makes you feel at home.  Everyone is all smiles when ordering.  Doesn't hurt that he is delivering tasty food also.\n\nPricing is very affordable.  It was $20 for us with our 2 large entrees, a drink and the appetizer.  Would be under $15 with just the meals.  \n\nThe whole experience was awesome.

Lately when I've been on that side of town and wanted sushi, I'd go to Temari, remembering how good it used to be.\n\nNot anymore -- I made excuses for their decline in standards.\n\nI'm not sure if that sushi chef was being trained, etc, but the rolls were a bit off -- they fell apart easily and the fish just didn't taste as fresh as I remember it being. The rice for the sushi tended to fall apart far too easily -- that was pissing me off. I had more rice in my soy sauce dipping bowl than on the actual sushi roll itself. Yea, I was pretty peeved, but that was nothing compared to what had happened minutes before...\n\nTheir sushi menu is a bit confusing as well. I am used to a menu where you can check things off on the left hand side of the column, not the far right. I made the mistake of checking the box off to the left, thinking I was ordering california rolls and an eel roll. Imagine my surprise when sashimi arrived instead of nigiri.\n\nThey charged me for my mistake. It was an honest mistake and frankly, I love sashimi, but I've recently had a bad experience with sashimi in California that left me feeling like I was hovering close to death...I was in zero mood for raw fish. What should have cost me about $18 in sushi ended up being $30 for my mistake...lunch there used to cost me somewhere between $15-$20, including tip. When all was said and done, the bill was $42 for 2 people...and my cousin hadn't even ordered sushi!\n\nMy cousin had ordered the chicken teriyaki which she said tasted like they had just straight out added corn flour to soy sauce. She said she'd never had a bigger salt lick in her life. The chicken was overcooked and the only thing I *think* she enjoyed was the salad on her plate...oh and the rice that came with the meal.\n\nThe end of the meal came with complimentary ice cream -- as if that could make me think about coming back here again.\n\nThe service was fine, but I found the tables a bit sticky...like they didn't wipe it down well enough.

The fish is unbelievable fresh, the service is wonderful and the sushi rolls are unlike anything you'll see anywhere else.\n\nOK, granted, the place is a bit of a hole in the wall. There's not much seating, it's tucked back into a strip mall, some of the staff barely speak English and it's not going to win any interior design awards. However, if you're looking for great sushi in the East Valley, you simply must try Temari.\n\nSaki is the owner and head sushi chef. He is usually accompanied by Danny, who I can only imagine is his protege. They churn out wonderfully delectable sushi rolls, nigiri and sashimi. The thing I really love about this place is the creativity of the ingredients and combinations of some of the rolls. Sure, you can get the standard California, Spicy Tuna, Rainbow and Caterpillar rolls, but for more adventurous fare, try the All-star roll, or the Primo roll, or the Saki roll. You will be greeted with ingredients such as deep-friend green chili, asparagus, red onion, a variety of sweet and savory sauces--even black pepper and bacon in some cases!\n\nI would highly recommend the tuna poke if you're a Maguro tuna lover. This is a really unique dish that you won't find at many other places.\n\nAt the end of your experience, you get a small scoop of strawberry ice cream and a Fortune Cookie with the check. A nice touch that I think is meant to take the edge off the bill (even though the prices are quite reasonable, especially compared to the Blue Wasabi's and Ra's of the world).\n\nIf you have a large party, I would call ahead to see how busy they are. As I mentioned, the place is small, so you might have to make a reservation or be prepared to wait (it's worth the wait though, trust me).\n\nTo sum up, if you want overpriced rolls with soggy rice and stale tuna, but served by good-looking people in a shi shi environment with techno bumping, try Ra. If you want phenomenal sushi and great service in a more humble setting, Temari simply can't be beat.", "business_id": "Er20nsiOS6TFHmAE717iTA", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-06-03", "type": "review"}

The lobster roll and calamari both came out to be around 15 bucks all together. They also serve you a free scoop of ice cream before they give you the check.

Then maybe they add something to it. Seriously. \nThe green paste wasabi was very weak. I had to use a full teaspoon to feel any heat. The spicy salmon on top of the California roll (oops I mean Alaskan roll) was MINCED. I kid you not. They did not lay some fresh cut salmon on the roll, it was reformed into a salmon chunk from chopped up salmon. BLINK. \nWhat saves Sakana a bit is they had a nice chicken cutlet appetizer, thin, juicy, nice panko. Great for my child who isn't a sushi monster. I saw a salad go by that looked nice. It did get a lot of business, but I suspect it is from people who like very americanized items, in particular the crab salad you can buy at any grocery store. \nThere were plenty of kids there, so if you want to introduce sushi to a child or someone, this might be a good place.

It stands out among the other sushi offerings in the valley because it has, in my opinion,\n\n- The most generous sushi portions you can find in Scottsdale and the Valley. The cuts are amazing, fresh, and expertly prepared. You get incredibly fresh fish, prepared with care. It is the freshest, loveliest fish you can imagine.\n\n- Really, really good rice, all the time. Sushi rice is tricky. Sakana's rice is just sticky enough to be cohesive, but each grain is distinct from its neighbor, sitting like little oblong pearls. Sakana's rolls are wrapped rice-side out, which I feel makes it a much lovelier experience than rice-side in, as the outer rice is not unnecessarily compressed. \n\n- Lovely service, at the bar and at the table. I see the same core staff and smiling faces that have been there for several years, and they are happy. You can't fake happy for that long! Even though the restaurant is usually full, the wait for a table is never excessive and, once you're seated, the service is prompt and friendly.\n\n- Good prices. You'll spend 25% less on sushi / sashimi and 40% less on beer and sake here than you will at Stingray, Sushi Brokers, Sapporo, and most other sushi places around. It's actually a great bargain for the quality you get - and that is just the regular menu. I also enjoy the Happy Hour roll specials on weekdays, as well as the $1.50 appetizer add-on to an order of Kirin beer. Ask for your \"I Love Sakana\" card to take advantage of the loyalty program.

It isn't often that you find a high-quality sushi place for a cheap price. But Sakana is it. They have a large menu with tons of selections- cooked and raw- that everyone in your party would be sure to love! If you have guests that aren't fish/sushi eaters, they have some teriyaki dishes, salads, and miso soup, which is really good!\n\nThe first time my boyfriend and I came here, we ordered from the happy hour menu, which is really valid from open-close with the exception of on the weekends. The waitress brought us each a complimentary bowl of miso soup, which was a nice touch! \n\nThey have a pretty decent variety on their happy hour menu, ranging from simple California rolls to Las Vegas rolls and other deep-fried, artistic creations. Thinking that the happy hour rolls were going be super small (being that the highest price on the menu was $5/$6) we initially ordered 8 rolls. When our waitress picked up our order card, she was kind enough to tell us that the happy hour rolls are quite large and that 8 was way too much! So, we took her advice and cut our order in half. I was a little skeptical of whether or not the rolls were really small or not, but to my surprise they came out and were HUGE! Each roll comes with about 6 pieces, but the pieces are thicker and larger in diameter than your average sushi rolls! \n\nThe sushi is of obvious fresh quality. The ingredients as well are fresh. It's the worst when you get rolls that have brown avocado or mushy cucumber inside.. ick! The sushi is also really nicely presented. Our four rolls came out on a nice wooden cutting board. \n\nThe second and third times we came here we ordered the lunch special and the sashimi deluxe. OH. MY. GOSH. I've never in my life seen such value! The lunch special comes with 6 pieces of California rolls, 2 jalapeno boats (jalapeno deep fried and stuffed with crab) and 6 pieces of nigiri. Not to mention it was delicious-- all for $10.95. The sashimi deluxe was even better. You get 12 FAT and LARGE pieces of fresh sashimi for $12.95!!! The best of the trio is the white tuna. I really have never had a piece of sashimi so good that literally you don't want to eat it because if you did that would mean you wouldn't have any left. \n\nService is average, food is AMAZING.
