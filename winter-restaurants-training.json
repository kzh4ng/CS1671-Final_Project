I noticed that this place opens really early (6am) on weekdays so I had thought it would be a nice idea to get down to the Dor-Stop on our way out of Pittsburgh.\n\nI was able to find parking on the street and the meters don't take effect until after 8am.  We had arrived around 7:35 so I figured we'd have enough time before I had to feed the meter.\n\nThere was only 2 other customers at the bar when we arrived.  We had our choice of seating and we had chosen to sit near the window.  Coffee up and ordered and our server was back consistently to make sure our coffees were filled.  On the table we noticed they had non dairy creamer and since both my wife and I aren't fans of non dairy creamer we had asked if we could have a small serving of milk and our server brought that over right away.\n\nBeing our first time I had to go through the menu to see what I was wanting.  I didn't want to eat too much since I had to drive back home but I did find something of interest.  My wife usually gets steak and eggs but she didn't this time.  I had sort of wanted her to get that so I could have some steak but she went with the ham and eggs with German potato pancakes and white toast.  \n\nI had gone with the all American which was 1/3lb burger, eggs, and lyonese potatoes which is basically homefries with onions with toast.  I also ordered a side of bacon.  I noticed the side of bacon was 3.10 which is kind of a lot but they gave me probably 6 slices or more.  I'm used to only getting 3 or 4 slices usually.  \n\nWe didn't order anything that they could impress us with I suppose.  It's not like we went with an item like hotcakes or a skillet or anything like that just a relatively conservative breakfast.  I did have some of my wife's potato pancakes and ham and they were both very good.

The hostess that had little to nothing to say prior or during our seating?  Or do I skip right to the waiter?  For those of you who have lack of taste, enjoy employees at a restaurant that seem they could not care less about their job, or even enjoy sushi not made the correct way,  Even if you love establishments that hire employees that seem to not care for quality of food or knowledge of food.  I HIGHLY suggest you go here.\nWhen we arrived at this location (which opened up 15 minutes prior to us getting there) we noticed a few individuals already sitting at their tables enjoying themselves, so we figured we'd be sat right away.  Instead we were then informed by the hostess to please wait for a few minutes because they were getting our table ready.  Ready for what?  We weren't even asked how many individuals would be dining nor if we wanted Hibachi or the sushi bar.  After we found a seat by ourselves we awaited approximately for about 10 minutes for a waiter to give us our menus.  After receiving our menus from our mute friendly waiter we were asked if we were ready to place our order.  Our starters consisted of Spicy Seafood soup, Edimame, and Shrimp Tempura.  After a few more minutes we decided we wanted to enjoy Sushi for lunch and so we placed our order to the waiter and asked if our starters were about ready in which he replied yes they should be out shortly.  Instead 2 of our 4 Sushi orders come out followed by Edimame and then followed by the Shrimp Tempura 5 minutes after that.  We then proceeded to ask about the soup and rest of our Sushi order, we were informed the soup takes a very long time and that the Sushi was being made still.  (we understood why the Sushi may take a little more time due to what we ordered)  The Edimame was very delicious, but the Shrimp Tempura had me baffled at what we had ordered and why the cost was $8 for the very small portioned flavorless Tempura, which included I'm assuming a thousand island dressing for some reason?  It was definitely not your normal Tempura sauce in which we've enjoyed many times before in other Benihana locations.  As we get our 2nd batch of Sushi our soup was still NOT ready.  Is this a lack of service, food staff, or poor kitchen management with untrained so called \"Chefs\"?  We decided it was best to simply cancel the soup in which then we were coincidentally informed the soup was ready and if we still wanted it.  During this whole ordeal, we had not seen our original waiter since we had placed our orders and instead had 2 other employees that had no clue what we ordered and had to run back and forth asking what we had and what we were waiting for still.  I wouldn't have minded being informed our original waiter was busy and they were going to take over for him, had our order been alright, or even if had our food been tasty.  The Tempura was horrible, the Sushi was questionable, and the service was beyond ridiculous.  If you're wondering what was so bad about the Sushi, I'll make it simple for you.  Looks and taste both scored a 3 out of 10.  Lack of knowledge of the Sushi from the employees should of been a red flag to us from the get go, instead we took a chance.  We love Benihanas, but never again at this location.  From our experience with Hibachi type establishments we've always encountered great personalities, great service, and tasty food that left us wanting to come back for that experience.  Instead we left with a sour taste in our mouths and with about $60 less in our pockets.", "business_id": "1vQLTKwmcmZXtNzfKEvMmA", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-02-15", "type": "review"}

Yelp said it was on smithfield near 4th but It must have closed because all we found was a 7/11 and subway. We found Zorba's on the corner and considering how cold it was neither of us felt like walking to search for food.  \n\nWe stumbled in here after reading the outdoor menu mentioning specials. The hubby  ordered the buffalo chicken salad which is the special on Wednesdays. I went with the gyro salad which came with a side of pita bread. The hubby's salad was huge, topped with fries and plenty of chicken, not to mention lettuce. He choose balsamic dressing which I thought was weird but he enjoyed it. The fries were great, nice and hot while the chicken was mildly spicy but a little bit dry.\n\nMy salad was just as big but it was mostly lettuce. At first I thought they were a little scant on the lamb meat but  almost like the loaves of bread that Jesus fed to the hungry, it just kept showing up. I was a little disappointed at the quality of lettuce. I hate those big crunchy chunks that you find close the root, they are so bitter no matter how much dressing you use. \n\nSo the reason I give this place only 3 stars is because of my salad. Crunchy bitter lettuce, gyro meat was a luke warm instead of hot which after 5 minutes made it cold because of the chilled dressing. Not to mention the dressing was rather bland and they didn't add enough to my huge salad so i ended up ordering more which cost 75 cents. The fact that I had to order more dressing even though it had little to no flavor was disappointing. \n\nThere is enough seating in here but just some simple tables and chairs spread out, nothing fancy or worth taking pictures for. It's almost like a cheap cafeteria which I don't mind if the foods good but I wasn't impressed with my gyro meat or with the chicken on the salad.

Don't get me wrong: the food is good, the service is great, and if you're already in the Bloomfield area, it's a fine choice for dinner.  But, there are a few unfortunate and glaring errors that prevent Taste of India from being much more than an average-level restaurant.\n\nFirst and foremost, I've tried just about everything I can imagine, and I can't seem to get Taste of India to actually serve me *spicy* food.  I'm a huge fan of vindaloo, which is often the spiciest item on an Indian menu (at least in the United States), but at Taste of India, it's about as spicy as a can of Chef Boyardee Ravioli.  I've tried asking for a spicy level of 11 on a scale of one to ten.  I've tried asking for \"traditional Indian\" heat.  No dice.  Chef Boyardee Vindaloo, every time.\n\nAnother problem is the take-out ordering process.  My wife and I have ordered take-out a couple times recently, and each time, we placed two orders for naan and only received one.  Since we live in Point Breeze, going back to the restaurant for $3 worth of naan isn't worth the effort, but really, we should have just received the naan in the first place.\n\nGiven these issues, why do we keep going back to Taste of India?  Simple: the biryani and korma are the best dishes this side of Stanwix Street.

Overall, I've been pleased with most of their products, the prices, and the customer service and atmosphere, hence the 4-star rating.\n\nAs others have mentioned, the space is rather cramped and chaotic, esp. during peak business hours (e.g., Sat. around noon, when I last stopped in).  The layout when you walk in is a bit strange, to the point that I inadvertently ended up behind the counter on my first visit.  (Stay to the left and you won't have this problem.)  The most crowded section of the store is the deli counter, where you can obtain not only meats and cheeses, but a variety of made-to-order sandwiches and sides.  If you visit the deli counter during peak hours and are feeling indecisive, take a number right away--trust me, you'll have plenty of time to decide what to get as others are being helped.\n\nAs for the grocery products, there is enough variety that you can find several versions of most Italian ingredients you'll need here, as well as other general grocery items like milk and ice cream. In general, prices are very reasonable-- generally less expensive than Groceria Italiana.  Unlike Groceria Italiana, a good portion of the product consists of commercially-available brands--albeit many that you wouldn't encounter in a mainstream grocery store like Giant Eagle. Having said that, the main attraction for me is the made-in-house items, such as the fresh pasta, the sauces, and the biscotti, as well as the hot meals.\n\nIn the interest of brevity, here is a list of products I've bought at Donatelli's, followed by price, recommendation, and comments:\n\nGrandma's plain sauce ($3.65): Recommended--Better flavor and seasoning than commercial jarred sauces (e.g., Ragu, etc.)  Also, I like that Donatelli's makes meatless red sauce, unlike Groceria Italiana, since I don't eat beef.\n\nLobster ravioli ($9.99): Not recommended--After following boiling directions (necessary to avoid curdling cream sauce via baking), pasta was good, but filling was mushy.  Also, included imitation crabmeat, and I'm not a fan of imitation foods.  I'll be sticking to Groceria Italiana's handmade ravioli from now on.\n\nRicotta pie ($5.49): Recommended--Though this was my first time trying it, I was favorably impressed with the flavor and texture.\n\nBiscotti ($3.52): Recommended--I've only had the spumoni biscotti (a flavor I haven't seen elsewhere), but it tasted fresh and was good.\n\nItalian bread ($1.50): Recommended--Soft and fresh, and inexpensive\n\nHot food from deli counter: Recommended--I had the half pound fish sandwich ($2.49) and a half pound of the white cheddar bake ($2.99), and both were very good.  Notably, the roll was proportional to the fish, so the sandwich didn't fall apart, as is common at other PGH eateries serving fish sandwiches.\n\nDespite how hectic Donatelli's can be during peak hours, I've been impressed at the friendly service that I've received at the deli counter and checkout.  If there's one drawback, it's that waits at both counters are inevitable during these times.  Of course, if your schedule permits, this problem can be avoided by simply visiting at non-peak times.\n\nWhile Donatelli's may feel kind of cramped and may not seem as immaculately clean as some big box grocery stores (at least for the section the customer sees), this is part of its charm as a neighborhood ethnic grocery store.  I'll definitely continue stopping in for certain Italian grocery items, such as the plain sauce, biscotti, and bread, as well as for inexpensive, delicious hot lunch items.", "business_id": "KH6stvNdq_aV0HvKw8P5yA", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-02-02", "type": "review"}

You open the box and that's what it looks like. Just thrown together with no care at all. I love cheese but the amount of cheese they put on is ridiculous. I guess they do this to cover the taste of the non existing crust. This pizza felt like I was eating a pound of cheese mixed with sauce. The pizza is a 1.5 stars max. \nThe Italian sausage I really enjoyed. Again way to much cheese. Seriously, what's the deal with all the freaking cheese! Anyways the sausage  had a great texture and taste to it. Just the right amount of peppers and the hoagie was soft and had a great feel to it. I give it a 4. \nI may give the pizza another try.

On a positive note it was clear that everyone was enjoying their time and the food that we saw being ordered looked terrific.  \nThe menu is simple consisting of a limited number of rustic pasta dishes as well as daily specials. We ordered an appetizer of beans and greens with homemade sausage which was very popular as everyone else around us also was ordering it. For good reason as it was absolutely delicious. For entrees I ordered Gnocchi, which were light and fluffy and came in a delicious tomato sauce with bits of fresh mozzarella cheese infused through it.  Simple,  but really good,  one of the better pasta dishes I have had in a restaurant in some time.  My wife ordered a filet mignon special.  The steak was cooked to order and was nice and juicy, but a little under seasoned according to my wife. It sat on a base of truffle infused mashed potatoes and was topped with roasted portobello mushrooms. Delicious at $35. Entrees come with a  house Salad,  dressed with a simple Italian dressing.

Service was attentive but not intrusive and kept the evening moving along.\n\nWe enjoyed cocktails in the small bar area and it felt like a private club.  Deanna answered questions knowledgably and provided great suggestions when requested.\n\nDinner was served (and the entire room reserved for us) in the space used for breakfast - but you'd never have known it from the feel.  It was candlelit and intimate without being close and claustrophobic.  Can't wait for next year when we have enough people to take over the intimate dining room!\n\nWhere do I begin with the food?  Creative, unique menu that I've never seen anywhere else in Charlotte.  Heavily focused on meat, chicken and seafood (sorry, my vegetarian friends) and all executed to perfection.  My personal favorite - the Krispy Kreme Bread Pudding for dessert.\n\nI highly recommend this restaurant for both the food and for the service.

The fire-roasted tomato soup is also a great option.\n\nAbove all, what stands out to me about the Cotswold location is their customer service. I always enjoy stopping in here.

Despite it being a Sunday morning with a line forming behind me, the girl behind the counter happily sliced the bagels for me, while I picked out delicious cream cheese from their large selection. (The willingness to slice bagels cannot be said for another S CLT bagel location, but I'll review them separately. However, the Bruegger's positive attitude confirmed this is the bagel place for me.)\n\nTo clarify what some other reviews have said, this Cotswold location is NOT attached to a Caribou.

And for the prices charged, this is as it should be.  My only complaint is the hostess took a phone call that apparently involved a complicated reservation and we were left standing for several minutes without a greeting or other recognition.  A small point, but couldn't the caller have been put on hold till we were whisked off to our own reservation?\n\nI got to try a couple of different cheese dips, broths and meats for the main course, and no less than 4 different types of chocolate fondue.  All came with plenty of accompanying items to drop into the fondues.  Vegetables were basic: broccoli, cauliflower and carrots.  Apples and grapes were a nice twist.  With the chocolate we had fresh bananas and strawberries that were a bit less fresh.  We also had squares of poundcake and rice crispy treats.  They brought more of what was popular, as much as we asked for.  No one should suffer for a lack of food here.\n\nMy issue really centers around the meats.  We had an endless deal, so I got to try a lot of different things, but here's the way it generally works: you get a meat (sometimes pre-seasoned) and cook it in a broth or an oil.  That broth may have a plain base of might be flavored with another set of seasonings. Once done, you put your meat on a small plate that has room for up to 6 different dipping sauces, all with another set of seasonings.  That's up to 3 different seasonings in the finished project.  Muddled and confusing?  Yeah, to say the least.  Can you narrow it down?  Of course, but that's hardly discouraged at the time you order.\n\nI like the concept, especially if you have a long time to sit down for dinner.  Our complete dinner lasted just over 3 hours.  It makes for great conversation with a small group.  However, when paying a minimum of $30 a head for dinner I'd like to think I'm paying for a chef's skill and training in producing good food.  Here you get all the basic building blocks and do the final work yourself.  I know it's novel, and some folks get excited for the change, but it's a off-putting to me.  If that's what you go for, however, this location will give you the full experience and make sure you are comfortable and served with care.  I'd easily go back for dessert, and maybe that alone.", "business_id": "uDoTFFud2mXE3VT1Jt9L5A", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-12-11", "type": "review"}

Went there for my final meal of 2010 and what a culinary treat!  The restaurant was quite busy on New Year's Eve; however, hostess and wait staff was accommodating and attentive.  \n\nA special holiday menu was provided, and I dined on Agnello Farcito - leg of lamb stuffed with Romano cheese and fresh parsley, gently braised in rich tomato sauce with olive oil mashed potatoes and braised black kale.  The lamb was very tender, sliced from the bone, rolled, and stuffed... what's not to like with that presentation?  I substituted Fontina risotto for the olive oil mashed potatoes... perfectly cooked, creamy, and just-enough cheesy.  And, I also opted for the asparagus over the braised black kale... wise choice on my part!  Portion was decent and filling enough that I took one of the lamb rolls home in order to save room for dessert!  And, while I had heard tall mouthwatering tales of their bread pudding, I ordered the Oreo Pie instead since it was only available that night for the special menu, and since plans of a return visit during 2011 were already dancing in my head!

The pastry chef should make it into heaven based on this creation alone... thick Oreo cookie crumb layer topped with cheesecake layer, chocolate ganache, sponge cake layer, more ganache, and caramel.

And Baoding is just about exactly opposite one of the entry drives, which makes it hard to get around cars parked in front.\n\nWe went for lunch.  Interior was warm, to the dark side of light, but cozy and pleasant.  Menu had all the standard meals and we ordered quite a variety, all of which were good.  \n\nMy best take-away experience was that the kitchen will cook to order if you have something you have had overseas or would like a certain dish cooked differently, no problem.\n\nIn my many travels throughout Asia I spent a lot of time in Kuala Lumpur (KL) my favorite breakfast was Bee Hoon, the small rice/glass noodles stir fried with shrimp, squid, and lots of other stuff.  Very yummy.  Problem has been that Chinese/Asian restaurants in the Charlotte area only serve Singapore Noodles, which are Bee Hoon style, but always, to my disappointment, cooked with curry powder.\n\nAt last, Baoding understood what I wanted and even offered another way to prepare this dish with a white rather than a brown sauce.  The waitress knew exactly what I wanted but checked with the chef, who also joined our table discussion and out came a wonderful pile of Bee Hoon in white sauce.  The waitress assured me that if I did not like it that they would replace it.\n\nI did and was, and continue to be, happy with my Bee Hoon.\n\nAnd I appreciate how Baoding takes special orders in stride.

It was near my best friend's home, and a huge group of us went one day. I wasn't an adventurous eater then, so I ordered something that looked pretty tame. I had the nacho cheese burritos, with chicken. That was in 2001 and for the past 12 years I have ordered the same thing every time I visit. \n\nThere is a short list of \"must visit\" places every time we go home, and Miguel's is #1 on that list. When you pull into their gravel parking lot, look past the outside of the building and it's location. When you get inside, look past the decor & the cracked, red vinyl booths. Take a seat (there is no host/hostess, just sit where you want), dive in to the chips and salsa (I could eat their salsa with a spoon!) and get ready to enjoy a truly delicious meal. \n\nThis visit Graham & I both began our meal with a margarita. We were heading to a movie after dinner, so I got a small one. If you're not going to sit through a three hour, really depressing musical (Les Miserables... really good, though) order a pitcher. They had them on special that night and it the pitcher was cheaper than what we spent on the drinks we ordered. Graham thought his was weak, and ordered an extra shot of tequila, I thought mine was perfect. \n\nWe devoured two baskets of chips and salsa while waiting for our meal. Finally, it arrived. We were starving, and of course this was the one time that the service was slow. But our food came out and it was worth the wait. I know the burritos don't look like much... but oh baby.\n\nThe cheese sauce is absolutely delicious, and the inside of the burrito is stuffed with huge chunks of chicken, bell peppers, tomatoes & onions. Every single bite is delicious. I was craving some black beans too, so I ordered a dish on the side. Black beans are usually pretty bland at most restaurants, and these were too. But a spoonful of the delicious salsa and some salt worked wonders. \n\nGraham is a little more diverse in his meal selections than I am. I find something I like, and I tend to stick with it. He typically gets something different each time. This time he ordered the Enchiladas De Chorizo. This was excellent. The chorizo was perfectly cooked and really flavorful. \n\nMiguel's is truly on my list of my favorite restaurants of all time. The food is delicious, the service is quick and the staff is always pleasant. The same people have worked there forever, and back when I still lived in Charlotte and ate there every week, my server would bring me a sweet tea without even asking. And the price absolutely can not be beat. Dinner, margaritas & tip cost us about $42. \n\nThree enchiladas filled with Mexican sausage, covered with shredded cheddar cheese & green sauce. Served with rice, lettuce & pico de gallo.", "business_id": "p_HFt0I92MHDNPWvdtyEBA", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-01-11", "type": "review"}

His straight man of 1000 voices sidekick, Larry Sprinkle, is still doing weather at WCNC TV.\n\nAnyway, Murphy MADE Bojangles a success here. You couldn't hear his Bojangles spots without wanting their coffee and their buttermilk biscuits, their dirty rice and their cajun-spiced fried chicken. One mention, and I'd be heading that way... drooling on my tie.\n\nBojangles is our local phenomenon, started in a little restaurant in South Charlotte. If you're a visitor, this is our contribution to fast-food-chain America. Try it; it's a guilty pleasure. It's not good for your cholesterol level or your waistline, but it tastes like pure comfort.\n\nMost locations are great. Don't miss the buttermilk biscuits!

Both times the waitstaff has been professional, helpful, and speedy.  The music is at an appropriate level, the atmosphere is cozy, the decor tasteful.  The wine list is extensive, and many dishes on the menu seem appetizing and imaginative at first glance.  With all of these elements going for it, I have high expectations for the food.  Although some of it is delicious, some significant problems have arisen when I've dined there.\n\nI have had both the bruschetta and the mussels as appetizers.  The bruschetta portion was a bit smaller than I expected, but it packs a large amount of flavor into the bites.  The tomatoes tasted fresh and sweet, and balanced well against the (presumably) homemade pesto.  The fresh bread served at the table is similarly warm, with a crisp crust and toothsome interior.  The mussels are flavorful and delicious, but they don't come with any bread to sop up the flavorful broth that remains after the mussels have been eaten.  Our plate was whisked away before we had a chance to ask for any bread to go with the sauce.\n\nTwo of my companions ordered the Ravioli al Vin Santo; both liked and finished the dish.  It is one of four vegetarian options (the Fettucini alla Putenesca does not list meat, but I've never heard of a putanesca sauce made without anchovies), which was a welcome surprise for the vegetarian with whom I dined.  One companion ordered the Insalata di Caesare (which also has unlisted anchovies in the dressing), and found it flavorful, if unimaginative.  A fourth companion ordered the Lasagna del Giorno (that day it was with roasted chicken), and savored every bite.  A fifth companion ordered the Fettucini alla Putenesca, of which I tried a bite.  The spinach fettucini was fresh and delicious, and the sauce was perfectly salty.  My entree, the Campenelli il Diavolillo, was pretty awful.  The combination of meat and seafood in a dish can be done artfully, but this felt like a clumsy mishmash of shrimp, chicken, and Italian sausage.  The sausage was very sweet and seemed to lack enough oregano, basil, and garlic.  It clashed notably with the rest of the dish.  The shrimp and chicken were both cooked well, and were tender and juicy.  The pasta was fresh and tasty.  It was really a shame that the \"spicy garlic broth\" as described by the menu translated into nearly an inch of oil at the bottom of the dish, making the entire dish almost inedible.  All portions were huge.\n\nThe desserts are delicious.  The tiramisu, which I sampled on my first visit, is fluffy and sweet.  I tried to order it on my return visit, but the waitress told me she had sold the last piece to a table that came in after us.  Since we arrived at 5 p.m., this came as quite a shock.  It seems unlikely that they started the evening's service with more than one piece of tiramisu, and seems like profoundly poor planning.  The bread pudding, while not much to look at, is also delicious, though it is so rich that by the time we finished one portion (between three people) it almost felt like i was eating a stick of butter rolled in cinnamon.\n\nI can't say I'll be back anytime soon.  I have to disagree with Zenide R.'s assertion that it's \"easily the best Italian food in the Madison area.\"  For the price, both Lombardino's and Tutto Pasta make better Italian food, and I shall stick to those restaurants in the future.", "business_id": "q8fD82us6uuGufvI44NoAg", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-12-14", "type": "review"}

The place was busy, there seemed to be a short wait for tables. Luckily two people had just gotten up from the bar so we were able to snag 2 bar seats without waiting. And boy, were we lucky, because the bartenders here are FANTASTIC. Incredibly knowledgeable and engaging, they make great traditional Brandy Old Fashioneds. They also have some of their own infusions that they do, like a honey chai infused bourbon (also great as the base of an old fashioned). \n\nThe food came out relatively quickly. It is a pretty standard fish fry menu. You can have either Cod or Walleye, breaded or fried. I had the fried cod, and it was definitely worth the trip to the near east side. Light, not overpowering batter, and thick pieces of cod. Fries were pretty standard, but the house-made cole slaw was a nice touch as well. \n\nAll in all, classic Wisconsin Fish Fry experience. Really cool little place, great staff, good food, and great drinks. They also told me they are opening a Speakeasy right next door, which is really exciting. They do a lot of their own infusions so I can't wait to see what drinks they come up with for this new venture. \n\nNot quite sure it was good enough to unseat Quivey's Grove at the \"Tip Top\" of my fish fry list, but it came darn close (horrible joke free of charge).", "business_id": "JJFoeKZXgi2_LeECDMkkoQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-02-10", "type": "review"}

I'd probably rate it at 3.5 stars if I could so that my scores relative to this one would make more sense overall.  But I digress....\n\nI ordered the ribs and a brisket sandwich with the spicy corn and the baked beans for dinner about two weeks ago.\n\nThe verdicts:\n\nRibs = VERY well done.  Tender, pull-off-the-bone and delicious.  The sauce is where you get the refinement too (beyond the smoking process of course, which is an art in itself).  There are a lot of flavors going on in the sauce and it's not overdone in terms of application.  I've eaten BBQ everywhere and this place's ribs stand up with anyone's.\n\nBrisket Sandwich = Boring.  I was told what I was ordering, so kudos to the service because they were dead on.  It was less of a sandwich and more of brisket on a plain roll.  That's fine of course, but for some reason I feel like sandwich doesn't describe this well.  It does remind me of the bare minimum approach you find in many BBQ joints around, but I don't like it there either.  Anyway, the brisket was very tasty and you should just order it on its own.  No point in getting a piece of bread that just hides the taste of good BBQ.\n\nSpicy Corn = Awesome.  Truly delicious stuff, and I plowed through it in 30 seconds.  Perfect amount of spice too.  Wish I had a little more in that serving, but it will bring me back...soooo mission accomplished?\n\nBaked Beans = Awesome.  I asked if they were made in house, I was told that they were and my palate was rewarded with some of the finest baked beans one can find.  Thick, almost pasty (in a good way) and chock full of flavor.\n\nThe only downfalls would be that it's somewhat pricey for what you get, but food is going up everywhere.  I also ordered a sandwich combo, which was a mistake.  \n\nThe service was top notch.  Everything and more was explained to me in detail.  I only have myself to blame for trying that damn sandwich combo.  Please take it off of the menu...your customers are getting punished for ordering it and it takes away from what you do best.\n\nThe decor is nice and very 'southern' in the sense that this is without a doubt a BBQ place.  I liked looking over all of the trophies and reading the articles and seeing the old pictures.  Very cool stuff.\n\nI got mine to go as well, which was quickly brought out to me.

I had been to the old Cafe Luna when it was on Green St. in my college days.  Anyway, walked it, loved the decor!  We stood by the end of the bar waiting for like 5 minutes, someone came over and said someone would be over to help us.  Then we waited awkwardly for about 5 more minutes.  The same girl came over and was like, do you have a reservation?  We did not so she offered up the bar to have a drink and when a table opened we could sit.  We decided we were just going to eat and drink at the bar.  We got a bottle of chardonnay...it was pretty good and was glad that they knew that it was not oak-y.  We ordered a salad, melting brie pot and lobster & crab stuffed prawns.  Well, the salad was pretty good..but how can you mess up salad.  The melting pot brie....DISAPPOINTMENT!  I was expecting some sort of fondue or something...well it was little potatoes that were halved and spooned out, filled with brie that was melted.  I guess I should have asked but I thought that the name was self sufficient...WRONG.  The potato totally overpowered the brie and you could barely taste it.  I must admit, when I eat brie, I want to EAT brie...I like lots of it.  So I guess that was a bad selection.  Then the \"prawns\" came out....well it wasnt prawns at all.  It was one very small, what looked like, a crab cake, slathered in guacamole....weird....so we took a bite and were pretty confused so we asked about it because it said stuffed prawns on the menu...well, it so happens that they messed up the order and gave us the crabcake topped with wasabi guac...or something like that.  Their fault so they said they would bring the prawns right out....except the bartender came back from the kitchen and said that they were out of prawns but they could do it with regular shrimp.  We said fine.  They came out (four of them), not stuffed at all.  It literally looked like sauteed shrimp with a touch of crab meat around the edge...unimpressed.

Unfortunately nothing has changed since the good old days and I feel there are some definitely in need. We were greeted with the typical tepid response from mama Manzella once she realized we were there and taken to our table with little more than a word offered. My wife an I ordered our meals, veal parm for me and fettuccini alfredo for her. The salad that came with our entree's were swimming in water (I can assume it wasn't the dressing that was that watery) that they apparently forgot to wring out of the lettuce. There were a few raw onion rings and a roma tomato slice or two scattered on top of of a haphazardly put together bed of iceberg lettuce. The entree's came with little fanfare, my wife reported that her alfredo was on the low end of quality from what she has had in other establishments and my veal was tough and smothered in cheese which pretty much masked any other flavor lying beneath it. The spaghettini that I got as a side seemed to be covered in some sort of jarred sauce (Prego, Ragu?). There was tons of pasta on the side, more than I could ever consider finishing and the veal was borderline too much. I would think with the prices they charge, they could up the quality and cut on the portions and make it a trade off monetarily.  All in all I don't know what we will ever go back. I really want to like this place and I would REALLY like to support a local town staple but I'm not going to pay good money for that. Sometimes it's good to reinvent oneself and their quality and menu could use a big makeover.

I went to the other one back in my college days, but this one I didn't even know existed. Walked in and it's seat yourself tables to the left, a bunch of pool tables to the front, and a long bar in the middle. \n\nVery limited seating, but it wasn't packed at all so that wasn't a problem. There was a weird draft hitting our table though, so we moved to one deeper in the corner since we thought it was the door, but the draft was there too. We just had to wear our coats throughout dinner.\n\nFor 6 people, we ordered 2 large pizzas, one buffalo chicken, and one prosciutto. I didn't care much for the prosciutto, but the buffalo was pretty bomb. Ordered some small ranches (50 cents per though, what a rip) and it was delicious. It's deceptive that they cut their pizzas into smaller squares because you feel like you can eat so much more. We had 6 slices left over and it was about 42-ish dollars with tax and tip. So a large probably feeds 4 people comfortably, 3 uncomfortably.\n\nWeird thing though is when we asked for a box, the waitress asked if we wanted anything else. We said no and assumed she would bring us the check. But didn't and we sat there for like 10 more minutes. Had to grab her attention and then ask for the check. We weren't drinking or anything so I'm not sure why she thought we would want to just hang out.

They also usually have a bunch specials, which I would recommend trying. \n\nNot to forget, they have an extensive wine list (including a pretty good selection of wine by the glass), and a full bar. The drinks are particularly cheap (at least compared to NYC prices that I am used to), and I'm always amazed at how low the bill is in the end: you can have a really nice meal with alcohol for $40 to $50, which is a pretty good deal considering the quality of the food.

As such Comedor Guadalajara would be filed in my database as the Mexican seafood place that I won't eat all day in anticipation of over-eating at. This is a very thin category, in fact it's the only one. The Veracruz style snapper is single-handedly responsible for keeping me from moving to another city. The shrimp tacos certainly pitch in on this retention campaign as well. Let's go back to the snapper for a moment, shall we? This dish serves an ample portion of fresh snapper  in a near stew-like combination of jalapenos, onions, bay leaves and a rich tomato sauce. If that's not enough, you have the option to add shrimp. \n\nIf I'm not feeling like eating off the coast, the chicken mole is sure to get my vote. The mole here is so good that I get a little insulted when I see it on menus elsewhere. The chicken is pulled from the bone and seems stewed as it's very tender and juicy. \n\nService is always quick and friendly here. Decor is not the most inspiring here, but in Mexican restaurants I think that is a badge of honor. Folks of my pale pigment may pass on this place because it's location is rather industrial and low rent.

And all the places I've never been to but have been wanting to go to for ages were either closed or greens free-- LoLo's (collard don't count), Palatte, Cheuvront, Cibo, My Florist, and so on.\n\nSo Moms decided that Coach and Willie's was the perfect luncheon destination.\n\n(Cuz they thought the salads online looked purdy tasty, and they were right. But I shouldn't have \"judged a book by its cover,\" since even McDonald's looks pretty good in commercials.)\n\nSo I swing by to pick up my sis and we dash to Coach and Willie's. I thought the name sounded like a bastard love filly to a Pony Express stud. Or maybe some purebred dog name, like Sir Charles McWigglesworth.\n\nEasy to find. Parking was plentiful. Patio was neato. Sunken bar seemed like a novelty. Horseshoe shaped booths were comfy and inviting. Atmosphere was upscaley for a sports bar. Company was vivacious. Waitress was engaging and attentive. Bacon wrapped prawns were succulent and satisfying. My Woodchuck cider was tasting crisp and peary. And I had a big ole smile on my face.\n\nIt was salad time. \n\nNow if a salad costs ten dollars, I expect more than a tasteless expanse of iceburg lettuce. What head chef uses iceburg lettuce any more? With all the varieties of salad greens to chose from, I end up with the tasteless, tacky trailer trash of the field greens world? I'm not saying you gotta get all pretentious with a salad by using micro greens grown in an organic hot house, but for fuck sake, iceburg? Airplanes and cafeterias are the only places I've ever encountered iceburg not in fancy pants wedge salad form, which classes it up some and acknowledges the fact that iceburg is tasteless filler devoid of nutrients of any sort.\n\nIs Coach and Willie's food comparable to airplane fare? Ahem, yes. My salad was anyway. Everyone else seemed to enjoy theirs, despite the offensive iceburg. I just ate the equally tasteless southwestern chicken mass that came on top and picked around the lettuce filler. So while the lunch was fun and the bacon wrapped prawns were rockin', the salad sucked. And since I've only been here once, they get a less than stellar review. (And I'm stating that straight up so nobody gets all persnickety. I've only been once. For lunch. And a crap salad.)\n\nI'm sure it's a fun place for drinks before a game or for a quick lunch with coworkers, but I'm taking a stand against iceburg lettuce. It should be eliminated on principle alone. (Aside from its uses as filler; see Navajo tacos and garnish.)\n\nAnybody want to join my one woman campaign?", "business_id": "j8nyAaN_w5t6wYv-ni23sg", "stars": 2, "date": "2008-01-24", "type": "review"}

For the five of us, our bill came to $52, which is very very reasonable.\n\nI can see how this is a popular destination before Diamondback or Suns games...plenty of TVs dot the restaurant so regardless of where you are sitting, you have an easy view of at least one TV.  Service was quick despite a pretty full restaurant (we were in and out in well under an hour). Street parking was a tad tricky as most of the meters this afternoon were unavailable to park at (not sure why). But if you are going before a game, parking won't be an issue.  The heavy eyeliner on the servers and hostesses was a bit much for me, but fits in the overall theme of the restaurant I suppose.\n\nAll and all a good choice if you work downtown and are looking for a lunch place or before a sporting event.  Not sure I would make a special trip to eat here though.\n\nUPDATE (4/20/08):\n\nI have been to Coopers Town a few times since my initial review, most recently today before a Diamondbacks home game. Based on my subsequent experiences after my initial review, I have bumped up my star rating to 4 stars. I have tried a few more things on the menu and I highly recommend the crispy chicken wrap...it is delicious! The atmosphere at Coopers Town before a game is awesome and is a great spot to hit before a game. Plus how can you go wrong with $3 Bud, Bud Light, and Amber Bock drafts on home game days for the Suns and Diamondbacks?", "business_id": "oCA2OZcd_Jo_ggVmUx3WVw", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-01-24", "type": "review"}

Today I finally made the trip inside the store, rather than just going to the restaurant on the side. It was too early for lunch at Tradiciones so in I went. I knew that the market had a lot going on at all times; I nearly run down at least 6 people getting in and out of the parking lot and I'm a really good driver (seriously-not Raymond from Rain Man good, but actually good!). The parking lot on the store side is always packed.\n\nSo the focus of my trip was the cucina. It was bustling for lunch already at just 10:30. So as I'm trying to make sense of the menus posted in both Spanish and English on the wall above the hot food line or whatever, I am greeted by a nice woman that helps me decide where to go. She mentioned sopes first, so that's what I started with.\n\nMy order was way too much food for one, but I wanted to try a couple of things. So I got both a chicken and a steak sopa, a street taco al pastor (pork), and a side of beans. They did have combos unlike another reviewer said but I only wanted to add beans an opted for a side instead. My total for food was $11.00. Not super cheap, but like I said more food than I would normally order at once.  \n\nSo a sope for those unfamilar is not a torta as someone else said. It's more like a weird tostada or open faced sandwich. The base is somewhere between a corn tortilla and an all out bread. It does appear to be flash fried to cook but I'm not totally sure and it didn't feel greasy. The sides are curved to make a small cup to fill with beans, meat of choice, topped with shredded lettuce, grated cojita cheese (I'd describe Mexican parm--hard salty and good!!) The chicken and steak were both tasty. The steak was a little strung together if you will. I'd rather have seen it be chopped better so I would be easier to eat smaller bites. If your teeth didn't make it through that bite, a big chunk was coming along with it. Sorta messy but good though I felt like my sopa was a bit tougher than it should be and my extra cheap plastic fork would bend to the will of the sope.\n\nThe street taco was just so I could taste the al pastor. Two tiny corn tortillas topped with a bit of pork. I topped it with onions and cilantro and would totally eat the al pastor in another dish. \n\nBeans. Not a really a fan. They lacked the taste of say Carolina's beans though the texture matched. A disappointment. \n\nSalsa bar was good. Hot green and red, and the pico was spicy too. Fresh onions and chopped cilantro are a must so it was good to have those. \n\nAgua Fresca...Just love it. I had the fresh guava juice. So tasty and well worth the additional $2.91 I spent for the 32oz drink. \n\nTotal food and drink, $13.91. A little spendy for lunch served in stryo while seated on a bench, but it was fun and I will order a little differently next time so it won't be as expensive and I won't order more food than I can eat.\n\nMarket, looks good. Great looking bakery (really), meat counter, tortilla factory, etc. I'll probably not go out of my way to get there for things I can buy at Food City on a regular day. This does look like a fun way to go get some lunch before you shop for dinner on a weekend. I'll definitely take others for hot food and a fun people watching experience, plus pick up a few goods on the way. \n\nI don't really know about authentic. It's probably not. I don't really care. My dad's family is from near the Mexican border and though I've been to mercados in Mexico and even here, I liked that this place is busy and clean. Campy, sure.

CARBS!!! I decided to finally give Pizza Heaven a try. I was hesitant at first & I asked the waitress too many questions. My diet is vegan so I am always used to fresh quality food & as of a couple of months ago, I dropped sugar out of my diet as well. I was hesitant on the vegan cheese, because it stated that it was soy so I wasn't sure if it was non-gmo or if it contained sugar. The waitress was amazing, she brought me out a folder that had all the ingredients of the foods that they use. The vegan cheese brand is Follow Your Heart & it did not have any added sugar nor genetically modified ingredients. I started to be more opened to this menu & decided to order a vegan calzone w/ mushrooms, onions, & spinach. \n\nOh my gosh, DELICIOUS! And, it's also huge so I will have lunch for a few days too. The calzone bread was amazing & it only contained four ingredients, sugar not being one of them. It was topped off with EVOO, not butter, so it was just as vegan as it could be. The sauce was amazing, it complimented the calzone perfectly.\n\nI talked to the owner for quite a bit, who is wonderful. She informed me that her French fries are not fried in the same frier where wings or other meat products are fried. That is beyond amazing because not many restaurants will invest in a separate frier to accommodate to their vegan population, not even big cooperate restaurants, & I know this for a fact. She also uses purified water when she cooks & not tap, she is very passionate about her business & the quality of her ingredients.\n\nI cannot wait to go back. This was exactly what my body needed last Saturday. I really enjoyed my experience & the amazing food.", "business_id": "auorqdHiATGZHVd-sd79ZQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-12-14", "type": "review"}

Since he is on a \"low carb\" diet, he asked to exchange the starch for veggies.    I was thinking about having that, but I am more of a seafood, chicken gal versus beef.    I tried it.   It was good, the beef was very tender.    Sorry, can't give a review from  just one bite.   My wine was the cab, Sebastiani, Sonoma Black Cherry.    No, I don't follow the white with the seafood/chicken \"rule.\"     I like cabs.    It was good.    I shall go back, you can count on it.    I sure would like to have the flavoring mix of the pasta.   I had called the restaurant to find out the name of my dish since it was the special of the night.    I was told it used to be on the menu, and they try to mix it up.    My opinion?     I think it should go back on the menu.

We ordered salads, soup, burgers and dessert and everything is SO good.  The price was decent with my restaurant.com coupon, but even without, I would have just skipped the dessert and still come in around $50 for two with tip.

I sincerely hope they beef up the advertising and get people IN here, because it's worth it.  I suspect in a more visible location there'd be a line out the door, but hotel full service restaurants are always tricky.\n\nIf you have a rest.com coupon, use it NOW because they stop accepting them as of 1/1/13.

Unless you like walking up steep driveways I suggest driving to the top and use the valet parking. Now the food. My wife and I ended up choosing the same items. The seafood cake which reminds you of a crab cake had lobster and crab, was deep fried, tender and moist and was dressed in two sauces that complimented it well as did the veggie garnish. We both had the lemon and spinach soup with risotto. The soup was excellent. Finally, we both had the Three Fish Neopaliton  with another version of risotto and veggies. It too was wonderful. We both had a glass of Seven Daughters Muscat which paired nicely with the fish. For dessert we shared a Chocolate and Blackberry Souffle that was truly a surprise.

My scale usually goes like this - 3 stars is average (duh), a place I wouldn't necessarily put effort into going to but I wouldn't be totally disappointed if somehow I wound up there.  2 stars would be somewhere I likely wouldn't return and wouldn't recommend to others.  For what T Cooks is trying to be, it is not worth a return trip for me.  Not that the food, decor, service, or anything was that terrible, but for the price there are far better fine dining establishments.  There is absolutely no reason to choose T Cooks or allow others to choose it. \n \nOk - so this review is based solely on my experience at the wine bar/lounge area and not the actual restaurant.  I was meeting a group of friends here for a cozy cocktail before we all took off to our various locations of origin for the holidays.  On a Tuesday night at 7, the lounge area was PACKED.  I couldn't believe it.  I arrived with my husband and there was only one other person from our party at the bar.  So I scouted the place out and swooped in like a hawk when I saw a party vacate a nice plush couch in the back corner.  \n \nThe decor is very cozy - wood fireplaces going, low lighting, oak tables, plush couches, beautiful patio - very Spanish villa.  But I guess that this place used to be a Spanish-villa influenced private estate, so no surprise there. \n \nSo after being seated, we waited for a server.  And waited.  We noticed only one server in the entire lounge, and people were literally lining up to talk to her, either to get her attention or to simply put in orders.  It turned out she was the only server for the whole lounge!  That's not her fault, but that is definitely some poor management right there. \n \nWe ordered some food off the lounge menu and some drinks and proceeded to enjoy ourselves with our friends over the course of the next 3 hours.  I started with the Pinot Grigio and my husband had the 007 martini (or the James Bond martini?  something like that).  Both were good.  For food, we selected the calamari in aioli, the charcuterie plate, and the tenderloin burger.  The calamari was interesting to say the least - the aioli was very watery and almost mayo-y, kind of like cole slaw.  Um, ok?  The tenderloin burger was very plain.  The boursin cheese was creative but it didn't do much to help.  The applewood smoked bacon could best be described as stale - it was extremely brittle, almost hurt to bite into.  It wasn't even that it was \"crispy\" because even when bacon is properly prepared crispy it's still a little chewy. \n \nThe charcuterie plate never came.\n \nOver the 3 hours, the crowd died down and we were able to enjoy a little more relaxing atmosphere.  But the service never improved.  Rarely did the server return to our table to check on us.  One of our friends ordered a tenderloin burger much later in the night, and it took almost 45 minutes to get to him.  After our first drinks, I ordered the Sauvingon Blanc and my husband the Russian Valley Pinot Noir.  The SB tasted like pickle juice and my husband exclaimed that it was potentially the worst PN he had ever had.    \n \nAt the end of the night we got the check.  $117.  For a mediocre burger, strangely prepared calamari, a cocktail, a beer, and 4 glasses of wine between my husband and I (two of which were terrible).\n \nNot worth it.\n \nWorse, out of curiosity I took a look at the regular restaurant menu.  3 entrees with mushrooms (I hate mushrooms), 1 with duck (to which I'm allergic), and 2 were seafood (based on the calamari, I wouldn't go for the seafood).  \n \nSo there is absolutely nothing here I would eat.  No reason to return, whatsoever.", "business_id": "fVgrpVyp-nPLTac9YIjTug", "stars": 2, "date": "2007-12-19", "type": "review"}

He said he knows for a fact that he put the chicken in the rice, because he NEVER forgets to do so.  He wanted me to drive back to the restaurant with the rice so he could see the rice for himself...REDICULOUS!  He then slammed the phone down in my ear...very unprofessional.  He definitely does not go with the philosophy of \"the customer is always right.\"  I don't see myself going back to this restaurant, as they proved to me that they do not value me as a customer.", "business_id": "wct7rZKyZqZftzmAU-vhWQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-02-20", "type": "review"}

The reviews were mixed - some proclaiming excellence and others less than stellar but none of them regarding the karaoke. I wanted to see for myself.\n\nOne, the parking is dismal. But, if needed, the post office is only half a block away with a nice big lot and available for parking (which is where I parked the Saturday I went).\n\nTwo, the place is a dive bar - nothing more, nothing less. When I arrived, there were several people at the bar and several groups at the tables. Karaoke was in full swing and there were singers up. When sitting at the bar, I was immediately served by a male bartender with an easy smile.\n\nThree, beer. The selection is fairly standard, the commonplace brews you can find in most bars - Bud, lites, Mich, etc. I was happy to find Woodchuck served, and not just served but on tap. (This is the only place - bar or liquor store - I've found since moving from the Midwest that offers my favorite hard cidar. I'm sure there are more, just haven't found them yet.) The price was a little steeper for that Woodchuck though than I'm accustomed. But that could be since the company that makes it is a small brewery in the Midwest and do not commonly distribute this far west.\n\nFour, Karaoke DJ. A nice wooden dance floor was where the DJ made house for karaoke. Decent set up (one more like I'm used to with a lap top instead of cartridges like a few places I've seen since moving here), and a decent selection. I think he had books available, but he said it is often easier to simply write the song you want down and, if he has problems, he'd let you know. I was happy to see he had several bands/artists that are a little less known karaoke-wise that I enjoy to sing.\n\nThe DJ did sing, unlike some places where they refuse. But it wasn't an issue as the rotation wasn't overly long, and he was good about weaving new people into the existing line up. There were singers (like all places) with good voices and others without. It's not an overly young crowd. I'd say late twenties and up.\n\nThe only annoyance was the sound system was wonky. There was really only one or two good places to stand with the microphone to keep feedback out of the speakers. For someone like me who likes to sit in their seat, instead of standing on the dance floor, that was a drawback.\n\nI did not eat while at the establishment. But there were a lot of people who did. I checked out the prices which seemed VERY inexpensive and also checked out the portions others had which were VERY large. But I can't attest to the quality. Despite negative reviews (and possibly at my own peril) I will try the food in the future however. \n\nI was happy with my experience. The people were polite and friendly, the service was good and not intrusive, and the karaoke was fun and had a receptive crowd. While not going to be a regular haunt, I'll certainly come back in the future.", "business_id": "RIeWXLMHZQlYprYt1x2f1w", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-12-20", "type": "review"}

The service is always prompt and friendly, that atmosphere is not tops but its not bad and always comfortable. \n\nThe lunch buffet is about $8.50 and they always have a handful of vegetarian/vegan items. Spicy eggplant, spicy tofu, spicy noodles, crispy tofu and vegetables, are just a few of the great dishes that are usually at the buffet.

Well over an hour passed between receiving our drinks/salads and when our meals where finally brought out to us. During that time, none of our drinks were refilled, our used plates weren't removed, and no one came to check on us until the hour mark. When our food did come out it was nice and piping hot, but it was also unrecognizable. Every plate was drowning in marinara sauce. You had to do some serious excavating to uncover your food.

Soon as I walk in the door, I'm literally transported. TV's playing the Spanish channel. Juke Box blaring Hispanic music at party volume.  All the signage is in Spanish. The bilingual \"small print\" on the menu is English! And the seafood is fresh from the gulf of Baja! Shrimp cocktails in big glass goblets of lime juice. Options to the shrimp, if you are adventuresome, include Scallops, oysters and octopus. On the table there are six different brands of hot sauce so you can doctor-up to your content. I like the shrimp burrito. Grilled shrimp, green peppers and onions, with soupy refried beans in a fresh flour tortilla. I'm a bit of a tortilla snob. They serve the real-deal, handmade flour tortillas here. I am always surprised that notable Mexican restaurants, opt for the preservative stenched, shelf life tortillas. Then there is the shrimp soup.... It's a must try. I've yet to introduce anyone to the shrimp soup, whom did not respond with, OMG! The soup is broth style, from a fish stock reduction, and loaded with shrimp and served with a side of fresh chopped cilantro, oinions and more flour (or corn) tortillas!\n    Let me predispose you please, to NOT, expect a whole, proper,  trained staff, dining experience.

He didn't ask what happened just opened the cash register and handed me money.  No apologies from anybody or acknowledgment of the fact that we waited and had no food. \nI think this place has okay food but I will never go back because this food isn't SO great that I need to deal with the service that doesn't care about keeping customers happy. \nThere are much better places that I don't fear food poisoning from that are really nice to their customers.

This stockyard would pass 40,000 cattle through here per daily during cattle auctions.

The entree included soup or salad and a side which is a rarity now a days with all the absurd priced Ala ca rte steak houses. The house salad was solid and the blue cheese dressing delicious.

Now that's a whole 'nother story. \n\nPicture this... I'm in Phoenix on a business trip at the Best Western HQ. So the owner of my company says that she heard about this restaurant that has a slide and she wants to try it out. Hmmm. A restaurant with a slide? Boss is paying. Hey, I'm coming, let me get my purse (for decoration only tonight). \n\nWell, after we driver to the end of the universe, we finally arrive. There are three in our party, including my crazy BGF co-worker. For those of you in the hotel biz, he's a night auditor, 'nuff said, you get the picture. \n\nOnce we are seated (and the view is spectacular), we peruse the menu (oh, I ix nayed the slide. After seeing a heavy set lady with a dress on slide down and leave her booty juice.... again, nuff said). We looked over the menu and boss lady decides that we should try the fried rattlesnake and the Cowboy Platter. I'm game, remember, she's paying. \n\nFried rattlesnake. What the he!! was I thinking? Must have been that quart sized drink I inhaled (remember, she's paying). Ok, what does it taste like? Popcorn chicken from KFC, over cooked. Again, nuff said. \n\nWe're discussing the merits of Fried rattlesnake (that darn drink again) when we hear a commotion. Running across the restaurant like the kitchen is on fire, come 3 waiters. One has a triangle and is screaming at the top of their lungs. And the other two have this massive metal platter between them, held above their heads. They are all screaming and heading for us. I'm looking like an intoxicated (drink, boss, paying) deer in headlights as my auditory system catches up and sends the signal to my brain. \"COWBOY SPECIAL, COWBOY SPECIAL, COWBOY SPECIAL\" \n\nOh great, now everyone in the restaurant is looking at our eclectic little group. My little Asian boss, dressed in flowers from head to toe with her $350 pumps, my BGF who is about 6\"5, 400# and bald as an egg, and me, the fully intoxicated (Drink, Boss, Free) Korean American in her business suit. \n\nThis platter had like 1/2 a cow, a chicken family and the 3 little pigs on it. I couldn't even begin to do it justice. It should have come with a warning. DO not eat for a week before ordering this special. Needless to say, I had an elephant bag to take with me after dinner (too much for a mere doggie). \n\nOh and the piece de resistance? Why my boss convinced me (Booze. Free. Boss) that the free country line dancing on the patio for everyone to see would be just the thing. WRONG! No rhythm when I'm sober, so you know how this looked. Two left feet when I'm not drinking. You get the picture? One last time.....Drink. Free. Boss. \"Nuff Said!", "business_id": "wZwZcte4lcbu51NOzCjWbQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-01-17", "type": "review"}

I went with a large group as part of a conference but I can't even imagine going here as a regular dinner table of 4 people. The place is huge & loud. \nWhen we arrived we went in the door marked handicap access with my elderly mom. There was what looked like a hostess stand right there, but the young woman assigned there was not only clueless but she made zero attempt to be helpful. Initially telling us we had to go back outside & proceed upstairs to the main hostess. I said we'd entered via the marked handicap entrance intentionally but she looked at us with oblivion. I then explained we were with a large group that was sitting outside with picnic tables & without asking which group, pointed ahead & said to keep going \"past the slide\" & we'd come to a doorway where a host could show us the way. We walked through a maze which included a dance floor & found no one, but we proceeded outside to where we saw groups. Eventually, a nice waiter was gracious enough to look up our group name & show us to our groups very nice private dining area. Once we arrived, we learned there had been at least 2 more direct and far closer routes. \nThe area our group had was really very nice. We had our own fire pit which was lit & of course the famous view of the entire Phoenix area. It was a really nice evening to be outside. \nThe food was set up in our own buffet & is served in cowboy style metal pie pans. The food was average, but portions were quite generous, with everyone getting a full half of chicken, beans, corn, salad & biscuits. They even brought more fresh, warm biscuits to our table. There was also large slices of what was probably the worse apple pie I've ever tasted on a separate buffet. \nOne of our guests learned that folks sitting inside got free cotton candy, so she got that ball rolling--a fun addition. \nWould I go back on a return to Phoenix?

The first time I went, I thought the prices were a little high, but not unreasonable.  The \"kimchi pancake\" was tasty, but my bibimbap was quite bland.  As for the wait staff, they were not very friendly, but brought everything out on time. Overall, I was content with the experience, but certainly wasn't impressed. \n\nHowever, my second experience at Hodori was awful.  We literally waited at our table for an hour to have our order taken--they told us the kitchen was too backed up to receive any new orders. (Meanwhile the two tables around us ordered and received their dinner.) We decided to leave, but they assured us we could order and that we would get our food in twenty minutes.  In reality, it took another hour and ten minutes to get our food.  I tried a kimchi soup this time--it was alright, but not worth the wait or price.  \n\nI NEVER stiff wait staff, having worked in food service myself. But I planned to make an exception this time, as waiting to be served for over two hours after being seated is ridiculous. However, they added a mandatory 18% gratuity to our bill.  Even thought this meant a few dollars per person, we all felt so cheated for being forced to pay for such poor service. They did apologize at the end for the wait and brought out complimentary ice cream. But at that point, we were just ready to get out of there. \n\nI would NOT recommend this restaurant and will certainly not be returning there in the future.\n\nUPDATE: It's one thing to have bad service, but I spent the next day throwing up.

He left, did not come back for about 15 minutes, and when he did come back, he brought us our checks and said there was nothing they could do. We then again asked for boxes, dessert and a manager. When the manager came out, he was EXTREMELY rude and basically told us \"too bad\" because we were with a big group and we came in \"late\" (let me remind you, people were just getting salads on the table when we got there, that's not THAT late) so it was our fault.

First point, you apparently have to get there when they open at 4 or you might not get seating for a while. We were visiting the in-laws in Sun City and were informed we would have to leave before 3 in order to get seating. Nothing like trying to go across Phoenix during rush hour for an early dinner. \n\nWhen you get in, you can see that it is quite a display. A huge, colorful organ rises up on a dais and swivels back and forth while the organist plays. The organist is very talented and can play a wide variety of songs. There are small instruments on wall that play and even some puppets that periodically come out from behind a wall and dance. It is, like someone at the table next to ours described it, \"Chuck E Cheese for old people\".\n\nWhen it comes to the food, the Chuck E Cheese comparison is pretty accurate. It really isn't anything special. Thank you to all the Yelpers who warned me about needing cash and about the separate food and drink lines. I suppose the separate lines makes some sense but the cash only is strange. Obviously, you go to a place like this for the entertainment, not the food. But, really, that only lasts so long. My 10 year old lasted about half an hour before clamoring for his iPad. I lasted only slightly longer.

It's larger, has a huge presence outside of the typical hidden strip mall, and looks promising. \n\nRest assured, Phu Thanh is different from most Vietnamese restaurants on the east side... it's very very bad. During a one-hour dinner in their dining room, I noticed three tables that were covered in dirty dishes upon my arrival, and still covered in the same dirty dishes upon my departure. Not to say this ruined my experience, but it sure was disgusting to look at. The waiter service here was actually nicer and more helpful than most, a which is the saving grace here. They offered a refill of my water (rare) and even came back to see if I needed anything else (very rare.) The clientele here seemed like predominately young married couples and young families of non-asian descent. \n\nI had been craving a bowl of Bun all day, a rice noodle dish served with julienned veggies, your choice of meat, and a nuoc mam (fish sauce) to give it a nice flavor. I also ordered spring rolls  prior to my meal, and was a tad surprised when, having ordered in Vietnamese, the server asked me questions that made no sense. My order of Goi Cuon garnered a respose of \"fried or not fried\" which definitely threw me off since fried would be Gha Gio, an entirely different dish... did you ask this because I'm white? He then asked \"you need fork right?\" No, I just gave you my entire order and said hello in conversational Vietnamese... this wasn't a tip off that I know how to eat your food? The spring rolls were very small and contained little filling. I'm used to Goi Cuon bursting with veggies pork and shrimp, not little tiny thunb sized things. When the Bun came, the noodles were all broken, which made it almost impossible to eat in anything other than tiny bites. The Nuoc Mam had an overwhelming fish sauce smell and flavor and was easily the worst I've ever had, and completely lacked chili, garlic, or anything to mask the fish sauce. Utterly awful. I also felt like the Bun portion was incredibly small compared to other Viet restaurants in town.\n\nI would hesitate to give this place any sort of recommendation, given it's proximity to some of the best Vietnamese restaurants in town. The quality seemed to be on par, and service was somewhat decent, but the combination of small portions, bad tasting food, and lack of ability to clean a table earns this restaurant a solid two-star review. Also, eating Vietnamese more than three times a week, I've had a good run of over two years and haven't become sick from a place. This one has had me burping for the past 12 hours and feeling kind of queasy... nothing major, but definitely something didn't sit well. I'm honstly not sure what the appeal of this restaurant is.

A gentle old lady let us pore over the menu for 10 minutes before putting in our order. The food was out of the kitchen quickly (despite the full house) which is a huge positive in my book.

If you go there with the plan of eating it there, you'll probably change your mind before the food is even ready.\n- Use the drive-through if nobody else is in it already, otherwise park your car and go inside. They don't take your order until you get to the window (no intercom) and at about 5 minutes/car, you don't want to line up for that.\n\nIt should also be said that they don't have a liquor license and it's 100% wrong to serve wings without beer, but I'll overlook that since this is strictly a to-go place for me and I have beer in my fridge.", "business_id": "maF18Z12TB2L_bV9CAhNrA", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-01-20", "type": "review"}
