It was my first job and continued to supplement my burgeoning shopping addiction throughout High School and into College.  I had a fantastic time throwing people's menus down as a hostess and then filling food orders (and occasionally spilling orange juice on people's crotches, oops) as a waitress and gossiping with my coworkers.  So needless to say, I have a special place in my heart for this lovely establishment!\n\nI think for a Pittsburgh owned chain restaurant it's one of the best.  This is in terms of how the business is run and the restaurants itself.  My love affair of grilled stickies began here.  I may have occasionally shoved one or two in my mouth as soon as they came out of the oven.  I also can't resist a smiley cookie.  They seem to be at every event in the city, so I never have to go long to fulfill on my smiley cookie cravings.  Thank gawd!\n\nMy all time favorite salad is the grilled chicken and portabella salad.  I absolutely love the balsamic dressing and mix of fresh ingredients.  I also had a second in High School (when I didn't have to count so many calories, ew) where I'd order a Super Burger every lunch break.  They are seriously addictive with their super secret sauce combination.  \n\nTheir breakfast buffet is bomb!  I always have to go for the regulars and one word sums that up.  Carbs.

There's really no use in rating the actual food, as it's hard to screw up food at a McDonald's. It's all subpar grub, but my penchant for getting filet-o-fish sandwiches this time of year lives on anyway, so I had to go satiate my once-a-year craving.\n\nMy issue was with the service. I walked in and the employees were just chatting it up with their friends and off-hours coworkers who were on the customer side of the counter. It was around 11pm and the lack of customers inside of the restaurant made it pretty obvious that I was the only person waiting for my order to be taken, but that didn't stop the employees behind the counter from finishing their conversations before taking my order.\n\nAfter I finally put my order in, I seemed to wait an eternity (in fast food terms) for my two filet-o-fish sandwiches, regular McBites, and medium french fry order. It was hardly a complicated order, but I've waited less time during peak hours at other fast food chains in the past. Thankfully, there was ONE girl working who saw me standing there for a long time, and asked, \"are his McBites up yet?...where are they?\" I was happy that someone had finally addressed the situation, but it shouldn't have taken that long.\n\nAgain, I'm aware that showing up at 11pm will probably increase my odds of walking into a late-night, preparing-for-the-next-day mess of a restaurant, but even in fast food, it's absurd to think that the level of cleanliness that I walked into is acceptable. Not to mention, the one girl who was working announcing that she was \"going to pee\"  while I was standing there. I wasn't offended at all, but I found it odd that she thought that was acceptable to say in front of a customer.\n\nI guess this experience reminded me of why I limit my trips to fast food chains as much as possible.", "business_id": "xUf11yTcoRagwNiJcY8GAA", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-03-26", "type": "review"}

It offers both drive-through and dine-in options, and prepares your food faster than you can count the change to pay for your meal.\n\nThe Establishment: This McDonald's does not have a playpen but is very clean and has plenty of seating. I have never had to wait for a table, and the lines move very quickly. Good amount of parking, and close to a streetlight for easy an easy exit to back to the airport.\n\nThe Food: The same sloppy McDonald's assembly, but gosh I do love how the burgers taste. I always get some kind of burger variant (Big Mac, double-cheeseburger, etc) and I am never disappointed. The quality control between individual McDonald's chains makes it a safe bet if you actually enjoy McDonald's food. Pricing is on-par with other North Carolina McDonalds' and cheaper than anything you can find at the airport.\n\nThe Service: Slightly disgruntled looking employees but that food comes out so darn fast it doesn't matter.\n\nOverview: This McDonald's is clean, in a great location close to the CLT airport, and has good prices. While my aunt was sad that they don't have regional specials like the double-jalapeno cheeseburger, I cannot fault McDonald's for their taste.

Bojangles is a fried chicken chain in the Southeast region that would be similar in style and menu to a Popeyes.\n\nConnecting through the Charlotte Airport on my way back to LA, I knew I was going to stop at Bojangles to give their chicken a try (this Bojangles is located in Concourse B of the US Airways terminal).  Bojangles may be fast food and a chain, but at least it is a regional chain and provides something different than other nearby airport eateries such as Burger King, Chili's, Quizno's, and KFC.\n\nThere is a sign posted that says the food gets out within minutes of ordering (to capitalize on those commuters who have to get-it-quick-and-go).  They delivered on their promise because the food came out really quick (less than a minute).  Service was also friendly and efficient.  They also seemed well-staffed to handle peak times.  It looked like many travelers were choosing Bojangles for their layover dining destination.\n\nTheir individual meals were not in the $5 range, but they were under $10 (which is not bad considering that airport food is often overpriced).  Family meals were also available.  I had three pieces of chicken (2 thighs and a leg) with one side (mashed potatoes and gravy) and a biscuit.\n\nThe chicken was quite crispy on the outside.  Often, fried chicken at fast food places can be overly fatty or skimpy on the meat, but there was a good portion of chicken meat on the thighs.  The dark meat had the appropriate amount of fat, but it was not too fatty.  The chicken was also juicy.\n\nUnfortunately, the chicken was a little bit bland and I was expecting more kick.  Popeyes has a nice spiciness to their chicken, but Bojangles' chicken (on the other hand) could have used a little more heat and seasoning.  Honey and hot sauce were available, which helped give the chicken more flavor.  There was some greasiness to the chicken, but it was fried chicken after all (that is kind of a given).\n\nThe mashed potatoes were similar to the mashed potatoes you would find at KFC.  Same taste with that signature texture that can only be described as not real-mashed-potato-like.  The gravy at Bojangles had a little more flavor than KFC.  I'm fine with KFC mashed potatoes so I thought this side was okay.\n\nThe biscuit was large and had a nice, crunchy golden brown top.  Unfortunately, the biscuit was quite dry.\n\nAirport food is often average quality, overpriced and the same everywhere.  I still can't figure out how there seem to be Cinnabons at most of the country's airports when they are so hard to find elsewhere.   Since Bojangles is a regional chain, I think it would definitely be worth trying if you are a fan of fried chicken and have some time to kill at the Charlotte Airport.\n\n(Irrelevant Note) I sat next to NFL QB Jimmy Clausen on the airplane back to LA and I was surprised that there were not many people in Charlotte who recognized him--especially considering that he was the Carolina Panthers' top draft pick just a few weeks ago.", "business_id": "1AXQja1QV47FGU0Jp0CSxw", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-05-11", "type": "review"}

The biscuits are nice anf buttery and soft.

As I was on my way to my table - the woman behind the counter calls over to me and says thay they just brought the rice out and here is a side.

I haven't had showmars in a couple years and decided to rejuvenate my taste buds since I was craving mediterranean food. My review will be based on my experience at this location:\n\nCons:\n1. Don't expect to find a parking spot at this location, especially during busy lunch hours. \n2. Drive through line is so long it wraps around the entire store, so you may as well just park your car across the street at the CVS and walk over to dine inside.\n3. There will not be enough indoor seating, so expect to have to sit on the outside patio. This may be less tempting in the hot Charlotte summers. \n4. I ordered the gyro platter, it was a mistake! I've never been to a mediterranean place that served my gyro in separate pieces, meaning the pita was separate from my meat. Did I mention there was no veggie for my pita, the picture on there menu looks nothing like the food I got. All I got was a piece of pita by itself and a cup of beef strips. \n\nNeutral:\n1. Wait time, I waited about 10-15 minute for my order...which could be a tad faster seeing it's a fast food chain\n\nPros:\n1. Great dining booths and interior decoration for a fast food joint. seriously, the inside looked like a sit down restaurant, great that they also have patio seating option. \n2. Sanitation score is not bad, 96.5\n3. Their daily specials\n4. Milkshakes are only $2.75 (Did not taste test to see if any good so I cannot comment on quality)\n\nTip:\n-Check the board for their daily specials!! I cannot emphasize this enough. I wish I had just gotten the chicken gyro with fries which was a special going on for the day for just $5.69...The chicken gyro itself is worth $.5.29 already on the regular menu so this is a great deal. They have more than just gyros on special, they also have soup, salad etc.\n-If you want yummy authentic greek food, try greco fresh grille on Rea Rd, 10x better!

There was no one in line, no one in the restaurant and maybe a couple of cars in the drive thru. The restaurant didn't seem all that clean, there was a lot of detritus in the food prep area, but nothing overly repellent.

After a few more minutes of waiting and my perception of discord in the kitchen and general apathy toward accomplishing anything, I decided I just wanted to leave.

When I lived in IL I would frequent one several times a week for the chicken fajita pita and their fries dipped in their buttermilk. Over the weekend my significant other and I decided to plan a trip to IKEA. My first plan was to find the closest Jack in the Box and add it to the GPS. Coming from Greensboro this was a very easy location to find. I had not been to one in over 15 years so I was surprised to see it was as clean as the one I remember in IL. I mentioned to the clerk I had not been to one in a long time and wanted the chicken fajita pita which used to be a #9, now a #13. I ordered it without onions and with the fries and buttermilk. The clerk said seeing me so happy made her day. I think I was so thrilled to be eating one of my favorite meals again. When the order came it was just as I remembered it! It was not one bit greasy and very fresh! I ate every bite with such pleasure! I highly recommend this location for the friendly and helpful staff, the clean interior, and also the best Jack in the Box food I can remember!

I'd never heard of Whataburger before so I thought David Foster Wallace was making it up when he refers to the \"Whataburger Southwest Junior Invitational\" in Infinite Jest (the tennis tournament is made up). When I found out it was a real place, I had to come here. \n\nIt wasn't bad and kudos to the woman taking my order. She upsold me to a meal - \"are you sure you don't want a meal, honey?\" Her voice indicated that she was genuinely concerned about my general hunger situation which, admittedly, was extremely high at that very moment. Then there was the wait outside the take-out window, probably 10 - 15 minutes in total. I  figured they must be assembling one king-hell burger in there. But more likely, it took that much time to fill the giant Whataburger cup with Fanta Orange soda. I let out an audible gasp when I saw it - holy crap it was big. Like I could have gone hiking in the desert for miles with nothing but that giant cup of soda to sustain me. \n\nThe burger was pretty big. Bigger than anything you'll find at any other fast food joint and don't forget the wait, I think the wait is key. Because that wait is what sets this place apart from say, a Mickey D's or an In-n-Out (which, incidentally, Whataburger is way better. Like the first time I ate an In-n-Out burger that's exactly what it did). So sitting outside waiting behind the big white SUV with the smokey exhaust you're inhaling for the ten minutes it takes for them to make their burger, plus the ten or so minutes it takes for them to cook your own and  assemble your meal, fill the giant styrofoam Whataburger cup with Fanta Orange soda, and deep fry your peach pie (very tasty) lets you reflect on the state of your life in relationship to your expectation of wanting a fast food restaurant to act as an instant gratification machine, when, in fact, by going to those other places, you are perhaps missing out on all this personal attention to your burger, meal, soda, dessert assembly (and don't forget that caring moms-like voice so concerned for your hunger situation), in the space of which time you are allowed to reach out to loved ones via your cellphone or text-messaging system (I was able to call my husband twice and read a magazine article about hiking in Tempe), and think about what you want to do next w/r/t your art and just what the fuck are you doing with your life anyway that you think waiting outside the Whataburger for ten minutes is keeping you from actualizing some potential self that may be far better served by simply having to wait a moment for your food?", "business_id": "ixTr1qXUFGTzyaZUuCDDvg", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-04-20", "type": "review"}

Being that I have never seen a Sonic, I was perplexed by these commercials.  So, using the power of the internets I discovered that there weren't any Sonics in the state of Maryland.\n\nWhen I moved to my new home of San Diego, I was confronted by the Sonic commercials yet again.  I internet-searched again and found the nearest Sonic was about 2 hours away.  My perplexion flexed into downright dismay.  Commercials are expensive endeavors--so why would a company essentially throw their money away by advertising whereever they are not located?\n\nOne night, my friend Jen picked me up at the Phoenix Airport for a nice hangout weekend.  We were both really hungry and deciding where to nosh.  When out of the corner of my right eye i spy a garish forty-one hundred kelvin fluorescent beacon in the night.  I thought it was some sort of carwash or super-sized gasstation at first glance.  Jen explained that was a Sonic.  \"What the fvck's a Sonic?\" I replied.  To this point I have never seen a Soinic before in the flesh or in the disgusting eyesore of a prefab materials and light, as it were.  So it was decided right then and there that we would eat this Sonic.\n\nNow, I know I cannot speak for all the distant Sonics in parts of the world a young hooligan such as myself has never been to, but to this, my virgin Sonicage, I can.\n\nThere is a huge slab of concrete which seemed way too large for the size of the building.  On this slab was lots of parking spots under a handfull of overhangs shining enough fluorescent light to make a operating room mildly jealous. Beside each of the parking spots was a lit-up menu with fast-food type stuffs, drinks, slushies, smoothies, ice cream sundaes, banana splits, etc.  As if this wasn't enough, they also have a drive-thru.  Again my perplexion returned.\n\nThe awful shine of it all, the harshness on weary eyes... It is a monument to decadence to the point of bloatation and bloatiosity.\n\nWhile we were deciding what we wanted a Mexican family rolled up beside us with a roller-skated jalopy and young children in the back.  They ordered and pulled away blasting some thuggish gangsta rap as their trunk buzzed with whorish flapping sheetmetal not sealed or sealed or sealed.\n\nJen ordered blackberry iced tea and some fried mac n' cheese bites, I, the tater-tots with cheese and a cranberry limeade. We pulled away blasting while our thuggish gangsta rap as our trunk rattled and flapped whoreishly--waves dissipating into the must of chaparral, waves lifting into the witheringchaped desert night.\n\nGot home and ate in normal lighting--Lighting that didn't make one's flesh crawl rutty-riddled with hungover insomniacian interrogation prior to a privilege afforded to be actually hungover.\n\nThe drinks were surprisingly not overly sweet and made with lots of that pellet style-ice that we so heart in drinks like these.  The iced tea was quality and the crisp tartness of my cranberry limeade (with actual half of a real lime floating in it) was perfectly refreshing.  The mac n' cheese thingees tasted like a crispy fried stouffers mac n' cheese.  Sadly, these are a limited time only option. As for my tater-tots with cheese, eh, not so good.  They were just bland cafeteria-style tots with a slice of American cheese thrown ontop--A wrinkly transparent orangish shellac coalescing my tots into a gelatinous choir.\n\n...and that was and is how I met a Sonic.", "business_id": "po5FyERB4lUZNnBIwnhFlg", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-05-03", "type": "review"}

Even if I get less ingredients then my boyfriend my burrito shouldn't be literally half the size of his. We're paying the same amount, so I want a size-able burrito! I've worked in food service before. I know lunch rushes suck, but when the quality starts slipping you need to take a deep breath and remember you're getting paid to make the burrito I'm paying almost eight dollars for. I shouldn't be able to tell that you hate your job. \n\nIt hasn't always been like this. There was some new employees hired a couple months ago, and I gave them a break. But it's been a few months and it's time to meet the standards that Chipotle has set for itself.

My email confirmation said that my food would be ready at 2:45. We arrived at 2:45 on the dot, ready to pick up our food. Upon telling the cashier that we ordered online, she argued with me saying there was no online order in her system. I then told her I had an email confirmation. She then \"went to the back\" and appeared with none other than my order sheet that had not been fulfilled. She then handed it to the person at the beginning of the assembly line to start making it and asked me if I was ready to pay, after I had already told her I had paid for it online. \n\nThe person making our order made the first thing wrong and we asked him to correct it, that was actually the least of my concerns, that happens, I get that. So then we just asked him if it would be easier for us to just tell him what we ordered. They then went through the line to make our order but for some reason were moving at the slowest pace I have ever seen at any Chiptole location, there was no sense of urgency and I had placed my order over a half hour before arriving, mind you, there was no line, which is rare for any Chiptole, so it really made no sense that our service was this poor. \n\nWe asked the girl at the cashier what we could do differently so that this wouldn't happen again and her response was that sometimes their system doesn't link up to whatever system is in the back and that was why our order wasn't ready. We left at 3:07. \n\nSo an order I placed at 2:20, was supposed to be ready at 2:45, and we left at 3:07. That is 22 minutes for an order that was placed online. \n\nI will not be going to that Chiptole ever again.

What can i say. Service is always top notch. And i know theres some healthy food with the vegetables and brown rice. Its just its very borning to me. Im vegetarian and They leave much to be desirered for a vegetarian. Yes you can get your meal made with veggies and no meat, but thats it. Theirs really no plates made especially for vegetarians. In their defense i will say the veggies are always crispy and not over cooked.  The down side is they dont give you many vegetables. Its such a small portion of vegetables You'll go away hungry. and if you ask for extra veggies they charge a dollar and some times the increased portion is really just the normal portion. pei wei is a  ok as a good go to stand bye restaurant. i  only wish they had more choices for vegetarians and gave better portions especially when it comes to vegetables. I also dont understand why they dont have Indian food or tiebetan food or Kashmir food. Its Called  an Asian Fusion restaurtant and They dont include India, Tiebet, Kashmir  as Asian food.

Truth be told, no honest person does.  It's fast food.  If we wanted a lot, we would just make it ourselves.  What I do expect, and what most people expect is reliability.  That's it... reliability.\n\nThat is something that this particular location of Taco Bell sorely lacks.  I have been there at 10:30, and they're open.  I have been there at 11:55, and they're open.  I even asked the hours once.  I was told that Sunday-Thursday, this location is open until 12:00AM, and on the weekends, they are open until 1:00AM.  Yet... they are unreliable...I wonder if the owner knows their staff closes early?\n\nOut of the last six times I have been to this location - on a weeknight - between 11:00 and 11:30 - they have been closed.  Sometimes they are open... sometimes they are closed.  You never know with this place.  If the owner were to check the power bill by the hour and see when the bill dropped off, they would be aware because the signs are off, the exterior lights are off, and the interior lights are off.  Don't advertise you are open if you're not going to be open.\n\nI went by tonight at 11:10PM and everything was off.  I work in a restaurant and don't want to go home and cook for myself on the nights that I work because I spend 8 hours cooking for other people while I'm at work.  I really wanted Taco Bell tonight, but because of the unreliability of this location, I spent my money elsewhere.  \n\nI really just hope the owner of this location gets a handle on the hours of their store.  Inconsistency is not okay.  If the employees want to close at 11:00 like they apparently did tonight (like I said, the sign-lights were off, the drive thru lights were off, the interior lights were off... on the whole, the place screamed, \"Don't spend your money here!\"), then that is fine... just be open about it.  Don't promise the public hours and don't deliver.\n\nI know this is a long review for Taco Bell, but I kept pulling for this place to get it together.  After four months of never knowing what the hours were going to be at this location, I finally convinced myself to write a review.  In a simple phrase... \"This location lacks on the most important function of customer service: Consistency.  There is none.\"", "business_id": "l8v1GHaB4CsryK6MioZ21A", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-05-08", "type": "review"}

I thought that was very rude especially when I know there is such an item and that I always order the same thing and have for years.  So when I get my food everything is wrong.  They gave me the crunch wrap.  I talked to the manager and told her I wanted the gordida supreme.  She knew exactly what I was talking about.

I never thought I would review a fast food joint on Yelp! Where to begin...my first time at this Jack in the Box was a 'walk-through' where I tried to persuade the nice lady at the window to let us buy food, as we were in no condition to be driving. She said it was against the rules and she could get in trouble, but we could probably easily persuade someone in a vehicle...which we did, The food was of course awesome, but I believe anything is probably amazing considering the state we were in that night. \n\nThe second time I was actually driving through after being DD for a birthday bash late in the evening. Ironically, I was asked to help some 'walkers' get their food. I also learned from these late night patrons that the sweet lady at the late-night window was Tess and that they always call in great reviews for her, which I found quite hilarious coming from two drunk burly men! Hahah, makes me laugh just remembering the image. I came to realize after living in this neighborhood for a while that this place has quite a few late-night regulars! \n\nIn addition another afternoon, after leaving the pool, my friend and I were starving and I volunteered to pick-up some food at good old Jack in the Box. My friend had recently become vegan, which I had forgotten up until my arrival at the menu.....hmmmmm, what on earth will I get her besides fries?! So I consulted another friendly Jack in the Box employee at the window and asked her if it was possible to take all the meat and cheese off the chicken fajita pita and add as many vegetables as they had. She also put every sauce in the bag because I was clueless in the vegan department. This along with some churros and my friend was quite impressed and she said it was quite tasty!!! \n\nThis place looks like any other Jack in the Box, and really probably tastes like most (it is always quite fresh though).

I just didn't see it... I only regret that maybe someone else was missing those items in their order : (\n\nBut the unthinkable, and the one I cannot wrap my head around, is that we had ordered a box of churros and... They didn't cover them in sugar and cinnamon! that is unforgivable : P\nIt bothers me enough when they don't do it evenly and some of them have sugar/cinnamon, and some have barely any... but skipping it altogether? I would give them zero stars if I could...\n\nI know this is making me sound like I am a very demanding person, but honestly I do not think I am. \nAny of these incidents on its own would have been within my tolerance level... but delay, wrong order, no cinnamon/sugar? that was a little too much for a not so much of a morning person like me.", "business_id": "ajf3Myr1PKX9RaLS_Ukc8A", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-04-06", "type": "review"}

The interesting thing is, the last time I had anything close to that there was a much older manager who'd been doing it for years.  Everyone in the place seems pretty young - but they seem to have a great sense of pride in doing the job.

We went through the drive-through and not only were the employees patient with us, but once they had our order, they were very fast and made every order perfect to our standards. \n\nMy sister got a strawberry shortcake shake, and it was quite fabulous. Every bite was packed with flavor, I'm sure they put more of the stuff in it than icecream. The cup was overflowing, but wasn't dripping, and I appreciated them wiping down the cup for us (sometimes you get a sticky or dirty cup in other places). \n\nI bought a peanut buster parfait and HOLY COW. It is so freakin' good. They make sure to layer the icecream with a nice helping of hot fudge and Spanish peanuts. So every bite has the perfect mix. \n\nAgain, the service was great. I can tell that the employees take pride in a job well done. \n\nTIPS & TRICKS: \n* As good as the peanut buster parfait is, it can be slightly overwhelming. Ask for just a hot fudge sundae topped with Spanish peanuts, and you've basically got yourself a tiny, cute version of the parfait. \n* Look for them tipping over your shake if you are inside, they prove that their shakes are so thick it won't fall out of the cup. It's kind of their signature thang, and it's kinda fun to secretly hope your icecream will plop on the ground--even though it never does.", "business_id": "McDRY65dB9a2hyk_bzcnkQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-03-20", "type": "review"}

Granted, I have been to no Whataburger! since this location (which I tried twice since it is right across the road from were I live), but both experiences were SO bad that I will probably never try again. \n\nLet me start off by saying that both visits were identical, in every way. And both visits were terrible, in every way. Why did I give it another shot? Everyone has bad days. Now, I'm not really a big fan of fast food, but as I said earlier, it's right across the road from where I live, and we're all creatures of convenience from time to time, so why not? I pulled into the drive-thru, up the screen and was friendly greeted. I assessed the menu, as I always do, for probably one second too long, before I decided on one of the meals, which was I believe a cheeseburger meal of some sort. There was a huge sign offering a new lemon pie. I wanted to try a lemon pie. It sounded good, I like lemon stuff, why not? \"Sorry, we're out of lemon pies.\" Not quickly forgetting the large sign advertising the lemon pies, I reluctantly parted ways with the pipe dream that was: lemon pie. I drove directly up to the window with no wait (curiously uncommon in retrospect) and my money was taken quickly, change returned quickly. So far so good (aside from the bitter conclusion of the great lemon pie saga). But wait my friends, this is where the fun begins. As I part with my money, the window begins to close. Soon to be the barrier between myself and my impending dinner for an excess of 10 minutes. I wait, and I wait, and I wait some more. I see the woman who took my money pass by several times, no eye contact. And even though it cannot be expressed in writing how long it actually felt like waiting for this meal, it was a really long time. Think about the longest time you've ever waited at a fast food window for your food. Multiply that by at least 2, but most likely 3 or 4. That's how long I waited. Maybe one more second for extra emphasis. Finally, I was handed my meal, and I peeled off, extremely frustrated over this scenario. Oh, and of course the meal was absolutely terrible. And I do mean terrible. Old, cold and full of mold. Well probably, I mean it might as well have been.\n\nAnyway, a month or so later, I was hungry, nothing sounded good or convenient, when in the distance, loomed the W I had begrudgingly renamed WheresMyBurger? Ok, Ok I thought to myself. I'll give them one more chance. Pulled up to the window, picked out another meal, a chicken sandwich this time, I think, and yes you guessed it, a lemon pie. Guess what? They were fully stocked with lemon pies. Just kidding, out again. I wanted to drive away right there, but was hungry and decided to wait. Maybe it'll be quicker. Nope, as long as last time. And the food was even worse.\n\nSo in conclusion, and proceeding most likely the longest fast food review you have ever read, I urge you, fellow food eaters, to stay far, far away.", "business_id": "2qf-0qkDNh7r8iU0498htQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2009-04-02", "type": "review"}

It was more along the eggo waffle lines than somthing you would make for yourself,  made thin enough to fold without breaking.   They filled it with eggs,  cheese and sausage (or bacon), and even though the eggs are probably powered and definitely rubbery,  it auctiually works.   Pour the syrup they give you on the side over it,  and it works even better.  Also of note,  it was pretty small.   It's a good thing I ordered 2, but it makes me question if it's even worth $1.99.  \n\nThe Waffle taco is deffently worth a try,  but I'm not sure if it will be somthing I go back for on a regular basis.", "business_id": "JXu6H3o0G0SRw7AFrbc4qQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-04-27", "type": "review"}

This means that they care what you are putting into your body and what it is doing to the environment!! (score!)\n\nTheir simple menu makes ordering easy, but still allows you variety (Burrito, Salad, Tacos, Bowls) and caters to a carnivore, vegetarian, or vegan. In fact, they are pretty \"food-allergy\" safe in general. (Believe me, I have experience)\n\nAs if the food wasn't enough, they have two amazing ordering systems: Iphone App and Online Ordering. Let's talk about this online ordering system here for a minute, because it is what I think really sets the bar high for their competitors and other restaurants in general:\n\nI run a medium sized business and when lunch comes around, my Operations staff of ten has the WORST time executing something as simple as a lunch order. I know this sounds ridiculous, but believe me, it is as true as the day is long. This all changed when I discovered Chipotle Online Ordering. \n\nAnyway, I go online, login, and tell the system I want a group order. It then emails each of my employees giving them a link to order or a link to decline. If they choose to order, the link takes them right to an online order page with pictures, places for memos, etc. They select exactly what they want and it gets added to our group order.\n\nOnce everyone has ordered, I hit submit, pay by credit card, and fifteen minutes later you arrive at Chipotle, give them a jingle, and they will actually bring the food right out to your car for you. They call this the \"valet\" service. Perfect if you can't find a spot or it is raining out!!\n\nChipotle Executives must have sat down and thought of every pain a company could have in ordering lunch because I honestly cannot think of one thing that would improve this process. (Well, delivery would be nice... but that is what I have a receptionist for)\n\nI want to take a second to recognize this particular location, on 54th Street. Let me start by saying, I believe that you can taste the love in food... as in, if someone is cranky as shit, making your food, it is not as good as if they are smiling, enjoying their lives. I know this probably sounds crazy, but I swear on my right hand it is true. EVERY time I have ever eaten here (we are talking dozens of times) my food has been fabulous! I can taste the LOVE! \n\nOh, and about two hours after pickup, someone calls to ask how everything was and to let you know that they took special care to pack it up and make sure everything was right. If there is a Best Chipotle award, this location deserves it!\n\nMy final note: I get the salad with black beans, rice, tomato salsa, green tomatillo salsa, and guacamole. 100% vegan, 100% delicious. Under 500 calories, 17g of fat, and 14g of protein. And I am full. REAL full. \n\nSince I have started eating Chipotle 3-4 times a week, I have actually started losing weight. Perhaps I will be the next Jared!", "business_id": "Cv4kZH9zN0wpN2Drn0qkLg", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-04-13", "type": "review"}
