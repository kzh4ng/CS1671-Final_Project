It took about 10 mins to make my Roethlisberger, and the whole time, the guy was telling me about the shop, about the sandwich, and asking where I was from and how I heard about it. He was fun and interesting and interested in me. It felt like I had a friend. That's the kind of service which is hard to come by these days.\n\nWhat's more, the sandwich was spectacular. It always is, but he seemed to make it extra greasy, and he put 2 eggs on there instead of 1 for me even though I only asked for 1. Some of the best service I've had anywhere, actually.\n\nI would come back to this location, or the Strip District one, over all the others. I love it. Best service. Miles better than Primanti's.\n\nAnd more info:\n\nThis place has some of the best subs in Western PA, especially the delicious and appropriately named Roethlisburger, my favourite! Yum!\n\nWell, well, well. Long before I was ever officially into food and having friends and local fans of my music pick out where I was supposed to eat in any given town I was visiting, I knew about Peppi's. That was because I was once watching the Steelers on a given Sunday (during their famous Cowher Superbowl Winning Run I think), and I saw a special on this little sandwich place making a Roethlisburger. It seemed like they put everthing imaginable on it \"plus an egg\". The \"plus an egg\" thing intrigued me, so when I finally made it to Pitt, I gave it a try.\n\nPlus an egg indeed! My word! It's actually spicy minced sausage (greasy as hell) with all sorts of goodies on it.... er... \"plus an egg\". It helps that these folks are some of the friendliest people you'll find. The Strip District folks asked for a signed CD and gave me a free Roethlisburger in return. The Downtown location gave me a free portion of fries because I had to wait about 30 seconds longer than they said I would have to wait. So really, whether you're looking for good service or good sub sandwiches (is that really a choice?), Peppi's is a great selection. I'm sure a lot of their other food is good too, but anyone that names a sandwich after the local hero and my favourite (joint) QB, is going to get my business, and since that sandwich is so delicious, it's the only thing I've ever ordered since I started going there.", "business_id": "pvGT62T6Ci1LKOS9DL42pg", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-12-05", "type": "review"}

Both were incredibly delicious, and I could tell the cheese was freshly-made. The basil was pungent and pristine (no holes in the leaves or discoloring), and the EVO they used was obviously fairly high quality. Yes, it's a very simple dish, but the quality of the ingredients is what counts. I give them full marks on both quality and presentation. And for the price, they gave me enough food to completely fill myself up. I left a bit bloated, but I would have definitely ate more had they set another plate of that delicious mozzarella in front of me. I seriously can't overstate how fantastic the cheese was. And they had fresh (not dried or old) whole black peppercorns on the table to grind onto the salad! They tasted almost as good as the pepper we used to get fresh right off the trees in our backyard.\n\nReally impressed with the quality of the ingredients here.

In those days, there was Katz Deli, several Miracle Mile locations, Chompie's and a few other ill fated places (anyone remember Hollywood Deli?). I currently live in one of the best food meccas of the West Coast and can't get really good Jewish deli (Saul's is not great folks, and no, I have not tried Miller's yet). \n\nWhen Mom and Grandma picked me up from the airport, I had suggested we stop at Scott's to give them a try on the way to Sun City. None of us had been there in several years and I was really excited at a prospect for a delicious hot pastrami sandwich on rye. We got there, walked in and I noticed that the place itself looked a bit run down and dare I say, a little dirty? The owners are the same but the guy behind the counter who used to be friendly and Hamish just sat there like a schlub. We were directed to a table, and I immediately noticed how large their menu was. I ordered my sandwich sadly assuming that my regular hot pastrami would be (a) HOT and (b) on Karsh's rye since Karsh's is right next door. Neither was the case when my sandwich arrived and the pastrami was not delicious and I asked the waitress if I was mistakenly given the \"lean\" type of pastrami and she said I was not. Mom had a tongue sandwich and thought it was \"okay\" but she is not as picky (bitchy) as I am and Grandma had blintzes which did not look homemade but that of the frozen variety (I hope I am wrong here). Service was fair. Not warm and not quite the NY attitude that passes in these types of establishments.\n\nAfter our experience I will no longer suggest Scott's and will have them drive directly to Chompie's.", "business_id": "PxeX1M8WtyPxX1MuuGIh-g", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-02-20", "type": "review"}

Maybe it is my secret desire to keep it a secret, as best as I can, so that it does not turn into a zoo everyday and I can't get my yummy sammies. \n\nIt is also extremely surprising to me that some have gone to lengths of posting a negative review of The Duck. It seems that in those cases they are wanting The Duck to be something it's clearly not; a mainstream-mass production-delivary running-squeeky clean-just-like-every-there kinda place. If that's what you are looking for then I would suggest going to AJ's, they might be a better fit for you.\n\nDuck and Decanter has been around for longer than I have been around. They have won award after award for the best sandwich in town. I am surprised Kanye hasn't busted in on a subway commercial and told Jared that he would let him finish, but Duck and Decanter has the best stuff EVER! It has a homey feel, that makes you almost say (as Jeff L. put it) \"Am I still in Phoenix?\" \n\nThey have daily soups and special sandwiches. Their cheese is out of this world, the best provolone I have ever had for sure. They slice all their meat in house and very thin, perfect! I would tell you what sammy is my favorite, but that list would go on way too long. Turkey on a croissant, bree with roasted red peppers and prosciutto, garlic chicken salad, BLT.... \n\nThe Duck is the perfect spot to have lunch out on the patio on a sunny Saturday or Sunday. They have a musician playing music most of the time and sometimes even have cute little farmers markets and art fests. It is perfectly tucked back in the shopping center with Sports Authority shielding you from the hustle and bustle. There is a fun grass area for pets and children to run around on. They also have some great knickknack shopping available to pa-ruse while you wait for your food. They have all kinds of coffee, tea, dishware, cookware, marinades, candy, drinks, wind chimes, magnets, jewelry, specialty gifts, and so on and so on. You can also call ahead and reorder to avoid the sometimes very long line. \n\nHave fun!", "business_id": "HIiVx2mseVWKtx8TKfWC_A", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-02-15", "type": "review"}
