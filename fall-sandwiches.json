Way to go Justin!  The restaurant is in a strip mall across from the Dairy Queen.  The grill is right up front so you can see them cooking.   They have counter space for eating and tables/booths for 4.   Don't expect to sit at one table if you have more than 4. They have a great looking breakfast menu.   We all got burgers of varying kinds!  They were tasty!   The buns were buttered, toasted and soft.  Yum!   the amount of butter didnt bother me  but it did my whiny mother. Who whined even though there is a no whining sign as you walk in the door.   We ordered fresh cut fries as onion rings.  Both of which were great.  The half order was plenty and a nice option to a full order.   The restaurant was full of local men at lunch which is usually a good sign.  I give it a 4 star only because of the waitress who kind of threw straws, silverware and napkins at us as she walked behind the counter.  At least she didn't throw the food when it came!   She also served the fries and Onion rings way before our burgers came out which was kind of weird.   They were nice and hot but would have been cold had we waited for the burgers.   It didn't factor into my four star rating but I deduct a star from nephew because he invited us out to lunch then allowed me pay!   Just kidding Justin!

I had wanted to dine at Atria's for their Oktoberfest menu, and with Saturday night being the last of October, I made reservations for a friend and I at the PNC Park location.  Just to be sure, I called the restaurant and asked if the location was featuring the Oktoberfest menu.  The girl who answered assured me that they were. \n\nWhen we checked in, I again asked if they were doing the Oktoberfest menu, and again was assured they were although they did not give me the special menu which was sitting next to the regular menu at the host's podium.\n\nI didn't see any of the Oktoberfest specials listed on the menu, so I asked our server, a pleasant young man named Qwan about it.  He told me that the O specials were listed in a box on the lower left hand corner of the menu.  When I questioned the skimpy selection given there, he told me that they were not featuring the entire Oktoberfest menu on weekends at that location, but only a selection of appetizers and small plates.  He told me that all other locations were featuring the whole menu.   He seemed surprised and disinclined to believe me when I told him that that was not satisfactory, especially in light of the fact I had called to check and had been told that the special menu was being offered, and that we would be leaving. I got on Open Table and secured a reservation for dinner at their Wexford location, a half-hour's drive out of town. I didn't speak to anyone from the restaurant's management because we had to leave to make our reservation time at the Wexford location.\n\nIt is certainly any restaurant's right to serve whatever menu or part of a menu they wish, but they should also inform people when they call if they are not honoring the complete published special menu advertised.  \n\nThe food and service at the Wexford location were acceptable other than a spinach salad that arrived only after I had asked about it and without the warm sweet and sour dressing advertised on the menu.

After trying a battleship sub this weekend, I can say without reservation that the subs here are the best in PGH, without a doubt.  If you haven't tried one, you need to ASAP!\n\nGiven that I've been wanting to try a battleship for a long while, a friend and I decided to pick one up and have a picnic in nearby Frick Park.  We called in our order, and they gave us an estimate of about 45 min., which worked well given that we had other errands to run.  By the time we arrived at Triangle, our battleship was ready, so we were able to cut in line, pay ($14.75), and be off to have our picnic.\n\nUnwrapping the sub, it was immediately apparent that it encompassed 26\" of goodness.  Since it wasn't pre-cut, I tore it in half crosswise, which gave each of us 14\" to chow down on. The sub was generously filled with meats and cheeses, with a sufficient but not overwhelming amount of vegetables.  The bread was substantial and of good quality, and didn't tear or crumble as we ate our portions of the sub, as lesser quality bread does.  I ate half of my portion, and my friend was unable to finish his, despite intending to do so.  I ate the other half for lunch the next day, and it was almost just as good as it was upon receipt.\n\nBoth my friend and I were very impressed with the quality of the battleship, and it kept us full for a subsequent long-ish walk in the park.  I'd highly recommend it as an ideal picnic item.  Whether you live near Swissvale or not, be sure to try a battleship, since it's without a doubt the best sub in PGH!", "business_id": "DzOPHyrG2XuVqKEvHCnN7w", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-09-21", "type": "review"}

The sandwich bread is two thick slices of soft, white italian bread.  They put at least half a pound of meat on it, plenty of cheese, tomatoes, and a fresh coleslaw (not the mayonaissey type that I was expecting).  It's more like a marinated shredded cabbage, the marinade is tangy and vinegary.  The piece de resistance is that the sandwich also contains a huge mound of fries right in the middle.  The fries taste fresh, reminiscent of boardwalk fries back in the day, only better.  At the table they had ketchup, mustard and apple cider vinegar!  Any one from MD would appreciate that ;-)  All I needed was Old Bay seasoning and it woulda been heaven.  Maybe next time I'll take that in my purse...ssshh!

Whenever I go to these types of iconic regional dining establishments, I order the house specialty to best judge the place on its supposed merits. Since it was 11 in the morning, I chose not to order Primanti's #1 best seller, which the waitress told me was beer, but perhaps that would have made my experience better. As it was, I ordered the #2 best seller, the cheese steak. It was heinous. \n\nThink a grimy, mechanically separated Salisbury-style steak with a meager slice of provolone on sliced Italian bread served signature Primanti-style: with coleslaw, tomatoes, and fries.\n\nFirst, the steak was disgusting: terrible flavor (smelled and tasted like hippie armpit, which I'm not necessarily opposed to as long as it's not involved in something I'm trying to eat) with a gross, processed meat texture. Secondly, the fries easily overwhelmed the sandwich, with their old fryer grease taste. Additionally, the sandwich was unwieldy and threatening to fall apart at every turn--a trait I don't hold against decent-tasting sandwiches, but this lack of structural integrity just added insult to injury. \n\nMy dining partners were equally disgusted by their choices: corned beef and ham & cheese sandwiches, respectively. Easily the best part of the meal was the Smallman Street Fries, and those were equally lack-luster. The \"bacon\" was simply bacon bits (oh, the humanity!), the chili was uninspired, and the cheese sauce and sour cream did little but soggy the fries. (Did I mention they tasted like old fryer grease?)  \n\nI will never go back and I will immediately disregard the culinary opinions of anyone who thinks Primanti Bros. produces decent food.", "business_id": "NeUf9FyCCIN4MEseNyqkXQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-09-08", "type": "review"}

Just to get a seat here I had to wait standing up watching people eat like a creepy stalker just to see who would get up first and finally when I got a seat no one cleaned our table for a while or even took our order cause no one even knew we had been seated. If we were bad people we could have stolen the check from the last table as they had paid with cash. Once we got a servers attention and got the table cleared and our drinks and food ordered the server forgot our drinks and when we where finally able to flag her down our food came out not even 5 minutes later. In total about a 30-40 minute wait from arrival to food. Don't even think about getting a refill I had to walk in and ask the bartender for refills for me and my family after being ignored several times. When we were done we wanted to leave but couldn't till we paid the bill and because we paid with credit card we had to wait for the server to return with our card.

When I'm in the mood for them, they are fantastic. So when my mother and aunt came to visit da Burgh for the first time they were intensely curious about local restaurants, and this one came up. They thought it sounded fun and different, but since one is pescatarian leaning to the veg side, and the other is gluten intolerant, I really didn't think Primanti would be the best place to take them.\n\nWalking around down town we passed this one, and they wanted to sit down and give it a try. It was a beautiful day so we sat outside, which was really amazing. We were also amazed by our server. By the end of the meal, we were amazed she remembered to show up at work at all. In fact, its a distinct possiblility that she didn't ever work there, and was just confused and thought she was at the greek place across the square. You don't go to a sandwich shop to be blown away by your server, but there is a minimum standard you should aspire to, and she was far off that mark.\n\nShe took forever to get there, but it was no hardship sitting outside on a beautiful day with two of my favorite gals. We talked about the menu, Auntie decided to order anything with no bread, with some loaded fries. Mom wanted a sardine sandwich, but only if its the sardine filets, she doesn't like the kind with bones. She is not one to make a fuss, so figured cheese and egg would be fine too. \n\nWhen she came around for drinks, they got a water and a pop. I asked if she had PBR, and she replied she didn't know. Then continued to stand there, pen in hand, ready to write my drink order down. OK then, how about I just have a diet pop. Before she ran off, we ordered our meals. I asked her if the sardines have bones in them or not. She looked up from her note pad and looked at me with a look that said {insert foul insult here} and shrugged. A big, slow, deliberate shrug. Not a word. And then just stood there waiting to write my order down. After a good, long, awkward pause, she said \"I don't know.\"  All three of us just looked back at her, waiting, until eventually she sighed, held her pad down by her side, and with a big roll of the eyes, asked if I wanted her to check. Yes. Please do.\n\nSo then she ran off, and started running food out to tables all around and refilling drinks. Running the sandwiches, she would grab two or three tables at a time, and then put all the sandwiches down, sort of paw through them to see what was what, and leave theirs and take the rest. It was just strange.\n\nShe came back, and without looking up announced \"Don't matter, we are out of sardines anyways.\"Facepalm! From the length of time she had been inside the restaurant, I doubt she even asked. Mom, very uncomfortable that her question had become such a horrible inconvenience, asked for egg and cheese. Auntie ordered loaded fries to start, then her corned beef with no bread. The waitress told her she already gets fries with her sandwich, but she wanted them anyways. I got balogna, just because neither of them would ever guess what jumbo means.\n\nOf course, the order came out quickly, and wrong. Mine was fine the way it came, but not what I asked for. Mom was the same. Auntie was fine, but no loaded fries every showed up. Until we got the check, that's where they were. Getting those taken off was another huge inconvenience to our poor server. \n\nMy Aunt picked up lunch, and left the tip. I don't know what she left, but I think that probably amazed the server as much as her server amazed us. All in all, I reckon she enjoyed our lunch together just as much as we did.", "business_id": "NeUf9FyCCIN4MEseNyqkXQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-09-12", "type": "review"}

And I've traveled to the north, south, east, and west of this great country.  So, I've been around the food block to know a good sandwich when I see one... and the sandwiches here are off da hook!  It's probably unlike any other sandwich you've ever had (unless you're a Pittsburgher, duhhh).  Who puts French fries on a sandwich?  And piles on the sweet and sour cole slaw?  On soft, thick sliced French bread?  Primanti Bros does!  \n\nI was in town for work, and of course had to catch a Penguins game...  and was glad to see how close this place was to the arena!  My co-worker and I came here afterward and were majorly impressed.  The corned beef one is sooooo good.  I seriously was sad when it was finished, haha.  I'm sure it's not super healthy, but it didn't feel unhealthy either.  It wasn't greasy, there weren't too many fries on it (a good thing, it was balanced well with probably 8-10 fries on top), the slaw was fresh and crisp, and the corned beef wasn't too greasy at all.  That soft French bread is the perfect surrounding for it all.  \n\nThe place itself is cool.  It has a nice patio facing the Square, and the inside has a cool diner feel to it.  Service was great and quick, parking was easy... but probably because it was late on a weeknight.  Metered parking, but it was free at that hour. :)  There aren't that many spots on the street, so during the daytime lunch rush or weekend I heard that there is a parking structure nearby.  Oh and prices?  Very reasonable for the amount of food you get.  One sandwich is around $7-8.  I think my sandwich had around 8 slices of corned beef, so that's a great deal. \n\nAlso, for what it's worth... we heard from native Pittsburghers that this one in Market Square and the other one on The Strip are the only two you should go to, as the other locations are not up to the same quality.", "business_id": "NeUf9FyCCIN4MEseNyqkXQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-10-26", "type": "review"}

The drinks are absurdly cheap and the pour wondrously stiff. The people who drink there are friendly and when I've gone there with my husband we've been just left alone to drink and relax and when I've gone there with female friends old guys sometimes talk to us in a totally jovial/friendly/non-threatening way, but I've never had a problem just having my own space.\n\nThe bartenders are so sweet and as I said, very generous with their pours.\n\nSeriously, I love Armand's Bar.

I seriously think this is the best fish sandwich in the city, and that is saying something in a place where many restaurants do a great fish sandwich.\n\nSo, this is five stars for a *dive bar* because if you want the *dive bar* experience, this is it, and it's awesome. Obviously this is not a place to go get a great Sazerac (er, or any Sazerac), and yes, the bathroom's kind of iffy, but if you just want a place that is totally chill and downtempo where you can drink with friends, it's a great spot.", "business_id": "FD6OocZdFUfE2J5H0WN4fA", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-11-06", "type": "review"}

We had no thin crust, real New York style pizza place. The sauce is good and tangy, the slices are huge, there's just nothing special about the place. Lately (for the past few years) it seems like they're not baking the pizza all the way or something. The pepperoni are never crisp, the crust is kind of pasty and chewy, and the cheese doesn't really get golden brown anymore. It's a descent pie, I think they can do better. They do have pretty good sub sandwiches, fresh salads, and garlic knots that smell amazing when hot out the oven! The offer pizza by the slice but only cheese and pepperoni. I've never been sure of why they can't just throw a couple of toppings on top of an already baked pie and throw it in the oven. They can charge extra! When I order a slice, I usually have to take it home to warm it up or brown it to get the crust crisp. The wings they offer are tasty and spicy even though their just frozen wings, they're not bad. Tony's doesn't have any competition too close by (when I go it's for convience), they're lucky in that sense. And, they close very early on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday night. If it's after 10pm and you want pizza, don't call Tony's. They serve beer and wine, maybe they should add a tv or two where people can hang a little and enjoy the pizza. It can be quiet and your only option is to look out the window, if you go alone lol.", "business_id": "sJtGRBWYUj013nkFA4Hrdg", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-10-02", "type": "review"}

So much so that you'll want to go when the place isn't crowded so that you have a reasonable chance of looking it over before ordering so as not to get in the way of anyone else.  That generally doesn't happen in most hot dog stands, either on the street or indoors because you have about two choices: All the way or plain, where you add your own condiments.\n\nAnd the rest...\n\nThough you can find Italian Beef and Chicago-style dogs in the same place, you don't always want to.  Focus on your specialty.  And that's the real problem here.  There is so much going on - visually and on the grill - that they don't seem to do anything really well.\n\nThough the staff is nice enough, and food is decent, it's just not that great.  Fries are limp.  House-made chips are nice and thin, but they are so thin that they can't support anything (dressing, chili leavings from dogs, not even the crunch from the fryer).

(cool, i've never had them b4 either) chips are pretty good.\n\nSo, I get back to the office ready to tear into this burger. So... my first bite was filled with Mushrooms.

Like Nicole said, is it the best Chicago dog I've ever had? Not even close. Is it the best Chicago dog in Charlotte? I say YES. They've got the traditional ingredients down pat, the Vienna beef sausage (yes, that's what a \"hot dog\" is.....an encased meat sausage), the neon green relish, the steamed poppy seed bun (which is the quintessential defining part of a Chicago dog), sport peppers, tomato, a pickle and MUSTARD (Chicago dogs NEVER, repeat, NEVER EVER use Ketchup!). \n\nSo I got a Chicago Dog and a special called the Fire Dog today which was a spicy Polish sausage with grilled onions, brown mustard and I opted for the sauerkraut. It was a good dog, with all the flavors expected. Fries are usually good here, but my criticism is that they lack some seasonings.....hell use Lawry's Seasoned Salt or something and fry them a tad longer to get more of a crisp on them. They're not bad but certainly CAN be better!\n\nBeing a lover of Portillos, Mr. Beef and Al's in Chicago, Matt's version of Chicago Beef is just meh.....sausage isn't bad but their beef just isn't flavorful enough for my tastes. I mean it's not bad, just not up to my expectation from what I remember from back home. OK now I'm being picky and critical.....me bad. \n\nFor first time visitors, just know that the portions are NOT very big (at least for the dogs). Recommend getting a combo with 2 Chicago Dogs or a combo Beef/Sausage. Even the females in my group complained that one dog wasn't quite enough. Jumbo dog is also an option. They should offer a TWO DOG JUMBO combo for us bigger eaters.\n\nSo overall I love Matt's as it does provide me with a LITTLE taste of home. I can only hope that SOMEONE opens up a REAL CHICAGO PIZZA place here in Charlotte....while I love thin pizza, there IS MUCH BETTER out there so please someone, open a Giordano's here!

Very quick in service, and I had 2 boxes to take with me to go! Tons of gyro meat, but it was a bit dry. Their pita is really good, I think they fry it, giving it that extra yumminess. I ended up making my own gyro with the veggies from the salad. Their fries were the crinkle cut kind, and it was good, but way too much! I couldn't even eat half my meal!\n\nThey have the special ice, which they put a ton of, which means getting a refill when you pick up your food! Staff are all very friendly and courteous as well.

Cold cut sandwiches sound so boring to me because they're something I can make at home and usually bring to work for lunch.  So to go out for lunch at work and pay more to get the same thing is very unappealing.\n\nTagging along for lunch one day, though, I went to McAlister's Deli.  I was very impressed (and overwhelmed) by their menu.  Not only were there cold cut sandwiches, there were hot sandwiches, salads, soups, and baked potato options, as well as full-on hot comfort food entrees like meatloaf and roast beast with gravy.  I loved seeing the corned beef and pastrami on the menu.  Mmm...  A lot of sub/sandwich shops don't carry those two meats, preferring to stick with \"the basics.\"  I went with the Muffaletta, though, because it's fun to say and sounded yummy.  Half Muff, please!   \n\nWe returned on another occasion and I wanted something fairly light, but it was also a chilly day.  The soup and salad combo did the trick.  I was one happy boy.  \n\nThe entrees are good-sized and there is plenty of seating so customers aren't all on top of one another.

Also, it's part of my goal to try as many food establishments as I can in the area and yelp about them while I'm at school here.\n\nI didn't know Silver Mine was a chain until after I got home and googled it. It definitely doesn't feel or look like a chain, which in my opinion is a good. Most of the locations are out west in Colorado and Arizona and there really aren't nearly as many locations as Jimmy John's or something similar.\n\nI walked into the place which is right next to a Subway, Kam's and the old C.O. Daniel's, which could be described as a very good or very bad location depending on the circumstances, however it is close to most things on campus. Either way, upon entry I was greeted with some fantastic bluegrass music and a mountain/silver mine themed sub shop, which was refreshing and definitely not something I've ever seen before.\n\nI perused the menu and settled on a variation of my favorite roast beef, which was interestingly called a \"Comstock\", and I also noticed many other sub names were geographic locations or western/mining-themed names, how cool!?\n\nI got home and began to tear into the sub. I was pleasantly surprised at how tasty it was. Decent flavor on everything and definitely not the same mediocrity as the Subway next door (or any Subway, for that matter). However, I wouldn't call it the best sub I've ever eaten. To be blunt about it, I think Jersey Mike's has got Silver Mine beat in terms of quality and maybe taste, but Silver Mine is definitely cheaper than Jersey Mike's and also has more of a variety of non-sub items like soup, breakfast and salads. \n\nI would also like to say that Silver Mine has very late store hours as well as delivery available as added conveniences. \n\nI was impressed with Silver Mine Subs, I do recommend it for anyone looking for a sub sandwich.

Wikipedia that Ish ladies and Gent's; Kansas City Bullriders). Well, the driver and my door man both called 3 times. I'm assuming the driver eventually came in and grabbed the bass guitar and strummed it out. Maybe he had a slice with us? Who really knows these things. However, I do know that I was insanely impressed with D'moes... from the left overs I ate the next when I could remember. It was pretty darn good. Between the awesome'ness that is called \"their customer service\" and the legit taste it left in my mouth, I'm a believer, unless, if I say I'm not, will I get a commercial?... hmmmm....

None of these adjectives turned out to be an accurate descriptor. In fact, the food at Zoe's kitchen took 30 minutes to come out and was disgustingly bland and in a few cases, quite gross. \n\nWe stopped in for lunch last week. The place was packed, but the line to order moved quickly, so we incorrectly assumed that we would also get our food quickly. More on that in a second. In terms of the menu, we were shocked at how uninteresting the menu options seemed. Even though the menu was decently sized and we are open to lots of different types of food and flavors, we found ourselves completely unable to choose and not drawn to any individual option. \n\nEven though I'm not a vegetarian, I prefer lunch sandwiches with no meat, so I was also quite irritated that the only vegetarian sandwiches were the grilled cheese and grilled feta. This is 2008, and the non-meat options at a lunch spot should be more imaginative than cheese slapped on some bread. In the end, I still ended up ordering the grilled cheese (nothing else sounded good!) and my husband selected the Greek Chicken Marinara. \n\nWe sat down at the table, displayed our number card, and just waited. And waited. And waited. After literally waiting for 25 minutes, I checked in with the assistant manager who was manning the pick-up counter. She went into the kitchen, checked on our order, and said it would be just a \"few more minutes.\" She even had a server bring us two slices of chocolate cake as some sort of  token of their sympathy, but it was super-dry and totally gross. Thanks, but no thanks. I'm just glad we didn't pay $2 for each slice!\n\nIt wasn't until 10 minutes later when I lost my patience and told the same server that we wanted our food immediately that we finally received it. We have a higher-than-average awareness of the difficulties of working in food service, but we found it un-acceptable that a non-full-service restaurant would take 35+ minutes to bring us two sandwiches. If they can't handle the catering, to-go, and eat-in order volume, they should hire more staff members. \n\nAs if the slow service wasn't painful enough, my grilled cheese was completed charred (literally burned and black). After one bit of the accompanying slaw, which was soaked in mayonnaise and soggy, I  immediately walked back to the assistant manager, handed her the plate, and asked her to refund me for my plate. To her credit, she complied, but the wait had already been so egregious that I wasn't about to just write the long wait and gross food off and decide to return. \n\nMy husband's Greek Marinara was not as terrible but was still bland and completely un-memorable. The bread was a plain roll, the chicken breast strips were formed and tasted totally processed, and the \"Greek\" marinara tasted like Prego. The only tasty part of his meal was the side of bagged chips!\n\nI guarantee you that we won't be back to Zoe's Kitchen. We are huge fans of fast, casual, and fresh lunch food, but we found the food at Zoe's to be anything but.", "business_id": "trAvQPp7gps0Btk-2AmLpw", "stars": 1, "date": "2008-09-23", "type": "review"}

I think they have a leaky roof, but it has been weeks, maybe even months, and there is still water. This is hazardous and just plain disgusting. Also, the restaurant is just dirty. I had to ask to have 2 different tables wiped down, and the crumbs from the table were wiped onto the chairs.

Great color scheme. The interior was cute to match and even had local artists' works propped up on ledges which was nice to see the local support. I couldn't figure out if this was a chain or locally owned because it looked borderline corportate inside but had a lot of \"we support local\" types about. \n\nAs a first-timer I asked the counter girl her suggestion and she (and the woman behind her) were kind enough to offer up good suggestions. I order Zoe's Club Pita with pasta salad for $8. I walked away but doubled back to ask if it had come with a drink, the counter girl said no but gave me a drink anyway... uh, hello, so nice!\n\nI'm glad I took the workers suggestions because the pasta salad was AMAZING! A generous portion of feta cheese and tomatoes was delightful, my only complant was there wasn't enough. I wanted more!\n\nMy sandwhich on the other hand was a different story. The pita pocket had huge hole in it making it tear and really difficult to handle. The meat wasn't positioned all the way into the pocket and most of it was falling out the top. It was like three slices of ham had been wrapped around huge slices of grilled chicken and shoved into the pita. I was pretty sad to see this. I ate the whole thing and although it was tasty, it wasn't easy to keep altogether.\n\nI really appreciated the counter girl's kindness in giving me a drink but the status of the sandwhich was enough to probably deter me from returning.

As you're standing in line either waiting for your pick up or ordering on the spot...you're forced to look at that beautiful pizza.  \nThe cheese looks gooey, the toppings fresh, and the crust crusty.  It looked so good to me that I ended up ordering a slice even though I had already called something else in.  \nI got ham and pepperoni.  It was honestly irresistible looking in its tray.  But when I got it back to the office I was like, \"Oh.\"\nI could see that it wasn't as thick as I first thought, and a bit more grease than expected too.  The crust had the consistency that I like - crusty and, well...crusty.  But its taste was less than stellar, just kinda bland and greasy.  \nSo now I know all that glitters isn't gold.\nNow on to what I actually ordered - the Italian beef.  I never had one like this before - its more like a hoagie than the thing I'm used to getting everywhere else.  The meat was thicker and chunkier (that's what she said), whole slices of green peppers, and really no juice.  Don't get me wrong, though...it tasted great.  Everything was fresh and the meat ended up being very tender and juicy.  I even liked the bread it was on.  But its not my beloved italian beef sandwich I'm used to.\nI went again the next day.\nThis time I ordered the gyro, with the idea that if they get the gyro wrong I can take them off of my wall of menus.\nIt was a traditional gyro with cucumber sauce, onions, tomato and a soft pita...but it was only ordinary.  Again, it tasted fine and good, but it wasn't one of the best I've had.\nAnd like the day before, I got messed up while I was in line looking at the food trays.  This time they had baked wing dings!  50 cent a wing was a bit expensive, but those little things were absolutely delicious!  They were seasoned so well.  And not greasy at all.  So good!\nTwo things about this place that will make me come back more than the food - the service and the prices.\nThe lady that works the cashier has such a warm smile and manner, like an old Italian mama.  And what I assume is the boss/owner was also very friendly and bubbly.  \nThe prices are some of the best in this downtown area that I've found so far.  I mean, under $5 for an Italian beef or a gyro???  When I got the pizza slice and the IB, I only paid like $8.50 or so.  ONE salad costs that much at some places.  \nThere is not a whole lotta room inside and seems to fill up quick, but there is seating outside too. \nSo to sum it up, If you didn't bring a lunch to work and have about $5, you can go here and have a tasty lunch.

So before I do that deal I'm saying goodbye to my favorite Phoenix delicacies. \n\nThis Place --ohhh. \n\nIt's sex. It's total sex. \n\nSometimes sex is nice. It's fun, it doesn't hurt, it's familiar. \n\nNot here. \n\nIt's like the shy unassuming person you never really thought of doin' it with before.  It's been in the neighborhood forever, you never really hear about how awesome it is, it doesn't look like much from the inside or outside. It kind of looks like an old school adobe Taco Bell. \n\nSo, never really having had a good Philly Cheesesteak sandwhich, I wasn't sure what to expect. \n\nThe Menu is pretty simple. 8 different cheesesteaks, gyros, subs, fries, onion rings, tasty cakes, salads, burgers. \n\nWell duh, I'll get a cheesesteak. \n\nThe cheesesteaks are 10 inches. \n\nEven after I saw that, I was thinking,\"I can take this\". I ordered a half mushroom one, a half pizza one. Thinking I could take 5 inches at a time, and save some for later. \n\nSo I began taking it. \n\nThis shy unassuming restaurant began showing how truly Freaky DeeKay it was. \n\nThe first bite was mind blowing, amazing, opening up whole new vistas of experience. I never knew it could be this good. The steak is chopped on the grill with olive oil, and then covered in white american cheese. The mushroom added the best mushrooms I have ever had on a sandwhich. The pizza side added really well done pizza sauce. \n\nThat first bite ohhh. \n\nThen thats where it got nasty, and rough.\n\nIt's too much! I thought I was tough, I thought I could take it- but this is fried red meat covered in fatty cheese encased in delicious carb centric white italian bread.  That first bite was amazing, but I wasn't sure this was for me. I was worried about the damage to my body. I didn't know if my heart could take it.\n\nThe sandwhich looked at me as if to say \"want me to stop?\". I considered that this was rough, this was new- but my 10 inch big boy was such a demonstration of mastery and experience, I couldn't stop. I NEEDED more.\n\nSo as I was abandoning myself to the experience I realized this was just on the brink of gross enough to be nasty and carnal, and refined enough to be a truly unique experience. There was no fatty pieces in the meat. It wasn't too hard and tough. It's astuteness tempered itself by being soft and delicate.  There were moments where I thought 'Oh my god, I have to stop, I think I might die!\" but I couldn't. I so couldn't.\n\nThis in not something I can handle every day. This sandwhich made me want to eat salads for the rest of the week. Not because I feel dirty or guilty, simply because I know taking this thing pushed the physical limits of my body. \n\nToo many of these and I could easily see myself crying in \nshame and lamenting  \"what man would want me now\"?", "business_id": "OoHWabV-ym7_HWlHeXTsVA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-09-11", "type": "review"}

Despite Best of Philly's derivation, it is, within reason, a very, very good sandwich.

I suggested Cibo, Matt's, or Valley Pizza, and he thought of Focaccia Fiorentina.  I thought FF sucked the first time I went there but was willing to give it another try. But when we got there ol' Dally had a \"better\" idea and suggested Athenian Express.\n\nAs we pulled in, some unacceptably angry looking woman glared at him for a reason that will presumably remain unknown to us.  (Please enjoy my multimedia Yelp.)\n\nhttp://twitter.com/spirit_fingers/status/5209414090\n\nIn retrospect, I think she was our guardian angel trying to scare us off.  Inside, the place looks quaintly divey.  I asked if anything was so much better than the gyro that I should get it instead, and was told that the gyro is the way to go.  Feta or no feta?  I wondered if it was an avalanche of feta or just a sprinkling.  He puts a lot on there.  Fine, no feta.  I get the potato salad with it, and an order of spanakopita--which I ordinarily love.\n\nWe sit outside.  The spanakopita arrives.  It has little cheese and is not flaky.  Tastes kinda like shit.  Served with crappy tzatziki, which I don't think is the appropriate side for spanakopita but whatevs.\n\nhttp://twitter.com/spirit_fingers/status/5209643122\n\nNext, my gyro arrives.  The gyro meat is covered in three slabs of tomato and a mountain of onions.\n\nhttp://twitter.com/spirit_fingers/status/5209752658\n\nAs you can see, at this point I'm fearing the worst.  Look, I like onions and all, but when you leave fresh onions out in the air for too long they become veeeerrrry rowdy.  Like so rowdy that eating one would be enough to burn your mouth and render you a pariah.  So all that's left of my gyro is three slices of \"gyro meat\" and tomatoes.  And the little side cup of tzatziki that is only filled a third of the way.  The gyro meat tastes like... nothing.  I am underwhelmed.\n\nI move on to my side of potato salad.\n\nhttp://twitter.com/spirit_fingers/status/5209805283\n\nNormally mustard potato salad has a pastelish yellow hue, but this one looked like it could be seen from space.  Whatever it was, it was odorless and flavorless, so I can only assume it's some undetectable poison like polonium-123.  If I die, I leave my rapier-like wit and boundless charisma to my son, Samir.  You all can fight over the rest.\n\nAnyway, the restaurant pretty much blew.\n\nhttp://twitter.com/spirit_fingers/status/5209947387\n\nI'm not an arsonist, it was a joke, relax.

I took a picture to prove that it literally only came with three slices. Whichever reviewer said that their sandwiches were bigger than a Kronos lied and lied mercilessly.

They taste like fries that come in a bag, no special seasoning or anything. \n- Cubs fans. Enough said. \n\nThe good:\n- I ordered fries, which I got, but they also gave me fruit. I don't know why, but this saved the review from being one star because the fruit salad had mango AND orange in addition to melons and strawberries.\n- Fast service. Damn fast.

While this place is conveniently close to my work, I am finding myself avoiding it every day during lunch time.

I am constantly picked on each time I go in there with constant \"oh im sorry did you want cheese on this side or that?\", \"girlfriend make up your mind!\", and \"laughs\" because I didn't want that extra high caloried 3rd cookie because it's 3 for a dollar (yes i like 2 and only 2 for the sake of not indulging myself...I think thats quite enough for my dollar thank you). As a customer, you're always supposed to walk out with a smile and experience a positive environment. Do I experience any of those? absolutely not, I find myself constantly muttering a bunch of rants each time I walk out in frustration that I as a customer am being picked on!! Perhaps that's their sense of humor, but they should realize that customer service is not a comedy show, and I don't have time for their silly remarks. Additionally, their \"welcome to subway\" is not welcome at all, especially when you don't even look at the customer while saying it. They're better off just not saying it all if it is not sincere.

I read it, half-confused, expecting more than just one wrap offered. I panicked for a half-second, since I was hungry for the Who's the Turkey, thanks to Sarah G's review. \n\nThe friendly guy behind the counter must have read my expression. He handed me a freshly printed menu. Brand new, he said; they debuted yesterday. Ah-ha. \"I've never been here,\" I admitted shyly.

Very cool. I picked up a couple free mags to peruse: Java and Urban Affair. Right on. Then I noticed them: stacks and stacks of Styrofoam cups. Weird. I figured a place like this wouldn't want to harm the environment. They even have a recycle-only bin near the trash. I was perplexed... and disappointed. I hate Styrofoam. For that alone, this place gets docked a single star. (I don't want to feel like I'm harming Mother Earth if I stop to eat here. I may bring in my own bottled water next time.)\n\nMy food arrived after a short wait. Beautiful.

Well I work in Tempe and That's A Wrap in Midtown Phoenix is so that place for me.\n\nTheir food is fresh and delicious, and considering how insane their lunch rush is, they do a pretty solid job of getting you in an out of there pretty damn quickly.\n\nSo, let's see. I've been there twice now during my \"I've got to get the F out of Tempe this second or I may actually shoot someone\" moments, and was pleasantly surprised on both occasions. The first time I went, I had the Buffalo 66 wrap, because if you've read a single one of my reviews, you know that I am incapable of saying no to Buffalo Chicken anything. The chicken breast was tender and extremely flavorful and the sauce was nice and spicy. The vegetables were really crisp as well.\n\nThe second time I went I got the Alota Fajita wrap mostly because I wanted to see if I could say it out loud without bursting out laughing. No real surprise, I could not. It was your run of the mill fajita wrap, again very tasty and flavorful, but not quite as good as my buffalo chicken wrap.\n\nThe place is very vegetarian-friendly, pro-natural ingredients and locally conscious, which I like, but in the business of full disclosure, it was just a little bit much. I don't want to pay $2-$3 for a can of shitty \"all-natural Black Cherry soda.\" Gimme a break. By all means, save those options for the marks with fat wallets that think buying the all-natural soda is making a positive impact on the environment, but do the rest of us a favor and throw some affordable regular ppl options out there as well.\n\nMinor rant aside, I am a very big fan of this place and will continue to flee my office for it.", "business_id": "ZoQAOnEFnyHjSpomtfqesA", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-11-30", "type": "review"}

We didn't even make it through the (new) front door before, the aroma of pizza hit Us.

Parking was a bit tight and not a lot of spaces in general but was luckily able to snatch one. There are two sides to enter, one for to-go and one for eat in. I walked inside and the d\u00e9cor was so cute, very vintage meets farmhouse feel. They wanted to stick me at a long table with another party of 2 but felt awkward so I went to sit up at the bar, since there weren't any small tables to choose from. Service was very fast, ordered a diet coke but received a coca cola \"light\", which in my opinion does not taste like diet coke. Oh well. \n\nI read their menu (which is VERY limited) and looked on their board for the specials of the day. There were a total of 4 sandwiches, 4 salads and 2-3 \"bar size\" options to choose from and that's all. Only 2 of the options had meat in them so I was a bit disappointed with that and neither option was what I wanted. I ultimately ordered the market sandwich, which was a roasted tomato, arugula and goat cheese on focaccia bread. I think the servers were bored because it wasn't busy and they kept circling around waiting for something to do, very weird. Maybe I noticed it more because I was alone? Anyways, I got my food within 5 minutes and it came with a tiny serving of coleslaw, which was made with apples and red onions. The sandwich was fine but nothing amazing...coleslaw was different but ate it in like 3 bites. I was still hungry after my lunch so decided to order the flourless chocolate cake for dessert...couldn't pass that up! It was really great, came with a vanilla bean cream on top to balance out the richness of the cake. I got the bill and it was $22 so not cheap...the market sandwich with no meat on it was $12! Yikes. \n\nAll in all, I just came to realize that Pane Bianco is just not for me. I know they have great ingredients and does have a certain appeal, very downtown. I did notice the dinner options and was curious if dinner time is a better time to go, since options were things I actually wanted to eat (stuffed peppers, posole, pasta, pizza).

Pane makes their sandwiches from locally sourced ingredients and home made mozzarella, which is that extra kiss that you look for in any decent meal.

My wife loves their tuna sandwich as well. \n\nHaving said that, I do have one minor criticism... the evening menu.  For the love of god leave the sandwiches on the menu in the evening.  I have sat outside so many times listening and watching people leave when they go in to pick up a sandwich in the evening only to find out that  it cannot be obtained.

A recent lunch with 5 colleagues was disappointing in terms of service and food. The peppered beef market sandwich was overpriced and sparce.The bread dominated the sandwich, with barely 3 oz of sliced roast beef, and onions that were not even close to being considered grilled. The onions overpowered the flavor of the beef, and had no caramelization of frill flavor.  The sandwich was disappointing with just about a tablespoon of side coleslaw. Service was even more disappointing with fundamentals of serving ladies first, reaching across guests, and stacking silverware and plates at the table. Overall, a disappointing experience.

Eating healthy has now becoming a part of my lifestyle. I was told this place was a sister company of another restaurant. \nIt's kinda hidden when we first pulled up next to a bicycle shop. They had a patio out front which was a nice option if you didn't want to eat inside. I didn't know what to expect before entering but when I entered the place, it seemed as if I was taken back in time. I was a little confused at what I've heard and the mental thought I already had, and the incorporation that was now in front of me. It was like an old, vintage, antique-ish, theme. (Maybe this shop is like those in Italy?) One side was to-go and other side was dine in with tables. It wasn't a busy lunch day but maybe half the tables were filled with people during this time. It was quiet, no music, and the sounds of your table neighbors.  I like this for the fact that you can actually talk and hear your lunch dates. The tables were already set with fork, knife, napkin, and menu. Presented a nice clean atmosphere.  They had a chalkboard up against the wall that noted the all the daily special, in this case lunch specials including meals and drinks. Our waitress was so kind to read and tell us the daily special. Looking through the menu, it wasn't so detailed with descriptions of what was inside each sandwhich or salad. Since it was a new place for me to try, I was all game for what the surprise would be. They had their sandwhich and salads and veggie soup in the front and drinks in the back. I heard their sandwhiches are pretty scrumptious but I was in the mood for eating like a rabbit, so I opted for a salad. I ended up getting the 2 wash ranch salad I believe is the name? As far as my date, he had the special pulled beef sandwhich and their square pieces of appetizer pizza.\nTo my surprise my salad was loaded. It came with a piece of bread wrapped in brown paper that reminded me that you would wrap fish if you were to get from a market. The salad had lots of dark mixed greens which had already been tossed in their dressing (delicious, but i cant figure out exactly what is in it!) and they had sliced one fresh tomato in half (which still had the vines on it) and a scoop of what looked like their version of chicken salad. Inside their chicken salad was tiny chops of chicken with red onion, celery, quinoa, and possibly minced parsely or basil? It was very delicous, light, refreshing, and made my tummy full and satisfied. Also, food came out quick. I think after ordering, it literally might have came out 7 min later. That was quite impressing. I would def recommend for people to try and I am definitely coming back for seconds another day, next time I'll try their sandwhiches.", "business_id": "-AAig9FG0s8gYE4f8GfowQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-10-17", "type": "review"}

It's such a strange little throwback to east coast style delis.  The service here is truly amazing, they just don't treat people like this much anywhere else.  They get to know you, they smile, wink, tell jokes, make you feel good about buying your lunch. I buy local whenever I can, and love that I can eat here before or after a little shopping jaunt to the ultra-local strip behind here that includes Halo, Frances, Red Hot Robot, Stinkweeds and Smeeks.  It's also right on the light rail.\n\nThe macaroni salad is my favorite anywhere.  I know everyone wants exactly what they want, which is often what their grandma/mom/Aunt Jenny made.  Lucky for me, this stuff tastes just like home to me. I can hardly drive by without stopping in for at the very least, a cup of macaroni salad. If I am lucky, I'm hungry, and I can get a cheese sandwich, (which is perfect in every way) or something with the Russian dressing on it.  (The Russian dressing makes me want to get naked and swim around in it.)\n\nThe weirdest thing about this place is the menu, which is on randomly placed sheets of paper hanging over the deli counter.  Do not rush, take your time.  Read it all, they don't mind.  They have a pre-printed menu, which has some (but not all) of the items on it, so you can start sorting things in your head.

I'm going to actually review while eating the food for the very first time. That's right, I just got home from Scott's Generation after waking up on a girlfriend's couch with a brutal hangover and a huge craving for matzo ball soup and chopped liver. I picked up a to-go order, and they're sitting in front of me right now, eagerly awaiting my noshing session.\n\nRight now, Scott's Generation is happily sitting at 5 stars. The employee handling my to-go order was awesome and seemed amused at my hangover remedy. Despite the fact that I love challah like a brother and could eat chopped liver for breakfast lunch and dinner, my parents insist I am not of Jewish heritage. However, there's never been an official paternity test, so I'm still holding out hope. On to the food!\n\nThe soup is fantastic! Lots of chunky veggies and chicken in a very tasty broth. The matzo balls are large with good texture. I would prefer a bit more seasoning, but I won't deduct a star because for all I know I'm just an Italian schmuck who doesn't know what a true matzo ball should taste like. But yeah, seasoning is good.\n\nOpening my bagel chips and...wtf? Is that a cinnamon raisin bagel chip! Sorry, deducting a star. Bagel chips are for soups and spreads. I don't care who you are, nobody wants a raisin in their soup. Throw them out!  Eating the chopped liver and....giving the star back! It's delicious and I haven't even mixed in any onion!  I don't think I realized how dense a half pound of chopped liver would be, I kind of wish I would have got some rye for a sandwich. Sorry, internal monologue creeping into review, I'll stop that now.\n\nFive stars for my first ever present-tense review! I can't wait to go back to Scott's to try the rest of their (very large) menu! Though for this trip, I'm glad I got out when I did. I was half drunk and the rainbow cookies were calling my name.

I've been missing my favorite Chicago deli and have been craving some good Jew food and I finally found it!  \n\nFor lunch I had a brisket sandwich on an onion roll with a side of kishke with gravy. It was excellent!  The beef was tender, flavorful and not dry, and the kishke was sliced,browned and skinless.  This is what I've been waiting for.  \n\nWhile at our table we had a great view of the deli cases and menu boards and I knew I would have to order some food to go for my Mom and for me.  I ordered the Mish mosh soup and that was just okay - the matzo ball was grainy, the kreplach was mostly dough and there was only one of each and no kasha like I'm used to when I order this soup back home.  The chopped liver was good, my Mom and her husband liked it a lot, but I think Don and Charlie's has the best chopped liver in the Phoenix area.  The best thing I brought home was the belly lox!  If I'm going to eat lox, it's going to be the real thing and taste like lox - not the tasteless nova lox that's served to the masses.  It was wonderful and salty and full of flavor and I have enough left for a sandwich tomorrow morning :)\n\nOverall this is the closes to a real Jewish Deli I've been to here in AZ - and I will for sure be back and try the corned beef/pastrami and potato pancakes next time!", "business_id": "PxeX1M8WtyPxX1MuuGIh-g", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-11-13", "type": "review"}

Expecting oozy swiss cheese. I could barely find it. The grilled onion  was inedible. How can you ruin onions?. I had to pull pieces out of my mouth. I don't think they were peeled. The pastrami was sky high but tough and not juicy. A tablespoon of coleslaw. Instead of french fries some kind of potato hunks, dried out. With a drink my bill came to $17.00. I asked for a box, scooped up the sandwhich, left the potatoes and the slaw--not worth taking home I have been going to Scott's for at least 30 years.

Care is obviously put into not only the choice of wares being sold here, but the quality of food presented to the customer.\n\nWhen I finally got around to the deli counter, I was about to order their specialty duck sandwich when I saw they had a reuben.  As I find it hard to turn down a reuben anywhere, I asked the woman behind the counter what she advised.  Without hesitation she said, \"The reuben.\"  Just as I had hoped and I'm glad I listened.  The sandwich was excellent.  Perfectly proportioned and fresh as possible without going backwards in time.  Making a good sandwich really is an art and the workers here are masterful as their craft.\n\nSitting outside at night with a wonderful sandwich in this strangely out of place shop is an opportunity not to be missed.

It seems we are forever looking for a place that has good prices and a quiet place for us to brainstorm and raise our energy. We have stumbled upon Duck and Decanter. \nFinding this restaurant is only half the battle, the other is where the heck the front door is. I felt I was intruding on the outside patrons, only to realize I had to meander through, taking a glimpse at what they were devouring to get to the front door, an added bonus I suppose. \n\nOpening the front door to a happily buzzing place seemed like quite a treat. To your right is small wine area, to the left were barrels and stuff. A bit confusing, but basically it is like walking into a deli shop of olden days. I had no idea what I was doing. I stood in line and squinted at the barely visible menu of an array of deli meats, smoked meats, salads and more. Of course being gluten intolerant one can hope she has hit the conscious jackpot..but not today...I will just have the insides..no bun! But wait! I see smoked duck and wait..I can order the sandwich of my choice and have it made into a salad. Well that is a great compromise! \n\nOf course to know me is to know I am gunna ask a lot of questions, my main concern, does the smoked duck use nitrites, nitrates or any of those other nasty carcinogens. Rather shocked by the question, the gentleman serving me has no idea and had no intentions of looking. Damn! I was really hoping for the duck! \n\nI quickly go with plan B as I weigh nitrites or high fructose corn syrup and soybean oil..with that it was the tuna salad. \n\nYou can not pay for your meal in advance as the idea is to meander the store..so I did. there were barrels of tea and coffee ready to be ground at your request. I was not impressed with the coffee grinder on the floor-ewwww. There was also an espresso area but it was not operational. \n\nThere are gadgets to buy for your kitchen, and packaged condiments and foods that I presume they make fresh there. There are fountain drinks , bottled drinks, good assortment of water and non alcoholic beer, and loads of sugary add ons within tempting reach right at the cash register-brilliant! And there is not tempting this fort Knox (well the rice cripsy treats looked..nooo must...resist...\n\nI get my food, pay and go up stairs. There are different levels and two places to sit outside, which makes this place even more interesting. \n\nI open my package and there right on top are two pieces of bread stuck to my tuna. I read the entry for the Entree salad and it said nothing about adding in the bread. I ordered the salad due to the fact I can not tolerate gluten. \n\nToo hungry to care, I peel off the bread and I dive into my food and I am shocked at how awful it is. What is that mushy stuff? I think it was water chestnuts in my tuna salad. Who puts water chestnuts, (if that was what it was) in their tuna salad? \n\nI was unimpressed with the fact that the tuna salad was put on a bed of spring lettuce (which is a thumbs up for this nutritionist), some sliced celery and string cheese. Cheese?!? Who eats cheese with their tuna? \n\nThe tuna itself was extremely dry and too salty for my liking, and I had a tough time getting it down, and eventually I got so turned off I did not finish it. There was no dressing and no taste.  I ended up not eating the salad either. What a waste of  $10.00 including guilt tip! At least the company I was with was fantastic! \n\nSome restaurants ask you if you have been to their establishment before so that they can have the opportunity to give you the best experience possible. I truly believe this is something Duck and Decanter could adopt. Maybe I was supposed to order dressing, I have no idea. Since I had never been there before and did not know what I was doing. \n\nI did ask someone else about the ingredients and she took the time to look and confirmed my suspicions-sigh. \n\nI can't wait until there is a conscious shift to what we are putting in our bodies and those who are Celiac or gluten intolerant can eat without anxiety! \n\nIs this a place for those who are Celiac or gluten intolerant? \nNO there is not enough awareness of ingredients, and handling of food. \n\nBathrooms? yes weird..outside of the building, but clean. \n\nWould I return? \nNo but for the sake of my friends, which is way more important, I will and eat some where else first.", "business_id": "HIiVx2mseVWKtx8TKfWC_A", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-11-16", "type": "review"}

Everything used is waaaaay above the quality of normal sandwich shops. You have a wide selection of fresh made pasta options as well as soups and other various sides. Its truly up to you to make your own brown bag special. My favorite is the Sonoran Chicken, with a wheat bread blend and swiss or provolone.... You can't go wrong with anything here guys.

You get your items (wine, coffee, sandwiches, whatever) and you mosey around, find a place to sit and enjoy them, just like you would in your own backyard, except your own backyard probably doesn't have as extensive of a wine collection or an award winning cheese department (and if it does, I officially hate you).\n\nI like to come here for happy hour (M-F, til 7:00, $2 off house wine and draft beer) or on Sunday afternoons to do a little daydrinking and people watching.

In fact my Dad has known Randy and his family all the way back to when Randy and my Dad were friends at NAU.  Their 16th Street location is as recognizable to me today as it was back then.  Today I get my fix sometimes at their original location, but also sometimes make the journey to their Downtown Phoenix location on 1st Street and Jefferson.  But for a true D&D experience, the original location is where its at (even if it might be a little hard to find).\n\nDuck & Decanter is a sandwich place first and foremost, but beyond that its a tough place to define.  In a way I sort of liken it to La Grande Orange Grocery in that its a restaurant that also has a number of grocery items you can grab on the go.  There's deli meats, cheeses, wines, coffees, and even a respectable selection of local craft brews.  There's a number of other miscellaneous items available for sale too (not all of them food or drink).  Theres seating in both the lower and upper levels of the place as well as a nice patio outside that will often have live music.  The staff has always been friendly and the mood is always casual and relaxed.\n\nThey serve breakfast and lunch items, but a true experience here is all about the Nooner sandwiches.  You can customize your own or get one of their signatures.  The Duckling is one you have to try once.  Duck, turkey, cranberry walnut relish, cream cheese and greens on walnut bread.  To me its almost like Turducken in a sandwich.  For custom sandwiches, I recommend the smoked turkey or roast beef.  There's a plethora of breads to choose from (I'm a sourdough guy) as well as a bunch of toppings to choose from.  Be sure to study the menu before ordering as the sandwich combinations are endless.  They also have some hot sandwiches to choose from if you wanna go that route.  Oh, and they always throw in the pickle and taffy are free.\n\nSo if you're around 16th Street and Camelback and looking for a freshly made sandwich or just a casual hangout spot, drive into the Sports Authority shopping complex until you reach the southeast corner of the complex and you see Duck & Decanter's original location.  Beware this place does get busy during the work week, but you can order ahead for pickup.  Its great to see this valley gem thrive and still stay true to its roots as long as it has.  Hopefully Randy's family will continue the business long enough for me to take my own kids here one day.", "business_id": "HIiVx2mseVWKtx8TKfWC_A", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-11-20", "type": "review"}

When we got there the host seemed annoyed and practically threw our menus on the table. He Sucked! \n\nWe ordered the Hell's Kitchen wings and the Philly Cheese steak pizza. First off the Wings were fantastic, although not as spicy as we anticipated. The wings came with sliced jalape\u00f1os scattered over the top of them, but it was just a psychological thing to make you think they're spicier. The Philly pizza was sub par. It was low on cheese and some what under cooked. There was still water from the meat running of the sides, basically making the crust soggy. \n\nOur waiter was very generous, unfortunately I forgot her name. She changed my perspective of the service.  For some strange reason, the host was still giving me the stink eye...I think he liked my girlfriend or something or may be just hated his job. lol    \n\nOverall, I would have preferred hitting up Streets of New York!

This is for 2 reasons. 1. Coda likes Domino's. 2. I like, nay, LOVE mushrooms on pizza (among other delicious vegetable toppings) while Coda prefers his pizza be served with toppings that, at one point, had a face. I'm not a vegetarian by any means (see my review of Blue Nile for proof), I just strongly prefer veggies on my pizza. I feel the tastes compliment each other better, and it's also much prettier. Neither of us is a big fan of compromise, so splitting a pizza is usually a challenge. \n\nNYPD took the pain out of pizza for us. We ordered a 14\" 5-topping and our AMAZING server let us know that, if we so desired, we could do 5 toppings on one half and 5 DIFFERENT toppings on the other, at no additional charge. I wanted to kiss her feet. I don't think she realized how far we would take it though, as our respective halves did not share one topping. That's right, we don't mess around. At this point in the meal, my Yelp rating of NYPD was 5 stars. Of course, I still had to eat the pizza.   \n\nIt is utterly confusing to me how so many places can claim to serve \"New York\" pizza and fail miserably, while almost every pizza place actually located in New York manages to pull it off. It's as if something magical happens when pizza is prepared in a new york zip code, and it's nearly impossible to recreate. But people keep trying. NYPD did not successfully recreate New York pizza. However, for Arizona pizza NYPD is definitely up there. And no, I've never waited 4 hours for pizza.\n\nFour stars for the food and cute, albeit somewhat gimmicky, ambiance. Five stars for the service. Our server was incredible, and they even gave us a gift bag when we left! It had coupons and a magnet! I used to order from a Chinese delivery place solely because they gave you little trinkets with your order, and I do order happy meals every so often so yeah, I guess you can say I'm a fan of gifts with food.

I understand the cost of food and labor along with the better quality ingredients, but I don't even spend that much on an Oreganos deep dish pie, and theirs actually taste better! The sicilian here doesn't really stand out. There's not enough sauce or cheese, and the toppings are just so so.

I got the Vinny, which has five toppings on it, and split my pizza with two on one side and three on the other. I got meatballs and tomatoes, and pepperoni, mushrooms, and black olives. Meatballs were dry as shit and sliced. Even Barro's has better meatballs! Everything else was just so so, I can get the same thing but better at Barros, at a fraction of the cost! \n\nAll in all, two stars for high cost and nothing to back it up.

The bread itself had the desirable softness and texture that I would expect from a genuine baguette (as I had in France).

Located in the old town area, I thought that a small, family-owned french breakfast place would be the perfect refreshing break from the trendy (Read: untsss unttsss untss music) mimosa-brunch places and overly-priced-food restaurants. I wanted something fresh, homemade, french and delicious.\n\nWe ordered an iced latte, a nutella crepe with fresh fruit and whipped cream, a croissant with egg and sausage and a normandy creme (ham, cheese and egg). The food came in before the waters and drinks, and unfortunately, they seemed prepared ahead of time and left to sit.\n\nMy normandy crepe looked (visually) delicious. When I started digging in, I noticed that it was a little cold (aka not prepared fresh) and that the cheese was barely there and already solidified and not gooey. The flavors were ok but the crepe contents were very flat, so they were very stingy on the portions of their ingredients. The crepe was topped with a sunny side-up egg but had no sauce or added flavors to it. I tried adding hot sauce but it really didn't make the dish any better. That was about $8. My iced latte was approximately $5 and really tasted like coffee with whole milk - and the coffee was not a great quality. Not an enjoyable meal.\n\nMy friend ordered the nutella crepe but was delivered a crepe stuffed with fresh fruit instead. Apparently, the order is EITHER a fruit crepe or a nutella crepe, not a nutella crepe served with fruit. When they took it back, they returned the same plate with a hint of nutella placed on top (my friend has already cut into the crepe earlier). The whipping cream was not your typical type: it was very dense and heavy, a weird combo between whipped cream and thick evaporated milk.\n\nThe service was decent but we were the only people at the restaurant besides from 2 other ladies who were just having coffee. The place was very empty, which is sad to see considering the 3 breakfast places adjacent to it had a 30-40min waiting line. I really want Au Petit Four to succeed but they need to overhaul the quality of their food and the attentiveness of their staff. With no customers to make them busy, there is no excused for stingy cold food.", "business_id": "wftoNIA0Q8nX-Da47psBCA", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-11-12", "type": "review"}

My only complaint about them is that they aren't bigger. I was literally rationing my croissant throughout my meal so that I could have a bite of it with every bite of my spinach & mushroom omelette - which by the way was also fantastic - and that's coming from someone who's paranoid about undercooked eggs and NEVER eats eggs unless they are cooked in her very own kitchen. \n\nWe ended up wracking up an almost $60 bill because we brought home a doggy bag of baked goods from the attached bakery.

I had seen them on Eat24, but since picking up an order from them involves a 9 mile roundtrip, I hadn't gotten around to trying them until tonight.\n\nMy overall impression:  just OK.  I've had better, and I've had worse.  I ordered a medium pepperoni pizza, and the crust had a dense, pillowy texture that I didn't much care for.  The sauce, cheese and pepperoni on top of the crust were actually pretty tasty, though.  Inexplicably, there was a small section on my pizza that was completely devoid of cheese and pepperoni.\n\nOrdering with Eat24 was easy, although I should point out that there isn't an option for extra cheese on the menu.  I left my house within five minutes of ordering, and when I arrived at the restaurant my pizza had about two minutes to go, so the speed of service was fine.  The quality of service, however, was a bit lacking -- much of which I attribute to the fact that the counter guy was young and probably didn't have a lot of experience.\n\nAs for the value...honestly, it wasn't great.  Without the $2 online coupon I used, the medium 12 inch one-topping pizza I ordered would have cost $13.53, which is higher than what the pizza joints in my neighborhood charge for a comparable or higher quality product.  (Overpriced, average pizza could be one of the reasons I was the only customer inside the place at 7PM on a Saturday night...)\n\nWould I return?  Probably not.  Frank's is just too far of a drive for me when better and cheaper pizza is available closer to home.  But, as always, individual results may vary.  If you're in the neighborhood, you should give them a try at least once and decide for yourselves.", "business_id": "VWcaFOSFcDwmFquycBzFyQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-11-21", "type": "review"}

Elie's gets high marks for being a family-run establishment and for having super-friendly and likeable service, but  it falls a little short in the food department. \n\nI can walk to this place from my work, so I decided to do just that one day last week. Alicia B was definitely right when she said that this place is \"dinky\" - the flooring is old, the tables are dingy, the bathroom is passable, and the \"decor\" consists of a few potted plants and some framed stock pictures of Greece. I might forgive the extreme lack of atmosphere if I felt that the prices were reasonable, since that would mean that the owners were skimping on style in order to provide a high-quality product. \n\nUnfortunately, the food doesn't quite deliver, especially given the high prices. I really wanted to order one of the vegetarian combo plates, but the cheapest one with falafel (plus hummus) was $7.85! That is really steep, in my opinion. If I had wanted to add baba and tabouli, it would have run me $9.10. Because this felt high, I ended up getting the falafel sandwich for $5.59. It only came with lettuce, tomatoes, and tahini sauce, so I ended up adding green peppers for $.45 (a bargain compared to the $.99 they charge to add tomatoes). \n\nI waited 10-15 minutes for my food, which I understand given that there was a steady flow of eat-in and take-out customers. When the sandwich did arrive (with a smile from the again very friendly owner), I enjoyed it because I was starving, but again, wasn't all too impressed. The pita was very large but very dry, and it definitely could have stood to be more moist. Similarly, I found the falafel overly dry and crumbly. The tahini sauce was decent but not as subtle as some I've had in the past. \n\nFor $8 or so, I got a filling falafel sandwich and a large Diet Coke. I definitely prefer the $2.99 falafel sandwich at Al-Hana, although the uber-convenient location of Elie's may mean that I return a few more times.

Oh my goodness, Donna is one of the most awesome ladies I have come in contact with in a long time. She is definitely an East coast kinda lady, she is a no nonsense straightforward gal, but also a really sweet and thoughtful person.... they were out of lasagna tonight, but she could tell I really wanted it and got the kitchen to make one special for me...how above and beyond is that? Not only that, but the lasagna was legit.... two different types of sausage, a ton of melty cheese, and a nice flavorful sauce. It was also huge, plenty for two meals. It came with garlic bread that was actually garlicky (I know, crazy) and was a great complement to the pasta. We also had a pepperoni calzone which was ridic good. The ricotta was well seasoned, the crust was perfectly cooked, crispy, and had garlicky seasoning on top. I would definitely get this again. Oh ya, it was also big enough for two meals. All of this food was 20$.... you heard me, 20$!!! This was quite the deal. I think we found our new favorite Italian place in Phoenix.... We'll be back and suggest you give it a shot too!\n\n\nPS they are BYOB\nPPS this place has 5 star potential, I just need a second visit to confirm the experience.", "business_id": "j0Uc-GuOe-x9_N_IK1KPpA", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-09-13", "type": "review"}

We decided to get delivery and called to order pizza and wings. We ordered a special they had for a large pizza with two toppings plus 30 wings, and added a small Hawaiian pizza. The guy on the phone was VERY nice - we had a lot of questions and requested sauces on the side. Unlike many places you call in an order, he was very friendly, accommodating, patient and helpful. We really appreciated this.\n\nWe ordered a large pizza with two toppings - pepperoni on the whole pizza and half of it also with meatballs. This was perfectly executed and tasty. The crust and dough was perfectly cooked - fluffy and fresh with a little crisp. The pepperonis were tasty with the right amount of spice, and the meatballs were flavorful without being spicy. They had a fair amount of black pepper but it wasn't overwhelming. The pepperonis were thinly sliced and laid on top of the cheese and pepperoni - well balanced and easy to eat! The other pizza was a small Hawaiian without sauce --- sadly, it had NO pineapple on it. How do you forget the pineapple on a Hawaiian. Since it was delivery, there was nothing we could do. So, we ate what equated to cheesy bread with Canadian bacon on it.  \n\nWe also had 30 wings with medium sauce on the side - and ordered them extra crispy. They were perfectly cooked and the medium sauce was good (when getting delivery or to go, getting the sauce on the side keeps them crispy!) It included two small (2 ounce) ramekins of ranch, so we ordered 6 extra (which was only 30 cents each, much cheaper than the nearby Stumpy's cost for ranch).\n\nThe Hawaiian (well, cheesy bread with Canadian bacon...) pizza's crust was much thinner and crispier than the large pizza. Just something to note - the crust was completely crusty. Which is fine, just know it wasn't soft like on the large. We were quoted 35-40 mins and paid cash... But it arrived closer to 25 mins. I do recommend this place. Despite the goof on the small pizza, the friendly service, quail delivery and wing quality leaves me with 4 solid stars.\n\nIf this review helped, let me know with the voting buttons.

It didn't taste like the bread at some places that give you a variety of 8 different kinds but they all suffer from a bland sameness.

I went to the store to pick up a bottle of Peachy Canyon Zin, and grabbed my pizza on the way back home. HOLY COW, my pizza was huge! Oh well, I'll have leftovers. It seemed like it took forever to get home because the pizza's aroma wafted through my car and drove me crazy! I got home opened the box, and marveled at the sight of my yummy pizza. The pizza is not sliced into triangles, rather, they are sliced into squares. I grabbed a couple squares and noticed the GREASE that oozed through the cheese on the pizza. Uh oh. I grabbed a few paper towels and firmly patted my pizza. I thought to myself \"This is one greasy pizza! This is going to be awesome!\" I felt guilty and rebellious taking the first bite of my pizza. I was immediately struck by the sweetness of their sauce! It wasn't too terribly sweet, but I must say I like a slightly sweet red sauce. It may catch some people off guard. The meat on the pizza was delicious! The sausage was flavorful and I think it's home-made. I ended up sticking the leftovers in the freezer for future indulgence.

I even once looked into shipping Aurelio's for a birthday present and quickly realized that that was insanely expensive. \n\nFast forward to this summer when I discovered a review on Yelp that mentioned that there used to be an Aurelio's here in AZ that eventually became Spinato's. Well my husband insisted that we get in the car that moment and check it out. The sweet marinara is exactly what he was looking for and while not exactly the same this is the closest pizza in Arizona to his beloved favorite. The crust is thin and the sausage is hand crumbled (or appears to be). They are very generous on the cheese and toppings in general and leftovers the next day aren't too shabby.

Pizzas can be shared and split into 2 different combinations (they even separate it with a line of tomato sauce so you know which is which) dessert is the only department they lack in.. Cannoli's are no bueno :( the dough tastes old and the cream filling is too sweet.  Overall, this is definitely on my top favorite list of restaurants in the valley.. Eating here always makes my day.. Heck even my week!! :)", "business_id": "YldXB1hRpnE1CWLF3mvgpQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-09-04", "type": "review"}

Luckily, Spinato's was just around the corner. The service was fantastic, with a wait time around seven minutes. Curious about their tea, our server allowed us to have a sample (in a rather large cup) of their green tea. Ultimately, we didn't order any tea, but our server provided consistent, positive service. My boyfriend and I ordered a large Da' Greek pizza for our meal. While the pizza combination was delicious, I did find a slight flaw. The only thing I didn't like was the amount of moisture soaked into the crust. I'm not sure if that's how the pizza is supposed to be, but it was almost impossible to eat without a fork. There was enough pizza to take home though, and the leftovers lasted us for a couple of days. Also, be sure to try the Cider.

Had drinks at home, called uber, hit the bars and had a great time and then came home and we crashed! As we woke up we were obviously starving, hadn't tried Streets of New York so we thought hey this is perfect we can order food stay in and watch Netflix! (No \"chilling\" LOL) \nWhen I called the girl who answered the phone didn't appear ready to take my order or really know what she was doing. I could tell she was young but hats no excuse. As I asked her a few basic questions I didn't get the the most speediest of replies that I would like. She needed to place me on hold as she was taking my order...my perception was that I was on hold longer than necessary but that was perhaps due to the fact that I was already upset by the way she was handling my order...now at this point I should not have placed my order because I could just feel it was not going to be right however, I proceeded on! So at the end of the ordering process I asked her to repeat my order and she did and I felt OK. At the beginning I asked if there were specials and she told me but when it came time to pay the price was significantly different, she had to get a manager because \"she did not know what was going on?\" Ok whatever I thought lets just get this done I have a house full of hungry friends LOL! So it was done and they deliver- 30-45 minutes that's pretty reasonable I thought. An hour and 25 minutes later there was a knock on the door...FINALLY FOOD!!!! The delivery guy was on point he was funny and really made it a great time and his service was AWESOME. I had to tell him about the girl in the phone and I let him know how I felt he gets 10 stars out of 5 stars!  he was great even though I was complaint about his fellow co worker he was great at not throwing her under the bus and never \" agreed \" with with what i was saying but you could tell in his face this was not the first time he had heard this. He pulled out the receipt and asked is this your address I replied no and he says oh ok that explains why I was driving around and couldn't find it. Really? The girl who took the order totally go it wrong! I tipped very well and he was great! Now the food , pizza was ok not warm obviously but taste was good we ordered 2 pepperoni and it was good - ok but not great- at this point we were just starving! Now we get to the 2nd box and to our surprise it's a whole different type of pizza and I'm like really? Man....we couldn't even eat it it was completely not ours.. I didn't have the energy to call and complain so we just sucked it up and made pb and j's. The girl on the telephone had us starving. Because of that I have to give one star maybe take your time on the phone next time and hit the right button and then it will be right... The delivery guy made up for this!!

Choices when you have a half hour lunch are pretty slim around here. We have Jack in the box, McD's and a Subway. I had never seen this little place because it's so well hidden. A friend who lives in the area recommended I try their sandwiches. Since I'd like to think I'm open to trying new things I walked on in. The deli is quite the interesting little place. Italian posters have taken over the store and it's kept dark. They seemed to have a vast array of authentic Italian foods for cooking at home. The menu offered variety of sandwiches as well as pizza (sold by the slice) and spaghetti. I settled on a salami sub. Wow, I have never realized a sub can taste SO good!! The salami with the cheese they used plus the condiments gave the sub a nice little kick. Everything tasted quite fresh. The tomatoes were smaller and shiny, bright red. The prices are great. What I could tell a sub runs 2.50- 4.00. Well worth it for its size. They also have the option of getting a side with your sub. While waiting for my sub to be prepared I did grab an orange Italian ice from the freezer. Once at work, I found it had no taste. It was just orange colored ice. All in all, great experience!

I ordered the hot pastrami sub, with extra meat. The guy behind the counter asked if I wanted it hot....\"yes.\"  The sandwich was large, so full of meat it was difficult to eat. The meat was really tender and juicy...the way you want it.\n\nThe Cons: After I ordered, he disappeared into the back, returned and asked if I wanted mustard. Yes, but I didn't realize that there weren't any condiments or condiment packages out, you had to trust that he would put on the amount you wanted in the back. The sandwich was \"hot\" but not because it was \"toasty hot\" it was because it was microwaved. The roll was so soggy that it wasn't easy to keep the sandwich together. \n\nRecommendation to owner: get a commercial toaster oven or alert your customers that \"hot sandwich\" means \"microwaved.\"\n\nThis sandwich would have be extraordinarily good had I been able to add my own condiments and had it been heated in a toaster oven.", "business_id": "unPzS1QJJctlZyLGFSk_HA", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-09-18", "type": "review"}

Had the last piece reheated for breakfast the next day and it was no less than excellent. \n\nThe canned mushrooms crack me up, but, as my husband says, they don't have fresh mushrooms in New York City!", "business_id": "V3lQtk1LgwAEcF9j-BzchA", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-09-29", "type": "review"}

I have frequented this place some many a' time. I like this place. It's close and tasty. I feel like this is the point of the review I present my uncertainty! Enter sad face. Wife ordered...per super awesome phone thing, a large pep and idk maybe 20 wings. Non the less $30 later I walk in, like I have many times b4, and dude looks at me like I am bothering him. With the secret two digit numerical code my wife relayed to me I was able to get my hands on the order. After acquiring the ordered items I shuffle slowly towards the register. Before 1 1/2 shuffles buddy behind the counter gave me some serious angry eyes asking if I paid! What!! I was obliged to promote their high traffic area and simply moved closer to the point of business where I could pay. Not cool. Insulting and honestly.... Never again. I hope they trained that staff to make sure they never get return business because in that scenario....
