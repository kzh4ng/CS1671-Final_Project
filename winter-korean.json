I went on a Wednesday evening and the place was totally dead except maybe one couple sitting by the sushi bar part of the time I was there.  Which is sad because they have such a huge space with 2 levels, lots of seating, and great proximity to both the Strip and downtown.  A lot more could be done with this place.  \n\nThe menu was printed in very poor quality with what could have been nice pictures of food options but they were super fuzzy and hard to see.  It seemed like their Korean menu was pretty varied but I had come for the sushi.  I ordered the Kim's Favorite Roll which was described as \"Tuna, Yellowtail, Broiled Eel, and Salmon\"  but what I wasn't expecting was the salmon to be cooked all the way through.  Maybe I  should have read it as \"broiled eel and salmon\" but that wasn't clear or typical of this sort of roll.  Normally eel is cooked but the other fish are raw unless specified otherwise.  Maybe you'd have a fried roll or something baked or seared on the top, but to cook one type of fish that is normally raw and mix it inside with 2 raw types just seems strange to me.  So it ended up being a really odd combination with the raw tuna and yellowtail next to the cooked sushi which wasn't so great all squished together inside the roll.  The sushi roll was quite large at 16 pieces, but I still felt that 18.95 was really pricey considering the quality of the fish was only mediocre with small portions, and they used a TON of rice. The quality of the fish was again just ok.  Not super fresh but not bad either.  The rolls (and those of my friends) kept falling apart as we tried to eat them.  It seemed they weren't properly wrapped or maybe it was just that they tried to use way too much rice.  One fun thing was that all the rolls came out on little boats, so that was a nice touch.  The roll also came with a miso soup, which was fine but nothing special.  The miso soup didn't have the awful taste some others here reported but it tasted like what I'd make from a powered package rather than made fresh.  I also got the shrimp shumai which were again just ok, and tasted like what I could get from the freezer section of an asian store and microwave myself rather than made fresh.  \n\nOne person at our table got a Korean dish which came with 4 side dishes that were all vegetable except for the fish cakes.  She said her food tasted decent but the beef bul go gi dish she got just didn't look right or have the proper color it should have had.  Just liked kind of dry and plain.  When I went to the restroom I was disturbed to see trays of the Korean side dishes in the hallway just sitting out in the open not covered or anything!  It would be different if the restaurant were bustling but it was totally dead and pretty clear those wouldn't be eaten that evening (so I shudder to think that after hours sitting out uncovered unrefrigerated that they put them out again the next day and hoped someone would eat them...).  If you aren't that busy there is no reason things can't be prepared to order!  That is simply lazy.  Also I overheard part of a conversation between a waiter and a guy at the sushi bar about something being \"expired\" and what to do about that.  Unfortunately I couldn't hear all the details but it was disturbing since this was after we all had gotten our food already.  I mean it's good they are being mindful of expiration dates but it sounded like someone had to be schooled on it based on what I heard.  But granted that I only heard bits and pieces so I can't say for sure.

I think based on the fact that everyone else in the restaurant except for my wife and son were speaking Korean that this is a pretty authentic place.\n\nOh, and the menu is mostly in Korean too, and even the parts that are English don't really make much sense and some of the descriptions are horrifying to my uneducated ignorant eyes (you'll know when you see them).  Fortunately there's lots of pictures and I picked the simple Chicken BBQ plate and whooo boy it's super awesome fantastic.\n\nThe serving staff all speak English and are really helpful in telling you what is what, but all you need to know is to order BBQ Chicken, Pork or Beef and you'll be happy.  \n\nAfter ordering the server will bring over 8 or 9 little dishes each filled with some sort of Korean appetizer.  There's lots of Kim Chi which I'm told is excellent, but I'm a coward.  The potatoes, though were excellent as were several other things that I tried.  If you finish any of the little bowls you can ask for more at no charge.  \n\nWhen the meal comes out you're in a for a great treat!  Each plate comes out sizzling like when you get fajitas.  They're piled high (really high) with your choice of seasoned meat and onions.  And they also give you a big bowl of rice.  \n\nEach bite is heaven.  Oh man, just thinking about it right now just before lunch is driving me insane.

I had REALLY hoped for table top cooking because I think it is just more fun that way. makes things more festive. I also like a bit more traditional korean decor.\n\nService: I had a Teenage Korean American girl who spoke perfect english and was polite but not very attentive.

The tofu was soft and flavorful.  Several other tables ordered their BBQ meats, which also looked/smelled good.  The side dishes were OK but not as many options as other Korean restaurants I have been to.  They have the basics - kimchee, cucumber, radish, sprouts.  Overall, the food was better than I expected for a place in Phoenix.\n\nNow to the bad: the service was absolutely atrocious, if you can call that service at all.  It is a sign of bad service when every table in the restaurant is looking around for someone to help them.  We waited 15 minutes for someone to acknowledge us and take our order.  Another 40 minutes for the food.  The side dishes come with the entrees so don't count on them when you are starving.  The tofu came without rice, which took another 10 minutes.  All this time, you have to flag the waiters multiple times if you want a refill of water or anything else.  Even when they make eye contact, they ignore you.  People actually left their tables to go to the service area and help themselves!  There were no apologies from the waiters for the wait.  They did not even smile.  The very worst part of the meal was paying.  Naturally, we were not able to get our checks at the table, so we lined up at the cashiers table behind another group.  (Keep in mind there is no cashier so we had to wait for a waiter to decide we were worth his time of day.)  When it came our turn to pay, the waiter blew right past us without help us!  Luckily, another waiter finally saw us and got us our check.  I wish we could have given him all the tip.\n\nThis may be the only Korean place in Phoenix, but I will hold out for when I go to LA.

I went there on Wednesday, 1/7/09, around 7 p.m., with my BF for his first eat-out Korean dinner. It's in the northwest corner of Dobson and Southern, just north of the gas station, in the same shopping center as Oregano's and Saketini. \n\nMostly, I wanted to try to find tofu soup--crazy-soft tofu pieces in flavorful spicy broth with whatever add-ins you want, from seafood to beef to mushroom to kimchi. YOM. You could smell the spice and sizzle (much of their dishes are served on hot plates, and meat always gives off a certain smell when charred up deliciously like that). Decorations were sparse and the lighting was almost a little too bright, like cafeteria-bright, with the tables and chairs set up diner-style, in neat rows. It wasn't packed (one half of the restaurant, I guess an overflow section, was dark until a couple showed up later), but business was steady. There was a big group of athletic-looking Koreans in the middle of the room having a seriously happy chow-down (everything looked good) and several Korean and mixed families and couples.\n\nThe hostess/waitress waved at us from across the restaurant to ask how many seats we'd need, then waved us to a table. After that, it was a bit of a wait before we got menus. They had an interesting selection, and by that I mean appetizing, choices and decent prices, with entrees starting at $9 and capping in the $20s. They also have a decent selection of lunch specials. It was a somewhat agonizingly long time before anyone came to take a drink order. By the time our polite, attentive waitress came, we were ready to put in our entire order, so we put in for drinks (which came quickly), goon mandu (dumplings) for an appetizer, short ribs, and tofu soup with pork and mushrooms.\n\nThe dumplings came without our getting impatient, and they were pretty tasty--slightly crisped wrappers and plenty of filling. Shortly after we finished, we received our banchan (traditional Korean appetizers on several small plates). I doubt I can remember all of them, but it included kimchi, kak tu gi (radish kimchi), gam-ja (braised potato and carrot), k'ong na mul (bean sprout salad), seaweed salad, and one or two other dishes, which was more than enough for both of us. We thought everything tasted just fine. After we'd enjoyed the banchan for about 5-10 minutes, they brought our little bowls of rice, then our little pile of short ribs on a sizzling plate (with a polite warning not to burn our hands off) served over raw, thickly slivered onions, and after a few moments longer, our tofu soup in a little hot clay pot. They also brought a raw egg in case we wanted one cracked in. \n\nThe ribs were good, but just a little tough--they're supposed to be that way, but if you're expecting something the consistency of all-day braised short ribs, these aren't them. I loved the tofu soup--eat it as soup or over rice, which is ten times better. It was AWESOME, but I\"m biased because it's like comfort food to me. Soft, creamy tofu curds in spicy broth (they ask you how spicy you'd like it, if you want it spicy at all), and just enough pork and mushrooms to still keep it tofu soup. It hit the spot.\n\nThe wait staff was pretty good about keeping my BF's glass of diet coke filled, and that was a feat in itself. It kind of took awhile for someone to bring the check, but when they did, they brought a few tasty coffee candies. We considered desserts, but we couldn't find any in the regular menu or on any special menus.\n\nOverall, the service may have been a little slow, but it wasn't for lack of trying--plating and delivering and clearing the banchan plates alone can be a Herculean task. We really enjoyed the food and plan to go back again. Our overall dinner was a bit pricey because of the short ribs, but it would be easy to get away with a $25 dinner for two if you went for a couple tofu soups and a couple of non-alcoholic drinks.", "business_id": "PX3e3qtBx_5VC3vqq47jpQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-01-09", "type": "review"}

All of us are very white and very non-Korean so I was concerned about the service we would receive after reading a few reviews on Yelp.  I was actually pleasantly surprised with the service.  Our waiter was very friendly and fast and answered any questions with a smile.\n\nIt was about 7pm on a Wednesday night and the place wasn't too crowded.  There were probably 15 other people in the place who were all of Asian decent so you know the place is the real deal.  The ambiance is a bit cafeteria-like but it didn't matter because I was there for a new culinary experience as this was my first time eating Korean food.\n\nNow about the food....\n\nAfter they take your drink and food orders, your table is given 6 or 7 small appetizers.  I don't remember what everything was but I do remember the kimchi.  I've never had it before but I know it is a Korean dining staple so I gave it a shot.  I was not a fan of it and probably won't ever have it again, but it was interesting to say the least.\n\nHere is what we ordered:\n\n* Mushroom Soon Tofu soup with beef - the soup is what this place seems to be known for judging by the Yelp reviews so I had to order it.  The bowl came out boiling hot which was good because we opted for the raw egg to be cracked and put into it right before it was served.  The soft tofu was a bit different to me but the soup had good flavor and a nice kick.  I would order it again but I'd like to try other ingredients such as prawns, etc.\n\n* Short ribs - this is secretly why I wanted to come here.  I was told they were awesome and they were.  The marinate\\sauce was not overpowering and they were very tender.  I will for sure order these again.\n\n* BBQ chicken - not the leanest or best cut of chicken but it was very good and flavorful.  Again, the sauce\\marinade was not too strong.\n\n* Octopus in spicy sauce - this was the \"crazy\" dish for me for the evening.  I enjoy fried calamari and squid/octopus salad, but larger chunks of squid or octopus scare me a little.  I mean they weren't real big chunks but big enough to where you see you are eating a bunch of those little suction cup thingys that octopi have.  Between that and the chewiness of each bite made my stomach turn a bit.  However, the dish had good flavor and a nice kick thanks to the red sauce they bathed it in.  I'm not sure I would order this again.\n\nAnyway, I would definitely come back again.  I enjoyed the service and would like to try other tofu soups and some of the other meat dishes.  I really want to try the bbq ribeye and bbq pork dishes in addition to more of that chicken and those short ribs!", "business_id": "PX3e3qtBx_5VC3vqq47jpQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-01-07", "type": "review"}

Look around...If there are a lot of Asians eating there and it's always packed, then that's a good sign your at the right place.  Let's start with the banchan (small side dishes)...They are always fresh and plentiful and they have the best kimchi I have had at ANY Korean restaurant (LA and NYC)!  Kalbi and Bulgogi are done perfectly and not too salty or sweet.  Soon Doobu chigaes are perfect.  If your feeling adventurous than try the spicy Squid or Octopus stirfry...again perfect.  The true foodie needs to try some of the hard core dishes like Ah Gu Jim or one of their many different Jungols (Hot Pot).  They do all the basic Korean dishes to perfection and the more traditional ones better than grandma!  I can also say that their quality and freshness is outstanding which sadly is not always synonomous with most Korean Restaurants.  What puts HODORI over the top is the great staff...I didn't think it was humanly possible to smile that much!  Also the owner with the strange spiked hair style is a really nice guy that goes out of his way to make sure your happy even though I found out he's a NY fan (Yankees, Jets and Knicks)...hey, no one is perfect.

They don't serve their soon dubu w/ a fried fish like many of the other soon dubu places do. :( Plus their rice is served in a plain metal bowl rather than a stone bowl. So you don't get that crispy/burnt rice (that you pour water on) towards the end of you meal. :( Also, we requested bori cha, and I think they charged us for it. ^__^", "business_id": "PX3e3qtBx_5VC3vqq47jpQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-12-16", "type": "review"}

Secondly, I realized that I'm not the biggest fan of korean food, but that's just me. And third, the prices were a little high. Around $90 for a family of 4/5 (My grandma eats almost nothing XD).

We didn't have to wait very long to be seated but it took forever to order, get our food, pay the bill, etc. They only had three ladies waitressing, running the register, and so on. Our water glasses were never filled. Well at least the food was good. \n\nThe Bulgogi had great flavor and was very tender. The entree was pricey (normal for ribeye to expensive at KBBQ places) but they gave us a huge portion so we ate it last night and today too. The Soon tofu was delicious and packed with tofu, kimchee, tender cubes of beef and seaweed. We asked for medium spicy and it was quite spicy! We can handle spice but for those who can't, I recommend you get it as mild as possible. Definitely loved the soup, I will be back for this one! Lastly the seafood pancake was packed with baby shrimp, octopus, scallion, and mushrooms. It was good but got soggy pretty quickly unfortunately. But when served hot in crispy its yummy dipped into the tangy sauce they serve with it. Banchan was unimpressive and limited, the potato side dish was too sweet (I think they put syrup on it) and the kimchee was just okay. I prefer the seafood pancake and banchan at Cafe Ga Hyang more .

It's been my go to place for Korean food, but my first time w their $16.99 ayce. \n\nStarted out rocky - it was half empty but we stood waiting to be seated for what felt like forever, while the frazzled server and busser both ignored us. There were a few other service issues to follow but sadly, authentic Asian places aren't known for great service. It is what it is. \n\nAnyway, food was great - decent selection of banchan (the sides), a surprisingly delish salad of romaine and cabbage mixed w a light dressing and I think kochujung sauce. We ordered bulgogi, kalbi short ribs, spicy chicken and spicy pork. The meat quality and marinade was really good, but I'm not a fan the marinade on pork and chicken. Both lacked flavor and the pork had really excessive fat and gristle. \n\nAlthough not included in ayce we got an order of the fried mandoo, which seemed to be homemade and a pretty generous portion. Also got the spicy tofu soup, which arrived boiling hot and yummy. Tried the steamed egg, which was incorrectly described as kind of a custard. It was more like a really fluffy omelette - seemed like a scrambled raw egg poured onto a little bit of boiling broth w green onion. Surprisingly good, must try.\n\nService was mediocre with just 1 poor guy running around and the busser girl who spoke no English - she just stared at us although I'm pretty sure coke is still coke in Spanish too. Things got better once one of the cooks came out to help wait tables, he was actually an awesome server. I'd suggest ordering everything at once while you have their attention, and you have to be pretty aggressive about flagging them down. \n\nSounds like a pretty bad experience, but it is probably my fav of the ayce k-bbq places over sura and woo che. Quality seemed better and a good selection of ban chan.

Waitress showed up at the beginning and end of the meal to drop of the bill. Kids drop their utensil? Get up and ask for another. Need a napkin or chop-sticks? Get up and ask for it.

I was delighted in finding a cheap all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ place in Vegas. That was 2 years ago.\n\nI went back to Tofu Hut over the weekend, after walking around all day at CES, I was starving (I refused to buy LV Convention food). I hopped on a bus to Tofu Hut salivating. When I got there, it seemed nothing had changed.\n\nGranted, I was not there on in the middle of the night (the price is cheaper than dinner), but I noticed the price had gone up a bit since I've been there. The cost of food has gone up so this was expected. We ordered the marinated sliced ribeye, the brisket, marinated pork belly, and shortribs.\n\nThe mariniated sliced ribeye was tasty, but lacking in quality. The brisket was super thin so it cooked fast. The marinated pork belly was a little spicy and delicious, but we got over it fairly quickly. Very fatty, but that's what pork belly is all about!\n\nThe short ribs were decent, a bit chewy, although I was quite full from the other meats, sides, and beer. And Soju. How could I forget the Soju? I was full and drunk at that point.\n\nThe sides were not memorable (except the big bowl of salad, which I confiscated for myself), and the service was ok. There seemed to be only one waitress running around the entire place.\n\nI have to say, while this isn't the best or cheapest Korean BBQ, it is a decent place to enjoy a meal with friends a little off the strip.", "business_id": "UKKz4HdQC0aH9j5lLi4u8Q", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-01-15", "type": "review"}

Very flavorful, and filling, too, since it comes with banchan and rice. I've been there with others, however, that order the ayce and it is always great as well (I manage to sneak a few bites when they aren't looking). The best part has to be the cabbage mix salad that comes with the ayce. You're supposed to eat it with the meat and it is SO GOOD!! The ayce servings are big, and they require a minimum of two people ordering to get it, because otherwise, you'd get full off of one serving. It's best to go after 11pm when the prices change to get the best value. \n\nMy only complaint would be the service. I don't know if management changed or what, but my favorite people there weren't working the last few times I've been, and honestly, they were better than who works there now. They also seemed to get rid of \"stone-pot\" rice, which is sad because it was almost better than the jigae itself. \n\nIf you're in the mood for Korean, you definitely have to check this place out.

For real. But you get what you can get and Tofu Hut is the place to get your Korean BBQ fix for a decent price.\n\nDuring their regular hours AYCE is $16.99, while late night (10 PM - 3 AM) is priced at $13.99. Not too shabby, considering you can get as much meat as you want. They offer a good variety - brisket, bulgogi (marinated beef), thick pork belly slices, tripe, squid, beef tongue and a few others. I'm a fan of the brisket, personally. You can't go wrong with ultra thin slices of beef dipped in their sesame oil/pepper sauce! The marinade on the bulgogi is decent, nothing to rave about. The pork belly is pretty fatty, just a warning. \n\nSide dishes are just as important to a Korean BBQ meal as the meat itself. There wasn't a lot of side dishes - kimchi, spicy cucumbers, japchae (stir-fried vermicelli noodles), fishcakes, steamed egg and a pre-dressed salad (essential for any Korean BBQ meal). This may sound like a lot, but really good BBQ places offer a lot more, probably twice as much. I was longing for some bean paste, maybe some garlic and jalapenos. Perhaps I'm asking for too much. After all, you get what you pay for. \n\nSo why the name 'Tofu Hut' when this place is popular for their Korean BBQ? Before the BBQ times, they once strictly sold a variety of soondubu (soft tofu stew). You can get this from not-so-spicy at all to ultra spicy, all depends on your taste buds. They still have this here and are decently priced.

The simplicity of this place makes this an enjoyable place for me and whoever I come to this place with.\n\nThe dinner price is about $17 bucks and includes all the items on the all you can eat menu and about $14 after 10 P.M. The extra items you get for the extra three dollars are the short ribs and the steamed eggs. The short ribs I would say is well worth it because that is my favorite meat on the menu personally. The egg is good as well, but it's not as special as the short ribs. I do really enjoy the bulgogi (marinated sliced ribeye), the brisket, and the short rib the most, but the pork belly and chicken thigh are good as well. The meats have been fresh every time I have visited and so I haven't had any problems there. The rest of the food are served with various side dishes and you can ask for that, as well as salad and rice when you run out of those things. \n\nThe service is adequate, but sometimes it feels like they see your hand, but they just ignore you just cause. They do bring you your meat and whatever else you ask for in due time. The food is good, and the only way the food sucks is if you suck at cooking, so don't suck at cooking.

There was no other reason for us to be here other than we were craving Korean BBQ. I can eat pretty much every hour since I'm always hungry. There were some empty tables at 1am which is why it didn't make sense to me to have to wait for a table.

There's an AYCE Korean BBQ place that has rib eye not too far away from TH and I like theirs better. So, I was a bit disappointed with TH's rib eye...it wasn't tasty for being marinated and it's not that tender. You can't go wrong with brisket since it's super quick to cook and it's good stuff.

Make sure to sign in so you can have your place in line. Don't forget to include the time you signed in along with the number in your party.\n\nI would say you got room for about 48 people total in the whole restaurant.

Not bad for a party of our size.\n\nSo here's the low down if AYCE is your option.\n- You need a minimum of two people to pick this option so if you are going solo, then a la carte is your only option.\n- $16.99 per person any time. $13.99 from 10 pm to 2 am.\n- No to go or take home. (Duh!)\n- Don't be afraid to ask for refills on any of your sides because there is no extra charge.\n- You must eat all the meat that you order or you will be charged extra.\n\nAs for the meats, I was pleasantly surprised, especially the marinated items like brisket, ribeye, and pork. The sides were good as well from the kimchi all the way to the salad, which is very solid. The salad itself I can eat all day.\n\nService was fast and furious, which would of made Paul Walker proud (may he Rest In Peace) for our party was eating like there was no tomorrow.

You would want to come with an empty stomach since this place is a All You Can Eat Korean BBQ. I dare you to come out of this place not smelling like Korean BBQ. So if you plan to go to a party after you might wanna bring a change of clothes. If this is your first time trying Korean BBQ let me tell you that the smell will linger on your clothes and hair. \n\nThis is an AYCE location starting at 10:00pm-2:00am and it only cost $18-20 depending on the tipping amount. This is a great deal since NYC prices are outrageous of this type of food. Along with the Korean BBQ meat that you order it comes with Banchan. Banchan are small tradition Korean side dishes such as kimchee, bean sprout, fish cake, pancake etc. If these dishes run out you can always ask for more. I am used to my basket of fresh lettuce but instead they served chop lettuce with some dressing. This is a complete shock to me, maybe the basket of fresh lettuce is a NYC thing. The basket of fresh lettuce here is served like a salad with a fresh sesame dressing. \n\nI will recommend  this brisket, marinated pork belly and sliced sliced rib-eye. I will stay away from the squid because it comes really elastic when it is cooked. The marinated pork belly was my favorite because it comes with so much favor. Keep in mind that this place does not change the Korean BBQ grill. Since the pork belly is marinated the grill turns black quicker and they will not replace it until you finish the dinner. \n\nThe restaurant is split into two parts. When you walk in the left side is for Korean BBQ quest. They have 6 tables that can seat 4 people each and 3 long table that can hold at least 8 individuals. The right side are for guest who do not want to eat Korean BBQ but just want Korean food. \n\nThe only reason this place lost a star is because of service and the wait. I came at 10:03pm and had to wait for an hour to get seated. The service is slow and they seem like zombies. When the table before us finish eating it took 10 minutes to clean the table and when the table was clean the waitress did not call us until another 10 minutes has passed. So the turn around rate for the table is around 20 minutes because they lack the help. Since only two people are working it takes a lot longer for wait and the meat to come out. If they hired more help this place would have earn five stars. \n\nHint: When you walk in place your name, time you came in and number in your party on that sheet of paper near the door. This place get pack after 10:15pm!", "business_id": "UKKz4HdQC0aH9j5lLi4u8Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-01-20", "type": "review"}

We were also brought a big house salad, rice, and banchan dishes while we waited for our meat. The banchan was ok and I really only liked the kimchi. The salad was surprisingly very tasty and I actually wanted more! The salad and banchan are refillable so don't be shy! It's all you can eat!\n\nAs usual, my favorite meat was the pork belly! It was basically just sliced pork belly but it was great with the salt/pepper/oil sauce mixture they give you.

Goes to show that sometimes the best things in life are the simple things! The steamed egg was also awesome and I could've eaten multple bowls! My least favorite was the marinated pork belly which looked mushy and was chewy and not like pork belly at all...\n\nThe grills were ok, just make sure yours is turnt up because ours wasn't and in the beginning we were trying to figure out why it was taking so long to warm up.

Sometimes it was hard to get a server's attention because it was so busy so you have to flag them down as they walk by otherwise you won't really get checked on. Parking is also pretty horrendous on busy nights so you may have to drive around multiple times to find a spot at all.\n\nAt $16.99 AYCE Korean BBQ, this place is hard to beat in value for what you get and it will remain my go to KBBQ spot.", "business_id": "UKKz4HdQC0aH9j5lLi4u8Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-01-05", "type": "review"}

I've been here many times already with friends and so far there's nothing that much bad to say about the place so let's focus on the good. \n\nFirst of all their dry meats are the best ones to go for. The marinated items just don't cut it for me. The steamed egg is always perfect and the Salad is always appetizing. $16.99 is pretty good for their prices, not too much out of the range of other AYCE places. \n\nThe only gripe I have with this place is the space and waiting times. They need to move somewhere larger. As good as their food is people come here because they want to binge and are hungry right at the moment they step in the door. To wait for another 30 minutes just to get seated kinda ruins it for some people. Parking is also an issue since there's more people coming in individually with their own cars versus people who carpool. Most times I park in the junkyard right behind the garage in front of the resto(not that I care though since the Tire shop in front of it is pretty well lit). \n\nOverall the place is an institution with foodies and Tofu Hut has already grabbed their fair share of regulars including Me and My crew. The place just needs enlarging both in resto space and parking space. Will be coming back here expecting for more Korean BBQ awesomeness.", "business_id": "UKKz4HdQC0aH9j5lLi4u8Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-01-19", "type": "review"}

Well it hit the spot tonight. There is usually no wait if you are not getting the all you can eat bbq so if that's you check the right part of restaurant first there will prob be tables for you to start grubbing. I got the dumpling which comes with dumplings and beef. All tofu soup is $8 something. It wasn't the best I've had but I was impressed by the amount of beef and dumpling in it. Usually you get super shisted but they don't hold out. The ban chan is not bad either. Also the combo with tofu soup and meat is a good value. I tried the combo short ribs and it was good but you can tell it wasn't a great piece of meat. Service was fast and food was hot though and I am a very happy wannabe Korean despite the continuous play of ghetto Korean music videos with skinny Korean chicks' shaking their little butts and words like swag sporadicly pop up in mist of all the bootie shaking and tofu soup.

That must mean something, considering there is nothing really special about this place. It's as simple as simplicity gets. This small AYCE Korean BBQ has enough choices to satisfy those Korean craving tastebuds. But on any given night be prepared to wait anywhere from a reasonable 30 minutes to a sometimes ridiculous 2 hour standby. It is pretty much a hit or miss, just expect the expected. After 10:00pm is a discounted price of $13.99 compared to the $16.99 regular price, which is still not bad.  Just know that the discounted price will not include short ribs and steamed egg. You can opt out those prices to get those menu items included.\n\nThis place has been on KTNV channel 13 news for Dirty Dining before, but I guess sometimes the dirtiest place taste good! (No pun intended but not saying that is a good status to acclaim). The times I have been here however were clean enough, but behind the kitchen only the prying eyes will know.
