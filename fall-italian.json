My husband and I have eatten here upwards of 20 times over the last few years and have never been disappointed. I assumed that when they opened the alternate bar with lounge area and extra tables for dining on the other side of the resturant that  the overall vibe of the restaurant would change and it would be very busy. I have been proved wrong.  We are always able to walk in on a weekend and get a table within a few minutes. Unfortunately, the alternate bar/lounge area isn't always open. I really don't understand why more people don't go here. \nMy favorites are the fried zucchini, wedding soup and pizza.The zucchini is always crispy and seasoned well. The wedding soup has big chunks of carrots and celery. My husband also enjoys the pork entrees especially the grilled pork and the pastas including the tomato cream sauce. Also, their homemade italian bread with oil and vinegar to dip is a great way to wet your appetite. Make sure to add the parmesan cheese that they put on the table. \n\nAlso, if you are looking for a good place to host a birthday party or event, consider Papa Js. They have a great catering menu and are easily able to accomodate larger parties.

No such luck, since it was prime dining time on Saturday night.

First, the waitstaff at this place are incredible. They take everything in stride. Things start with fresh bread, a small dish of olives and the Holy oil....better love garlic!\n\nAppetizer....a tasty softball-sized meatball with mozzarella in a nicely spiced red sauce. Not your average hamburger meatball...this is a work of art...perfectly seasoned, juicy and delicious.\n\nSalad....wow! Crisp greens, olives, peppers, Gorgonzola with a red wine based vinaigrette...couldn't stop eating it.\n\nPasta course....opted for both house pastas....the first was the oft mentioned linguine tossed in the wheel of Romano with cream and black pepper. Served table side with a bottle of deliciously spicy oil. Second was the curly pasta tossed in the signature vodka sauce! The pasta was spot on cooked...not a soggy noodle in sight. The preparations were executed to perfection.\n\nEntrees...veal Milanese...this is a beautiful double chop, \"paddled\" into tenderness, dredged in house made bread crumbs, tossed with pine nuts and cooked to perfection. If you can only order one thing here...this is it! We also had the filet of beef in Gorgonzola cream...medium rare, tender, well seasoned...rich, decadent and incredible.\n\nDessert....yes...we forced ourselves...homemade cannoli and a variant of tiramisu with toasted/burnt almond slivers and raspberries. Tiramisu was delectable...light, balanced and very flavorful.\n\nHaven't really added much to the raves from previous patrons...just had to chime in our hearty AMEN of agreement.

To start they set the table with \"Holy Oil,\" which is banana pepper olive oil for dipping Italian bread in, a seasoned cecci bean and cheese gustoso and a goat cheese and olive spread. I wish they sold that banana pepper olive oil because I wanted to have it every day of my life! \n\nWe ordered the famous Meatball appetizer. This meatball is for serious! It's massive and stuffed with mozzarella cheese. Yep, I'm for realz. It was just oozing Italian sexiness, in a ball. As soon as I tasted the red sauce, it tasted like my Grandma's, which sparked fond memories and made me want to actually live in this place. \n\nWe also ordered the Trifolata, which is assorted mushrooms and currants in marsala cream. It was also incredible. The bad/good of it was that it wasn't really needed because they give you so much food, but it was delicious, so whatever!\n\nFor the Third course they serve you your choice of pasta either with their famous home made vodka sauce or fettucini. But here's the thing, the fettucini is made in front of you... in a cheese wheel. Yep, I'm for realz again! I know I'm crazy for not ordering it, but I really love me some vodka sauce and was incredibly happy with this amazing homemade sauce. My hubby got the fetticini and loved it. See, we're all happy here!\n\nFourth course is a salad with red vinagariette, roasted red peppers, candied walnuts, golden raisens and gargonzola cheese. It wasn't memorable amongst all the bangin' dishes but not too shabby at all.\n\nFor the Fifth course (and when I finally tapped out) I ordered the Cioppino with shrimp, mussels, clams, scallops and fish in a saffron and tomato broth with sambuca. It matched all the other dishes. Just incredible. Loved the broth, loved the succulent scallop (just one, but I can't complain, I was stuffed by that point!), the shrimp was jumbo and the fish was perfectly cooked. And the garlic bread was excellent.\n\nWhenever anyone says things are expensive, I usually think they're talking $30 a plate. But, this place is legit expensive. Think $50 (ish) a plate. But what I can tell you is it was 100% worth it! We had leftovers for two days! Talk about an Italian hospitality. Which, by the way, the service was exceptional, but I would have expected that here. \n\nA perfect special night out, if you don't mind unbuckling a couple notches in front of your dining companion, of course!", "business_id": "qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-09-25", "type": "review"}

This is the framed \"art\" inside the women's restroom located on the 2nd floor. Odd. I nearly poked my eyes out with my mascara brush from staring. It's hypnotizing.\n\nNow that we got that out of the way, let's talk about  the restaurant!\n\nAfter months of whining, a group of 8 of us finally decided to nut up or shut up and finally made plans. (Thank you, Samantha B. for organizing!)\n\nGetting a reservation for 8 is not an easy task. The building is a three-story, traditional townhouse  that is very narrow leaving only so much space inside for the dining area, bar, and the kitchen. And, it is located in the middle of Allentown. Yes, Allentown. This fact could qualify as the baby elephant in the room but it seems to be the trend to operate fantastic restaurants in areas that would make your average xenophobe from suburbia go bat shit cray cray.  And, for the record, I'm not drinking Hatorade. I was equally \"scurred\"  during the drive up E. Warrington Avenue...and I live in the East End where hipsters and old school hippies are known to reside and give peace a chance. \n\nThe reality is what it is. It's a scary part of town but it did not matter a damn when we got out of the car. It was a Saturday night and we were greeted by an average Joe  valet who sincerely welcomed us to the restaurant  and told us to enjoy our dinner. The locals who walked by smiled and nodded as if they were giving us their approval. It's as if the restaurant was under a dome, protected by a force field that doesn't allow the stereotypical nonsense most would fear when entering Allentown at night. \n\nWe were greeted by our server who immediately took our drink orders. I didn't see a bar on the first floor so I almost hesitated to order my usual dirty martini and my sweetheart's Manhattan, thinking they were limited in their mixology. Orders were taken without pause and both drinks were most impressive. Our friends enjoyed vino rossos and biancos from their diverse wine list that is 100% Italia! \n\nTables are set with \"Holy Oil\" for dipping artisanal Italian breads, a seasoned cheese and cecci bean gustoso, and, my favorite, a fresh goat cheese olive spread.\n\nWe started with the artichoke appetizer special and shared the meatball appetizer with the rest of the table. Yes, shared. The meatball is bigger than Barry Bonds and Kanye West's egos combined. And, it was friggin' fantastic. The flavors, the marinara sauce, the mozzarella stuffed inside...If I could marry a meatball, this would be matrimonial bliss.\n\nMy sweetheart chose the highly recommended veal chop Milanese. This is yet another piece of meat listed on the menu not small in size. Because I am always the a-hole of the group, I asked if I could have Linguine and Clam sauce instead of the pasta prep on the menu. Again, no hesitation. Wow. But the groans from my our table makes me still an a-hole. I DON'T CARE! IT WAS MY CARB DAY DAMNIT! :-)\n\nOur entrees did not disappoint. TASTY!!!! The entrees minus the pasta came with salad and pasta side served family style. Lots of food to be shared.\n\nWe finished with the hand-spun espresso gelato. Others at the table went for other gelato flavors and the Tiramisu. We all had spoons to share. All were \"delish\".\n\nI was tempted to order the other highly recommended entree, the Cowboy Steak Diane. My friend Beth had the pleasure. The wild mushrooms on her dish looked just as big as the meatballs and she raved about the Worcestershire butter. She offered me a sample but I was too full and ready to birth my food baby.\n\nOh yeah. How could I forget! Franco Harris walked in. SHUT UP!!! Not entirely surprising after viewing the wall on the second floor covered with photos of VIPs posing with the chef/owner. \n\nIt's great to see a gem in Allentown that can shine a light on the other diamonds in the ruff in that area. But don't let  the neighborhood fool you. This restaurant is VERY high end in service, cuisine, price, and atmosphere.\n\nI really enjoyed my experience at Alla Familigia so maybe it wasn't such a coincidence they placed The Terminator's Mr. Universe pic in the restroom...because...

Alla Famiglia has been on my list of places to try for quite a long time and I was eagerly anticipating eating a dinner here.  We arrived shortly before our reservation time of 7:30 at about the same time as another couple from our party. We were almost immediately taken back to our table which was on the first floor in a back room.  I honestly didn't notice too much while we were walking back to our table but thought there was not much decoration in the room we were in.  Yes there was a fireplace but nothing else really sticks out besides the fact that the lights would dim a bit for about 5 seconds before eventually brightening back up every 10 minutes or so.\n\nSince none of our party had ever been to Alla Famiglia before our server took the time to go over the menu with us.  Whenever he got to the veal chop and explained it was their specialty, I immediately knew that was what I wanted.  So I ended up ordering that with the pizzaiolo option while my fiance went with the seafood diavolo.  My veal chop was described as a double cut natural chop braised with hot and sweet peppers, homemade Italian sausage, and plum tomatoes while my fiances seafood diavola had many different types of seafood in it including a lobster tail.  All entrees also come with a first course of salad and a second course of pasta with vodka sauce, both served family style.  While we were waiting for our first course to come out they served us some crusty Italian bread along with a couple of different dipping sauces of which I remember one that had a couple of different imported cheeses, one with goat cheese and then another which was olive oil based and called the holy oil(?) due to a trio of herbs of which one was basil.  That one was my favorite and when combined with some of the Parmesan cheese that they had on the table was awesome.  After a short while our salads came out, 2 family style bowls for the 6 of us along with a dish of Gorgonzola so that we could top our salads with it.  The salad ended up tasting decent, I only wish that I had more of it.  The six of us quickly finished it all and then were in for quite a bit of a wait before our pasta with vodka sauce arrived.  It was long enough for all of us to notice and wonder what was taking so long for pasta.  Whenever it arrived, once again 2 family style bowls for the 6 of us, I thought that it tasted pretty good.  It wasn't the best vodka sauce I have ever tasted but since I was still pretty hungry at this point I really enjoyed it especially after adding some of the chili oil that they brought to the table with it.  The chili oil gave the sauce that perfect bite for me.  Almost immediately after finishing our pasta our dinner entrees arrived.  My veal chop looked impressive and was big enough to make comments about how it could tip the car on the Flintstones.  Most of that was due to the size of the bone although there was a decent amount of meat on it.  The veal itself was cooked perfectly as it was moist and juicy and I  ended up enjoying it. The pizzaiolo sauce was just ok though as some of the sausage that I had seemed to be burnt while others were fine.  Whenever I had the non burnt pieces I liked it but the couple of burnt pieces really made the sauce inconsistent from bite to bite.  I was also lucky enough to try some of my wonderful fiances lobster tail and thought that it was very good.  It was cooked perfectly and was tender and tasty while not being overdone at all.  After all that we had eaten our whole table ended up passing on dessert and I left the restaurant full but not overly so.  I am still wondering about all of these reviews that tell you how much food they received which was also said by the valet on the way in.  It made me wonder do they normally serve a family style portion to two people instead of the three like they did at our table?  Should I feel cheated on this one?  Maybe I will find out on a future visit but then again maybe I will not.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I might come back here again in the future but I don't think that this would be my first choice.  Don't get me wrong, the food here was pretty good but whenever my food bill after tip is coming out to about $150, they had better either have impeccable service like the Capital Grille or Ruth Chris' or to die for food.  Sadly Alla Famiglia let me down on both accounts here as the food was good and the service average.", "business_id": "qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-10-02", "type": "review"}

We made reservations weeks in advance and I counted down the days. Finally, D day arrived. We arrived and quickly valeted the car. I would definitely suggest you valet. The neighborhood seemed a bit sketchy. Into the restaurant I happily galloped. What a cute little place. Open kitchen in the first room. We sat in the second room. Homey, old school Italian feel. The server explained the menu and took our drink order. Hubs and I split a bottle of wine. Nothing better than a good bottle of red wine with a hearty Italian meal. \n\nWe were ready to eat. I dug into the bread on the table and thoroughly enjoyed the holy oil dip. So much so that I didn't even bother with the other two spreads. The menu was very veal heavy. I guess that's their specialty but not what I was looking for. I chose the filet gorgonzola. Our first course was salad. Served family style this salad was savory and sweet with raisins and gorgonzola on the side. Then we waited, and waited and waited. They are definitely not in a rush here. The next course was pasta with vodka sauce. After reading the reviews, I was a little disappointed that we were not offered the alfredo cheese wheel as an option. The vodka sauce was lacking flavor for me. I added a little chili oil and it brightened up some. Again we waited and waited. Finally, our entrees arrived. My filet was cooked well and tender. However, I did not care for the peppers and creamy sauce it was topped with. Also, this was the only part of the meal that I had left overs to take home. For me, the portion sizes were about average. I did not have mounds of left overs as other reviews noted. We opted to skip dessert. Overall, it was a good meal but nothing blew me away. I had high hopes for AF and was slightly let down.

We were treated extremely well from the second we walked in the door.  They even had a menu printed with a \"Happy birthday Jennifer\" message on the top!  What a nice touch.\n\nWe were seated in the area near the door with a view of the kitchen.  There is also a small room (three tables) on the same floor.  The upper floor has a dining area and bar, but they are often booked for private events.\n\nWhen you arrive, there are three accompaniments for your fresh baked bread.  The \"holy oil\" that is an olive oil and banana pepper mix.  It lives up to its name because it was divine.  There was also a goat cheese spread that had red peppers and olives.  I'm a huge goat cheese fan, so I could have eaten this by the spoonful.  There was also a bean and cheese mixture with three types of cheese chopped up.  It was incredible as well.  You may be tempted to fill up on these delictible delights, but don't, becase as good as these items are, it only gets better from there.\n\nWe were having a hard time deciding whether to get the meatball appetizer or the hand pulled mozzarella.  The waitress steered us towards their meatball since it is one of their signature items.  It was a wise decision.  The meatball is the size of a fist and it was perfect.  I don't usually like meatballs or red sauce and I found myself devouring every last bit of both on this plate.  The meatball is stuffed and topped with an excellent mozzarella and then drenched with an amazing red sauce with bits of garlic.  If you order this, make sure you are sharing because it is huge. \n\nThe salad course was very tasty.  It as a mix of field greens, an olive oil dressing, gorgonzola and other incredibly tasty things.  I could have eaten the entire plate of it myself but wanted to save room for the pasta and my entree.\n\nThe pasta course is a house made spiral pasta in a vodka sauce.  It was extremely tasty.  So much so that my husband said he would have been happy if that alone had been his main course.  It had such incredible fresh taste.  \n\nFor our main courses, I got the veal chop prepared in the milanese style.  It was HUGE, pretty much the size of the plate.  A nice surprise considering how small portions tend to be at other fancy restaurants in the area.  It was served with a lemon butter sauce and had large chunks of crab on top.  It was tender and you could cut it with a fork.  I savored every bite (and have leftovers to enjoy at home).  My husband had the filet and loved his choice as well.  A lot of flavors and extremely tender.

We also had two desserts: the banana n coconut pie and the tiramisu! Both desserts are served w cream and taste fantastic! The pie has a very banana-ish texture with pieces of coconuts in it.

He said it was the best steak he's had since we left Nebraska, so that's a pretty high compliment.\n\nYes, this place is expensive ($50-ish/entree), but you can DEFINITELY get at least two meals from one, and there is an option to share a dinner with a $15 charge for the extra pasta and salad dish, which may be the route I would take in the future since I'm a snacker and would rather have an appetizer as dinner anyway.\n\nI think everyone in the 'burgh should try this place at least once, for a special occasion dinner because it's awesome!", "business_id": "qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-11-17", "type": "review"}

It's been a few years, and we figured, the Saturday after Thanksgiving would be perfect for italian - a welcome break from turkey.\n\nUnexpected, and awful problem with our experience.\n\nOur party of nine was seated onetime for our 5 pm reservation.  Drink orders were taken, bread and assorted accoutrements of oil and such were brought to the table.  Waitress was pleasant, holiday tunes playing (over 6 separate speakers in the small upstairs bar/table area - quality sound, something I appreciate) and muted Penn State football game on the flat screen.  We were settled in for a good meal.  \n\nAppetizers arrived approximately an hour later.  They were quite good.  The 12 ounce meatball was fantastic.  It was covered in a great tomato sauce, and hit the spot.   We ordered the calamari, and even a second round of the prosciutto wrapped prawns.  Pasta arrived - it was good, but it should be at Ala Famiglia.  \n\nThe dinners arrived at 7:25.   Yes, it was a 5:00 reservation.  At least it gave our Brunello time to breath.   The portions were big.  Lots of veal dishes, rib eyes, and filets.   Non cooked too long, or too short.  \n\nSo why the mediocre review?  The long wait?  No.   We were in good company, and enjoyed being together.  The problem was the large number of fruit flies that were all over our table.  I first noticed them in one of the empty cocktail glasses.  They liked the remnants of the Manhattan - and the cherry left in the glass.   Three of them dead, two more flew away when I waived my hand.  \n\nThat caused me to look over at my wine glass holding the $140 per bottle Brunello......yep, one dead, and one alive.  What do you do?  I fished out the dead one, and covered my glass with a cocktail napkin.  This was pretty disgusting.  We mentioned it to the waitress, but she didn't respond or summon a manager.  Not looking for a free meal or anything, but as a business owner myself, I would think they would want to know about the problem, and get it rectified asap.  \n\nI like the food, but I won't likely be back.

The reason is simple, in reading the reviews below, I have to assume we hit Alla Famigilia on a bad night, at least I hope so.  The main reason for the low rating was the service.  We were seated on the third floor which is their bar area, at a high top table and the bar tender was our server.  She had to mix drinks for every table on the third floor, tend to the patrons at the bar and come around to wait on our table.  That was not fair to her and definitely not fair to us.  Her service and attentiveness lacked for obvious reasons but even when she was \"free\" she walked by our table without a glance and was apparently hard of hearing.  Furthermore, when ever one person got her attention for another drink or something, she said okay and left, without giving anyone else a chance to order.  The rest of the staff tried to pick up the slack a little but they were jammed as well.  Sounds weird, but I never felt so rushed in a 3 hour dinner.  The food took awhile, which is fine and expected on a busy Saturday night, just keep the drinks flowing and stop by once in a awhile so we don't notice.\n\nI also did not like that we were seated at a high top table.  I love the high tops for drinks and a few apps but for a 3 hour meal, these were uncomfortable, especially if your legs didn't hit the chair cross bars correctly (either too short or too tall).\n\nThe food was good, very good in some instances and disappointing in one.  I loved the pasta with Vodka sauce and the salad, both part of the entree which is unusual for a high end restaurant.  The meatball appetizer and the calamari and shrimp appetizer were the best things I ate all evening.  The biggest disappointment was the veal chop.  I love a good bone in veal chop but was leaning towards a seafood dish. I ended up changing my mind right before I ordered as I saw the veal chop brought out to another table and it looked amazing.  The disappointment was it was over-cooked.  It came out medium well at best (closer to well) and for $68, and for the amount they were serving that night, they should know how to cook them to perfection.  Not a spot of pink to be found.  No one even asked us during our meal if everything was okay or any issues.  When most of the chop remained on my plate and everyone else's entree was 90% eaten, not even a \"was everything okay\".  Just clear me out and get on with the next one.\n\nI hope to have the opportunity to go back and I will not be seated in the third floor bar area and I will not get my same waitress and give it another try.  I expected so much more.", "business_id": "qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-09-28", "type": "review"}

Their regular NY style slices are decent, but I would definitely go for the sicilian. \n\nThe hoagies are all pretty good too, as a good Italian place should do. Not the most veg-friendly place. Other than the toppings on the pizza, they serve a side salad, which is mostly iceberg lettuce, and they put deli ham on the salad, which in my opinion is completely unnecessary. Seems like they are just serving to the over meaty and under-vegged Pittsburgh eaters (who whould be confronted with more good veggie dishes more often).

I was curious as to how it would compare to the other nearby slice shop, Cafe Milano, which left me underwhelmed.  Ultimately, my assessment of La Gondola ended up being similar, but at least the owner was friendly and didn't aggressively upsell me.\n\nTo get an idea of what their pizza is like, I ordered two slices--one of the thick crust Sicilian, and one of the thin crust regular ($2.50 each, I believe).  Additionally, I ordered a small side salad ($3.50).  The salad, while not anything too special, was enjoyable, esp. given the price--I especially enjoyed the generous topping of pizza cheese.  As for the slices, I could tell they were made fresh, based on the amount of time that they took to come out and seeing the owner ladling sauce on them before they went into the oven.  I have to agree with Chip's assessment here--they struck me as fairly average in quality.  While there was nothing wrong with them, per se, they just weren't very memorable.  I can't speak for the toppings, since both of my slices were plain (the thought of ordering a topping occurred to me too late), but a good pizza stands on its own.  While I guess $2.50 is relatively inexpensive downtown (esp. in Market Square, where the rent must be sky high), it's more than I'm used to paying for slices.\n\nOn a positive note, the owner was very friendly, as I mentioned--there's always something to be said for service with a smile.  On the flip side, however, the furniture is looking pretty run down, with large visible tears in the upholstery, and could definitely use an overhaul.  Overall, not bad, but also probably not good enough to make me seek it out again, given the competitive downtown dining scene.  3.5 stars.", "business_id": "DhDNNHZtaBxYNSqJz64ixg", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-10-08", "type": "review"}

It's funny, because waiters walk through the bar area and even use the bar to get drinks.  But it seems they don't like to actually wait on customers or even make eye contact.  After waiting way too long to even be acknowledged, my order was taken.  The waiter who ended up helping me, Andrae, apologized at least and was very nice.  I asked for two salads and he was happy to accomodate.  But then I waited again.  I'm not sure why my food took so long, but Andrae knew I had been waiting and threw in some extra bread.  Despite the wait, at least I felt like I Andrae took an interest in making sure I was taken care of and his apology was sincere.  \n\nSkip to the second time.  While I had bad memories of my last visit, I was hoping it was an isolated incident and gave Spaghetti Warehouse the benefit of the doubt.  Except....things were worst.  I start to wonder if there is ever an actual bartender.  But as I'm sitting at the bar, waiting once again for achknowledgement from an employee, there was not one but two managers conducting interviews in the bar area.  While this is happening, several waitresses come to the bar to get drinks.  Not one even looks in my direction, let alone ask if I need something.  I didn't want to be rude and interrupt the interviews being conducted, but after a good ten minutes of waiting, I went to the hostess stand at the entrance.  I waited a minute or two before one of the waitresses who previously ignored me came out.  I was a little salty with her, I'll admit.  I explained that I had been waiting at the bar as the sign says but no one was there to take my order.  She said she could take my order and again, I was directed to wait at the bar.  Back at the bar, their interviews over, I spoke up to one of the managers about how I had been ignored.  She apologized and said she thought someone had waited on me.  She then offered to take my order which I told her was unnecessary because I had placed it with a waitress at the hostess stand.  A few minutes later, the manager came up to tell me that she had deducted $10 from my bill and apologized again.  I wasn't expecting that, but at least it was an admission of their poor customer service.  However when I received my to-go bag, I only found one salad and one loaf of bread.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is....beware when placing to-go orders.  It's probably best to call ahead.

I remembered the experience being pretty underwhelming, so I didn't have high expectations, but we had ordered food for delivery last winter (no, they don't deliver, but one of the online delivery services had them listed), and the food was good enough that we figured it would be a decent meal...and it didn't disappoint on a food level!\n\nNow, I'll never claim that Spaghetti Warehouse is the best Italian food spot in the city, but the prices were very reasonable for the portions you get, and the food is actually pretty good. We tried the classic bruschetta as an app. It was really good, and while you \"only\" get four small pieces, it was a perfect amount for the two of us. The endless salad and bread is a great touch for those who are fans of the Spaghetti Warehouse's counterpart, The Olive Garden. \n\nMaybe it was the plaque for the 8,800 lb. World Largest Lasagna on the outside of the restaurant, or the photos in the menu, but I couldn't resist trying the 15-layer lasagna. I actually got the lasagna & chicken park combo, which was probably enough to feed two, despite my gluttonous ability to eat it all myself. The lasagna was good, with a very sausage-dominant flavor, which pleased me. I think my only complaint would've been the lack of sauce. There was barely enough. Same complaint goes for the chicken parm that was on the plate. It was good, but definitely could've used a little more sauce. I'd likely request extra next time to be safe. The bread is awesome, but disappears too quickly! Overall, there really wasn't anything to complain about regarding the meal itself. We went in with chain restaurant expectations and weren't disappointed. When we had ordered food for delivery, I tried the eggplant parm, which was really good. My wife said the wedding soup was also awesome. I'd say two positive food experiences out of two is a good trend!\n\nThe biggest issue that I have with Spaghetti Warehouse - and the reason I can't give it more than 3 stars - is this: while the expectations/food quality are in line with what you'd expect from an Olive Garden and the vibe is what you'd expect from an old school TGI Friday's, the reality is that the restaurant itself in in shambles when you compare it to those two (or any other chain, small or large, in the same category). For a restaurant that seems to always be packed, you'd think there would be money to maintain the inside of the restaurant a little. We sat in the bar, and the fans above the bar were in various levels of disrepair. The TV's at the bar were all so old that you'd never choose Spaghetti Warehouse for a place to grab a meal if you were hoping to also catch the game. A small tube TV/VCR combo? Even the dive bars that we hangout in are more up-to-date! The cleanliness left a lot to be desired, as well. In a dive bar, diner, or truck stop, I'd be okay with the griminess, but in a large restaurant? No thanks. I'm not saying it'll keep me away, and it clearly doesn't bother the masses that keep the lines flowing out the door, but it really needs to improve to make Spaghetti Warehouse a destination that I'd be quick to recommend.", "business_id": "9mwShpTgZofOujt4JfyGmw", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-10-21", "type": "review"}

Honestly.  Lidia's is one of them.  Most restaurants in our fair city order supplies from \"food service\" companies; they come frozen and ready to \"heat and serve.\"   Or they're chain restaurants with pre-packaged meals (to \"protect the 'quality' of the product\") from the central \"food factory.\"   Lidia's?  All the food is hand-made from fresh ingredients in the kitchen of the restaurant.  And under the watchful eye of Lidia herself who seems to visit Pittsburgh quite often to maintain quality control.  \n\nI adore the frico and the pasta trio offerings.  The salads are fresh and vibrant.  And the \"under $30\" wine list is a blessing.  Over the years, I've had most of what's offered on the menu and I've NEVER been disappointed by either the quality of the food or the price.  And the portions are generous.  \n\nIf that's not enough, the staff -- host/hostesses, servers, bartenders, mgmt -- are first-rate: friendly, responsive and on-the-mark.  One night, my wife and I stopped by simply to have drinks and appetizers. We sat at the bar and began to chat with the bartender about wine.  We ended up tasting several red wines and learning about some terrific wines priced under $20 at the state liquor store.  What a resource HE turned out to be!\n\nMy only warning: holidays can be tough at Lidia's: Valentine's Day, Easter, Mother's Day, New Year's Eve, etc.   They usually have a fixed-price menu offering those days and they tend to be overwhelmed by the number of people who come to eat there.  The service and the food quality suffers as a result.  My advice?  Avoid the holidays and stop by on a weeknight for a dinner experience unlike you've ever had.   Linger and enjoy the desserts.  Soak in the atmosphere.  Chat with the staff.  \n\nStill the best restaurant in Pittsburgh.

The atmosphere is pretty fancy...high ceilings, white table clothes, snooty looking hosts and waiters, however, looks are deceiving. This is a family-style restaurant, disguised as a fine dining. \n\nWe went here with 6 adults and 2 young children...arriving a little too early for dinner, they let us wait inside. I was hoping they'd give us some free appetizers, but no such luck =(. They seated us right at 5p and seats started filling up fast, so it was probably a good idea we got there early. We ordered 5 of the pasta trios and I ordered the Zuppe di Pesce (seafood stew). The pasta was good...I wouldn't say it was amazing, but definitely worth the price...$20 for just the pasta, but yo u can add a ceasar salad and desert for I think $7. For people that don't know, everyday, there are 3 different pasta dishes the chef makes for this pasta trio. They have servers for each of the individual pastas (pretty neat IMO). They give you a sampling of the 3 at first, which, quite honestly was plenty. Then you can pick one, two or even all three for the subsequent rounds. I don't know if it's all you can eat, but even the big eaters were done after their 3rd plate. There is a child's menu, but our kids eat like birds, so we asked if they could have a little of the pasta. The servers were very accomodating...bringing everyone plates to share. My wife ordered the pasta trio with a salad and desert. The ceasar was perfect (she shared it with me) and she had tiramisu that was probably the best we've ever had. The Zuppe di pesce (my entree) was AMAZING...I'm a seafood lover though.

This is an impressive review for me to give a restaurant as I consider myself an avid foodie. It is rare for me to give an Italian restaurant a rave review, since I grew up eating Italian-American homemade meals. \n\nThe ambiance was nice, the buzz was slightly nosier than I would have liked but it was also not so much so to be considered bothersome. Their staff were attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable. I will say, it was a little strange to not receive a menu until after we were served water and bread sticks. I can actually say I've never been seated at a restaurant where it took 15 minutes to receive one. However, after munching on the delightful breadbasket (The star of which is definitely the Focaccia bread) left me excited for what was yet to come. \n\nI enjoyed the affordable wine selection. We order an Italian table wine style Pinot Noir. It was delightful and we would order it again.\n\nFor an appetizer we shared the Capesante: grilled sea scallops, shaved fennel, red onion, orange and basil. My husband and I rarely go out to eat without ordering some sort of scallop dish.  I can proudly say, their scallops had a lovely sear and were cooked perfectly inside. \n\nFor my entree, I ordered the Lidia's Pasta Trio which is their signature dish.  Unlimited daily pasta selection served table-side. I must confess, I found the serving via table-side a little odd. If they served only my portion from the pan it would not have been as off. But thinking that others may have or will be served from that same dish that is inches away from the diner was a bit off. I had the linguine w/ walnut pesto which was average nothing too spectacular but good all around. The chicken, pork ravioli was interesting. Tastier that I expected. In fact, had I not tried my husband's entree I would have been more impressed with my ravioli. Lastly, it was served w/ eggplant penne in a red sauce. I was probably least underwhelmed by this last dish. But nevertheless, all three pastas far supersede the majority of Pittsburgh Italian restaurants. \n\nI order this with the Caesar salad and choice of dessert. The salad was okay. Admittedly, I'm a hard sell with Caesar as I prefer to make it myself. Unless of course I am eating it from Emeril's (Las Vegas) which was the best Caesar I've ever eaten. Bygones.\n\nFor dessert, I ordered the Torta d'Ananas- ricotta and butter cake, caramelized pineapple, Amarena cherries, and coconut ice cream. If I had to guess, the cherries were present in syrup form perhaps on the top of the cake. As I did not see any cherries (or taste for that matter) their presence within the dish. Perhaps the syrup was used sparingly. Nevertheless, the dish was yummy. The coconut ice cream with the caramelized pineapple was the star. However, I do not think it was spectacular enough to order again.\n\nMy husband had the Ravioli di Cinghale: ravioli filled with braised wild boar in a rosemary infused sauce. This dish was amazing. I could not believe how delicious every single aspect of this dish was. The ravioli looked so fresh, it appear made to order. Significantly, far exceeded the quality present in the Trio I ordered. The rosemary infused sauce was one of the most incredible sauces I have EVER eaten. The wild boar itself, was absolutely to die for. My husband and I swore we would be back, simply for us both to eat this dish again. It is a MUST HAVE.

Decor and service were just fine, no issues there. \n\nBut the food was something I would expect from a chain restaurant like Carrabba's or Olive Garden.

Plus, I spent the entire meal swatting flies away from our table.\n\nI was really puzzled by this experience. When you dine at Joe's restaurants, you get the sense that every single ingredient is hand selected for the highest quality and the presentation of the food shows care went into it.  I expected a similar standard at Lidia's. I wondered if Lidia visits this restaurant often and whether she knows about the quality of the food.

My Dad is a huge fan as well. I recently moved back to Pittsburgh (after 30 years) to help out my folks as my Dad's cancer has worsened. I had no idea Lidia had a restaurant here. About a month ago I met a college friend (and foodie) at the strip for drinks and we ended up at Lidia's. Bar is awesome - I highly recommend the white Manhattans. While I was there I found out Lidia would be in town for a special dinner, Nov. 7. Woot! Gonna go and bring my Mom and Dad.\n\nSo happy I could make my reservation online! The restaurant was very professional and called to confirm (beating me to call them) and then accommodated us with a table closer to the door so my Dad, who has a walker, would not have to walk so far.\n\nSaid table was very cozy against the wall, the arrangement was perfect. The greeting and seating staff were excellent and friendly. My Mom and Dad bought her latest cook in anticipation. Upon seating, Lidia was bee bopping around and we said hello and she promised to come back to visit.\n\nThe meal, the MEAL! Yum, holy moly! To start, I had a white Manhattan, of course, and enjoyed the yummy bread-sticks. I also ate some of the homemade bread (one was rosemary I think) with pesto butter and a bean butter. Had to save room! We did not order wine, my Dad can't drink wine due to his medication. The meal was paired with Lidia's own wine, another time I would love to try some. Since I was driving I only had one cocktail. ; p\n\nThe antipasti - squash and ricotta tart was to die for, the mozzarella and celery salad was wonderful. For Primi, my Mom had Lidia's signature Ceasar salad, my Dad had the tomato and ricotta crostini. I had the ricotta and vegetable crostata with arugula salad. I loved mine, the crostata again so excellent, the arugula salad was warm served on a warm plate. Had a bite of my parent's Primi. It's always good to go with others, so you can share and try out more dishes!\n\nThe pasta was Ravioli verde with sage butter - delectable! The ravioli looked more like beautiful speckled green meatballs and melted in your mouth.\n\nFor Secondi, I had Lidia's Pasta trio, my favorite of which was the homemade pappardelle with cabbage and meat sauce. My Dad had the pork shanks braised in apple cider vinegar and barley risotto (my other choice) and my Mom had the lamb chops with red wine sauce and spinach spaetzle. The pork was luscious and the lamb chops were delicious too.\n\nDolci was outstanding as well, my parents had the Grandma Rose's apple cake with candied walnuts (those were awesome - they were coated with a marzipan type coating). I had the Caprese Torte which was chocolate and divine. All served with a dollop of mascarpone ice cream, so good!\n\nLidia came back over and chatted for awhile with my Dad (and my Mom and me) and signed their cookbook. They talked about cooking and where in Italy they are from and the slovak influence of their youth. Her's in far north Italy, his in a coal town in PA with Italian and Slovak neighbors. Magical.\n\nThe service was superb. The only sour notes were the din of the restaurant (everyone was excited!) and the \"bull in the china shop\" busboy (man). He actually splashed matter into my Dad's eye piling dishes and utensils on his arm busing the table next to us. It was fine, no harm, no foul and he was very nice, as was everyone on staff.\n\nI can't wait to go back!", "business_id": "XmdTkxKyJd7TuDLoiic1kg", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-11-09", "type": "review"}

My group all ordered the pasta trio.  The trio included a spaghetti type with roasted cauliflower and tomatoes, penne with ragu and mushroom ravioli. Each pasta was delicious and it was impossible to choose a favorite.  The servings are unlimited so you dont have to miss any pasta for very long before more is brought to you.  Each pasta satisfied a different food craving (light, hearty and rich) and this is what made it difficult to choose a favorite.  Dessert was also very good and I had split the chocolate cake with my uncle. Just in case you're wondering,  the chocolate cake has no shredded coconut so eat away!

The veggies tomatoes were gross and the dressing was mixed oil vinegar only no herbs! I pushed it away ugh! Then I had the gnocchi my Mom used to make from scratch ! This wasn't that! This was the frozen gnocchi I in supermarkets they were all the same size and the taste was that you find in a store not fresh made! Don't be fooled! It came w duck ragu that was ice cold! They must of forgot to heat it up. Desert time! Well I was still very hungry order coffee and Tiramisu was a old soggy mess! Last piece in fridge seemed like.

I had gnocchi, she had Veal Imperial, and we ordered 'traditional style' which meant for an addition $4 it came with marinated mushrooms, Clams Casino, soup and salad. My friend left 1/3 of her veal dish on her plate and didn't want to take it home. I took a bite, and my tongue experienced absolutely no flavor, to the extent that I had to take a sip of my iced tea to see if I was getting a cold and losing my sense of taste. I could taste the tea. I could taste absolutely NOTHING from her veal.  With the gnocchi, I ordered the sausage, which was again $3 extra, and when it arrived it was a flat sausage patty cut in half, that tasted like a dry sausage McMuffin patty. The salad was basic iceberg lettuce and a few other veggies. The wedding soup had two tiny meatballs and about 1/3 cup of celery. The meal in general was a total disaster, but we ordered dessert anyway, and the tiramisu was still partially frozen. Then the bill came to over $82.  \n\nWe could not believe that we'd enjoyed the lunch buffet so completely, which was only $7.95, and that this dinner, as overpriced as it already was, was so completely void of flavor and character. \n\nIt's baffling to comprehend that an Italian restaurant that's been around as long as they have would still survive with these prices and total lack of quality for dinner.

So I decided to give Alexander's Italian Bistro a try.\n\nWe stopped in tonight, a Saturday evening. The place was pretty much full and we didn't have a reservation, but we got seated after just a few minutes. The tables are packed pretty tight and you can see the servers dancing around each other precariously. The decor is charming without being all tacky like other local Italian places...I love the beautiful backlit stained glass panels that open the space up. There is a nice little bar area in the front with a smaller bar food menu and a couple nice TVs...we'll have to check that out soon.\n\nMr. got the Eggplant Alexander, I got the Mafalda Alexander. The eggplant was nice and crispy, not mushy inside like eggplant parmesan can often turn out. It was very rich and definitely two meals worth of food. My pasta was excellent. The noodles were flavorful on their own, and cooked freshly and perfectly. I like the mafalda noodles, which aren't too commonly used in most Italian places. The sauce, a mixture of marinara and alfredo, was tasty and not overpowering. The spicy Italian sausage was soooo good...just the right amount of spicy, tender and flavorful. They give a pretty large basket of bread that is moist, fresh, and flaky.\n\nWe got the tiramisu for dessert, which was pretty good. It's hard to find real tiramisu anyways so I give them credit for having it. The ladyfingers were a little bit tough to cut with a spoon but they were good, and the cream was very good, not too sweet. A nice finish to the meal.\n\nOnly downsides...no soup or salad included with the dish, those are extra. Our server was nice enough but kinda disappeared when we were finished with our food...we waited around a good 15 minutes for her to come back and wrap Mr.'s leftovers and ask if we wanted dessert, then another 10 minutes after finishing dessert for her to come back with the check. This is one of my top pet peeves.\n\nAlexander himself (I'm pretty sure anyway...) stopped by the table at the end of our meal to ask how everything was, which is always a nice touch in my book. Everyone working there seemed like they must be family, but not the type of family who dread working for the family business, which is nice.\n\nWe'll definitely be back.", "business_id": "5MChfa-jZfMo3vBpolkSbw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-10-30", "type": "review"}

I have eaten at Alexander's several times and the food and wait staff have always been spot on. My favorite dish is the Mafalda Alexander (Mafalda pasta, sausage, and a tomato cream sauce). They give you an un-eatably huge portion which is fine by me, it makes a great lunch the next day. Also, I think the decor and prices make this a great spot for a date night. One minor flaw is that the only parking is metered street parking.

Unfortunately, it is yet another example of poorly made Americanized Italian food. Too much cheese, too much butter and cream, and quite possibly the worst bread I have ever consumed at any Italian restaurant in my life. \n\nSomeone had to go out of their way to find bread this flavorless and awful. It's already a travesty that it's served to me before the meal, but to put it on my sandwich! I'm actually offended for Italians, and bread. Yes bread, this is not your best. The eggplant Parmesan served to my mother was soggy, covered with an absurd amount of plastic Parmesan cheese swimming in a bland sauce. My fathers pasta, cream and cheese. Contrary to popular believe, this is not traditional Italian! This is what some would refer to as, terrible and heavy. And the cannoli? Words could not describe my disappointment.\n\nI'll admit it, I'm already an Italian food snob. I cook tons of Italian food for myself, family, and friends, and I only use the highest quality ingredients and go about preparing my meals in traditional southern Italian ways. I've had phenomenal Italian meals at the few great Italian restaurants in this city, so whenever I get the opportunity to eat at another \"Italian\" joint, I'm heading in with high expectations.\n\nIs this what Italian food in Pittsburgh has come too? Seeing other similar Italian places in Bloomfield, I'm sad to say...yes. I'm actually slightly upset even writing this because the waitstaff is charming, and I hear the owners are great, but to pass this off as representative of Italian food is an injustice. If you want a truly great Italian meal please look elsewhere.", "business_id": "5MChfa-jZfMo3vBpolkSbw", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-11-10", "type": "review"}

I've visited for drinks and pool a few times in the past, but dined there for the first time this weekend. I expected standard bar food and was super impressed by the homemade quality of everything we ordered.\n\nAfter 8pm, they have a special low-price menu with $4 appetizers,$5 sandwiches and burgers, and a great wing and pitcher special. We ordered both appetizers to share amongst the group. The provolone wheel was literally a round of provolone breaded, fried, and topped with sauce. Best eaten by just digging in with a fork, it is melty cheesy goodness. The tomato sauce was spot on as well, just sweet enough to cut through the richness of all the cheese. The fried zucchini was the real surprise - amazingly light, crispy breading with a mild seasoning. I've never really liked fried zucchini because it tends to get soggy and limp. I don't know what their secret is, but I would order this fried zucchini every time!\n\nFor my meal I enjoyed the burger with american cheese. It was juicy with a nice chargrilled flavor (reminded me of a good quality Burger King patty haha, I mean that as a compliment!) and the toppings were fresh. A solid burger. My hubby quickly devoured the meatball sub so I didn't get a chance to try it, but he was impressed. We both enjoyed the homemade fries that accompanied the sandwiches - spice blend game strong.\n\nThe bartender that's usually working is super sweet and makes sure that nobody waits too long for a drink.

When I asked again he said 14 inches so I ordered a medium cheese and an order of breadsticks.  \n\nI will confess that I didn't actually try the pizza because I had to send it back because it was well past the point of being edible.  It was like pizza soup in a crust bowl. \n\nThis place is using deck style brick ovens, which is about the only thing they are doing right.  They do not cook directly on the brick though, they use pizza screens.  The screens that they use are the ones with the really big holes as opposed to the grid style screens that everyone else uses.  I have never seen another shop use the big hole screens, and probably for a reason because the dough was really really terrible cooked.  It was burned to the point of being black on the bottom at (which I usually don't mind at all) but somehow they managed for it to still be completely doughy and soft and not the least bit crispy.  Honestly it seems like some kind of miracle of science to have a black pizza bottom and for it to not at least be a little bit crispy.  The pizza was definitely on the overly thick and doughy side and even if it had been cooked well it probably still would have been too doughy to be very good.  The dough recipe may or may not have tasted good, no one will probably ever know because it will probably never be cooked evenly enough to even have a chance at tasting good. \n\nThe biggest problem with the pizza overall was the 2 pounds of cheese sunken into a large gelatinous wad in the middle.  It smelled like decent cheese, probably Grande (although probably cut with something cheaper).  They are wasting so much money on cheese its sad.  Whoever the pizzaman was obviously took no pride in it whatsoever.  The sauce was all dropped into the middle with most of the cheese.  The edges of the pizza had big bubbles where all of the cheese and sauce should have been, but they were NOT the nice crispy kind of bubbles that could be enjoyed...just lumpy masses of sadness.  \n\nI can't comment on the taste of the sauce because I am not a brave enough man to have put a slice of this DIY toilet clogging kit into my delicate stomachular system.  Fake words aside, this pizza really sucks guys. \n\nThe icing on the cake were the breadsticks, a side item that I consider to be pretty un-f*ckable.  So for breadsticks, Mr. Bellesario (BTW, I hope that this is just some made-up Italian restaurant name and that someone doesn't actually put their family name behind this crap) just cuts up slices of the premade Sicilian dough and slaps some oil and herbs on it and calls it breadsticks.  Its the most ghetto attempt at this particular appetizer that I have ever heard of.  Its pretty funny, really. \n\n\nSo yeah, this place is definitely worth avoiding at all costs especially considering the prices aren't even good and the restaurant itself is completely filthy inside.  The owner was nice enough about refunding the money for the pizza.  Its a shame when I see businesses like this that are set in their ways and are really wasting their potential with a general lack of pride.", "business_id": "UjJMQguryo1jypomvOCZgg", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-11-16", "type": "review"}

After a few drinks we were able to secure a table for 6 in the front and the server was prompt and friendly.  Wow, the pizza truly the best I've had in the burgh'.  I love mineos, aiellos, and fioris as much as the next but this is in a different league.  We ordered the neoplolitan pizza which is very simple, light, thin crust and amazing flavor.  As another yelper mentioned this is one of only 16 pizza places in the states to be certified to serve authentic neopolitan pizza.  We also tried some of the other pasta dishes, which were very good but again go for the pizza.  It's one of the best pies I've had coast to coast and I'd stack up against Ray's or any other historic pizza joint in NYC.  I'd give it 5 stars if it had better parking and a better wine selection.", "business_id": "6-rJjW6ITl5o_FliiNgZRA", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-09-15", "type": "review"}

I had thought about eating here in the past but was always put off by the location.  That being said, I went to Il Pizzaiolo last night with my fiance, and I have to say I was very disappointed.  We started with the Caesar salad, which was OK.  The dressing was delicious, however there was very little of it, and we found ourselves eating entire bites of dry, flavorless lettuce.  It was also an outrageous $10 dollars.  Don't get me wrong, had this been an entree sized portion, $10 would have been more than appropriate.  However it was just a starter size, and should have been no more than $6.\n\nWe then shared their margherita pizza which had delicious flavors, but was incredibly soggy.  It was also fairly small, but that was almost to be expected.  It was $12 dollars, so the size was not necessarily a problem, however it was hard to enjoy such a soggy mess of a pizza.  We also shared a pasta dish which was INCREDIBLY overpriced.  At $17 dollars, I was expecting more than a small bowl filled with dry pasta.  It was homemade, and well made, however it was almost insultingly small.  We finished with tiramisu which was excellent, and appropriately priced at $8.\n\nIn all, I found the flavors of their food to be excellent, however i was horribly misled.  Not only was every menu I found online roughly $2 to $3 dollars cheaper than their actual menu, but there was a table next to us who ordered pasta and received an enormous portion, prompting us to order pasta.  It was only till later did we realize that they were employees who had decided to dine their for the evening.  We also had a serious problem with the timing of the food.  The service was great, however for a Tuesday night, I would have thought their kitchen could time the courses properly; we had barely started our salad when the entree's came.  In all, I don't think I will be going back to this restaurant, nor would I recommend anyone waste their time traveling out to Mt.

We eventually decided to keep it classic and order the margherita.\n\nAs soon as it came out, I could tell it was exactly what I had been craving for months. real. pizza. we scarfed down the whole thing in minutes.

Other than that, the service was quick and the atmosphere was quaint and pleasant. Unfortunately, it's fairly pricey for a casual meal, so I won't be able to come here as often as I would like (oh, and despite what another reviewer said, they do take credit cards).

Their lunch menu did not have a lot of options - but I would rather see a place focus on a few items and do them really well than spread themselves over several mediocre offerings. I opted for the potato gnocchi in a marinara with fresh mozzarella and my husband ordered the penne in marinara with roasted chicken... bot of us were really happy with our entrees. For me, the star was the salad. I am never a real fan of salads in restaurants but this one was excellent. The lettuce was fresh and perfectly balanced - garbanzo beans, Gorgonzola, sunflower seeds, shaved red onion, and nicoise olives (the only thing that I left on the plate) dressed with a house sunflower vinaigrette dressing. \n\nI'd certainly recommend this for a casual lunch/dinner -- I really want to head back if only just for the salad!

I've only been to Girasole during dinnertime, with my last visit being last night.  Most patrons appear to be late 20's/early 30's to older patrons in the late 40's/early 50's as well as some college students here and there.  The restaurant itself is pretty cramped and ridiculously loud.  Tables are close together and patrons are all basically shouting to talk to each other or awkwardly sitting in silence.  I'm a loud guy who's at college and loud noises typically don't bother me, but something about the acoustics of the room... noises just bounce around instead of getting absorbed and the metal tables don't help either.  Anyways, on with the food.\n\nTheir menu is seasonal with slight changes in their pasta throughout the year.  Everyday they have a fresh poultry, a fresh fish, and a fresh meat of the day.  Their fresh fish was a grilled mako shark, but alas they were out for the night already (we got there before 6:30 PM).  All entrees come with a choice of soup or salad.  I ended up ordering their house ribeye medium rare along with a cup of their wedding soup.\n\nWhile we waited, we munched on bread from their bread basket.  Butter comes with the bread, but they also have balsamic and olive oil at each table too.\n\nThe wedding soup was pretty good; it wasn't overly salty and there was a reasonably amount of sausage.  I picked soup over their salad because my past experience with their salads are that they are swimming in dressing and I don't like my salads soggy.\n\nThe ribeye came topped with a pesto, diced tomatoes and served with roasted potatoes.  It was cooked to medium as opposed to medium rare, but for a steak under $30 bucks I'm not going to make a big deal out of it.  The pesto was flavorful but the roasted potatoes were a bit overcooked.  The steak itself had a beautiful char and cooked well as a medium steak.\n\nI've had their pasta in the past and they're of pretty good quality and cooked perfectly, but the portions have gotten smaller over time and I don't think the $3-5 dollar upcharge from the lunch menu is really worth it for dinner anymore.\n\nI would probably recommend Lydia's over Girasole, but it might be worth a shot for lunch when it won't be as loud and there probably wouldn't be a wait either.", "business_id": "xgK6AAhJ-cYBUCSaLzgTuw", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-11-16", "type": "review"}

My two recs: spinach and ricotta ravioli and sausage risotto. The texture of the ravioli shell was perfect - slightly al dente and thick, perfectly complimenting the fragrant tomato cream sauce. And I had just tried making a batch of my own risotto and failed (it was much too soft), so I could appreciate the precise crunchy-to-creamy ratio of Girasole's risotto. It tasted even better as leftovers the next day. And staying true to their name (girasole means sunflower in Italian), their fresh salad was served with crisp roasted sunflower seeds.\n\nSo why the three-star rating? You know the feeling of gazing into a cozy home on a cold night, with your nose pressed against the window, longing to come inside and rest by the hearth? That's how I felt the entire time I was eating here. The restaurant's interior is enchanting - warmly lit with charming artistic details. I was so excited to experience that atmosphere, but no - we weren't allowed to. Even though we had made an 8 PM reservation, they seated customers without reservations inside, and put us at a ramshackle table beneath a flight of stairs outdoors. There were not even enough chairs for all three of us at that table. I had to grab a chair for myself, and just as I was getting comfortable in my seat, one of the waiters rudely told me to move. In fact, it seemed like my chair was always in some waiter or customer's way; I had to keep moving it throughout dinner. The table was extremely unstable, and our waitress had to put something under one of the legs so that our food and candle would not fall off. I'm not even sure what she used because it was so dark. Next time, I'm ordering take out from this place - love the food, but I'd skip the makeshift service and overcrowded environment in a heartbeat.", "business_id": "xgK6AAhJ-cYBUCSaLzgTuw", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-10-16", "type": "review"}

The staff is friendly and you'll often see Mr. Girasole walking back and forth, checking how you like your meal and pouring more wine.  This small and very quaint Italian restaurant is located in the heart of Shadyside.  You have to walk down about 6 or 7 steps to get to the door, so if you are handicapped or elderly, it may be a tad tough.  It is a little pricey, but for good, Italian like your Mamma makes, it's worth it.  I had the pumpkin ravioli and the house salad.  I loved the salad dressing--it's light and delicious and the pumpkin ravioli was excellent as well.  I really chowed on the thick slices of Italian bread and they willingly brought lots more upon request.  We had a party of 9 and were happy to have made a reservation in advance.  Go early on a weekend evening as the wait looked treacherous by the time we left the restaurant at 7:00PM.  Girasole reminds me of eating in my Italian Grandma's basement kitchen!  The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars was because the servers were a bit slow in providing basics like water and silverware in the beginning of the meal.  Otherwise, Manga!

Although there were some highlights, there were plenty of negatives to counter them.\n\nSERVICE:\nDespite having a reservation, we were made to wait for over 45 minutes for a table, standing outside in the cold. Also, we were only given cutlery for two of the three people in our party. Not a good start. Once seated, though, the service was good. Our server, Vito, was pleasant and attentive.\n\nFOOD:\nDisappointing. The bread brought to our table was stone cold, and the accompanying butter was rock hard and still in the commercial packaging. I expect to get butter in little plastic tubs at a diner, but not at a relatively upscale restaurant like Girasole. Furthermore, the fact that the bread was cold and the butter was practically frozen made it impossible to spread. Not a good start. \n\nFortunately, it improved from there. The salad course was the highlight of the meal - the greens were crisp and the addition of sunflower seeds and bleu cheese crumbles gave it wonderful texture and flavor. This was the best part of the meal.\n\nMy steak was tender and the meat was of good quality. However, it was a tad under-seasoned and the accompanying risotto was undercooked and quite bland. The polenta that was served with my wife's chicken was also bland and under-seasoned. \n\nDesserts were average. I had the chocolate mousse cake, which sounded delicious, but ultimately the quality was on par with what you would get at a supermarket bakery. My wife had the coconut cream cake, which turned out to just be yellow cake with some coconut frosting.\n\nAMBIANCE: \nProbably the best thing about this place. It is quaint and intimate. The decor is charming and it's in a lovely location.\n\nFINAL VERDICT:\nProbably a better bet on an off-peak night and when the weather is nicer, but if it's a busy night and it's cold out, I'd give it a miss.", "business_id": "xgK6AAhJ-cYBUCSaLzgTuw", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-10-22", "type": "review"}

We ended up waiting in the front of the restaurant for ~20 minutes without anyone taking down our name. A few waitresses mentioned that the older italian guy (owner) took down names. We were ignored several times by him as he came up front - no biggie we saw it was busy. An older woman came up to us several times and asked if we had been helped, we replied no, and she reiterated that the older man dealt with the \"list\".

The entire restaurant went quiet and was staring at the front of the restaurant (where we were awkwardly standing as well). The older gentleman was screaming that she was always interfering with the list and he was done with it.

Given that we arrived shortly after 4pm, I doubted this place would be busy--and it wasn't--which worked out perfectly, in light of this place's size and popularity during normal dinner hours on the weekend.\n\nBased on the recommendation of my labmate and other Yelpers, I ordered the spinach and ricotta ravioli, and it didn't disappoint.  The pasta was perfectly tender without being mushy, and the filling was savory and delicious.  As Rachel C. pointed out in her review, this place is quite generous with the sauce, which is great because this was the best part of the dish!  It was a tomato cream sauce that was delicious in its own right, but that complemented the savoriness of the ravioli fillings well.  After finishing my raviolis, I asked for some more bread and used it to sop up the remainder of the sauce.  My dish also came with the Girasole salad--a tossed salad dressed with sunflower seeds (how cute, in light of the meaning of the restaurant's name!)--that served as a great appetizer to the meal.  About the only part of my meal that wasn't noteworthy was the bread, which was fine, but just your standard Italian bread.\n\nSince he wasn't as hungry as me, my dining companion ordered the bruschetta, which also came with a salad.  It wasn't your standard bruschetta, however--it consisted of what looked like chopped squash with prosciutto on toasted flatbread.  I'm not sure how much he enjoyed it, since he left a fair amount of the squash and prosciutto on his plate.  However, I wouldn't count this as a strike against the dish or the restaurant, since he can be a pretty picky eater.  I didn't taste the bruschetta in its entirety, so I can't pass my own judgment on it, unfortunately.\n\nAs others have mentioned, the dining area is definitely small and intimate, and the tables are quite close to one another.  However, this wasn't a problem for us since the restaurant was only about 1/3 full when we were dining, due to being there on an off hour.  We really liked the ambience, which I'd describe as rustic but classy, and it didn't feel like basement dining even though it was.  The waitstaff all seemed quite jovial with one another, which was fun to observe.  I have no complaints about the service we received.\n\nOverall, we had a nice experience here, and would definitely return.  Given the popularity of this place, if you want to avoid some of the problems mentioned in other reviews due to the small space, I'd recommend going for lunch or during an off time.  This is definitely one of the better Italian restaurants I've eaten at thus far in PGH, so if you're in the mood for this type of food, give it a try!", "business_id": "xgK6AAhJ-cYBUCSaLzgTuw", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-09-01", "type": "review"}

The place itself is very small and intimate, so it has a very nice, cozy, if not bordering on claustrophobic feel. That is not the impetus for my review. Both times I have dined here, the customer service was intolerable. A moment that I will never forget in all my life was at my birthday dinner, when the waitress came to our table as we were about to leave, and said to our group, (my friends who had graciously paid for my dinner) \"why is the tip so low? What was wrong with my service?\" My friends had left this woman at least a 15% tip. I will never forget this publicly humiliating moment for the rest of my life. This should serve as a reminder and a stark warning for all who work in customer service (as I have myself) that you should never, ever do something as atrocious as what this waitress did. There were so many alternatives to how she or the restaurant itself could have approached this, but I truly believe she acted in the least responsible, most alarming manner I have yet to see from anyone who holds a job.

However, upon arriving the owner ignored me for a solid five minutes in trying to give my name for a table. As soon as a regular came in, the owner tried to greet him, but the patron very strongly suggested that the owner take my name first. The owner gruffly took my name and number. We went somewhere else to get a drink because it was going to be a 45-minute wait. The restaurant never called us, so we ended up eating elsewhere. \n\nTrying not to let the first experience color our opinion of the restaurant we went back a second time with open minds. This time we literally got sat at a table in the kitchen hallway. The drink prep table was so close behind me that I couldn't even sit comfortably. (I wish I had reached around and heavily helped myself to the liquor the way the meal went...) The main portion of the restaurant has ambient lighting and a romantic feel. However, our table was cast in the bright glare of the kitchen pass-through window that was basically at the end of our table. The service staff couldn't fit past our table in order to pick up the food. They kept tripping over one another repeatedly and often were yelling so loudly to one another that we couldn't even have a conversation across the table. We then witnessed a fight between the chef and the owner at which point I literally burst out laughing at the absurdity that we were actually seated there. The owner saw me laughing and made some joke about having the best seat in the restaurant and getting to hear the kitchens' comments. Obviously the \"best seat\" part of his comment was sarcastic, but I don't think he has ever sat at our table to realize how horrible it truly is. He thought I was laughing about the chef's comments... absolutely clueless.  \n\nI will absolutely never return and wouldn't recommend it to anyone. For a restaurant to care that little about its customers to seat them basically within the kitchen says a lot about the owners. It is very clear that getting the highest number of people through the door is more important than their customers. Also to top it off they pretend like your experience has been splendid!

I got less than a third of a pepper on my plate with 3 tiny, extremely thin, tough pieces of veal. It was supposed to be served with a brandy sherry sauce. Nope. It was a white wine butter sauce. The description also didn't mention the veal was scallopine. It was. Probably could of given myself a paper cut with these. The experience was awful, the service was horrendous, the decor cannot be unseen, and everything was a good 5 to 7 dollars over priced.

We had no thin crust, real New York style pizza place. The sauce is good and tangy, the slices are huge, there's just nothing special about the place. Lately (for the past few years) it seems like they're not baking the pizza all the way or something. The pepperoni are never crisp, the crust is kind of pasty and chewy, and the cheese doesn't really get golden brown anymore. It's a descent pie, I think they can do better. They do have pretty good sub sandwiches, fresh salads, and garlic knots that smell amazing when hot out the oven! The offer pizza by the slice but only cheese and pepperoni. I've never been sure of why they can't just throw a couple of toppings on top of an already baked pie and throw it in the oven. They can charge extra! When I order a slice, I usually have to take it home to warm it up or brown it to get the crust crisp. The wings they offer are tasty and spicy even though their just frozen wings, they're not bad. Tony's doesn't have any competition too close by (when I go it's for convience), they're lucky in that sense. And, they close very early on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday night. If it's after 10pm and you want pizza, don't call Tony's. They serve beer and wine, maybe they should add a tv or two where people can hang a little and enjoy the pizza.

At least you know that, even if the final dish doesn't taste that great, it came from a clean kitchen.", "business_id": "SVKC_-gIQFkHElZ6bFsE6g", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-11-10", "type": "review"}

I guess we should have expected that, given that making lasagna \"light\" isn't an easy task. I can't even begin to explain to you how small it was......AND normally we normally split meals at restaurants, so we are typically used to smaller portions to begin with! Probably the size of half a deck of cards (width, length, and height) with like 3 small pieces of grilled chicken on it. He ate it and didn't complain....it was tasty, though!\n\nNormally we skip dessert but when the waitress came by, my husband ordered the pumpkin cheesecake (not sure if it was because he was still hungry or just craving something sweet!).

I thought that Luce had taken over the old Coco Osteria space along Tryon St so when we arrived and it said Malabar, we were confused.  I quickly pulled out my phone to check the address.  The addresses matched.  Knowing that there is a courtyard right there, we decided to explore a bit further back.  That's when we noticed Luce tucked way back in the left corner right next to the Hearst Tower.  It's certainly not the most visible location for a restaurant.  \n\nWe booked a reservation on OpenTable.com and when we looked inside the windows and saw the crystal chandeliers and other decor, we had our doubts.  We thought maybe it was skewed to a much older crowd than us and we didn't want a \"stuffy\" experience, only a great meal.  After debating, we finally decided to go ahead with the reservation.  I'm so glad we did.  \n\nOur table wasn't quite ready yet when we checked in, but we were led to the bar area to sit and wait.  We were promptly greeted by the bartender at our high-top table and he offered us drinks.  I tried a red wine from Sicily I had never heard of before.  It was an excellent choice.  It wasn't too dry or bitter.  It was just right and I really enjoyed the BIG glassful that the bartender poured.  We sat and enjoyed our wines until our table was ready.  \n\nWe were seated and promptly greeted by our server, Fabio.  Everyone with whom we came into contact was very friendly and seemed authentically Italian, as if English wasn't their first language at all.  \n\nAll of the appetizer options sounded delicious, but we ventured with the imported italian FORMAGGI (cheeses) with marinated olives.  We ordered the larger version of the appetizer (they have small and large versions for about half of the items -- appetizers and entrees -- on their menu).  We received a cupful of green olives and four triangle slices each of five different cheeses, along with some crisp bread slices.  It was definitely more than enough for two to share.  The harder cheeses had more flavor than the softer ones.   We were also brought fresh slices of bread and a bowl of a whole cannellini beans mixed with olive oil and other flavorful ingredients complimentary for each table.  It was so simple, yet so delicious.  \n\nNext came the entrees.  I didn't want anything with red sauce, so I opted for something new:  AGNOLOTTI.  Agnolotti apparently is \"ravioli.\"  In each ravioli was roasted veal and swiss chard, and then covered in a brown \"butter, sage, and jus de veau sauce.\"   It was freakin' AMAZING.  And that wasn't just the effect of the delicious red wine.  My partner tried the Spaghetti Carbonara, which was very rich and creamy, covered in a white sauce.  \n\nUnfortunately, after all that bread, beans, cheese, and pasta, we did not have room for dessert.  The cannolis were very tempting, though.  For a final good, lasting impression, our server brought us complimentary shots of deliciously sweet limoncello.  \n\nUpon leaving, we were thanked and told goodbye by several of the waitstaff, as if we were family.  It was a fantastic, authentically Italian experience, and I look forward to returning soon!  \n\np.s. When our reservation was confirmed on OpenTable, it said that if you park in the Hearst Tower parking garage, you get two free hours of parking with a validated ticket from Luce during lunchtime hours, or \"free\" with validated ticket on evenings and weekends.  We took this to mean that you could park for more than two hours for free, but when we got our validated ticket, it was marked as \"two hours.\"  Unsure with the conflicting information, we left and found free parking elsewhere to walk around Uptown.  So...I really don't know what the correct parking situation is there.  But at least two hours is free!", "business_id": "z24h6ZYnZiWjlDTuLXG9jw", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-10-29", "type": "review"}

We arrived at about 6PM without a reservation and were seated immediately.  The staff had no objection to our sitting for half an hour eating olives and sharing a single cocktail to pass some time before we ordered our main meal.\n\nAs many other reviewers have mentioned, the olives are excellent.  So was the negroni.  The ambiance was authentically Italian (and we have been to Italy before): intimate, quiet, and comfortable.  A lot of this is due to the wait staff, who are all at least ethnically Italian, and in some cases rather adorably fresh-off-the-boat.\n\nWhen we finally got around to ordering dinner off of their fall menu, we settled upon a meal with one main course and contorni to share.  My fianc\u00e9e had (A) the spinach papardelle with oxtail rag\u00f9 and I had (B) the risotto ai frutti di mare (a daily special).  To share, (1) cannellini beans with escarole and (2) spinach fried with garlic.  Upon the waitress's recommendation we also ordered one glass of Sangiovese to accompany the entire meal.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9e is allergic to most dairy, and when she asked whether the rag\u00f9 had any milk in it, the staff's immediate answer was \"Not that one,\" which really is the most reassuring answer that one can possibly get.\n\nThe food was, on the whole, marvelous:\n\n(0) The first thing to arrive after we'd ordered was a cold cannellini bean salad with peppers, onions, and basil, served with bread.  Every table got this.  It made a great opener.\n\n(A) The pasta was house-made.  Good, though we have had better - but that was in Italy.  The rag\u00f9 was excellent, with the flavors of tomato, oxtail, wine, and carrot in good balance, and an amazing mouth feel.\n\n(B) My seafood risotto had clams, scallops, calamari, shrimp, and mussels.  The key to seafood is freshness, and what went into my dish was certainly very fresh, with no off-flavors whatsoever.  For my part, I could also taste that they used very high quality cream.  The rice, unfortunately, was a bit grainy.  My guess is that they had one pot of it cooking continuously throughout the night, and that since we arrived early in the night, the risotto actually wasn't quite done.  Nevertheless, the flavors were so good and well-melded that I hardly minded.\n\n(1) The cannellini with escarole was perhaps the one disappointment of the night.  The escarole was blanched first, so it lost its signature bitterness, which we both expected it to contribute to this dish.\n\n(2) The spinach with garlic was 'a good straight line' as the two of us put it.  Is there a cuisine in the world which -doesn't- like spinach stir-fried with garlic?\n\nWe finished with coffee; our waiter commented upon our ordering coffee instead of desserts, \"yeah, that's how we do it in Italy.\"  I had black and she had espresso.  The espresso was very well made, and my coffee definitely benefited from (again) the very good cream.\n\nOur whole meal ran us $85 including tax before tip, and included two drinks, two main courses, two side dishes, and two coffees.  We weren't billed for the tiny plates of olives we had during cocktails, so we left extra tip to match the staff's generosity.\n\nLuce is the most authentic Italian dining experience we have had in the United States.", "business_id": "z24h6ZYnZiWjlDTuLXG9jw", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-11-07", "type": "review"}

Given the large size of the party, the staff was definitely very accommodating.  I'm pretty sure my friend who recommended the restaurant, has tried at least 50% of the menu over her visits there.  \n\nI chose the Scallops - \"Pan seared sea scallops, olive oil smashed potatoes, black truffle, prosciutto chips.\"  The scallops were some of the largest and best scallops I've ever had.  Everything about the dish was perfect.  The prosciutto chips literally melted in your mouth and I even shared one with the birthday girl.\n\nMy friend sitting on my other side, opted for a vegetarian dish, the Peperone - \"stuffed pepper, quinoa, vegetable risotto, roasted tomato coulis\".  It was delicious.  \n\nEveryone in the group left their plates looking like they had licked them clean.  My boyfriend had the lasagna, and when I asked him if he liked it (as I stared at the empty plate), he said \"Yeah, but it's not as good as yours.\" Someone was just being nice because I am not that good of a cook, trust me.  \n\nI would definitely return to Luce and as much as I loved the scallops, I know I would need to try out one of their other menu items.", "business_id": "z24h6ZYnZiWjlDTuLXG9jw", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-10-04", "type": "review"}

And the meals are ALWAYS huge. Their pastas are great--that's what most people order, as far as I can tell--as are their typical Italian restaurant salads and appetizers. You can get everything served Family Style if you like, which makes for portions that you won't believe. Great value, especially if you don't mind taking home large amounts of food to nibble on for the rest of the weekend.

I would suggest reservations if you like to eat later.\n\nWhen it comes to the food, prepare to eat heartily, because you'll get plenty of it, and it will be full of lots of stuff you probably shouldn't eat.

From the layout of the interior, to the style of service, to the quality of the food- this place has it all. If overall fitness and money weren't an issue, you would probably find me eating here 6 out of the 7 nights a week. Love Italian!!!\n\nThe food is absolutely great. Each table receives free bread appetizers and are served with a very tasty EVOO. Ask for a little balsamic on the side and you can literally make a meal out of this in itself! \n\nAdditional appetizers and salads, such as the Fried Calamari & the Sicilian Roasted Pepper Salad, are also very, very good. For an entree, I had myself a basic vodka blush sauce over angel hair dish that was absolutely phenomenal. \n\nThe menu is pretty broad and you won't have a hard time finding something you like if your a picky eater. It is somewhat on the pricey side, but rarely will you be dissapointed with the meal in comparison to the cost.\n\nDespite the location (nestled in a small shopping center), the overall layout is perfect for Italian atmosphere. The interior is dolled-up in a very elegant, but not over elegant way. The noise is adequate and seating can be a little tight at certain times, i.e. a Saturday night. The exterior & outdoor seating are decorated with lattice and vine, has good lighting, and is great weather permitting.\n\nThey have a full bar (inside) to accomodate your choice of drink, and offer different specials per day of the week. \n\nOverall, this is my new favorite in Charlotte for dine-in Italian.

I've had several great experiences both in the restaurant and with their catering. That being said, last night's performance -aside from the scrumptious food- was not acceptable.\n\nI went with a group of ~15 people to Mama Ricotta's for a Christmas function. I was one of the people that voted to have the event at the restaurant because I've had such great experiences in the past. I know a larger party requires patience on both ends and that mistakes are inevitable, but we had quite a few... our drink orders were mixed up repeatedly. One person ordered a salad with romaine lettuce and it came out with iceburg. The servers kept placing the wrong meals with the wrong individuals, which I know is hard not to do with a big group -but it added to our frustration. We did all get our food, but none of the dishes came out at the same time, so several people's food was cold by the time the final entree came out. \n\nThe real fun started with the checks. Given the issues we had getting the right entree/drink to the right person, we knew the bills were going to be a nightmare -and they were. It took nearly 45 minutes to get our bills straightened out. By the time I actually received my bill (which was about 10 minutes after everyone else had paid and was leaving the restaurant) it was incorrect. I notified the server that my glass of Pinot Grigio was not on the ticket, he asked if that was a red wine. I know you only have to be 18 to serve alcohol, but it's important for servers to know which wines are white and which are red for customer service purposes. The server tried again with the ticket, which I had to go to the hostess stand to get, and it still did not have a glass of wine on it. Because I needed to leave I spoke to the manager, who was very nice and told me just to pay for my entree... but he kind of made me feel like I was making a stink to get my wine comped -which was not the case.\n\nWill I try Mama Ricotta's again? Yes, but never again will I go back with a large group & I'll make sure not to order wine next time.", "business_id": "MQnNtW1lHS-eid3QNUoUIw", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-11-28", "type": "review"}

Last night, our server Danny (who was terrific) added a splash of balsamic to the usual mix, which was a nice addition.

Yes, it's full of meaty, greasy goodness, but the house-made sausage is killer. \n\nWe ended last night's anniversary extravaganza by splitting the legendary tiramisu.

The sauce had a metallic taste, so that almost certainly came from a can, and the noodles were mush. How can you offer \"traditional Italian fare\" and not cook a noodle correctly?\n\nI got a \"small antipasto platter\" described as \"traditional greek salad, olives, tomatoes, salami, and cheese.\" It came out as a bed of lettuce with two green olives, hard unripened tomato wedges, BEETS (wtf? not in the description and not something you surprise folks with) and little triangles of generic meat and cheese arranged in a geometric pattern on top. $7.95 or so for $1.00 worth of Walmart ingredients. Does this place think it's funny to overcharge people for store-bought, prepackaged food? I didn't get the joke, and I don't understand how can this place can possibly take itself seriously. \n\nIf you look closely at the reviews, you can read right through the thinly-veiled attempts to say something positive about this \"historical venue\" to the nasty reality. \"Almost half of the lasagna was cheese\"--yeah, they're hiding boxed noodles and sub-par sauce under there for $14. \"Crab meat\" and \"veal\"--yeah right.

The last time, however, really went above and beyond.  \n\nFor starters, my companion and I arrived at 4:45, and the server told us he'd have bread out to us momentarily, as \"the bread guy\" had just arrived.  When it came, it was crusty and tender on the inside and drank the butter well.\n\nAs it was tomato season, they had a caprese salad on as an appetizer special, and it was excellent. The tomatoes were thickly cut and very fresh, and the mozzarella was decadently creamy.  My companion went for the fried calamari, which was delicious although to me could have used a touch more salt.  It was properly cooked, which is an achievement in itself.\n\nMy entree was the real winner.  Braciole is one of those dishes that is easy to make, but hard to make well.  This was stellar.  The salami, prosciutto and Italian sausage were distributed well in the rolled steak, and cooked perfectly. This is one of those old-school dishes, like Oysters Rockefeller, that you don't find on a lot of menus anymore, and that's a sad thing.  \n\nMy companion, being of a somewhat more pedestrian bent, had the lasagna, and it was tasty.  I haven't been much of a lasagna guy since I discovered the Latin version, Pastelon, which uses plantains in place of noodles and tons of chorizo.  \n\nWith cold Peroni in abundance, this was a truly excellent meal.  It's working-class Italian food done with an attention to detail.

I was surprised they offered something like this since the set-up was less than ideal. We were suppose to mingle around and interview the suspects, but it was tough to identify suspects because 1) many people were in costume, 2) they did introduce themselves but the mic was very quiet so it was extremely difficult to hear 3) There was very little room in between people and there was a big column blocking the main stage area.  \n\nUpon are arrival we had salads waiting for us. This was bagged iceberg shredded lettuce, a mealy tomato, and a cucumber. This was beyond uninspired but the dressing was tasty (though bottled most likely). Our group mostly ordered the prime rib and two had the blackened chicken pasta. I thought the prime rib was better than expected. It was a tad on the small/thin side but it was cooked right (I asked for rare) and it was served with a nice baked potato and some au jus. I tried the pasta which wasn't amazing, but it certainly wasn't bad. The dessert was a pineapple orange pound cake which I found to be an odd choice. I was expecting it to be a signature dessert so I thought it might be good. It wasn't. It was served with canned pineapple and was overwhelmingly sweet. Why not serve chocolate cake, cookies, mousse? Those are choices more people are likely to enjoy. \n\nThe service was friendly -if a bit frantic. I felt bad for the servers since there wasn't a ton of room in the first place and now they had to work around people during the inquisition phase when people were walking around. I had to ask a couple times for some horseradish but in general I never wanted too long for anything. My drinks remained full..though the water had a bit of a funny pipe taste. \n\nThe show was bad. Costumes were super cheesy and the storyline very confusing. There were a ton of characters- maybe giving each table a list might help, or even name tags. Some actors were better than others but oddly enough their audience appointed actors did the stand-out job. There was very little actual show time and most of the time consisted of us having to go around and interview actors...or audience members. Which sounds more fun than it is because you wanted to enjoy your dinner. They took some cute pictures in the beginning and tried to get us to buy them for $20- but I wish they spent the money on a better production or layout. \n\nWe had fun since we came as a group, but overall half of us (and several others in the audience) left early, as it was rather disorganized and seemed to drag on.

I called on Saturday night and asked how long it would be until my pizza would be ready, before I placed the order.  I was told it would be 15 minutes.  As I concluded the call, the employee said it would be 30 minutes.  Strange that it would double in the two minutes it took me to place my order, but I live very close by, so no big deal.  I arrived right at 30 minutes.  It ended up being over an HOUR, from the time I placed my call, to the time I got my pizza.  I get that it was busy, but they should train their people to be able to provide semi-accurate estimates so customers don't have to wait around and waste their time.  Also, when I placed my order, I had asked if I could leverage a specific promotion that I had seen online, and I was told that it was available online only.  While I was waiting for my pizza,  a man came in and provided that same code, which they honored. (!)   I could have saved 50% off the price of my food.  After all that, I did not get a single apology or any sort of empathy.  At least I would think they would offer a simple \"I'm sorry for your wait.\"  To top it all off, the pizza was terrible (according to three starving teenagers, who for the record eat just about everything!).

First off, not even a fan of this place, but it was a coworker's birthday, and she chose to dine here. It was Race Week in Charlotte, but the restaurant was not overly packed near 7 PM. We were seated quickly, and our waiter took forever to even take our drink orders. 15 minutes in, he finally gets our drink orders. Then within the next 15 minutes, he brings out our drinks, one by one...30 minutes in, we finally get the freshly baked foccacia bread (which is really the only thing I like about Macaroni Grill). 45 minutes in, FINALLY takes our damn order. I was so irritated but tried to keep my cool since I was with coworkers. I asked about the pasta sampler which only caught my eye because of the proscuitto mac and cheese. It also included the sausage quadratini and carmela's chicken. I decided to order that to get a variety. We all ordered salads as well to start. About 20 minutes later or so, the diet coke I ordered never came, so I asked for it. Then he slowly brings one salad out at a time. REALLY? First one, no dressing. Second one, no bleu cheese. Third one, no bleu cheese or pancetta. Fourth one, no ranch dressing on the side or pancetta. Mine, no pancetta. Only the caeser salad was the one that came out how it should be. About...30 minutes later (we were there for over 2 hours...we had no issues talking and hanging out, but it was getting ridiculous!) our food finally came out. As the manager started bringing out the dishes, I mentioned that our salads were all wrong (I finally mentioned as I didn't want our food to be \"messed up\"), and he apologized. Then a server starts to hand me a dish that was completely off and not mine. So...I got to wait for 15 minutes while they re-created my dish, and being the slowest eater of the group, I was tempted to just take it to go. Another dish did not have the mozerrella cheese she had requested. When my food finally came, it was all lacking in flavor. The mac and cheese was as dry as can be, boxed mac and cheese would probably have been better, and I think there were two chunks of proscuitto, the size of a penny. I barely touched my meal, and pushed it aside.\n\nWhen the bills came, I had heard him say they took the salads off the bills, which was great. I didn't see my bill, and was told everything was taken off. Which was a really nice gesture, but since we were expensing to the company, it was a time where I wished I was paying out of my own pocket. Overall, I would never dine here again. Servers really need to learn how to question the cooks if obvious ingredients are missing, and not hand dishes out one by one. The cooks should also know these standard dishes like the back of their hands and keep the food consistent.", "business_id": "hvhogN-3cMny0Nrqbsjpkg", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-10-15", "type": "review"}

I ordered their signature Benvenutos pizza (with ingredients similar to some chain places' \"supreme\") and tap water.\n\nThis was an extraordinary pizza.  The crust was explosive, the ingredients were pleasing  (I went to a boutique, Sicilian-personally-owned pizza place in Madison last week - - which I charitably did not rate on Yelp - -  where the otherwise-droolingly-pretty and well-assembled aggregations somehow tasted plain and  DULL - - you have to BUY good basic INGREDIENTS).\n\nThe truly odd thing about Benvenutos are the aesthetics.  It is situated on a desperate strip mall, with a hideous bland exterior, that makes you think it is some pretend restaurant, living on pretentions alone.  The pretentions continue as you go to the giant counter.  And then there is this quasi-industrial interior, with huge industrial ceiling-fanned ceilings, cute semi-Vegas-italian- buffet faux-italain scrawlings on the strange pompous facades, all amidst these massive spatial proportions that are wholly intimidating, and make you think you are either in some very, very SPECIAL hallowed unknown reclusive monastery purveying mama's most lustrous home-style concoctions (which you know isn't true), or you are in the most prepostrous strip-mall farce that has ever been created\n\nIt's a little of each, but amidst this aggregation of disparate elements, the proof is in the pizza, and the pizza is incredibly good.  A  billowing perfect crust - -  superb textures all around - -  ingredients with satisfying flavor - -  a PERFECTLY constructed pie (texture, flavor, appearance - - you name it).  Nice serrvice.\n\nI'm going back.", "business_id": "ybkWtM1ZnT2ewuquj3A9KQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-09-17", "type": "review"}

They've got your fresh baked bread with olive oil, a wide variety of parmesan filled or topped pastas, a bunch of red wine that doesn't technically go with your meal, and some ridiculously cheesy music that really only should be played in a movie when someone is riding a gondola in Venice. Sometimes this is exactly what you want, a definite dad pleaser for my family. Sometimes you want something that actually comes from Italy, which probably couldn't be further from the menu here.\n\nTonight I had a six ounce sirloin with some seasoned veggies. The sirloin was medium rare as requested, but pretty charred on the outside. I suppose ill stick to pasta next time, it's what they do the most of. I also tried their chili which was good but had no kick at all. Perhaps they meant minestrone? The best part of the meal was the fresh bread. I mean that not as knock to the meal and more as a compliment to the bread. It was seasoned really well and had a nice hardness to the outside to give it an awesome texture. Great starter!\n\nThe service was about as good as you can get from a restaurant that had their waiters write on your table in classy crayon.

It's typically very reliable, great for families, and an affordable meal...Except when they miss the mark.  In this case, because the East Madison N&C is the only one near the area, they were very busy and we completely incapable of keeping up with quality and service. My family and I went to there on a late Saturday afternoon. They were unusually busy with not many seats available, but because line was shorter, we took a risk and ordered the regular Mac & Cheese, Pad Thai with Tofu, Japanese Pan Noodles with Chicken, Asian Salad and a couple of those amazing Rice Crispy Treats.\n\nFOOD TASTE/QUALITY: After waiting an understandably long time, we were quite taken back with the lack of attention given to most of our meals. First, let's start with the ridiculously large bowls in comparison to the portions. The food was literally dwarfed in the bowl. Not sure who made this decision, but it was a bad one. The Mac and Cheese worked and was on-the-spot (pretty standard for them); the Japanese Pan noodles had one small piece of broccoli and -- oddly -- other random noodles (see pics); Pad Thai was sporting burnt tofu, and the salad was missing several ingredients, including crispy noodles. The overall taste was fine, but the quality and details were way, way of the mark. \n\nPRESENTATION: As mentioned, the presentation was grossly off. Huge bowls, wrong ingredients, and little attention to detail. \n\nPORTION: We did not go away hungry (thanks in large part to the Rice Crispy treats), but the portions were very hard to gauge because the presentation was so off. I actually had to ask them if it was the kid sized portion or the regular, because we literally could not tell the difference in the gargantuan bowls. \n\nPRICES: Regular Japanese Pan Noodle with Chicken is $8.84 with tax; Mac and Cheese is $6.11 with tax; Pad Thai with Tofu is $8.63 with tax, Chinese Salad was $6.01 after tax; and those Crispy treats are a buck eighty-nine each. Typically, I don't have a huge issue with their prices, as the food quality makes it worth the price. However, in this case, $40-$50 for mediocre food made it a bit hard to swallow. \n\nDINING EXPERIENCE: As mentioned, it was really busy and the employees were doing what they could to keep up. But, this was a management problem. They did not have enough people working to handle the amount of customers there, and the capacity of the location was certainly maxed out. When we questioned the staff about the portions and missing parts, they didn't re-make it (the right answer), but brought us out the missing parts one-by-one: steamed broccoli, crispy noodles, tofu, etc. \n\nFINAL NOTES/IMPRESSIONS (2.5 to 3 stars): As I said, I have expectations of N&C and typically like their food and atmosphere. The Madison East Towne Boulevard location did not meet the expectation. While I like the company, as a whole, this location brought the reputation down a notch.", "business_id": "0oQFFOdPZycIBmGkoBrlbg", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-11-05", "type": "review"}

The sad thing is that we \"tried\" to go to Red Lobster first, but were repelled by the large crowd of waiting people.  No, I don't want to stand around like cattle waiting for my pager to buzz so I can be ushered to a cramped seat, fed, branded, and ushered out again stampede style.  The mighty gods of chain restaurants everywhere are wagging their fingers at me right now saying, \"what do you expect lady?\"  I know, I know.  \n\nSo we went to Olive Garden down the street.  No wait there.  Our waitress was very young, I'll refer to her as \"Sparky\".  My dining companion had a sudden need to try some wine, so he asked Sparky what would pair well with the lasagna.  She didn't come across confident as she pointed to the list of wines on the menu that mister dining companion was holding.  She finally chose one and said that it would go well with the \"meaty\" dish.  I'm not sure what either one of us was expecting because after all this is Olive Garden and we have almost zero knowledge of wines.  So de-classA!!  \n\nAfter Sparky left our table, dining companion says that he expects the chosen wine to be the suck because Sparky doesn't look like she's even old enough to drink, let alone have knowledge of the fine wines.  But you know, none of this really matters when you consider the fact that compared to her we are old as dirt, and still don't know shit about wine.\n\nI had the eggplant Parmesan with Alfredo sauce.  It usually comes with marinara, but if I'm going to have a heart attack it had better well be because of something I enjoyed eating, not something I felt like I had to eat in the name of my health!  Hell no!  \n\nDining companion had his red wine something or other, and he was right it sucked.  He described it as tasting like, \"the barrel it came out of\".  \n\nAfter the main course I had the seasonal pumpkin cheesecake.  I made sure to look in a direction where no one could see my face before I crossed my eyes from sheer delight.  I am a pumpkin lovin' nerd by nature, and this cheesecake was gooood.\n\nSo this chain experience wasn't too bad.  The only thing that sucked was no refill on the bread sticks.  If I'm going to go slummin' at the chain restaurants, I expect the constant refills man.  Especially on those items they advertise as \"bottomless\" and/or \"never-ending\".

We've eaten at this particular Olive Garden in Madison many, many times. It has usually been very good: a relaxing meal, served well, the food pretty consistently good.....UNTIL!! We were there yesterday after dropping our kid off at UW and moving all the stuff into the dinky student apartment. We were tired and somewhat sad and looking forward to a nice dinner. It didn't start well. Our waiter was a strangely aloof, indifferent guy who seemed to deign to wait on us when he had a moment. Plus, horror of horrors, there are now those little 'ziosk' thingies on each table, just like in a sports bar. We hate those things and so moved it to face the wall. However, when Aloof Guy came to take our order for an appetizer, he pointedly reached across me to get the apparatus and clicked in our app order. In other places where they have these dumb things, using them is optional. Salad and breadsticks came as usual. For my entree I ordered fish and shrimp in 'light wine sauce'. Our entrees came very quickly, we were not done with salads yet, but Aloof Guy didn't care. He just crowded the plates onto the table while we scrambled to make room. When I saw my fish I was immediately wary. The sauce looked like something you'd find at a cheap hotel buffet or a highschool cafeteria. I tasted it, and yup, tasted just like it looked. Very, very salty and with a strange, sourish taste to it. Plus the 'seasoned' broccoli was dry, practically raw and inedible. I politely and apologetically told Aloof Guy that I couldn't eat it and asked for the portobella ravioli, which I've had numerous times before. It's very rich, which is why I didn't order it in the first place. AG said he'd inform the manager and put in my order and then left, leaving the unappetizing plate of fish in yuck sauce in front of me. It took quite a while for him to realize that he'd left it there. Finally he came and got it and finally removed the empty plates from the appetizer and salads. The manager came by and asked about the problem with the fish. When I explained, she as much as told me I was mistaken, as that was her 'favorite'. She just loved that salty sauce! The ravioli finally came and - ah well - not in the sauce they sauce they usually were in - this was thin and broken ( showing the fat separated out). By this time I had given up. I'm assuming that this was just a bad day for the cook, but the aloof and uncaring waiter was a bit much. Also, when we were ready to pay, sure enough, he grabbed the ziosk thing again. I said, are you going to make us use that to pay? and he just firmly said, yes ma'am and left. It was a pain to figure out. So much for the relaxing dinner after a trying day.

I'm something of a chicken tenders/strips conisseur (sp?).  \n\nThey do homemade chicken strips with a batter that's not too far off from the kind at Chilli's, almost like a tempura type of thing.  When they're good, they give esquire a run for best around.  Too often though, the tempura-mental batter puffs up like a corndog and soaks up too much grease - my theory is that they just don't keep the oil hot enough.  i've basically sworn it off because of this inconsistency.  Also, the honey mustard is like some funky yellow mayonaise.  Blech!", "business_id": "iCOvcfVRfi-f05aeqBLpKg", "stars": 2, "date": "2007-11-02", "type": "review"}

My husband and I went with our families who were helping us move in. \n\nWhen we arrived, we were promptly seated at our reserved table. I should have realized than an almost empty restaurant on a Saturday night is never a good thing. I picked up my bread plate to move it and saw a squashed tomato underneath.  We then proceeded to wait at least 20 minutes to even be served water or asked for our drink order. When we finally got around to order, we had to listen to a pretentious and inattentive server. When my  mother-in-law (not a foodie) asked for her tuna medium well, the server told her that it's only good if served rare and it was a crime to serve medium-well, which was very rude. I agree a tuna steak should be seared and gets dried out and flavorless past medium-rare- but- there are better ways to approach the situation. Perhaps suggest that the chef likes to prepare it medium rare, but we have a nice salmon that you may enjoy more. The menu indicated that the Fettuccine Alfredo sauce had egg in it (which is not authentic Alfredo) and I asked if the chef could leave out the egg because I was pregnant and unable to have eggs that were not fully cooked (Hollandaise and Bernaise  sauce, Caesar dressing, and homemade ice cream are also on the forbidden list for the same reason). A halfway decent chef should be able to do this with their eyes closed- especially since Alfredo is traditionally only butter and Parmegiano-Reggiano or Parm-Butter-Heavy Cream.  The waiter would not even go back and ask the chef about this- he simply refused (and this was for health purposes- not taste preference- I am visibly 7 months pregnant), again, rudely. We then inquired about the ravioli, which it turns out, is not made fresh, and the pasta with clam sauce- which is made with canned clams- not fresh ones. \n\nHow was the food we actually ordered? Bad. I ordered a fettuccine with chicken and what was supposed to be a bacon/cream/white wine sauce. It was so bland, no amount of salt or grated cheese could salvage the dish. No hint of bacon or wine or any aromatics like garlic or shallot. The \"fresh fettuccine\", which should be thin and light, was so thick and dense- I would rather eat dried Barilla fettuccine or the refrigerated Buitoini stuff from the supermarket.  My husband ordered pasta with a red sauce that resembled Prego- it was so sweet and pasty. My mother ordered the salmon, which came rare. She prefers her salmon medium/medium-well and asked the server to please bring it back to the kitchen and cook further. He told  her \"it's supposed to be that way.\" A good server would have said, I'm sorry, I will take care of this right away- and done it- NOT argued with the customer. \n\nYou couldn't pay me to go back.

We then shared one entree: we got the braised pork shank, which came with sauteed spinach, mushrooms, bacon, and fig sauce: soooo good! The portions are not huge, but two appetizers and one entree turned out to be enough food. For dessert, we got the panna cotta with fresh fruit: simple but just as outstanding.

This place blew my mind it was so good.  We chose to do the tasting menu which was about 6 courses, complete with a cheese course and dessert.  I paired it with the wines too. The wine list was definitely impressive.  Lots of interesting wines at very fair prices. They are considered a wine bar, so I was hoping for a good list.  But I was impressed with the prices, there were many bottles on the list for under $30 which is always great to me.  It's easy to fill a list with great expensive bottles, but it is indeed very difficult to pick a variety of great wines at reasonable prices. The wines paired perfectly with each dish, I was so happy.  About the food... I was just so impressed.  The octopus over german potato salad was unlike anything I've ever had, and just so delicious.  Yes, it does sound strange but it was so well done, and the octopus was cooked just perfectly, it was so tender.  I was so thrilled the chef has decided to include this as one of the courses.  We had a big scallop seared and served over corn salsa which was almost sweet but just delicious.  We also had braised rabbit, which again was tender and also quite flavorful sitting in a pool of broth, with some tomatoes, and homemade pasta.  The rib eye for the main course was flavorful and again very tender.  The cheese course was fun.  And I loved thin very rich slice of chocolate dessert.  To be honest, I was simply amazed at the quality of these dishes.  Sure it is a more expensive dinner out, but for the quality and caliber of the dishes, it is a steal!! This is easily one of my most memorable and favorite dining experiences.  Easily 5 stars for Bacaro!!", "business_id": "h9xdY1NO4GnNijNChTy-8A", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-10-10", "type": "review"}

On the whole, the food was very good, but the overall experience fell short of my expectations for other dinners of similar quality that I have had elsewhere.   \n\nFirst, the atmosphere of the restaurant, while nice, did not strike me as anything special.  That said, this could be a product of where I sat.   Even though I placed a reservation close to a week in advance, I found myself sitting at the table nearest to the kitchen with my date.  While she had a view of downtown Champaign and the restaurant's interior, my own view was of a row of temperature controlled wine racks and a junky-looking electrical socket near the kitchen's entrance.     \n\nFor the appetizer, we had the pizzetta, which didn't strike me as anything special:  just bread, cheese, grape tomatoes, onion, and bacon.   Our entrees-- the braised rabbit and the grouper-- were better, but as others have mentioned, the portions were quite small, even for a restaurant focused on contemporary fine-dining.  Thanks to a bottle of wine and a second helping of bread, nobody left hungry, but with the final bill clocking in at close to $120, it was hard not to walk away with a sense that some of that money could be better spent elsewhere.         \n\nUltimately, in giving Bacaro three stars, I am rating it in the context of other \"fine-dining\" establishments.  The restaurant's chefs clearly know how to cook, and their wait staff is very well trained, but I don't think that either the food nor the space warrants the price that they have set on it.", "business_id": "h9xdY1NO4GnNijNChTy-8A", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-09-23", "type": "review"}

My parent's idea of trying new places meant sitting at a different table at the same restaurant.  Once a place got introduced into our dining lives, we went there every week until my dad got pissed off for some odd reason, and we would move on to a different establishment.  Needless to say we ate at Spaghetti Factory many, many, many times.  I have some fond memories from this place.\n\nFast forward to now, many years later, I learn they have gluten-free pasta.  1 3/4 hours after finding this out, I was sitting at a table ordering gluten-free pasta with meat sauce and sausage.  I was not disappointed.  They use a corn pasta that has a very good consistency and has a very good taste... my non-gf dining partner also ordered it and enjoyed it very much.  The meat sauce was fantastic in a super salty, not healthy kind of way and the sausage... oh the sausage, so good.  Now I realize this place is in no way healthy, authentic, or \"italian\", but it's a guilty pleasure that many will like.  I especially like the prices and the decor inside, just like it was when I was a kid.\n\nI enjoy this place, for the memories, and now for the gluten-free pasta.

Foo on  you.\n\nOSF doesn't pretend to be anything that it isn't. It is a basic, solid, basic, unpretentious, basic, fun restaurant; it's the type of restaurant that is disappearing in this country, where we are rapidly becoming a nation of two choices: fast food or upscale. Here you will find generous sized portions, friendly service (almost over-zealously so), and a crowd of diners that are genuinely enjoying their experience. There is always at least 1 birthday song going on somewhere in the restaurant, and I've heard as many as 4 during one visit. You'll see a cable car, you'll hear creaking floors, you'll have ice cream (included) in a small metal dish.\n\nThe salads are 100% iceberg. Want field greens or Romaine? Not here. Go somewhere else. The bread usually comes out so hot that you have to wait for it to cool. It tastes much less mass produced than the breadsticks at Olive Garden these days. You can have your spaghetti in the regular size or get the larger portion \"for the hearty appetite\". Where do you see that anymore? They have mizithra cheese. You won't find that at Bucca di Beppo. They have spumoni ice cream. Sorry, didn't notice that the last time I was at Gelato Spot. \n\nIt's gotten to the point that I end up dining at OSF alone, with my Kindle.

I got the baked chicken which had good seasoning, but was a little dry. The dish came with a side of pasta and I got the spaghetti with mizithra cheese and browned butter. It was amazing!The dinner comes with free ice cream or sorbet but I opted to pay extra to get the mud pie. I have no regrets in doing that! The dessert was delicious.\n\nThe waitress was very attentive and sweet. We did wait a little longer than usual to order drinks but once she got to our table the service wasn't slow.

We walked in yesterday evening and I promptly greeted the two hostesses at the front desk. They were chatting amongst themselves, turned to look at me, and then went back to chatting with each other. My husband, thinking  they hadn't heard me, also greeted them and we were once again met with the same chilly silence. An awkward moment passed where they stared at us and we stared at them before one of the hostesses turned and grabbed three menus and walked us through a nearly empty restaurant - passed all the lovely tables,  architectural details, and charming decor - all the way back to the bowels of the restaurant. We were sat at a dingy table on the kitchen's doorstep. Who doesn't enjoy being serenaded by clanking dishes, wait staff yelling at each other, and the general cacophony of a kitchen in a nearly empty restaurant? How thoughtful. The waiter, who was far more friendly than the hostesses, was nice enough if not a bit bungling. He stepped on my husband's foot once and even hit him with the serving tray accidentally. We were off to a great start. \n\nOur food was as miserable as the service. The sourdough bread came with a side of warm margarine, and the minestrone soup was a little too close to canned-tasting for my liking. My husband had the #3 which came with two meatballs, spaghetti with meat sauce, and an Italian sausage. (He fared the best.) His son had the pope pourri (poo pourri) which is spaghetti with four different, equally sad, canned sauces. I ordered the jumbo crab raviolis which were served unexpectedly lukewarm/cold and dry with a little warm sauce and oil. There is nothing special about the food - it's edible, yes, but it's also lacking anything crave-able. The food is overpriced for what you get. It's \"competitively priced\" with trendy midtown eateries, but lacking all of the flavor, care, and quality that makes the other places so very worth it. \n\nThe highlight of the evening came when the waiter brought the check and cough/laughed enveloping the table in a thick, aromatic blanket of smoke which hung in the air like a moist hug. It was the perfect unappetizing, terrible end to a generally terrible experience.", "business_id": "DlCtdbceo4YNSI53cCL2lg", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-10-19", "type": "review"}

As you're standing in line either waiting for your pick up or ordering on the spot...you're forced to look at that beautiful pizza.  \nThe cheese looks gooey, the toppings fresh, and the crust crusty.  It looked so good to me that I ended up ordering a slice even though I had already called something else in.  \nI got ham and pepperoni.  It was honestly irresistible looking in its tray.  But when I got it back to the office I was like, \"Oh.\"\nI could see that it wasn't as thick as I first thought, and a bit more grease than expected too.  The crust had the consistency that I like - crusty and, well...crusty.  But its taste was less than stellar, just kinda bland and greasy.  \nSo now I know all that glitters isn't gold.\nNow on to what I actually ordered - the Italian beef.  I never had one like this before - its more like a hoagie than the thing I'm used to getting everywhere else.  The meat was thicker and chunkier (that's what she said), whole slices of green peppers, and really no juice.  Don't get me wrong, though...it tasted great.  Everything was fresh and the meat ended up being very tender and juicy.  I even liked the bread it was on.  But its not my beloved italian beef sandwich I'm used to.\nI went again the next day.\nThis time I ordered the gyro, with the idea that if they get the gyro wrong I can take them off of my wall of menus.\nIt was a traditional gyro with cucumber sauce, onions, tomato and a soft pita...but it was only ordinary.  Again, it tasted fine and good, but it wasn't one of the best I've had.\nAnd like the day before, I got messed up while I was in line looking at the food trays.  This time they had baked wing dings!  50 cent a wing was a bit expensive, but those little things were absolutely delicious!  They were seasoned so well.  And not greasy at all.  So good!\nTwo things about this place that will make me come back more than the food - the service and the prices.\nThe lady that works the cashier has such a warm smile and manner, like an old Italian mama.  And what I assume is the boss/owner was also very friendly and bubbly.  \nThe prices are some of the best in this downtown area that I've found so far.  I mean, under $5 for an Italian beef or a gyro???  When I got the pizza slice and the IB, I only paid like $8.50 or so.  ONE salad costs that much at some places.  \nThere is not a whole lotta room inside and seems to fill up quick, but there is seating outside too. \nSo to sum it up, If you didn't bring a lunch to work and have about $5, you can go here and have a tasty lunch.

It was the most amazing salad I've ever had.  EVER.  The chicken breast was a quality cut and grilled perfectly, and the salad greens were flavorful and crunchy and the strawberries were sweet, fresh and delicious and the whole salad was dressed in an amazing, light and tangy dressing that was almost non-existent in appearance, but exploded in flavor on the first bite.

Oh my goodness!! The flavors made the half tuna sandwich pale by compairison.  \nAs for the service I had my food without wating in line and was out in about 10 minutes or so.

This place is i.n.c.r.e.d.i.b.l.e. for the following reasons:  \n1:  She spoke to the chef in italian when she told him our order.\n2:  Our order came quickly and she offered to bring it outside instead of us having to wait for it.\n3:  We got a Coke and a Sprite, which was actually Mexican Coke and Sprite in the bottles made with actual sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup and they were cold and delicious!\n4:  Everything she brought us from the plates to the silverware is environmentally friendly.\n5: She brought two little pieces of homemade chocolate with toffee in it.\n6: Now what you've been waiting for...  The pizza.  We were a little hesitant about the crust just by looking at it, but one bite in, we were in love.  The crust was flavorful and light and crispy but not too crispy with a hint of sweetness and that glorious wood-stone oven flavor.  You could tell that the marinara sauce was homemade and it tasted like they'd picked the tomatoes fresh from their garden that morning.  The mozzarella  had just enough pull to melt in your mouth instead of getting caught in your throat and the basil was fresh and glorious.  It was seriously the best pizza I've ever had.  \n\nIf you're in the mood for something authentic, fresh and AMAZING, go to Pane Bianco.  Support this locally owned business.

I walked inside and the d\u00e9cor was so cute, very vintage meets farmhouse feel. They wanted to stick me at a long table with another party of 2 but felt awkward so I went to sit up at the bar, since there weren't any small tables to choose from. Service was very fast, ordered a diet coke but received a coca cola \"light\", which in my opinion does not taste like diet coke. Oh well. \n\nI read their menu (which is VERY limited) and looked on their board for the specials of the day. There were a total of 4 sandwiches, 4 salads and 2-3 \"bar size\" options to choose from and that's all. Only 2 of the options had meat in them so I was a bit disappointed with that and neither option was what I wanted. I ultimately ordered the market sandwich, which was a roasted tomato, arugula and goat cheese on focaccia bread. I think the servers were bored because it wasn't busy and they kept circling around waiting for something to do, very weird. Maybe I noticed it more because I was alone? Anyways, I got my food within 5 minutes and it came with a tiny serving of coleslaw, which was made with apples and red onions. The sandwich was fine but nothing amazing...coleslaw was different but ate it in like 3 bites. I was still hungry after my lunch so decided to order the flourless chocolate cake for dessert...couldn't pass that up! It was really great, came with a vanilla bean cream on top to balance out the richness of the cake. I got the bill and it was $22 so not cheap...the market sandwich with no meat on it was $12! Yikes. \n\nAll in all, I just came to realize that Pane Bianco is just not for me. I know they have great ingredients and does have a certain appeal, very downtown. I did notice the dinner options and was curious if dinner time is a better time to go, since options were things I actually wanted to eat (stuffed peppers, posole, pasta, pizza).

The chicken is extremely tender, and the accompanying apple slaw and potato salad are refreshing and delicious. The plating is very rustic, which I like.\n\nService was good. We had a great time.

For Years I used to order the tuna salad because the sandwiches are too filling for me for lunch and it's gone now so I tried the chicken salad. The chicken salad was made with white meat chicken that was cooked well and was still was moist and tossed with a whole grain mustard lots of  apple and seemed sweetened with something. The greens underneath were very fresh and were garnished with a fresh ripe local tomato and it came with a piece of country bread. The salad was good and an above average salad but it was sweet.\n\nMy husband always used to enjoy the sopressata sandwich and that one has also been updated to be made with roasted onions instead of the fire roasted red pepper. It's still a good sandwich but it used to be great with the red pepper mostly because of the natural juices the pepper added to the sandwich improved the flavor and the meaty texture of the pepper that made it easier to eat. The onions are good but not the same but it was nice that it came with a small side of apple slaw. \n\nThey also don't give out the candies anymore with your meal.\n\nThe bread is special from here as it's made with local heirloom grains.", "business_id": "-AAig9FG0s8gYE4f8GfowQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-11-04", "type": "review"}

Eating healthy has now becoming a part of my lifestyle. I was told this place was a sister company of another restaurant. \nIt's kinda hidden when we first pulled up next to a bicycle shop. They had a patio out front which was a nice option if you didn't want to eat inside. I didn't know what to expect before entering but when I entered the place, it seemed as if I was taken back in time. I was a little confused at what I've heard and the mental thought I already had, and the incorporation that was now in front of me. It was like an old, vintage, antique-ish, theme. (Maybe this shop is like those in Italy?) One side was to-go and other side was dine in with tables. It wasn't a busy lunch day but maybe half the tables were filled with people during this time. It was quiet, no music, and the sounds of your table neighbors.  I like this for the fact that you can actually talk and hear your lunch dates. The tables were already set with fork, knife, napkin, and menu. Presented a nice clean atmosphere.  They had a chalkboard up against the wall that noted the all the daily special, in this case lunch specials including meals and drinks. Our waitress was so kind to read and tell us the daily special. Looking through the menu, it wasn't so detailed with descriptions of what was inside each sandwhich or salad. Since it was a new place for me to try, I was all game for what the surprise would be. They had their sandwhich and salads and veggie soup in the front and drinks in the back. I heard their sandwhiches are pretty scrumptious but I was in the mood for eating like a rabbit, so I opted for a salad. I ended up getting the 2 wash ranch salad I believe is the name? As far as my date, he had the special pulled beef sandwhich and their square pieces of appetizer pizza.\nTo my surprise my salad was loaded. It came with a piece of bread wrapped in brown paper that reminded me that you would wrap fish if you were to get from a market. The salad had lots of dark mixed greens which had already been tossed in their dressing (delicious, but i cant figure out exactly what is in it!) and they had sliced one fresh tomato in half (which still had the vines on it) and a scoop of what looked like their version of chicken salad. Inside their chicken salad was tiny chops of chicken with red onion, celery, quinoa, and possibly minced parsely or basil? It was very delicous, light, refreshing, and made my tummy full and satisfied. Also, food came out quick. I think after ordering, it literally might have came out 7 min later. That was quite impressing. I would def recommend for people to try and I am definitely coming back for seconds another day, next time I'll try their sandwhiches.", "business_id": "-AAig9FG0s8gYE4f8GfowQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-10-17", "type": "review"}

The pizza is passable but not a million miles from a toasted lavash cracker, the beer is all right, and the pizza cookie is pretty good (it's basically a cookie half-baked in a deep-dish pizza pan). \n\nThe problem with Oregano's is that it's something of a victim of its own success. They don't accept reservations no matter what the occasion, and there's almost always a wait. I've yet to figure out why, because it's really not all that. Unfortunately, I have friends who like it, and my polite requests to go elsewhere aren't always properly considered.\n\nOregano's relies on gimmicks--swing music, gigantic menus that are awkward to hold, and cutesy names for the pizzas. Sports fans take note: There is no cable TV.  When I  politely asked if they could turn on the Suns game (this was playoffs time, mind you), I was sternly told that Oregano's is not a sports bar. God forbid anything should distract customers from the frighteningly chirpy wait staff. \n\nSo after waiting a good long while to be seated, expect to be led through a gauntlet of manufactured greetings and well-wishing on the way to your table. If you're particularly unlucky, you may be served by the effeminate robotic waiter who avoids eye contact--he manages to be chirpy and rude at the same time, the worst of both worlds. I think he's worked there for a long time. If you veer off script, his head just might explode.\n\nI'm just too damn cranky for this overrated pizza joint, I'm afraid.", "business_id": "ML1RJdeZ7bbfMrHvJ7m99A", "stars": 2, "date": "2008-11-11", "type": "review"}

My friend and I were going there about once a month for a year and a half while we were in school. I had never been here so she introduced me. I have now been there several times and this is my favorite of the locations. The tasters I've tried are the toasted ravioli espaniol, boom dip, guaca tony, and Lawrence's stuffed mushrooms.  The ravioli is divine with a nice kick in the cheese and the marinara is my favorite of all of the the marinaras I have tasted.  The boom dip is rich and creamy and the chips are actually a thin crust pizza with cheese on top, there are no words to describe how absolutely wonderful it is.  The guaca tony has the same thin crust pizza to smear guac on and from what I hear the guac is phenomenal, stupid allergies prohibit me tasting.  The stuffed mushrooms are more of a meal than a taster and are a lot meatier than I had imagined but was rich and delicious.  If you get tasters just know that they are huge and that if you plan on dessert it is important to have plenty of people to share with unless you plan on not eating lunch/dinner. \nIn regards to the wings my husband has thoroughly enjoyed the wings of fire and says that they are a different kind of hot more black pepper than hot sauce hot.  He says that they were surprising but that they were a good change.  \nThe salads are like everything else on the menu huge and a little different.  The Julius Caesar has a dressing that is Caesar with a little bit of a different kick.  I normally ask for extra dressing but there was flavor in every bite.  When you add chicken it is finally sliced and you can never get a bite without the chicken, I usually share this with my daughter because it is just to big for one person.  My husband has said that the big beefstro and the antipasto thing are both the best salads he has ever had.  This is high praise since he tends to not like going out.  Every time we have gone out since he compares every salad he comes in contact with the salads from Oregano's and so his taste for other salads has become ruined.  My father-in-law says that the southwestern shrimp caesar is better than he ever imagined.  The shrimp was so tasty that even I liked it and my daughter started trying to steal salad.  \nWe have tried two of the sandwiches sort of on accident.  The Italian stuffed and the fresh grilled Italian sausage.  My mother-in-law meant to order the fresh grilled Italian sausage but accidentally said the Italian stuffed and when it came out she said it was delicious but that she wanted the sausage and mentioned it to the waitress.  The waitress reordered the sausage sandwich and wrapped it up for her to take home and didn't even charge us for it.  I think this really says something about the level of customer service that I have seen every time we go.  We all tasted both and my mother-in-law who is rarely impressed has suggested this place numerous times based on this, oh and dessert. \nThe pizzas are great. I normally don't like the thin crust but feel that they pack a lot in. I read in a review that the Aunt Margarita had no flavor which I thought was odd. It definitely isn't as greasy as some of the pizzas but it has some darn good flavor. The tomatoes are always done just right to give you that juicy tomato quality.\nMy daughter always gets the pasta with the pesto sauce.  She loves the pesto and enjoys the pesto penne bake.  I truly love the ziti since it is flavorful and huge enough for three meals.  I don't really like their Alfredo the dark but it isn't the worst alfredo that I have had.  \nFor dessert I have only ever had their pizza cookie and don't see any reason to change this in the future.  I have had pizza cookie at many places but non that are even close to as yummy as the ones her at Oregano's.  \nYou will definitely find me at an Oregano's again soon.", "business_id": "ML1RJdeZ7bbfMrHvJ7m99A", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-11-06", "type": "review"}

Not sure why they don't seat people since there were tables on the patio open and once we were seated inside there were at least 6 empty booths and tables.  When we walked inside there was a really unpleasant fish smell but it seemed to subside.  Service a little spotty and it took a while for the food to arrive. We always get the Anti pasta salad and a pizza.  The salad was really good and the pizza tasty though it was slightly soggy in the middle pieces. Our server asked us if we wanted desert when she brought us the pizza which seemed liked she wanted us to eat and get out.  Overall it was okay and I would probably go back but I would not wait in any line to get in.

Even when they're not so fancy, you still are left wondering why you're paying so much money for a bowl of something that's essentially noodles with a spiced tomato and onion sauce poured on top of it.\n\nLook, I LOVE my Italian food, and I certainly like visiting the Old Spaghetti Factory as well as Babbo's on occasion, but even these places leave me thinking that their price is a bit inflated.  It left me wondering whether or not there was a \"cheap pasta place\" out there--a joint that would serve up a decent noodles and sauce for a price that I would expect for noodles and sauce.\n\nOregano's--this is IT!  If all you're looking for a simple bowl of pasta like Nonna used to make, you need to order the \"Bollo Pasta\" from this place.  It's bottomless, and the dinner version is $6.99.  The marinara is a little spicy (Southern Italian style), but really great.  If you're hungry, your $6.99 will get you as much as you want until you're ready to unbuckle your belt and go to sleep.\n\nThis is the best bang for your buck Italian that you will find in the Valley, hands down.  Is it the absolute best pasta taste?  No, but for a few bucks, you can get satisfying pasta 'till you want to basta.\n\nOh, and their pizza is pretty good too.", "business_id": "ML1RJdeZ7bbfMrHvJ7m99A", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-11-17", "type": "review"}

Something I never noticed before, but highly appreciate, is that their wines by the glass are VERY inexpensive.  Since I made the switch to wine as my exclusive drink of choice a couple years ago, my restaurant bills have pretty much doubled, but at Oregano's I can go drink for drink with Lance and his tall Bud Lights without being the asshole who added $30 to our bill in booze, so that's always good.\n\nAs I said before, I'm not crazy about their pizza, but their appetizers and salads are delicious, and they have a gigantic cookie on the menu so you can't really go wrong there.  I haven't tried the pasta either, but that's another type of food I have impossibly high standards for restaurants to meet, so I'm probably not the best critic.\n\nBasically, Oregano's is a great place that everyone likes.

He said the pepperoni thin pizza, rigatoni and salad were his very favorite.\n\nOn our first Sunday evening in Phoenix, we make it priority to have dinner here. He did warn us that it's a very busy place.  So we arrived after 8pm and coincidentally parked right in front of the \"welcome\" sign. Again the parking gods were looking after us. If's most unusual for us to be offered water while waiting outdoors for our table. As it turns out we eventually get seated outdoor at a bar table for two. This is where we meet our server Lucas along with his manager Jonny (yes, it's not a misspelling).\n\nTold them that our PDX hotel concierge had been touting about their entrees. We proceeded to order the following mindful that we're intentionally over ordering and that the servings are huge in portions:\n\n- Jr Pablo Picasso Salad\n- Big Rig Pasta adding two meatballs to this rigatoni dish\n- Numero One-0 12\" thin crust pizza\n\nI think we had to be careful not to attempt to finish everything that was in front of us. It was all very very good. As a welcome to Phoenix gesture, Jonny treated us to their Pizza Cookie Chocolate Chip with chocolate mint Ice cream. By the time we were ready to hit the bed, it was very close to closing time.\n\nNote:  The pizza didn't make it past bedtime.  In the meanwhile it was salad and Big Rig for lunch the next day.  My classmates keep looking me as if I was a meal on wheels.\n\nOTHER TRIP\n\nDidn't know that our class would run so late that it eliminated many of our restaurants we had listed that closed at 8pm and 9pm.  Intentionally we keep a number of them along the 16th Street corridor.\n\nSo Yu-go chauffeur says let's go back to Oregano's and say hi to Jonny and Lucas.  This time we're seated indoors where its quite cool with all the red and green.  Asked Jonny to recommend something other than what we had tried previously.  This time we're more conscious of portions.\n\n- Junior sized Beefstro Salad that's spicy\n- Clark Street Meat 12\" thin crust pizza\n- Pizza Cookie Chocolate Chip with two different flavors of ice cream (told Jonny that we would buy our dessert this time. He still comped us)\n\nWhen it was all said and done, there was nothing to take back to the hotel.\n\nMANGA TALE\n\nThe pizza crust is flat bread thin and crispy so that we didn't feel like we were filling up with pizza dough.. Perhaps I would instruct them to cook it for a few seconds longer just to ensure that the crust remained crispy throughout our eating experience. Our personal preference would be the Clark Street Meat and Big Rig Pasta.  Both salads finished tied.\n\nA very big thanks to \"Aire-Bear\" of PDX for this wonderful experience. BTW his favorite is the Big Rig.", "business_id": "ML1RJdeZ7bbfMrHvJ7m99A", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-10-22", "type": "review"}

Not my ideal seating but I don't like waiting, so it is what it is.\nBartender was friendly. Tried the Belini? An alcoholic slushi drink someone else had posted a picture of. I could be completely wrong on the name. Wasn't as strong as I'd like, but tasty.\nWe got a big caesar salad to start. Was big enough for two people. Was just ok...kind of dry in my opinion. Definitely could've used more dressing. Probably wouldn't get again- their other salads look a lot better anyways.\nSomehow in all this, we changed our minds about deep dish (sorry chi town), and went with a \"make your own\" thin crust. I got sausage, pepperoni, spiced feta, roasted garlic, and spinach on my half and my husband got sausage, pepperoni, garlic, and bacon on his.\nI was a little worried about my choices and how they'd turn out shortly after we placed the order. Those ingredients can definitely overwhelm a pizza. The wait was usual...half hr maybe?\nLemme tell you.....that pizza was one of the best pizzas I've ever eaten.......they didn't put TOO much of each topping, so you didn't get too much of one flavor overpowering another (aka garlic or feta). Everything blended perfectly and was so stinkin delicious I never wanted it to end......my husband loved his just as much. \nOverall for the salad, pizza, 2 beers, 2 \"specialty\" drinks, and a tip....the final bill came to around $77. Kind of expensive in my opinion. Adding your own toppings individually can get kind of pricey so I'd probably get a pizza off the menu choices next time?

(It's a shame that Phoenix is lacking on options when it comes to Noodle Houses; Chicago, New York, and DC have noodles galore but we're not there yet I guess.)  Anyways, Cherryblossom has a welcoming ambiance and decent service too. I've been a few times, so I figured it would be the perfect place to stop for a late dinner last night after Urban Affair.  (It was Friday night around 9:30, so no problem getting in and seated right away).\n\nWe sat at the bar and got drinks immediately.  Since the BF had already eaten a bunch of appetizers at the event we were at, he said he'd just share whatever I ordered.  So, I chose the miso eggplant appetizer and the Yaki Udon Noodle entree with tofu.  The eggplant dish was really tasty but they served it straight from the stove and we both burned our mouths taking the first bite.  We had to let it sit another few minutes to cool down enough to eat it.  (Note - I'm not complaining; I'd rather have my food served too hot than not hot enough... )  \n\nWe finished the eggplant dish up right as the noodle dish arrived.  The noodles themselves were cooked just right but the dish had a weird flavor to it.  It just didn't taste right, or maybe it was just nothing special.  Either way, I would skip the Yaki Udon and go for something else on the menu when you go.\n\nAlthough I wouldn't rave about the food on my most recent visit to Cherryblossom, it was quick and cheap for a latenight dinner.

That's not surprising. Most small independent restaurants have this problem. Expect it, and be ok with it so that you can enjoy a delicious meal with no stress. \n\nMy boyfriend always orders the same thing. He prefers to have his soup scalding hot and full of seafood. He is never, ever disappointed in the dish called Champon. It's huge, super hot, chock full of seafood and perfect noodles. He loves it. I think it's tasty, but I'm not so hooked on soup. I order something different every time and we share our dishes. \n\nThe bread basket is always good here. I love their banana bread. It was the perfect forerunner to the chicken salad I ordered on Sunday. I had a beautiful plate brimming full of fresh, delicious spring greens and topped with two grilled chicken breasts that were sliced up and artistically placed upon the heap of greens, then topped with a super tasty light but creamy sesame dressing. I also ordered the sushi combo plate which came with a small salad (for the bf) and a cup of terrific miso soup for $11.00 (it's an appetizer and it totally satisfies)! \n\nMind you, the service lacked. I think there were two servers for the whole restaurant, so ask for a big glass of water when you arrive, or order two drinks in advance. Know the restaurant's limitations and you'll be glad you went, anyway! The ambiance is lovely; the open kitchen makes it so homey and yet romantic with the brick work and artistic lighting. \n\nPS.

I have taken my family there at least a dozen times and it appears as if the service which was so-so to begin with has deteriorated to just plain incompetent. Today was the final straw. My wife and I arrived there at 11:35 am for an early lunch and while the place was not empty, it was not packed either. We were seated immediately in the back room which was empty when we arrived. The server promptly took our drink order and brought it to us. She said she'd give us a few minutes to look over the menu. A few minutes went by, then another few minutes, then another and by 11:57, our order had still not been taken. At that point, my wife flagged down the host who took our order. I should point out that both my wife and I had ordered two simple lunch items from the menu without any substitutions or special requests. Two minutes later (around 11:59) our server appeared and asked if we had decided what we wanted. After informing her that we just gave our order to the host, she vanished. Both our orders were supposed to come with soup and salad and still by 12:14, neither had arrived. At that point, more people had arrived and the several tables in the back room where we were had become occupied. We also noticed that these customers, who arrived well after we had, had been served their salads, soups and even their meals while we sat there waiting. At that point I went to speak with the host about where our missing salads and soups were and she smiled politely but did not respond. My wife and I decided we were not going to pay for such incompetent service and just walked out. The last time I was there, the service was slow and they did not bring one of the salads for one of the meals we ordered. Other times we have gone there and waited 10 minutes to even be asked for our drink order when the place was not even half full. It just seems to get worse and worse at Cherry Blossom.\n\nSo in conclusion. If you enjoy sitting and waiting while watching other customers who walked in 10 or 15 minutes or more after you did get their orders taken and served their food, this is the place for you. It is my belief that management is to blame for Cherry Blossom's poor service. Fortunately, I can take my money and spend it elsewhere and that's just what we did after we left. Cherry Blossom will not be getting any more visits from us.", "business_id": "AkOruz5CrCxUmXe1p_WoRg", "stars": 1, "date": "2009-10-20", "type": "review"}

It's located in a dodgy strip mall east of Rosie McCaffrey's Irish Pub.  A weird location, but once you walk through the door of Cherry Blossom you are transported to a little rustic restaurant setting.  It was a nice surprise.\n\nThe place was busy.  We had to wait for a little bit because we didn't have a reservation.  Our table finally opened up and the three of us took our seats.  I was pleasantly surprised with the prices on the menu.  The place wasn't going to break us.  Another thing I noticed was that the menu items were all over the place.  Sushi, Japanese Food, Asian Noodles, Italian Pasta and so on.\n\nOur waitress was an interesting soul.  I will leave it at that.  She showed up to take our order and deliver our food and that was pretty much it.  Our water glasses were empty for most of our dinner.  I ended up pouring our bottle of wine because my date refused to pour it.  He gave up on our waitress.\n\nWe had Spring Rolls with a peanut sauce and a Spicy Tuna Roll to start the dinner.  I enjoyed the spring rolls.  The spicy tuna roll was a little bit fishy.  I was scared.  My main dish was the Korean Spicy Beef.  It was one of their signature dishes.  I don't know why.  It was just okay.  The sauce was very rich.  Almost overwhelming.  I forced my self to keep eating.  I don't think I will order that again.\n\nCherry Blossom creates a nice environment and the prices are right.  No wonder it is crowded.  When I return I will try something else.  After all the menu is huge.  Something has to be good on there.  Three stars.", "business_id": "AkOruz5CrCxUmXe1p_WoRg", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-10-26", "type": "review"}

It's pretty cozy inside, like someone said, Asian European.  The menu is huge.  I'm typically a picky person and will only find one or two things on any given menu that I want to eat, but this menu...I would try half of it.\n\nHowever, I had a hankerin' for sushi, so that's what I ordered.  I was a little disappointed that they didn't have an individual selection of nigiri to choose from, but they did have a combo option for nigiri, which is usually what I like to see anyway.  I decided to try the Philly roll and the Alaskan roll.  I was also concerned this might not fill me up, so I also ordered a bowl of miso ($2).\n\nFirst of all, the miso was delicious.  It had raw cabbage in it, which I didn't really like (nor have I seen it before), but other than that, it was one of the best miso soups I've ever had.  Secondly, the Philly roll was awesome!  It was made with smoked salmon, which made it a million times more delicious than usual. The Alaskan roll had cooked salmon, and it was good, but couldn't compare to the Philly roll with smoked salmon.\n\nAlso, I didn't realize they served bread at the table (wasn't really expecting that at an Asian restaurant).  We had two rolls and two cinnamon and sugar crostinis in our basket.  They were both good.  Nothing special about the rolls, though.  Just your typical dinner roll.  Because of the bread, I ended up being super full at the end of my meal, which I wasn't expecting at all.\n\nMy fiance ordered the shrimp pad thai.  He asked for super-extra hot, but it came not spicy at all.  They gave him chili sauce, though, which helped him out.  He absolutely loved it.  Normally, he doesn't really like Thai or Japanese food that much, but he couldn't stop talking about how good his food was.  That's a giant thumbs up for this place, just for impressing him with Thai food.\n\nOverall it was excellent.  We went at 8pm on a Sunday night and the place was packed.  I see that as a great sign.  Our service was normal, nothing to complain about, so overall, the two of us gives Cherryblossom Noodle Cafe 5 stars :)", "business_id": "AkOruz5CrCxUmXe1p_WoRg", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-09-26", "type": "review"}

My go-to order is TanTan-Men which is actually kind of a problem considering I love it so much I rarely venture out from it and I'm sure there are other noodle dishes that are just as delicious that I am missing out on (feel bad for me). But, if you like spice, the TanTan-Men is the way to go. It will fill your stomach and clear your sinuses, and the order is HUGE. Definitely a two, or maybe even three, sitting meal. Which reminds me, once after dining in and barely denting my ginormous soup order, I proceeded to have a minor panic attack about how I was going to get this ramen equivalent of hoover dam into a to-go container without spilling it all over myself and causing a major scene. This panic attack proved to be completely unwarranted, since as soon as I said I wanted to take the rest home they took it and neatly packaged it FOR ME which was very nice and appreciated (I'm seriously not sure what I would have done if they brought me a container...cried, possibly). \n\nThis is the kind of service I'm writing this review about. Let me explain:\n\nEvery year since I've known him, my boyfriend hibernates from approximately January to June to study for an extremely difficult exam called the \"CFA\".  It's like the Bar except it's harder, it's about finance, and you have to take (and pass) a newer and harder level every year for three years to finally become a \"CFA\". This year the test was in June and of course, as soon as he was done with it we wanted to do something we hadn't been able to do for quite a while: a good old fashioned bar crawl.  This bar crawl went pretty long and at one point I remember playing the always appropriate song \"Stay Fly\" by Academy Award winning rap group Three Six Mafia on a jukebox at some dive bar whose name I can't even recall right now. Fast forward 24 hours later, and I can't find my wallet. I just KNEW I lost it on the bar crawl, and highly suspected it was during aforementioned jukebox session. I called every bar we visited to no avail and finally just came to terms with the fact that my cherry red Kate Spade wallet that I loved was gone forever. I bought a new wallet, got a new ID, new credit cards, all that fun stuff, and went on with my life.\n\nFast forward a couple months later. There's a package at my door. It's from Cherry Blossom Noodle Caf\u00e9. \"Hmm...I don't remember ordering takeout from Cherry Blossom Noodle Caf\u00e9,\" I think, \"and if I did, sending it UPS is a very odd method of delivery\".  Then it dawned on me...what's my hangover food of choice after a good old fashioned bar crawl that ends with me playing inappropriate songs by Academy Award winning rap groups at bars whose name I can't recall? OMG NOODLES!!!!  Oh yes, I went to Cherry Blossom the next day for a hangover lunch, left my wallet there, and proceeded to completely block out the entire trip while trying to remember what bar I could have possibly left my wallet at the night before.  They got my address from my ID, packaged it up, paid the shipping, and MAILED IT TO ME. It was seriously one of the happiest days of my life. Any place that will go that much out of their way (Mind you, I never even CALLED them about the wallet. They had nothing to go on here.) to help a customer will never get less than 5 stars in my book though it doesn't hurt that their food is delicious, cures hangover, and packs itself up to go without you making a scene.

Since then I've tried another place besides Cherryblossom in the Valley and have been told that Phoenix just doesn't have a good \"ramen scene.\" I'm glad I didn't give up my search before I remembered this place! \n\nOther reviewers are right, this place is definitely buzzing with activity, and with only one cook and what appeared to be one server on a Sunday evening they were doing remarkably well. It did, however, take a little while for the waiter to see us once we were seated, and the table next to us complained about not being given menus. Part of that may have been due to the layout of the restaurant- we were in a side room that seemed cut off from the rest of the place. \n\nOnce our orders were placed the food arrived fairly quickly, and our drinks were delivered about the same time. To start we had gyoza, which arrived piping hot. \n\nHe had the Tan-Tan Men (spicy ramen,) and I had the Cha-shu (a more traditional-style ramen.) As usually happens when I dine out with my boyfriend, he chose the better dish. The broth was very flavorful and spicy enough to set his nose running, which according to him was one of the more important criteria... I can't really argue with that logic since I treat horshradish similarly. \n\nMy ramen dish was excellent, jealousy of my boyfriend's meal aside. The amount of pork in it was plentiful, and the noodles were soft and not too overcooked.\n\nThe atmosphere of this place is very friendly and inviting, it would be a great place to grab lunch on a not-so-busy day, but it was still enjoyable even with the wait. It lent itself well to casual conversation. \n\nIf you are a little impatient (or your date is) then it might be best to try somewhere a little less hectic. However if you don't mind sitting around a bit and chatting, I highly recommend checking out this local noodle house.", "business_id": "AkOruz5CrCxUmXe1p_WoRg", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-11-24", "type": "review"}

If I knew it was shrimp shuimai, I wouldn't have ordered it because of the obvious differences between the two. This is the probably just the Asian side in me but that bothered me because they are two different dishes. As for the food order, it took us 45mins to get our actual dinner because the server didn't put the order in until 10mins after we finished our appetizer.

We called to make a reservation and when we came in we were seated without menus. Now working in restaurants this is almost un-heard of but like I said we were hungry...\n\nThe waiter came over and asked if we would like something to drink (A little rudely) but like I keep saying we were hungry. Since we didn't have any menus including a wine menu, we asked the waiter to see some menus. He proceeded to only bring a wine menu...\n\nAfter we made are choice we laid the menu down in clear vision of the waiter (A definite sign to come back to the table.) He then proceeded to take the other tables' orders. (Perfectly fine). Oh and they had both food and drink menus as this comes back later in the story.\n\nWe waited for a solid 10 min before trying to flag down the waiter....NOTHING. We decided to try to flag him down and he was having none of it. We then got up from the table and left! Walking right passed the so called manager (Older lady with short brown hair) she told us to have a good night as if we just had a great dinner.....\n\nWe were so hungry we needed to go somewhere else!! On the way to a much nicer and hospitable establishment. I called Cristo's and asked to speak to the manager. The lady who told us to have a good night answered and told us she was the head manager and then proceeded to tell us that not giving people who sit down at a restaurant menus unless they ask...

I was expecting to dine here but it was much more similar to a diner experience were you get whammed bammed and thank you'd as we were in and out in a jiffy.\n\nMy husband loves classic Italian Foods and according to reviews Christo's seemed like a top destination. Honestly in general the food was OK but not great and nothing I'd drive out of my way for. I almost never consider service as part of my review since it varies all the time everywhere but in this case it sort of even lessened the experience so MUCH that I have to consider it otherwise I would have given Christo's three stars.\n\nOur waiter quickly greats us and ask if we want the menu or the restaurant week special. Despite being around 70 years old he was very quick talking and very speedy and sort of made us nervous but what really bothered me the most was him  and his helpers standing there not to far from us with his arms crossed just watching us like a hawk eating the whole time. \n\nNow the food.\n\nI started with a Christo's Caesar Salad. I could tell the dressing was house made as well as the croutons. The dressing wasn't properly emulsified nor was it balanced in flavors and was super heavy with lemon. The croutons were crisp and buttery. I pointed out the faults since I know them but it really was an OK salad. I do note I wasn't offered fresh ground pepper, nicer restaurants do offer fresh ground pepper for Caesar Salads.\n\nI was sort of excited to have the classic dish Sole Meuniere here. The Christo's Version is nontraditional as the fish seemed heavily coated (maybe battered not sure) with flour in a lemon white wine sauce in stead of a traditional lightly floured and prepared in browned butter. The fresh spinach on the side was just plain without anything on it. \n\nDesserts seemed house made and were OK. We both liked the lemon cake better over the mousse.\n\nA glass of house wine was included with our dinners and during the meal we finished it and my husband ordered another round. He noticed a price difference from the menu and questioned our server. The server confirmed it wasn't the same price as the menu and said that for restaurant week they up charge the wine. It was only a few dollars but I feel this is bad business and not good for customer relations.\n\nI was really torn between two and three stars but the surprise of the wine up charge, being really rushed though dinner and with the waiter and his help all standing across from us just watching us the whole time in a unprofessional way sort of spoiled the dining experience.\n\n2.5 Stars", "business_id": "3CSaqRNvYg7ZdN2zwxwzVw", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-09-28", "type": "review"}

Our server waited on them and brought out wines/drinks and salads to them before we had any items on our table.  This group behind us were definitely in \"party mode\" as they were getting louder and louder. After we finished our soup and salad, the noise level from that table was now at disaster level. We were not able to hear or speak to anyone at our table due to the noise. We asked to move and were seated in the bar area where it was much quieter.

If I had written this Friday night and they didn't offer good vegan options it could have easily been a 1 star review.\n\nThe funny part of this saga is I had completely forgotten about my prior review which had to do with Pizza Heaven figuring out orders with different toppings, charges, etc. \n\nRecently I have been complaining about how expensive Z pizza has been getting, Pizza Heaven's location is closer and I thought would be cheaper so here goes; round two.\n\nThe order: 3 topping large pizza with vegan cheese, on their menu listed for $17.50. When I arrived to pick up the pie I was told \" That will be $27.?? \" What?!?! \"No, I just had a 3 topping pizza, just one...nothing else\".\n\nThis is where the discussion began on how they charge for toppings, apparently their policy is to rip people off? I think we all learned in the 4th grade (ok maybe not) if you put 3 toppings on one half and 3 toppings on the second half you have used the same amount of toppings for the pie - the toppings may be different yes, but the net amount of toppings used (and might I add purchased by the establishment) is still the same. Since my girlfriend can't stand onions, and I hate those little black olives we each had our own side of 3 toppings each BUT...get this....were charged for 6 toppings! Recap: no more toppings were used total on the pizza but because they were all different apparently they have made it a policy to charge for 6 toppings. The vegan cheese was also an extra $2 but not listed on their menu online (or at the restaurant). \n\nThey ended up comping me for one topping and I didn't throw too much of a fight because I knew I would not be coming back anytime soon. Once I got home and tried the pizza it did nothing more then seal the deal. It wasn't the worse pizza but it was mediocre at best.\n\nI don't feel great about writing this review, I really want to love and support independent businesses in Phoenix but when they have crazy policies like this and I have to spend $27+ to get a large mediocre pizza I need to draw the line somewhere. Phoenix has very few vegan pizza options but right now it seems like the corporate giants win again - I can get a large surfboard vegan pizza at Whole Foods, with any 3 toppings on any half, which tastes great for $15.99; no hassles.\n\nLastly I would like to comment that the girl working the cashier was very friendly and very courteous even though I was displaying clear signs of being utterly appalled. Even when I left she was still very friendly, it's safe to say she saved this from being a one star review, kudos to you.", "business_id": "auorqdHiATGZHVd-sd79ZQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-11-08", "type": "review"}

It's a small establishment with a compact parking lot, and both were jam-packed. Luckily, someone was leaving as I was pulling into the lot, so I was able to grab a spot. (I don't know if they have an overflow lot, but they should.) \n\nOnce inside, I quickly observed the \"Please Wait to be Seated\" sign.  We were asked how many were in our party, after which the hostess/waitress (they seem to be one in the same) scurried off to assess the availability.  As said earlier, it was packed, and there were others also waiting.  I was thinking we'd have to wait forever and that my starving spirit animal would come bursting out of my abdomen, like in those beef jerky commercials. But we ended up waiting no more than about 5 minutes before we were shown to a booth. (I love booths!)\n\nDESIGNATED VEGAN MENU:\nThere's a vegan menu inserted inside of their regular menu.  The waitress said that patrons keep taking them out, so if you want the vegan menu and don't see it, just ask for one. \nThe vegan options include appetizers, hot stuffed sandwiches, pasta, calzone, pizzas, and desserts.  It wasn't listed on the menu, but they also have a vegan cheesecake, which you can get topped with chocolate syrup or mixed berry sauce. \n\n\nMy order:\nVeggieballs in buffalo hot sauce -  They are described as vegan meatballs, so I'm thinking faux-beef \"meat\" balls. I was pleasantly surprised when I cut into one and found actual vegetables: peas, string beans, carrots, & corn. They were positively delicious. A slightly crispy coating covered in a proper buffalo sauce, which had a legit heat level. Excellent dish for only $5.95. Comes w/ vegan ranch and carrot sticks. \n\nVegan Spaghetti with soy sausage, $8.50 - (Beautiful presentation.) The pasta noodles were cooked perfectly al dente. The sauce and the soy sausage were bland, however.  Aside from flavor, I don't know what to say that it was lacking. A dash of this? A splash of that? Not sure, but it was a pretty big boring bowl of blah. I kept furiously twirling my fork in the saucy mix, thinking that maybe the flavor was at the bottom somewhere, clicking its heels thrice and trying to get back home, but no luck. If you avoid salt/seasoning (and flavor), as well as meat, then this is your dish. I liked the vegan garlic bread though. \n\n\nDessert-\nVegan cheesecake w/ mixed berry sauce, $6.50 - I never ate cheese before going vegan, but I used to eat cheesecake (weird, I know), so I do have something with which to compare vegan versions. I have had some better-than-real-cheesecake vegan cheesecakes, but this isn't one of them. I did not like it. The cheesecake had a weird, grainy, earthy taste to it. And it was like, almost smooth & creamy, (*singing* Ooooh, we're 1/2 way theeeere...) but it didn't quite make it there.  Silver lining? The crust and mixed berry sauce were both good.\n\nAngel bites, $4.95 - (If you've ever been to France or New Orleans, think beignets, except here, they are vegan.) They cover theirs with cinnamon and powdered sugar, and they offer you one of 3 dipping sauces: agave, chocolate, or caramel. (The caramel is NOT vegan, fyi.) I chose the chocolate. O-M-G. These suitably named bites of awesomeness brought me life. They came out hot, fresh & ready to be devoured. This is one of those treats that you want to eat right away because you know they won't taste the same later. But they give you so many! (Which is a great thing!) You can easily share this dessert with 2 or more people.\n\n\nNon vegan:\nMy non-veggie DD got the Mozzarella Sticks as an appetizer, and the Cajun Chicken Alfredo pasta w/ shrimp added. She liked the pasta, but said it was definitely spicy.  \n\n\n\nNice ambience, especially for dates. I don't know if they take reservations, but I suggest asking, especially for busy weekend nights.  As busy as they were, the staff was still nice and attentive. The owner was making rounds and asking patrons how their meals were. Cool little bistro. Great for vegans dining with omnivores.  I'll go back for more buffalo Veggieballs and Angel Bites.", "business_id": "auorqdHiATGZHVd-sd79ZQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-09-28", "type": "review"}

However, since it was my first time, I didn't mind paying an extra $1 to get 2 separate orders so I can try the different flavors. I also got fried zucchini as an appetizer and it was deliciously fresh. Be careful to not burn your tongue because everything will be hot and freshly made. I will definitely come back to try the pizzas when I am in the area.", "business_id": "auorqdHiATGZHVd-sd79ZQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-11-02", "type": "review"}

Definitely a run down, hole in the wall type of place with a musty smell and a decor I'm sure hasn't ever changed in the decades this place has existed.  \n\nFive of us came in on Saturday night on a whim to \"try something different\" from our usual haunts.  Boy was this place different!  We sat in the bar area where several tvs were showing the cards preseason game, and one muted tv was on the sound of music...\n\nThere were 3 or 4 other parties in the bar area, average age was approx 68.  Fortunately none of them really had any problem with our obnoxious drunkenness.  Not sure how many people were in the dining room portion of the restaurant, but suffice it to say the place was far from empty, which is always a good sign.  But there was only 1 bartender/waitress working in the bar area, and though we were more than patient and amiable, she was still very flustered with her duties.  Eh, we were drunk and didn't care.\n\nOn to the food.  We ordered the eggplant rollatini and mozz sticks to start, a pizza, manicotti, chicken parm, and fettuccine alfredo.  Everything was pretty good, huge portioned, relatively cheap, traditional italian(-american) food.  It really hit the spot!  The marinara sauce was incredible, and the manicotti was bursting with ricotta.  The pizza was good, the chicken parm standard (the spaghetti was cooked perfectly al dente), and the fettuccine was probably the loser of the group (my meal, of course) - it was good, but not as creamy as I had hoped.\n\nAll in all, this was exactly the type of experience we expected and went looking for.

The Alfredo sauce was rich, thick, and full of flavor. The possibility of adding vegetables [I am a vegetarian] made the choices plentiful. One can choose from shrimp, vegetable, and chicken as toppings. \n\nThe flat screens allowed me to enjoy the baseball game while enjoying $2 beer. The \"bar\" area allows for friendly, quiet conversation or just a getaway from \"trendy\" and \"crowded\" bars. The friendliness and prompt service provided a world class style of service.

Sundays were spent at Uncle Pete's for an all day meal with all of the extended family.  Everything fresh, homemade, completely filling and delicious.  It's hard to describe the feelings associated with these memories, but walking into Niccoli's was like living them all over again.  And that's a great thing!\n\nThe lasagna I ordered was just made that afternoon.  It came with fabulous garlic pesto toast and sliced tomatoes with the homemade Italian dressing.  No way I could finish it all, huge huge portion.  I'll have a nice breakfast tomorrow morning!  Regardless of being full I did indulge in my cannoli.  The filling was just like Zia Pietra's minus the chocolate chips and citron.  So delicious that I could not bear to leave a trace of it on the paper it came wrapped in.  Know what I did?

This is for 2 reasons. 1. Coda likes Domino's. 2. I like, nay, LOVE mushrooms on pizza (among other delicious vegetable toppings) while Coda prefers his pizza be served with toppings that, at one point, had a face. I'm not a vegetarian by any means (see my review of Blue Nile for proof), I just strongly prefer veggies on my pizza. I feel the tastes compliment each other better, and it's also much prettier. Neither of us is a big fan of compromise, so splitting a pizza is usually a challenge. \n\nNYPD took the pain out of pizza for us. We ordered a 14\" 5-topping and our AMAZING server let us know that, if we so desired, we could do 5 toppings on one half and 5 DIFFERENT toppings on the other, at no additional charge. I wanted to kiss her feet. I don't think she realized how far we would take it though, as our respective halves did not share one topping. That's right, we don't mess around. At this point in the meal, my Yelp rating of NYPD was 5 stars. Of course, I still had to eat the pizza.   \n\nIt is utterly confusing to me how so many places can claim to serve \"New York\" pizza and fail miserably, while almost every pizza place actually located in New York manages to pull it off. It's as if something magical happens when pizza is prepared in a new york zip code, and it's nearly impossible to recreate. But people keep trying. NYPD did not successfully recreate New York pizza. However, for Arizona pizza NYPD is definitely up there. And no, I've never waited 4 hours for pizza.\n\nFour stars for the food and cute, albeit somewhat gimmicky, ambiance. Five stars for the service. Our server was incredible, and they even gave us a gift bag when we left! It had coupons and a magnet!

Meatballs were dry as shit and sliced. Even Barro's has better meatballs!

I am from the northeast, and very particular about my pizza, and am willing to pay the extra for it. I first experienced NYPD at another location, and fell completely in love. Continued to enjoy on a time to time basis as there wasn't a location close to where I lived. Moved very close to this location, and literally ordered take out the very first night. Very happy, excited about our new home being so close. We made NYPD a weekly thing for us, still for the most part as take out, but the food quality seemed to be slipping. Something different was off with each experience. It eventualy got to a point where we questioned why we spent the extra money on quality that was getting to be less than ideal. We reserved ourselves to finding another pizza joint in the neighborhood. Tried a few other places, eventually settled on one we liked, while not as good as NYPD once was, a lot cheaper, and better than it has been. I am not going to drop another buisness name into this review, as that isn't the point, NYPD's drop in quality is the issue.

To me, that is not proper baked ziti.  The pasta wasnt sauced enough either.  \n\nMy aunt had eggplant.  cant comment on that since I despise eggplant.  She loved it though.  My uncle had a pasta dish that had brocolli rabe and gemelli pasta.  They subbed out chicken for the sausage so my uncle was happy.  The bread was so/so.  The salad was basic.  The dressing wasnt emulsified ( pool of oil on the bottom of the plate). My homemade flourless choc. cake was the best thing about the meal.

But like every place, there are pros and cons:\n\nCons:  The prices on the online menu are NOT the prices in the store.  I only had pasta, so I can't speak for the entrees, but a dish of pasta was closer to $20 a plate than $12.  The crowd was older.  We were the youngest people by at least 20 years.  However, if you ask me, it's a sign of how GOOD the food was (older people tend to have more $$ to spend on their meals, and thus choose better ones!!!)  Finally, it's a little far out of the way, but that's only because I live in downtown Phoenix; this may not be an issue for you!\n\nThat's all I got for cons!  :)\n\nPros:  The food was AMAZING!!!!  The portions are definitely large, and in all, are totally worth what they cost.  We tried the potato gnocchi with red sauce, the chicken fettucini alfredo, and the tortellini with prosciutto and peas and cream sauce.  I would HIGHLY recommend the tortellini, it's CRAZY how amazing it was!!!  The staff was nice, there was even some live music!  The setting is very romantic, but not too over the top (we went as a girls night, and even then it was still fun!) \n\nOverall, it's totally worth the drive, and worth the prices if you are up for sharing (or it's a special occasion!)

I grew up in an Italian household, so Italian food is as personal as it gets for me. And this place does Italian well enough to please my grandmother. My husband and I went for a romantic dinner, and we were not disappointed at the amibance of the place. The owner himself was seating everyone and while it was an air of elegance, we also felt really welcomed. Our waiter Julio brought us our menus and ice water right away, which was great because it was super hot out, even for Arizona. We selected a Chardonnay from Fess Parker vineyards, and because we had a gift certificate from restaurants.com, we opted to split a bottle of it. It was the first of many great decisions. For our appetizer we split the antipasto for 2. Incredible. Fresh veggies that were perfectly roasted, cold, salty meats, sweet rich cheeses, awesome! Their fresh sourdough bread was a pleasure to eat, with that just right crispy crust and light, fluffy middle. We both had the ceasar salad, which really prepped us well for our meal, as it was well sized and not overly dressed.  I ended up with the seafood risotto and my husband had the baked ziti with sausage. We were stunned. First of all, they came out HOT! Not the luke warm-ness that's becoming too common now, but truly hot! My husband loved his ziti. He went so far as to say it's better the first baked ziti he ever had, which was on New York's Mulberry Street with his parents when he was a teen. My risotto had so many layers of deep intense flavor I was beside myself. Not overly full of seafood, but enough to satisfy the craving, the clams, mussles, scallops and shrimp were to perfection. There was small peices of shredded lobster throughout. The peas, red peppers and asparagus were done well, but not mushy and the rice was just al dente. The saffron lobster bisque broth was intense in flavor but let each aspect of the dish shine through! As much as we were enjoying dinner, we decided to take half of each portion (very large portions, so bring friends or a large appetite or be prepared to take some home) home with us so we could have dessert. I'm so glad we did. We had the vanilla creme brulee. You could actually see the vanilla beans in the custard. And it wasn't overly sweet. Too many are cloyingly so, but not this one! And it had a rather thick ring of the burnt sugar, which I liked, cause to me that's the best thing about creme brulee. The owner, as mentioned by others, was all over the place, but always making time to sit and chat with his patrons to make sure they were happy. Julio was fabulously attentive, not being in our faces, but our glasses were never empty and the pace was perfect. We agreed this is a place we'll be going to at least once a month, if not more!", "business_id": "PAtgWCLCFRQd_fjnihISOg", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-09-05", "type": "review"}

One of my coworkers has recommended this place often and wow, she was so right!!  We sat at the bar and had the happy hour small plate calamari (which was the perfect size to share to start) which had the PERFECT texture; it was chewy but not too hard with just the right amount of crisp.  And the red pepper sauce it was served on was divine!  \nFor dinner the man got the Linguini with Fresh Clams and I got the Chicken Parmigiana upon the recommendation of the bartender.   Both came with a choice of soup or salad.  I got the house salad, which was a simple mix of iceberg and field greens with shaved carrots and a roma tomato slice with italian dressing on top (that had just the right amount of acidity) but upon tasting his soup (it was lentil tonight) I was a bit jealous.  The soup appeared to be a broth base with chopped vegetables and lentils, not a thick too-much-lentil type of soup.  It had great flavor without being overpowering.\nNow for the entrees.  Wow.  When they came out, my eyes popped.  When I smelled, my nose sang.  When I tasted, my mouth weeped.  We had asked the bartender if the clams were just in the sauce or if they were in the shell.  When he said \"both,\" we expected two or three whole clams with a smattering of clam in the sauce.  Boy, were we wrong!  There were 10-12 WHOLE CLAMS atop a garlic and white wine sauce FILLED with chopped manila clams.  \nThe Chicken Parmigiana would have made Sophia Petrillo of Golden Girls relocate to Phoenix!  The sauce was THE FRESHEST, most flavorful, not too wet tomato sauce I've ever had.  In. My. Life.  And I've had my share of tomato sauce, let me tell you!!  The chicken was moist and I'm not sure how the breading didn't get soggy by the last bite, but it didn't!!  The mozzarella cheese on top was melted to perfection.  The plates were served piping hot and we didn't let that slow us down!  \nThe beers were ice cold to the last drop as well, which is a necessity in my book.  The only critique the man had was that they could have a better selection of beers (he likes heavy craft beers).  \nWe will d.e.f.i.n.i.t.e.l.y. be back.  It is a bit pricy, but it's worth every cent!  And happy hour is a great value.  Draft beers are $3, glasses of wine and well cocktails are $5 and they have a selection of \"small plates,\" which are smaller portions of their appetizers, but with the entrees being so incredible AND coming with soup or salad (and don't forget the bread with some balsamic vinegar and olive oil!), you definitely won't leave hungry!

The \"Involtini of Eggplant\" with mozzarella and fontina with tomato basil sauce was excellent.  While my love and I waited for the shared main course of eggplant lasagna, I happened to chat up the courteous and attentive waiter who mentioned the specialty of the house - pasta made in house.  So we visited the pasta chef who proudly showed off the spinach-ricotta ravioli, pappardelle, fettucini and gnocchi.  Since my partner was nursing a leg injury, the pasta chef brought the tray over to our table and suggested we try the gnocchi with alfredo sauce.  The gnocchi were the melt-in-your-mouth kind and the sauce was a tomato enhanced alfredo - very flavorful.   Full from the appetizer, salad and gnocchi, we decided to take the eggplant lasagna home so that we could taste the home made \"tiramisu\".  Again, the tiramisu was incredible - the liquer flowing as your fork went through the dessert which was flavorful, not too sweet and coated the mouth.  We had the left over gnocchi and eggplant lasagna the next day - what a treat as a leftover.  Overall the service was great, food was excellent.  The ambiance is as explained by other reviewers, customers were dressed from casual to formal.  Decide to go here because as out of towners we not only could find the world famous pizzeria, but it had a 3 hour wait for dinner.   Talked with one of the owners of Avanti on the phone, who sounded welcoming and accommodating too.  We also cashed in on a rarely extended favor which helped make our decision instantly.  All the facts from the other reviewers are accurate - the 70s interior, the clientele, the owners etc.  Pending more visits, Avanti may get the 5 star rating after all.", "business_id": "vvA3fbps4F9nGlAEYKk_sA", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-11-15", "type": "review"}

It was supposedly 5 courses (I was thinking tasting menu like, not expecting huge portions), but they served it as 3 courses (salad, main, dessert) and the pasta was obviously premade and just glopped on the plate, one big spoonfool to each corner.\n\nThe only pasta that rose to the \"good\" level was the gnocchi.  One tasted like vegetable stroganoff and was just nasty.\n\nCeasar salad had way too much dressing and tasted pre-made (kind of limp and drowning), the pasta as a whole frankly tasted like crap, and the dessert could have fit on a tablespoon.\n\nFurthermore, our server seemed rude since we weren't dropping $150 on dinner.  We made no complaints as it seemed like one of those heavy handed places where the blame would clearly be placed on the patron, so we didn't bother.  Just smiled weakly and paid the bill.\n\nIt was a big two star step down from our first experience, where I was probably generous as it was with 4 stars.  \n\nFrankly, I'll take my business elsewhere with the many amazing Italian restaurants around the valley.  Leave this restaurant to the Assisted Living crowd that spare no expense for frankly mediocre food.\n\nHowever, IF you have to go here (coupon, invited by another, etc.), stick to the following:\n\nOrder the parmesan encrusted fish (you can't go really wrong with that), and if you want a pasta course, stick to the gnocchi.  And pass on dessert and salad course unless you like a ton of dressing.", "business_id": "vvA3fbps4F9nGlAEYKk_sA", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-10-18", "type": "review"}

Maybe it was because I was there for a company dinner with about 20 people (although the restaurant was empty). Maybe it was because I spent the last three weeks on a whirlwind tour of New York, Philadelphia, and Asheville, NC.\n\nIn any case, aside from the service, which was very good, I was deeply unimpressed with the food here. We started off with a plate of gnocchi in an Alfredo sauce and an appetizer of calamari. The gnocchi was completely drenched in Alfredo sauce, which is reminiscent of restaurants that try to hide the quality of their food with excessive sauce, e.g., The Olive Garden. The calamari was a bit rubbery, but otherwise average for a 2-3 star restaurant.\n\nOnto the main course, I opted for the Ossobucco Milanese ($33). Again, this dish was completely covered in sauce. Aside from the bone, I wouldn't have been able to tell what I was eating. The risotto was overcooked, and there was a hint of a taste of dishwater so it was probably diluted to keep it from burning on the stove.\n\nAgain, the service was very good. And their bread was probably the best part of the meal. Maybe this place did serve good Italian food at one time, but the oversaucing of the food just killed it for me. For $33, I would like to taste the quality and flavor of the meat. If I wanted to eat gravy, I'd go to Grandy's. And don't get me started on the decor. Wow. Just wow. Think mirrors.\n\nMy suggestion would be to skip this place and head over to BLT Steak for their escargot appetizer ($7) during happy hour and then to Beckett's Table for the Pork Osso Bucco Confit ($18). And if you want a cleaner taste, try 5th & Wine.

I have also sat at the bar with friends and had some good conversations with John, who has been there for the long haul. The service is great, but a little different from what people are used to (servers dropping off the check at their convenience, etc.). Avanti's servers want you to have an elegant dining experience, and they are mindful of your experience. They will not clear your plates until they are absolutely sure you are finished or give them a signal (napkin on plate or even a nod). If you have wine to finish, they will stand back and let you enjoy it and the company you're with, even if they have locked the doors and want to go home. My party and I have been the last to leave on a couple of occasions, and they are greatful for your patronage and do not act at all put out for being there a little later.

I had seen them on Eat24, but since picking up an order from them involves a 9 mile roundtrip, I hadn't gotten around to trying them until tonight.\n\nMy overall impression:  just OK.  I've had better, and I've had worse.  I ordered a medium pepperoni pizza, and the crust had a dense, pillowy texture that I didn't much care for.  The sauce, cheese and pepperoni on top of the crust were actually pretty tasty, though.  Inexplicably, there was a small section on my pizza that was completely devoid of cheese and pepperoni.\n\nOrdering with Eat24 was easy, although I should point out that there isn't an option for extra cheese on the menu.  I left my house within five minutes of ordering, and when I arrived at the restaurant my pizza had about two minutes to go, so the speed of service was fine.  The quality of service, however, was a bit lacking -- much of which I attribute to the fact that the counter guy was young and probably didn't have a lot of experience.\n\nAs for the value...honestly, it wasn't great.  Without the $2 online coupon I used, the medium 12 inch one-topping pizza I ordered would have cost $13.53, which is higher than what the pizza joints in my neighborhood charge for a comparable or higher quality product.  (Overpriced, average pizza could be one of the reasons I was the only customer inside the place at 7PM on a Saturday night...)\n\nWould I return?  Probably not.  Frank's is just too far of a drive for me when better and cheaper pizza is available closer to home.  But, as always, individual results may vary.

Having lived in NYC for a while, I became a bit spoiled and was pleasantly surprised to find Postino comparable to places I loved out there! \n\nNighttime is the best time to go as it's dim, loud and full of energy. Postino is one of my favorite places to go for a light dinner and drinks with good friends year-round; however, on a fall or spring night, when they have all the doors and windows open onto the patio, it's perfection.\n\nAs many have mentioned, the bruschetta is great. It's a good option for an appetizer or sharing for a main dish, especially if you'd rather focus on filling up with wine than food. ;) The grilled cheese appetizer is tasty, but a pretty small portion. If you're looking for a small compliment to wine, they've got a \"cheese course\" and a meat and cheese \"plate\". The cheese course comes with 3 different cheeses that they switch up frequently. It's a pretty decently sized dish, but the last time I ordered it, the \"fruit\" they mentioned on the menu was basically just dried apricots, cranberries and nuts. It wasn't bad, but with the crunchy bread it came with, there were too many dry things on one plate for my liking! If you like olives, I'd recommend splurging on the $5 olive bowl. It's a generous portion of mixed olives that will not disappoint. \n\nMy all-time favorite item at Postino is the \"Prosciutto with Brie\" Panini, on Ciabatta bread, with salad. The sandwich is soft prosciutto layered with brie, arugula and figs, drizzled with a little balsamic and olive oil and served on a super crunchy ciabatta roll. If this was the only item on the menu, I'd still make the 15 mile drive to order it. The sandwich is big enough to share, but I love it enough to eat the whole thing and suffer the consequences later. :) All of the paninis come with potato chips or salad. Rarely would I choose salad as a side, but I actually look forward to this salad almost as much as the sandwich. It's romaine lettuce, pine nuts, crumbled feta and a very light oil dressing (from what I can gather). \n\nThe two negatives, which is what drops it from 5 stars to 4 are the following: The service is often lacking. There are some really nice, attentive servers and there are some rather pretentious servers (which isn't unheard of at a wine-bar). It's really hit or miss, but I take it with a grain of salt and don't let it deter me from going. After all, a pretentious server can become great material for dinner-time laughs. \n\nThe second negative is the parking situation. This is an issue with any of the many LA Grande Orange establishments located on that corner. Pretty much any time you go there, you will have trouble finding parking. They do offer valet, but call me cheap, I'd rather not HAVE to pay for valet. \n\nTo make a long story short (I know, too late), go to Postino if you're looking for an experience you're unlikely to find anywhere else in Phoenix.", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-09-02", "type": "review"}

Occasionally the service has a lag time - only occasionally.", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-10-28", "type": "review"}

The wine selection is awesome and the food is super yummy.  I recommend you order the brushetta sampler, there are so many options and I have tried and love them all.  On Monday's they have half price bottled wine night, excellent for happy hour.\n\nMy only complaint is the parking situation, I hate that my only option is valet.  Why can't I just park my own car?  It does get packed in here so come early, it is busy because it is awesome.\n\nOne other thing I have noticed and really appreciated is that everyone who works there is guest oriented.  I had a manager opening my wine for me, the hostess told us about the specials, the waiter helped us move from the lounge to the restaurant, it was great.  There was no, \"Oh, that's not my job, so and so will be right with you,\" they take initiative and focus on the guest, something that is lacking in too many places today.\n\nLove it, can't wait to go back.", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-11-15", "type": "review"}

Sadly, I had to answer no.  There's nothing quite like this in Ann Arbor, which is too bad. There are some great places here, and even a couple of nice places to sip wine, but the feel of Postino is totally different.\n\nThe warm weather enables the front of the cafe to be pretty much totally open (nice garage doors), and though that's not something that would work too well in Michigan in the winter, I have a feeling the the wine selection and food quality offered by Postino would go over famously here in Ann Arbor and elsewhere.  I'm not into big chains, but maybe they'd consider a satellite location?\n\nThe bruschetta is a dream -- perfect to share with a group. I especially enjoyed the roasted pepper with goat cheese; brie, apple and fig spread; and the wonderfully salty roasted artichoke heart versions.\n\nAnd of course, I enjoyed the wine.  In warm weather, I'm a white wine kind of gal, so I sipped a nice glass of Pinot Grigio. I was totally charmed by both the food and the company. Oh, and extra charm points for playing some Otis Redding. The service was just fine -- attentive without being intrusive. If they can't open a Michigan location, then I guess I'll just have to come back the next time I'm around Phoenix.", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-11-23", "type": "review"}

Had the olives and pub board as appetizers along with a very nice Spanish red wine that was suggested by the server. The Pub Board was fantastic with Portuguese chorizo, cheese, and a very yummy homemade pretzel. The olives were a really great sampling of many different types and they all complimented our wine well too. \n\nHubby had the Autostrada with the potato cheese soup, I had the 9 Iron with soup, friends split the Proscuitto with Brie with chips. All were positively perfect!\n\nFor dessert, we ordered a bottle of a white Spanish wine Fuente Milano and it had a nice grapefruity after taste that was very cleansing on the palate before we had the Chocolate Bouchon, the Creme Brulee, and the salted carmel sundae. OMG...all were so yummy and the wine went perfectly!\n\nThe nicest part about Postino is that it isn't on a main Scottsdale Rd. drag....it's actually nestled on a side street off of 39th St. and Campbell. You'd never know it was there if you weren't looking for it but apparently plenty of people know about it because it was hopping at noon yesterday.\n\nIf you haven't tried it....go. You won't regret it. It was hip, fun, and the food was realistically priced and absolutely DELICIOUS!", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-09-06", "type": "review"}
