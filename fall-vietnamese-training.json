Its a monday and my favorite Pho place (Tram's...in pittsburgh anyway) is closed.\n\nI decided to give this place a go...and take out their pho...\n\nThe broth is actually good, very light yet flavorful.  But the noodles are a disgrace.  They are lumpy, smooshy and not at all chewy...they just kind of dissolve once you put it in your mouth, and they take up none of the broth's flavor.  I also ordered some fresh shrimp spring rolls that were halfway falling apart when I got them, and barely any shrimp.\n\nAll in all, I'll come back if im desperate for Pho on a Monday, but otherwise...nay", "business_id": "uBW3PIKqc-_eyG1_vdJn1w", "stars": 2, "date": "2008-11-10", "type": "review"}

We tried the pho, spring rolls, and lemongrass chicken; all were well worth ordering again.  This was, however, my first Vietnamese meal, so my thoughts are necessarily less discerning.  \n\nThe owner is indeed a character, and he more or less ordered for one of us.  Luckily, we're pretty easy going, and generally happy to take a proprietor's advice on what's good.  He struck me as amusing and endearing rather than abrasive.\n\nThe place was packed, though we went at 7 on a Friday.  Given this and the fact that they take no reservations, it'd probably be a hassle to go there with parties larger than 4.", "business_id": "dxCqGkhtXq-9fYEsX7Mf6Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-09-16", "type": "review"}

No. But does it hit the spot? HELL YES! \n\nThis was our go-to for hangover pho in college. Coming back the Pittsburgh after trying countless Vietnamese resturants, I was afraid to try the food again. I thought that the great taste I remembered was more of a memory and lack of food savvy-ness than anything else.\n\nHowever, Tram's did not disappoint. The rough-around-the-edges owner is still there, pumping out customers.\n\nThe pho lacked a little depth, but satisfied the craving. The portion was bit small for the price (Vietnamese is dirt cheap, even in NYC), but fine. The lemongrass tofu was a little on the salty side, but very tasty! The spring rolls, like everyone has mentioned, is packed with goodies inside.\n\nMy favorite dish of the night was probably the Split Rice dish. It comes with shredded and grilled pork and a lovely egg with runny yolk on top. The fish sauce that comes with it is sweet and delicious.\n\nHardly a wait on Saturday night? BYOB?

You also get a great meal for your dollar. What is keeping me from giving them a higher rating is that it's too safe.\n\nI love to come here for a quick, healthy, inexpensive lunch, but if I want the real stuff I'll go to the competing restaurant a little ways away. The ph\u00f4 at Tea Lite Caf\u00e9 is sorta gentrified, a product of the neighborhood that it's in. There's no tripe or tendon in the broth, and there's no option to add it in if you desire a dish a little more adventurous. There are plenty of options if you want to spice it up, but not if you want to add more general flavor to the soup that i expect to enjoy when i go to a Vietnamese restaurant. Maybe it's because their specialty is a quick lunch and therefore a more streamlined menu? I am however super grateful that's one of the few places in the Airpark vicinity where I can get a boba tea!\n\nNow, I am no way condemning this restaurant, and in fact I recommend that you go there for lunch and support them, and if you like, request some of the omitted goodies for your ph\u00f4 so that someday they'll change their menu up and I can grant them a couple more stars.", "business_id": "L_MtTn4IUBTmQtqqM2iFqA", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-10-28", "type": "review"}

This Vietnamese Pho restaurant was one of my regular haunts when I still lived here. And Saigon Pho has not changed one bit.... some of the \"old\" waitresses are still there, and not one new decoration to adorn the walls. This restaurant has not changed one bit!\n\nOn the menu today....\n\nBeef Chow Fun #39 (***** $6.50) As good a dish of Chow Fun you will find... even at a strictly Chinese restaurant. One of the added ingredients I request... even at Chinese restaurants... is the addition of Black Bean Sauce (or more of it). This will make this entree tast quite a bit better, IMO. Unfortunately, I forgot today.\n\nMinced Pork with String Beans #47 (**** 1/2 $5.95) Very fresh String Beans with some sweetness that Vietnamese like, and just a little bit spicy with some Ground Pork... which is a carry-over from Szechuan cooking! I asked the waitress what the vegetable was that was cooked with the Ground Pork... She replied that she couldn't tell me that... as it was a restaurant secret! She was just kidding with me, of course! She thought that the vegetable was preserved Radishes. I think she \"remembered\" me....\n\nChicken Rice Soup #51 (**** 1/2 $4.50) A Vietnamese variation of \"Jook\" - Chinese name for Rice Soup. Contained quite a few hand-separated pieces of meat from Chicken. Not as much Ginger as I would like, though. But very good, nevertheless...\n\nVietnamese Ice Coffee with Condensed Milk #54 (***** $2.50) No where in California... AND I mean NO WHERE... will you find a Vietnamese restaurant that would invest the time and energy to construct this Vietnamese Coffee for you... A Vietnamese Percolator filled with triple-strength French Roast over a cup with Sweetend Condensed Milk at the bottom of the cup. Once you try Vietnamese Iced Coffee you will not go back to that Italian Capuccino stuff. I guarantee it! The waitress told me that the restaurant will only offer to have the customer \"make\" his own coffee at the table if they're regulars or Vietnamese. That's nice to know!\n\nOther recommended entrees...\n\nCrab with Ginger and Onion (Market Price)\nClam with Black Bean Sauce (Market Price, not on Menu)\nOysters with Black Bean Sauce (Market Price, not on Menu)\nAny of the Pho's ($5.50 to $5.95)\n\n\"NEW\" dishes I want to try...\nLive Lobster (Market Price)\nLive Crab (Market Price)\n\nMy waitress, tonight, was one of the \"old-timers\"... She wouldn't like that phrase because she's only thirty-something. Back when I lived here, she was still attending ASU... now she's graduated and has a degree in Business, and a more advanced degree besides that!\n\nAt the end of the meal, I asked her if she remembered me... I used to kid around with her when she was attending ASU. She replied that she had a recollection about me... because I used to kid around with her a lot... But she wasn't sure. Now, that I asked that question was the verification that what she thought was correct... the old \"kidder\" was back in town. Even though it's just for a week!\n\nEspecially Recommended by an \"old\" customer... And some of the most affordable Pho in the Phoenix area... or any area of the country!\n\nFYI: to anyone that's interested... Boba or Tapioca Balls or Bubble Tea is actually a Taiwanese innovation that was introduced to the Western part of the United States over a decade ago in large metropolitan areas with a large Asian population. I remember my teen-age kids introducing this drink to me while living in Las Vegas. A few years after that, the proliferation of Boba was accentuated by Vietnamese restaurants offering these drinks, with the addition of their own unique ingredients.
