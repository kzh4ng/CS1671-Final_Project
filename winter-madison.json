The sides, service, and atmosphere leave a little to be desired, but if it's fantastic fish you're seeking, look no further than the VFW 8483.  Please note that they're a cash only place - no debit/credit cards - but they do have an ATM onsite.\n\n\nDetailed review:\nThe VFW 8483 is located on the north side of the Dane County Airport - hop onto Packers Avenue and follow it north until Packers turns into CV.  Continue about a mile or so, and you'll find the VFW - look for the big airplane on a pole out front.\n\nWe arrived at around 6:00pm and easily found a parking spot.  We made our way into the VFW where we were immediately greeted by a gentleman who took our order and money.  Fish options included cod, walleye, shrimp, and poorman's lobster.  All are served deep-fried, and include your choice of a potato (baked, fries, or wedge fries), coleslaw, bread, and coffee.\n\nWe went with the cod for $8.50 (it comes with 2-pieces; you can add additional pieces for $2/piece), and after the gentleman took our money, he gave us two small index cards that read \"Cod.\"  We were instructed to seat ourselves at the table of our choice, and that we could purchase drinks at the bar.\n\nWe grabbed a table and wandered over to the bar, where we purchased two drafts of Miller Lite for $3.50.  Served in an ice cold frosty mug, the 16oz drafts are definitely a bargain!  \n\nOur waitress arrived, picked-up the cards and asked what we'd like for sides.  We went with a baked potato and an order of regular fries.  She headed back to the kitchen and returned a few minutes later with our bread and coleslaw.  The bread consisted of yeast rolls, which were soft, slightly warm, and delicious.  The coleslaw was uneventful - no real seasoning to speak of; bland and boring at best.\n\nWe downed our beers and ordered a second round; just as I returned from the bar with the beers, our fish arrived and it looked unbelievable.  \n\nThe good news is that the fish tasted even better than it looked - the breading featured a hint of spicy seasoning, and was expertly applied and fried.  The breading didn't steal any thunder from the fish; it complimented it perfectly.  \n\nThe fish itself was amazing - thick cuts of cod - moist, flaky, nice and firm, and absolutely delicious.  Best of all, there wasn't a hint of grease anywhere on the plate.\n\nFries were a bit cold and lifeless; baked potato was, well, a baked potato.  Not much to add there.\n\nAfter our plates were dropped off, we never saw our waitress again, but that was ok, as diners are left to their own accord when it comes to getting drinks.\n\nVFW 8483 = WIN\n\nService = 1 star (virtually non-existent)\nFood = 4 stars (the fish was top notch; sides bland and forgettable)\nValue = 4 stars ($8.50 per person + $1.75 for 16oz taps)\nMISC = 1 star (ambiance leaves much to be desired)\n\nIf it's good fish you're seeking, this is one of the better places to check out.

Their online system is less than user friendly but he was great about scheduling for me. When I arrived for my massage Todd mistook me for someone else. When I let him know that I was a new patient he took me back to the lobby to fill out paperwork. While I was filling out the paperwork he proceeded to take his sweater off so that he was just wearing an undershirt. While this is not innapropriate, it did strike me as unprofessional. His social interactions with me continued to be strange. While he was never inappropriate, he was less than professional. When I told him that I had suffered from tight painful calves he said \"Yes!\" Again, not inappropriate but not professional. I have also never had a therapist that didnt tell me to undress to my comfort level. He just told me to undress and that he would be back  with a heat lamp. At this point, as a female about to undress for a large male, he didn't do anything to make sure that I felt comfortable. The entire interaction leading up to the massage was strange and uncomfortable.  \nThe massage itself was fine. At one point he made a slurping nose and then apologized for forgetting to swallow. The pressure was too much at times and when I told him that it hurt his response was, \"But it's so good for the tissue.\" I will not be going back and I wouldn't recommend him to a friend.

I didn't want to eat any of the other chain garbage that all the other tourists were eating near the hotel. Enter NOTO. What an awesome little find!\n\nAfter reading some of the reviews, I wanted to try a little bit of everything. The woman at the counter suggested we try the Mardi Gras Combo and the popular Shrimp Po' Boy sandwich. I wanted to try the dirty rice and was told that I could substitute the regular rice in the Combo for dirty rice. Yes, please!\n\nFirst, I'd like to clarify that the sandwich is NOT as big as other reviews may make it out to be. It's a standard French roll with a standard amount of fillings BUT the flavors are admittedly some of the best I've ever had. The juxtaposition of creamy, tangy sauce with the crunchy, juicy shrimp combined with the fresh lettuce will have you swooning for more.\n\nOn to the combo... What a cornucopia (nods to Candice G.) of beautifully tasty french creole goodness all nestled magically in compartmentalized order without any compartments in the take-out box. It traveled several miles successfully in the manner as well. The warnings of the menu and lady at the counter on the spiciness of the dirty rice and shrimp creole were accurate. It was a flavorful, creeping sort of spice that increased with each bite. Absolutely fantastic.\n\nThe name \"take-out\" is rather misleading because there is ample seating inside the place and many interesting jazz memorabilia to peruse over while eating so eat-in instead of taking-out as the name suggests.\n\nI'll definitely be making a stop here again whenever I'm in the Madison area for some good ol' N'Orleans style cookin'.", "business_id": "cpGv6ES2hzPCtCUQgipwXw", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-01-08", "type": "review"}

We also go a shrimp po'boy -- I was so excited that it tasted almost exactly at the one we get from our normal go-to place in the Quarter. \n\nWhile the quantity was less than we expected, the quality was superior to what we get at our little dive joints.

The online system also allows you to track your cab (once it has been assigned to you) and gives you an estimated time of arrival (fabulous!). \n\nSide note: I noticed that calling the number they have listed on their website is a huge pain in the ass and the hold time is always longer than their estimate. As such, I really appreciate the new ordering system because it allows me to bypass the wait time on the phone and to avoid speaking to operators who sometimes have trouble understanding what I am asking for. \n\nWhen the cab arrives at your address, a text is sent to your phone and you are able to communicate with the driver via text (in case of delay/change of plans, etc.).\n\nAlso, since you enter your credit card number into the online ordering system, once you get to your destination and are ready to 'pay' for the ride, all you have to do is sign a piece of paper and write in the amount of tip you want to leave, and everything is set. There is no need to pull out your wallet and risk leaving it in the cab or dropping it on the street!\n\nThumbs up, Union Cab! I'm in love with all this technology!! \n\nPS. If you get cab #59, you are in for a treat. The driver is a real sweetheart and a great conversationalist. Ask him for advice on which airlines to take and you'll get a lot of good tips and tricks. :)", "business_id": "5TQQy_x_ArR3_5L5L0fFVQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-02-21", "type": "review"}

The tuition is affordable and the degrees offered can catapult you into the working world, or prepare the foundation for you to move on to a UW system university for your bachelors and beyond. \n\nI got my liberal arts transfer degree from MATC. We are not all fed with a silver spoon as children, some of us are the first in our families to even think about college, and when the first it means there isn't much preparation or discussions at home about what college one wants to go to, what it takes to get there - or even how to get there. Many of the kids' experiences who go to MATC have a similar story.  There are also those who are returning adults who have been in the working world and want to change their path. Others yet find themselves there because they want to be a mechanic, a police officer, a fire fighter, a cook, or to prepare for a licensing exam in their field, to take an apprenticeship, heck to even get their motorcycle license (something I also did at MATC).\n\nMATC gave me my mentors, whom gave me the guidance I so needed, kicked me in my butt a few times, gave me honest and critical feedback, inspired me, took me under their wings, and gave me the courage and confidence to realize I was more than my upbringing.\n\nPretty powerful stuff to self-actualize right before other people's eyes,  to start receiving 4.0's throughout my time there and be pulled aside by the best teacher out there, Karen Redfield, and asked \"why the hell aren't you at UW-Madison?!\" \n\nIndeed, why the hell wasn't I? That is a long answer best told in person, but let's just say she changed my life. As did the entire human services staff who embraced me that year, my sociology teacher who gave me an A++ on my final paper and told me what a thesis is, and how I was beginning something that could take me down such a long and wonderful path of academia. \n\nThey saved me. \n\nYears later with my masters degree under my belt, working in an excellent job in a field I adore, having travelled the world, gotten married, made friends from all backgrounds and experiences - I look back and I recognize exactly how I became the successful person I am today. It deserves to be shouted from the rooftops, written on billboards, told to incoming students and those still unsure.\n\nMATC changed my life. Those teachers changed my life. I saw Ms. Redfield last summer while I was on campus and I hugged her so tightly she may have had a hard time breathing.

I have no idea what are motivation was for going there, but we did. We were seated up to the right of the hostess stand as soon as we walked in. Waited 10 minutes, and no service. A server walked by the table and we thought they'd just let us know that they were behind and would be right with us. Nope. I'm not sure how much more time passed maybe 5 or 10 more minutes, but it was significant enough for me to convince my boyfriend that we should leave. And so we did. We got up, walked out and nobody said a word or noticed.\n\nFast forward to today, where again we were in the area, looking for a late lunch, and decided we'd give them another shot. We were seated in the exact same area, and there were other patrons seated there as well. The restaurant itself I would say was busier than what I expected (I was thinking it would be completely dead) but by no means crazy busy or filled to the max with customers. We waited a little bit, browsed the menu, decided what we were getting and still nobody checked in with us. The hostess even sat a few people after us in the same section.\n\nSo, again we decided it wasn't worth it to stay and eat and got up and left only to find another restaurant in the area to eat at. \n\nIt seems from other reviews there are a lot of issues with this location.

Alas, the fish is unreal and the beer selection rivals many (if not most) of Madison's finest.\n\nDetailed Review:\nThe Fish Fry Fanatics stumbled into Dexter's Pub this past Friday and decided to give their fish fry a shot.  The menu selection is vast - we counted at least 6 or 7 solid fish fry options, from shrimp to Lake Perch to Walleye.  \n\nWe put our name in for a table, and were told it would be a 35-40 minute wait, so we ordered some of our customary Old Fashioneds.  We were pleasantly surprised to find that the bartenders muddle their Old Fashioneds, but were disappointed by the inclusion of a huge chunk of orange.  I'm sorry to say, but a Whiskey Old Fashioned Sour should *not* include half-of-an-orange as garnish.  \n\nRegardless, the Old Fashioned was solid - very good, actually.  So much so that when we ordered a second round and requested they drop the orange, it wasn't a problem.  Dexter's recovered nicely, and as luck would have it, our table became available soon after we grabbed round 2 of drinks. \n\nWe immediately ordered cheese curds, salad, and soup.  I went with the vegetable garden soup; others at the table went with chili and salad.  The soup and salads arrived within seconds; the soup was good - not great, but good - and it could've been a little warmer.  I'm told the chili was good as well - not life altering, but good.\n\nThe waiter came back to take our dinner order: two orders of beer battered cod, an order of lake perch, and an order of shrimp.  He said he'd be back in 10 minutes with our fish.  \n\nNearly an hour later, we flagged down a waitress for: refills on our drinks, and to inquire about our curds and fish.  She apologized profusely... curds came out a few minutes later - apparently they forgot about us.  The only benefit to being forgotten was that we had plenty of time to read the beer menu, which features a nice selection of craft beers from microbreweries - Dexter's doesn't strike me as a place that would feature such a wide selection of unique beers, but I guess it goes to prove that you can never judge a book by its cover.  \n\nCurds were excellent - not your typical \"from the bag\" curds, which was a nice surprise.  They were breaded and featured a mild white cheese; they were cooked perfectly.\n\nFish arrived within minutes, and it was well worth the wait.  The cod was phenomenal.

However, when we went back a month or so later, we had a horrible experience.  We had to wait nearly 45 minutes for our food and then when we got it- it was terrible.  My boyfriend had the garlic chili fries and they arrived not only COLD, but DOUSED in disgusting grease- they were inedible.  We mentioned it to the waitress and she offered to bring a new order, but it turned out the new order was just as terrible as the first one.  I had the roast beef sandwich and it was horrible- very dry and bland.  To her credit, the waitress did give us free cupcakes to take home to make up for the horrible food (although it turned out the cupcakes were also inedible and terrible).  \n\nWe hoped this was just an unusually busy night and not the norm, and because the fish fry is so good, we went back again tonight, hoping for a better experience.  We were wrong!  We went around 7 and waited 15 min or so for a table.  Once we were seated we placed our order right away with the waiter, since we already knew what we wanted.  An hour later, we were still waiting for our food.  All we ordered was the fish and waffle fries- so nothing complicated- and on such a busy night, you'd think they'd be making sure to keep batches of fish and fries going steadily into the fryer.  When we finally got our food, it was the tasty fish we'd remembered from before, but by that time, we were so tired and crabby from having to wait for so long, it wasn't quite so enjoyable.  After our meal, we had to wait quite a long time for the waiter to bring the check, and then he didn't come back to pick it up for a good 15 minutes.  We would still go back to Dexter's just for drinks, but I don't think we'll be going there to eat the food anymore.  Two terrible experiences with inexcusably long waits is enough to keep us from going back for dinner.  It's too bad because the fish is good, but not good enough to justify the SLOW service.\n\nEdit: Turns out the fish wasn't so good- ended up being up all night with food poisoning.

It will appeal to people who just want to go to a local pub and crack open a Hamm's. It will also appeal to people who want an unassuming space to quaff some delicious craft beer. It isn't fancy, but it is roomy. My one complaint is that it is always chilly. I usually keep my coat on or I freeze. \n\nFood - The food at Dexter's is pretty good. It is slightly amped up pub food. It is most certainly better than your standard pub fare. They have some yummy options for spicy, heart-clogging sandwiches that my husband loves. I like the Fajita salad and pulled pork sandwich. \n\nBeer -  Fantastic. This is real the reason to go to Dexters. They have rotating taps of featured beer. They are attentive to trends in craft brewing and will often have something that is new and difficult to find. Their bartenders are usually knowledgeable about the beer, and they know how to pour a hefeweizen correctly. It is not the best deal you will find in town, but they will also have pours other places don't get. \n\nService - Also pretty good. I have no complaints about the staff here.

The clam chowder is phenomenal and so are the rest of their soups...obviously lovingly tended to and cooked from homemade stocks.  I could further pontificate, but no need...the execution in the kitchen is stellar.  \n\nNow, the beer list is exquisite in my opinion.  I love Madison, but many bars get so caught up on local-centric taps lists.  Consequently, more often than not, you walk in to see the taps jammed with Ale Ayslum, Lake Louie and Capital.  Not bad...but I'll be damned to say I could choke down another Hopalicious.  Dexters, on the other hand, opens their taps up to pretty much anything.  From Toppling Goliath (which I love, but you can't really get outside of Iowa and Wisco) to Belgian Flander's Reds, they kill it with their beer selection.  Also, I really respect that they let you know on the beer list what's on deck...this has kept me coming back many-a-times.  \n\nSo why not the 5-stars?  Well, we've run into some seriously long waits, both for a table and then for the fish.  If they could streamline a little more in the kitchen, I'd gladly give it that extra star.

Far past the expiration date; 2. Poor quality; 3. Stale. Of the expired items I can recall, one was a package of tortillas, purchased in the last few days that expired 12/09/13! Almost a full month past expiration! A month ago, I bought hummus. It didn't look right when I opened it (mold), & of course, it had expired 2 weeks earlier. Fortunately, we didn't eat the hummus. Unfortunately, we discovered the tortillas had expired in the middle of dinner. \n\nThere've been a handful of instances where rolls/breads are stale, particularly from the bins by the registers. Rolls weren't just hard on the outside or a day past fresh-baked, we're talking inedible. It's incredibly disappointing too, when you're looking forward to good bread. \n\nThen there's the deli, where there's been a few issues. \n\nDeli issue #1: My wife bought sliced deli meat, a cut known for being fatty, but this one was overly so. It was slimy, chewy, tough, flavorless, & ultimately inedible. It was the first time I've returned meat. I'm a carnivore. I've had hackepeter, steak tartare, tripe, chitlins, sheep brain, sheep testicle... things most people won't eat. This particular deli meat however, was a few steps beyond. \n\nDeli issue #2: More an observation, which now prevents me from buying from the previously liked, pre-made deli salad section. One time at the deli counter, I saw a JSM worker \"clean\" the front of the pre-made salad case, from the inside, with a towel. Mind you, none of the salads were taken out of the case or covered for the cleaning process. So when this worker brought the towel back out of the case, I was aghast to see a dirty towel, with all sorts of crumbs, crumbles, food pieces & products, being carried haphazardly, over uncovered salads. I saw some bits fall from the towel, over the salads, as it was brought out of the case. \n\nDeli issue #3: A JSM worker cut slices of meat & cheese, kindly packaging them with care. However, he did so without gloves & without washing his hands. I was pretty much done with the JSM deli at this point. \n\nYou can have all the locally produced, environmentally friendly, organic, small batch, artisan &/or handmade, gluten-free, nonsense all you want. It does no good however, when it's stored in unclean, unsanitary conditions, &/or expired all together. If I were a \"freegan\" I'd say this place was a rip-off. Everyone knows you can get spoiled foods in dumpsters behind most grocery stores, for free. I'd also make exceptions for small \"mom & pop\" businesses, but I have standards & limits. JSM has surpassed both.

They also have ridiculously delicious chocolate shakes, so don't be afraid to splurge while you're there.  \n\nOne of the other great things about Monty's is the atmosphere; the area around it is filled with little mom and pop shops, the Barrymore theater, and relics of an older time.

First, there is usually a very long wait.  The place is popular, but I don't feel that the food and eastside location (I live far westside) always justifies the overall experience.  Secondly, the service is hit or miss.  I've had some waitresses who were prompt and polite, making me feel right at home, and others who were sarcastically rude to the point where people in my party almost had to say something.  Furthermore, the kitchen doesn't always look clean, as trays of biscuits have been left sitting out and flies have been a buzzing.\n\nSetting all those things aside though (which I know may be hard for some), the blue plate is a Madison delight that should not be missed.

I tried this place for the first time the other week when my grandparents were visiting me in Madison.  It was just wonderful!\n\nThe decor is adorable, the servers were friendly and prompt, and the food was fabulous.  I went with the Heathen Vegan Sandwich, which is piled high with mushrooms, tempeh, and avocado.  For my side, I chose the bean salad.  Both of these items were delicious.  The sandwich was HUGE.  I could not eat it like a regular sandwich, so I ate it in an open-faced sort of way with a fork.  A little messy, but totally worth it.  The mushrooms and tempeh were perfectly seasoned and tender and the avocado brought it all together with the toasted bread.\n\nI got a bit nervous because at the *very last second* my grandma changed her order to the exact same thing I got (she's not vegan) because she \"trusts me\".  I was pretty nervous, but she ended up loving it!  I was so pleased.  My one complaint might be that my bean salad had a bit too much dressing on it, but my grandma's did not share that problem and it wasn't difficult to just eat it with a fork instead of a spoon.\n\nMy grandpa ordered some sort of breakfast platter and was very pleased.  He basically always orders the same thing at diners - two poached eggs, bacon, potatoes, and toast, so if he is impressed I feel that it is a good sign. He said the eggs were cooked perfectly.\n\nThey seem extremely accommodating for allergies and preferences as well, which is always a huge plus.\n\nOverall, I was very happy with my first visit to Monty's.   Not only because I loved my vegan options, but because you made my grandparents very happy too and that rocks in my book.

Service is fast, food is good, prices are reasonable (but not cheap) and wait staff is friendly.  Feels neighborhood friendly, although they bring in people from all over the area.  Plenty of good vegetarian options also.\n\nFood is interesting, with lots of things not found in your typical diner.   Coffee is from Just Coffee (that is a bonus feature people - if you like coffee, this is a great place) and many of the specials are made with organic foods.  Want a burger but don't eat meat?  Swap out the Walnut burger - which, as a meat eater, I can say is good.  Certainly better than their hamburger.  Speaking of which...\n\nWhat is up with that hamburger?  First off, it comes medium well done - no burger should ever be cooked to that.  Second, it is heavily, and funky seasoned.  As in, if I ordered it, it would go back.  A good burger needs salt and pepper.  They add a bunch of stuff.  However my niece who ordered it liked it, so we kept it.\n\nDeserts are very popular at Monty's, but that was our disappointment.  Cheesecake was rubbery and the carrot cake was dry - stale dry.  Really?  I am almost tempted to go to three stars just for that.\n\nOverall, I have to stick with four stars.

I found the chunks of pork a bit tough, the dish heavy on the hominy and the dish itself lacking in flavor.  It felt one noted.  It wasn't bad; it just wasn't for me.  I was really hoping that this would be the dish I'd be excited to come back to Monty's for but I came away disappointed. \n\nI ate less than half of my dish but I decided that the rest wasn't worth a takeout box.  Unfortunately, this is how I often feel about Monty's food.", "business_id": "fjaQ3Ixkofh8xGhklUtDnA", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-12-23", "type": "review"}

Back in the day, I went often enough to know the staff by name and to have pretty much sampled the whole menu. The consistency is crazy. For having such a big and varied (vegan, vegetarian and uhh... carnivorous?) menu, everything I have ever tried has been really incredible.\n\nThey have options for everyone, sweet and savory breakfasts, filling dinners, boozy shakes and tons of delicious cakes and cupcakes. I usually just go for a sandwich, sometimes the Artichoke sandwich, or Farmer John's. My absolute favorite from back in my vegetarian days is the Meatless Meatloaf of the Gods. I would usually ask them to make it into a sandwich and they would do so, no problem. I've heard incredible things about their regular meatloaf, but I can't stop ordering the meatless version to ever get the real deal. They also have incredible sides. The Three Bean Salad is sooo addictive, the Mashed Potatoes with Cashew Gravy (!!!) is really comforting and their Waffle Fries... I could probably just order a plate of those fries and call it a day. Other must tries include the Brandy Alexander shake, biscuits with jam and honey and the zucchini/potato pancakes. \n\nThe diner itself is always impeccable, very bright and clean. Choose a seat at the bar to get a glimpse into the kitchen or sit at one of the comfortable 6-person booths. The servers here are amongst the best, just really friendly and funny. They all seem like people I'd spend time with IRL, charming and personable. \n\nI will keep returning to Monty's whenever I have an excuse to visit Madison.

Standbys be damned! So I ordered the Meatloaf Stacker sandwich (open face) with the gravy on the side (I'm not a big gravy fan) with their always fabulous waffle fries and an Oreo shake instead of Chocolate. Here's how it went down:\n\n~ Sandwich: The meatloaf was good - fairly moist with a nice full flavor profile (wise addition of sausage). The mashed potatoes were dry and needed seasoning so I pulled those off and skipped them altogether. The sprinkling of fried onions on top was brilliant both flavor & texture-wise.\n\n~ Waffle fries:  SO GOOD - ALWAYS!!!!!! Enough said.\n\n~ Oreo shake:  It was delicious with lots of real Oreos. And I love that they give you the extra shake in that metal blending cup - so old school, so classy. I only wish they made their shakes just a bot thicker so it didn't get liquidy so quickly. Side note: if I had it to do over again, I would have gotten the chocolate shake instead as it's not quite as sweet at the Oreo, but hindsight.......\n\nI want to end with acknowledging how much I appreciate the great customer service at Monty's.

Not a big deal but it essentially negated the discount / groupon we were using. \n\nSecond, almost everything was mislabeled! Cube steak was hamburger patties. Chicken breasts were chicken tenders. Beef hamburgers were bratwurst patties. Pork cutlets were sausage patties....etc. Again, not a huge deal but annoying when you plan ahead, thaw an item for meal and end up having to improvise in the end anyway (hamburger stir fry isn't bad, neither is a bratwurst cheeseburger).\n\nFinally, I am not sure it was an outstanding value. We ended up with about 70 hot dogs, assorted bratwurst and assorted bratwurst patties which are quite inexpensive. Of the remaining items, portions were quite small and anything expensive was bulked up by wrapping it in bacon. Also, the assorted kabobs we got were simply flavored by dusting them with powder flavorings.

Turned out we had 4, and that was still a stretch.\n- The wait! Holy cats. One of our party arrived at about 7:15pm, and put his name on the wait list. We weren't seated until after 9pm, and were then told that they had run out of cod, and had a half piece of walleye left, \"maybe\"\n- The smell. I'm going to smell like a deep fryer for 2 weeks after standing in that tiny, low-ceilinged place\n\n- Prices. For a dive bar, they're fairly proud of their stuff. Further, a drink board special showed Alaskan Amber on special for $3, yet it always rang up as $4.50?\n\n- Service. Atrocious. Abysmal. Two servers, running around like crazy, yet not really helping anyone in the process. \n\nWe were seated at 9:00pm, and didn't receive any food until 10:15pm. How is this possible? 3+ hours??? To make matters worse, as we sat waiting to share our order of cod and half-piece of walleye, we repeatedly asked for refills of waters/drinks and for an extra piece of bread or two to help tide us over... nothing. \n\n- The cod. Boo. When it finally arrived, the three pieces of heavily-battered European block cod were far too watery. According to my fisherman friend (he's a professional fisherman who fishes for Alaskan salmon, cod, and sable fish), the cod they serve here is a pressed-combination of cod loin and belly. It fell apart as we cut into the pieces, and was difficult to eat, other than to scoop it with a fork. At least it was served piping hot, and the batter had a decent seasoning. But the fish itself wasn't exciting at all.\n\n- The fries. Cold. Lifeless. \n\nI love dive bars, a lot. But Villa won't be on my list of places to return. I'm still stunned that it took 3+ hours to get any food, and that the service was so terrible.

I had absolutely no idea that it existed until a cabbie friend of mine told me it was one of his favorite places to stop between fares.\n\n(Can I just say that cabbies are amazing? They know where everything is, and they know about all the cool hidden spots that most of us pass up every day. If you know a cabbie, pick their brain sometime. You will probably discover at least one awesome place because of them.)\n\nSo, back to People's. The donuts are really top notch. Chewy, moist, iced just enough, and they have a ton of options. I really think that their plain glazed and their boston cream donuts are the best. Their glazed donuts have this bit of crispiness to them that is amazing. The fritters aren't as good as Greenbush, but still tasty. There are also some specialty desserts that I am unsure of, but will have to try some day. \n\nAs far as the food goes - the gyros are among the best I have had in town (right up there with Gyro House) but that is all I have tried there so far.\n\nSo, to sum it all up: good gyros, great donuts, fair prices, and great (but sort of slow) service.

Total hole in the wall on East Wash in a strip mall behind some Mexican buffet, with the name People's Bakery, you'd never guess this place would have the best Middle Eastern food in Madison.  \n\nStart with the wife of the wife and husband team, who greets you warmly as you come in.  The menu is on the wall, but there are hard copies for those who need an explanation of the nicely blended mix of Lebanese, Armenian and Syrian dishes.  No matter your experience with food of the Middle East or Mediterranean, you'll find dishes you recognize, perhaps by different names.\n\nThis was my first visit, I'm sitting here eating my takeout order as I type this because it's that good.  I ordered the lentil soup, and several appetizer portions including hummus, moohamara, sarma, and falafel.    \n\nQuick review:\n- lentil soup.  Awesome, just awesome.  Beautiful saffron color from the cooked down red lentils, just the right mix of cumin and lemon, and a back end of heat, I'm guessing from Aleppo pepper.  This is some thick soup, and filling, and for 2.50, you get a pint\n\n- Moohamara.  I wasn't going to get this.  I like roasted red bell pepper, and I've had dips and purees made of them, but I've never sought it out.  Mary, one of the owners, told me it was her favorite, best on the menu.  And holy COW was she right.  A smack of roasted red pepper is quickly deepened by a sweet hit of pomegranate and walnuts, ubelievably complex and wonderful.\n\n- Falafel.  Huge portion, perfectly deep-fried, with a really nice, light texture.  Love the falafel, but I prefer tahini sauce, and these come with a yogurt mint sauce.  Don't get me wrong, this is clearly their regional interpretation, Im all about the authentic experience, and this was good sauce.  But, I confess that for my leftovers I'm making some tahini sauce.\n\n- Hummus.  You know, hummus is always a crap shoot for me.  I make my own, from dried chick peas, and I've been working on this recipe for 25 years (along with my Bloody Mary recipe and about a hundred others). This is another of those regional interpretation issues, this was my least favorite today.  I'll try it again, because my own hummus has on and off days.  This was just more on the bland side than I expected,  No one distinct flavor dominated so I felt like it was left with an almost indescribable flavor.  Not bad, totally edible, just oddly unflavored.  I added some lemon and salt, which helped some.  \n\nSarma - if you're expecting dolmathes this will be familiar in flavor, but it texture.  These are served cold with a yogurt dipping sauce.  I'm okay with the temperature, but I just like a little lemon on mine.  These are veg, the rice filling is cooked down to a coarse 'risotto-y' consistency.  I dig them, but those who prefer the snap of dolmathes will find these softer, but just as flavorful\n\nAll in all, outstanding.  Next time, shish tahouk and baba ganouj.", "business_id": "Ryq600aoE3h8_qRQGIed9A", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-12-08", "type": "review"}

Well, my Shish Tauok was plump with heavily marinated, tender chicken slices, tomatoes, tahina, and lettuce.  In short, it was outstanding.  Aggressive herbal flavors perfectly matched with a spike of lemony acidity.  My wife LOVED her falafel sandwich...which is really saying something, as she's somewhat of connoisseur.  The hummus was really good, and the spike of sumac was a nice touch, although it was tad bit to lemony for me.  \n\nNonetheless, this is an AWESOME Madtown ethnic eats spot...and oh yeah...how can  completely dismiss the incredible homemade donut selection?

I would recommend if you get a dud representative that tell you they can't do X Y Z, to just hang up, call again until you get a representative who can actually comprehend the concept of \"diverting all excess payment to the highest interest rate loan while satisfying minimum requirements.\" That's all a loan specialist ever needs to know to make the rest of the changes. Instead, the bad reps CLAIM they can't act based on that, and that they need you to specify every specific change. This is patently false, as I talked to one rep who did do it based on the simple high-level instructions (except that he made a mistake, which is why i had to call again), and another representative after I talked to this incompetent, can't-think-for-yourself rep.\n\nThe escalation team was even worse, repeating the same information while you're actually trying to ask a different question. I guess the actual smart, competent people are there temporarily, which is why the better reps tend to be first-time receiving reps, rather than on the escalation team. Seriously, how do you hold an escalations team position at a loan servicing company and not comprehend the best way to pay off a loan? Madness.\n\nThe escalation team member after I talked to also claimed that they couldn't reallocate a payment when in fact, she herself was going over two counterexamples of exactly that happening. Then she claimed it was in my best interest to apply payments in certain ways, when mathematically it was false. Don't you love it when people claim a prescribed action is for your benefit when in fact it's for theirs? I saw right through it. Another BS claim she made is that she had to have me wait for another representative to call me after I said I was done dealing with her. She claimed that it was protocol. Such obvious BS. I could just hang up on her, and call again, and be put in a waitlist. It is not \"protocol\" to have me wait to get called back. She probably just wanted to fill out notes on my account, which I later confirmed she did as I was talking to the new rep, probably saying bad things about me for the core reason that she was no competent or smart enough to grasp the concept of \"satisfy minimum requirements and divert all excess payment to the highest interest rate loans first.\"\n\nI've had 2 absolutely fantastic, great, smart, god-bless-their-soul reps and 2 horrendously incompetent, lying, dishonest reps. Their customer service is really hit or miss, but 50% amazing reps is actually not a bad ratio. The company should just be better aware of highest quality reps and lower quality reps, and promote/demote accordingly. But given the fact that an escalations team rep was so terrible and couldn't even understand basic loan efficiency concepts, AND on top of that tried to BS me 3 separate times, and was so spiteful to continue writing notes even after i stopped conversing with her... it's not likely that good people will rise when higher level people are bad apples.", "business_id": "CjHMXSaXttTv4jZSQnmyEA", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-12-05", "type": "review"}

Olbrich Gardens is a fun place to visit for both locals and out of towners.  The gardens are lovely and admission is FREE. Be sure to walk all the way through the gardens so you get to see the Thai Pavilion which is a pretty impressive structure.\n\nA lovely thing to do in the winter (or summer, I suppose, but definitely winter) is to visit the indoor Bolz Conservatory.  Warm, humid and tropical, it's fun to check out all the different plants and read the educational signage (which does rotate so you can expect something new).  Admission is only $2 or if you go Wednesday or Saturday mornings (10-12) it's free.\n\nUgh, now let's get to the grand prize winner for \"event most in need of improvement\".  The Cocktails in the Conservatory event sounds great in theory - come explore the Conservatory at night, there will be a DJ, lights, and cocktails!  This event appears to be hosted every other month and admission is $6.  I met up with a group here last Friday and the only way I could describe it is a fiasco. Doors opened at 7pm. By 7:30 they were \"at capacity\" and people were still streaming into the building. At this point they set up a line in the lobby to get into the Conservatory but it was a one-in one-out system. \n\nGiven that the crowd had just gotten there at 7pm, nobody was leaving anytime soon.  To make matters worse, there did not appear to be anyone actually officially and methodically checking people out so plenty of people seemed to come out, visit the bar in the lobby, grab their coats, leave unnoticed, and nobody else was allowed in.  Mind you, they have a ton of space in the building (a whole banquet room for weddings) so really they should probably take advantage of all this space and have the DJ / lights / speakers / bar in there and let people wander in/out of the Conservatory.  OR sell tickets ahead of time so people know if they're \"in\" and otherwise the event can be \"sold out\" ahead of time.  We hung out in line (not realizing how this scene was actually working) until 8:30 and then gave up and left. \n\nYou just have to picture this scene -- when we left (after an hour of waiting) the same people remained at the front of the line and the line behind us snaked 100+ people and extended all through the ballroom.  Cars still cruised into the parking lot, people were dropped off in cabs trying to get in, staff stood outside telling people they weren't even letting people into the lobby at this point.  Oy vey!  \n\nSo let's just say this event has become \"overly successful\".  Unless you plan on arriving at 7pm on the nose or they recognize some way to correct this issue, I would not plan on returning to this event nor recommending any friend go there.  \n\nBOTTOM LINE:  Check out the Gardens or the Conservatory, by day.  Hold off on the \"Cocktails in the Conservatory\" event until the kinks are worked out.", "business_id": "Q3GGB4ZMajP-Qmtdr1cVZw", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-02-01", "type": "review"}

Apparently the fish was delicious as well. Finally - the curds. Oh man, the curds! They were seriously (tip) top-notch. Lightly breaded, crispy, and gooey with some nice tasting ranch on the side. These are the closest to perfection I have ever had. Hopefully it wasn't a fluke!\n\nBeyond the food and drink, it really was a nice space. The lighting was great, the decorations were were fun, and it just felt like a cozy place that I would love to hang out at on a Wednesday night to grab a burger and a beer.\n\nI feel like all I have done lately is write about how awesome the spots I go to are, but hopefully that says more about how great Madison is than it does about my (potentially) overly-optimistic ratings.", "business_id": "JJFoeKZXgi2_LeECDMkkoQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-02-07", "type": "review"}

The space is large, divided in two, one half the main bar area and the other a large space with family-style tables where groups gather and bands sometimes play at night.

At first I thought it was just sarcastic \"Soup Nazi\" humor, but soon realized that the prevalent hostile attitude there is genuine and that it trickles down from management to employees, customers, and even performers.  I've seen bar managers there either berate customers directly or berate the bartenders who then have to try very hard not to pass that negativity on to customers.\n\nAlso, it's downright embarrassing to be an audience member there when the bar mistreats the band.  I once saw a Harmony bar manager preempt an encore performance by turning on the overhead lights, jumping up on the stage, and literally grabbing the mike from a performer to announce that the show's over and that everybody has to finish their drinks and leave.  I was floored.  It was the first time I'd ever seen anyone kick a band off the stage just because they wanted to close their bar early.  \n\nThe kitchen staff works hard, and the food is decent.  Unfortunately, this is the only bar I've ever been to in Madison where I've been asked to pay for my dinner tab up front.  (There are lots of other bars that also don't take credit cards, but they still let you run a tab.) It made me wonder if they didn't trust me to close out my tab or if they were hoping my tip would be better prior to experiencing their poor service.\n\nIn short, even on occasions when they book national acts, it's not worth going there if you're going to encounter hostility when you want something from the bar.  There are too many other fun places to go in Madison for anyone to have to put up with the miserable buzz killing atmosphere that prevails at The \"Harmony\".", "business_id": "KHOHjA8HOcTlFBCtMQFv8A", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-12-01", "type": "review"}

We 'd been looking for a good BBQ place in Madison, and Smoky Jon's was the first place we tried.  Needless to say, we won't be trying any place else!\n\nThe first thing that struck me was the great atmosphere in the restaurant.  It's a small place, maybe 15 tables total, and there's blues music playing in the background.  We put our order in at the front window and then grabbed a couple of tables.  We grabbed a couple of tables and didn't have to wait very long before our food was brought out.\n\nOh was the food good.  I ordered a 1/3 slab of ribs and the pulled pork sandwich combo platter.  The pork was piled on it's bun in plentiful quantities.  It was pretty good, the pork had good flavor and my only complaint is that it wasn't quite as tender and juicy as some of the homemade stuff I've had.  The ribs, though, were amazing.  The meat was incredibly tender.  More importantly, though, was that there was a lot of meat on each bone.  I'm used to seeing skimpy ribs get served at restaurants where you're left wanting more after a full rack.  Here, in just 4 bones I found I was very full.  Smoky Jon's sauce was a great compliment to the meat as well.  Good full flavor with a nice little kick at the end.\n\nThe sides were equally excellent.  The baked beans are a must, and I saved mine for the end so that's the flavor I would leave with.  I also had the sugar fried biscuits that were pretty good too.\n\nThe highlight of the meal, though, was something one of my friends had ordered.  The restaurant also had chili available (which may just be a seasonal item).  It was served with a fork rather than a spoon, and with good reason.  I've never seen chili that was that thick and meaty.  I was able to get a taste of it and was floored by how great the flavors were.  It was so good that I almost went back up to order some chili to go for the next day.\n\nSmoky Jon's is a must for BBQ fans in Madison.

Tender, pull-off-the-bone and delicious.  The sauce is where you get the refinement too (beyond the smoking process of course, which is an art in itself).  There are a lot of flavors going on in the sauce and it's not overdone in terms of application.  I've eaten BBQ everywhere and this place's ribs stand up with anyone's.\n\nBrisket Sandwich = Boring.  I was told what I was ordering, so kudos to the service because they were dead on.  It was less of a sandwich and more of brisket on a plain roll.  That's fine of course, but for some reason I feel like sandwich doesn't describe this well.  It does remind me of the bare minimum approach you find in many BBQ joints around, but I don't like it there either.  Anyway, the brisket was very tasty and you should just order it on its own.  No point in getting a piece of bread that just hides the taste of good BBQ.\n\nSpicy Corn = Awesome.  Truly delicious stuff, and I plowed through it in 30 seconds.  Perfect amount of spice too.  Wish I had a little more in that serving, but it will bring me back...soooo mission accomplished?\n\nBaked Beans = Awesome.  I asked if they were made in house, I was told that they were and my palate was rewarded with some of the finest baked beans one can find.  Thick, almost pasty (in a good way) and chock full of flavor.\n\nThe only downfalls would be that it's somewhat pricey for what you get, but food is going up everywhere.  I also ordered a sandwich combo, which was a mistake.  \n\nThe service was top notch.  Everything and more was explained to me in detail.  I only have myself to blame for trying that damn sandwich combo.  Please take it off of the menu...your customers are getting punished for ordering it and it takes away from what you do best.\n\nThe decor is nice and very 'southern' in the sense that this is without a doubt a BBQ place.  I liked looking over all of the trophies and reading the articles and seeing the old pictures.  Very cool stuff.\n\nI got mine to go as well, which was quickly brought out to me.

I had looked up this place before on tripadvisor and was not disappointed. The restaurant itself is super small and the parking in front is rather limited (I had to drive around the block twice and realized that there was no parking in the back). Built as best BBQ in madison I was not disappointed. Fall of the bone tender ribs along with two sides was the meal I had. Get the sugar fried biscuits and you won't be disappointed. This place could be on diner and drives and I am glad I found it one my own! Also prices are super reasonable. No wonder why they won so many awards for there food. Best bbq sauce period.\n\nPro- Inexpensive, delicious bbq, hidden gem\n\nCon- Small seating area, small parking, closes at 8:30 PM\n\nHidden deal- Order the combo to get the best bang for your buck", "business_id": "HLWtNcf3l-wKb6v9duteMQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-12-21", "type": "review"}

I like me some niceeee slab of ribs, drizzled in a tangy, but slightly sweet BBQ sauce. Smoky Jon's definitely delivered!!

What I found amazing was the sauce and the sides!!! The corn was deliciousss, especially all dressed up in their special seasoning. The garlic mashed potatoes tasted just like the ones I usually make at home, which are pretttty darn amazing- if I should say so myself.\n\nOne downfall was that there is a $4.00 plate splitting fee (BOOOOO!). I really wanted to try the 1/2 slab + sandwich + sides combo (only like 2 bucks more than just 1/2 slab) but I knew I couldn't finish it by myself... and it just wouldnt be worth it to pay $4.00 more to share it with a friend. Hmm... or maybe, next time don't be as dumb as me and say out loud you want to share.... sneakily share it at the table!!\n\nAnyways, Smoky Jon's was a great farewell from Madison meal for me, leaving me nice and full, the perfect prep for a long flight back to Los Angeles. \nI'd give it a solid 4 stars.", "business_id": "HLWtNcf3l-wKb6v9duteMQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-01-04", "type": "review"}

If it is simply a matter of cost to provide larger servings, I would suggest to remove \"Jumbo\" from the menu.

I was hoping for an outstanding experience based on the other reviews, but I have to say it wasn't a whole lot different than other big city repair places.  Based on my experience there I would advise:\n1. Call for a rough estimate, and make it clear that you haven't committed to any particular shop- my truck was immobile and I made the mistake of having it towed there first and then got the estimate once I was pretty well trapped.  My repair ended up being 10% more expensive than the last identical repair I had gotten done at another shop, and about 30% more than my regular small town mechanic had quoted me.  \n2.  Thoroughly review the estimate in person and make sure there won't be any unexpected add-ons before agreeing to the estimate- I agreed to the estimate only to get a call later saying that there would have to be an additional $150 repair made in order to do the alignment, which should have been quite obvious to them at the time of the initial inspection.\n3.  Ask lots of questions- after getting my estimate, I asked if the $50 estimate charge was included in the quote I had been given- he paused, backpedaled and said no, \"well we haven't even figured out how we're going to get it into the shop and up on the lift to do the repairs yet, so it might be a little more.\"  I'm sorry, but the $50 I agreed to was for the quote you just gave me, not for 'figuring out how to get it into the shop'.\n\nSo, when it was all said and done I had paid what I figure to be at least $150 an hour in labor, which seems to be on the higher end of what shops charge, so I wouldn't go here expecting a deal.  Aside from the gentleman I had the quote snafu with, everyone else seemed professional, but I didn't have a particularly overwhelmingly great customer service experience.  Based on the other reviews it sounds like they go out of their way to make women in particular feel comfortable there, so if you're willing to pay extra for that experience, and you're not a cheapskate guy driving a junky old truck this might be the shop for you.

It is so much more cost effective to do this because you can take the older parts to Kragen where it will get recycled and refurbished ( you get a small price taken off your purchase, and it is a great for the environment).\n\nThis guy just showed his hand, because he quoted me 2x the amount another shop had quoted me $300ish parts and labor yet he started at $600ish. He must have thought me ripe for the taking, but this isn't my first time at the rodeo.\n\n\nJudging by other reviewers who have shopped around and received price quotes from Chet's, you will be wise to do so too!", "business_id": "cbodGg8dt0gZpdtrQBgduQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-12-13", "type": "review"}

Give it a try!\n\n\nDetailed review:\nI've been craving some pancakes for quite some time and have been on a mission to find the perfect stack.  I've recently tried 'cakes from several Madison eateries and while most have been decent, none have knocked my socks off.\n\nSo, I ventured out to Pat O'Malley's, which is located on the very north side of Truax field.  Or, as some might say, \"in the middle of nowhere.\"  Yes, it's a bit of a drive... and yes, it's a bit difficult to find.  But, it's well worth the effort - believe me.\n\nThe Jet Room is located inside of the aviation building, which (for those not familiar) is where people lucky enough to not have to suffer the pains associated with public air transportation go for their arrivals and departures via private aircraft.  \n\nThe building features a nice lobby, a pilot's lounge, a small gift shop, a vending area, a front desk for travelers, and Pat O'Malley's.  It's spotlessly clean, quiet, and completely opposite of what you'd find at any public airport.  There's plenty of parking available in front of the building.\n\nI entered the smallish diner and was promptly greeted by a friendly hostess and seated at a small table with an awesome view of the airstrip.  Private planes of all types - from small jets to single engine craft - regularly took off and landed during my visit.  It was fun to watch them arrive, taxi, unload, and all of that stuff.  \n\nPat's serves breakfast all day - or until they close, which is around 2:00pm.  Because I arrived at lunchtime, they shared the specials, which sounded (and looked) excellent, but I was there for the pancakes.  \n\nI promptly ordered a coffee, an order of pancakes, and a side of bacon.  After the waitress left, I took note of the food around me, and all of it looked great.  The burgers appeared to be thick and hand-formed.  Many sandwiches featured marbled rye.  The fries and sides were plentiful and appeared to be fresh and crispy.  \n\nI could easily overhear folks talking during their meals and only heard positive comments about the lunch items.  I'll definitely have to head back to check them out.\n\nAfter a very short wait, my food arrived - the pancakes were thick, but as Mio confirmed, light and fluffy.  Butter was served on the side; I lathered the cakes with some of that creamy dairy, splashed on my home-brought 100% real Vermont Maple (grade B, thankyouverymuch), and took a bite.  \n\nThe two plate-sized cakes quickly absorbed the syrup, which made for a delightfully tasty combination.  The pancakes, while substantial, weren't heavy or overwhelming.  A hint of buttermilk provided just enough \"bite\" to the syrup.  Mmmmm - definitely a good experience.\n\nBut the hidden star was the bacon.  It was perfectly cooked; crispy, but slightly chewy.  Thick, but not too thick.  Perfect balance of everything: salt/smoke, thickness/chewiness, and not at all greasy or fatty.  Win.\n\nThe check came - $8 for my meal of cakes, bacon, and coffee.  Service was excellent - the waitress was quick on the coffee fills, made sure my food was ok, and promptly delivered the check and my change.  A $4 tip seemed totally fair for such an excellent experience (plus it was a slow Monday).\n\nPat O'Malleys = WIN\n\nFood = 4.25 stars\nValue = 4 stars\nService = 4 stars\nMISC = 4.5 stars \n\nI'd probably avoid this place during the weekend rushes - it would likely fill-up quickly.  But the food, service, and environment are all top notch, so any wait is well worth it.  Do yourself (and your tastebuds) a favor and visit the fine folks at Pat O'Malley's Jet Room - you'll be glad you did.", "business_id": "j515klfbCAEF3KPiKvHz9g", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-01-25", "type": "review"}

Sundays are the worst, when the church crowd stuffs the place and there's a long wait for a table.  \n\nBut the food is always decent, some of it good, some less-so, but very consistent quality all around.  I like their soups a lot.  A little salty maybe, but made in-house, and not with the starters or canned bases a lot of cheap diners use.  The sandwiches are hit-and-miss; burgers are fine, turkey club comes on a hoagie (WTF?) grilled cheese is done right, and can be varied with diff. breads and cheese choices if you want..  Fries are crispy with a coating of crunchy potato stuff.  Salads are all iceberg lettuce based.  Like you expected anything else.\n\nThe hashbrowns are classic, like the Platonic Ideal of hashbrowns  - grated potatoes, crispy and a little greasy, with veggies mixed in.  The scrambled eggs are not my fave - they are the kind that are cooked in one mass on the griddle, like a kind of omelet.  I prefer scrambled eggs to be turned as they cook so they're fluffy.  The pancakes are average but good, sort of like your classic bisquick style.  The coffee is diner coffee - that's what all the sugar and cream is for!  \n\nCome on - you know exactly what this place is all about before you even walk in.  A lot of these cheap diners make you feel like you're gonna get sick eating their food.  The Cottage Cafe is one of the good ones.
