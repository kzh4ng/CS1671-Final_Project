Ten years ago, I ate here sometimes twice a day.  Over the past year or two, it has gone downhill.  And now?  Well, I hope they read their reviews, but I doubt it.  It would not take much to correct what has gone downhill, but I have seen negative reviews for awhile, but I kept coming back, because I was a regular, maybe I got better food.\n\nFirst...  I like Korean, because I like the ban-chan.  These are the side dishes you get with any Korean meal.  You used to get seven dishes, and they were good, well seasoned, always great.  Then it went to five, now it is down to three or four.  I asked the waiter if this was really all they had.  I tip well, the waiter knows this, and was apologetic that, yes, they only had four type of ban-chan.  And not the \"good\" kind.  You used to get slices of the Korean pancake, or sweet potatoes, not to mention excellent kimchi.  Bean sprouts, and broccoli yum!  Now, you pretty much get kimchi, the sweet red beans, bean sprouts.  That is it.\n\nSecond...  The portion size of the meat was way down.  And I mean miniscule.  Hey, if they are having trouble paying the reant because they expanded out of all proportion to the actual number of paying customers they have, that is not my issue.  Unless they start shorting me on the size of my portion.  In which case, I vote with my feet.  I am not eating here again, period, until I see a turnaround in the negative reviews.  And if I suddenly see a bunch of reviews that sound \"planted', well, that is not too hard to figure out.\n\nThird...  Their sushi has gotton way overpriced and the pieces of fish have gotten really small.\n\nSo, I am done with the place.  I will probably stop by in a few months.  But right now, that Pho place down the street is way better than this.  Not to mention the sushi I can get at that one Asian market that is just a little further up on the strip.  Too bad.  I LOVE dol-sut-bi-bim-barp, and this place used to nail it.  I am not a small ticket customer either.  Just for me, my standard order was a bottle or two of soju, dol-sut-bi-bim-barp, or the grilled korean short ribs, a few pieces of salmon sushi, and then whatever the wife wanted.  And I would tip 20%.  Way to save cash dude!\n\nedit - 12 June 2011...\n\nI have eaten here about three times since I wrote the above review.  I still do not get sushi here, but the side dishes have taken a turn for the better.  Still not enough different ones, but better than it was.  And the food has gotten a little better.  I still have not really pigged out at the weekend meat buffet.  And it is on my list of \"things I REALLY want to do\", will write it up when I do it.  problem is, for what they charge, and how little the wife eats, not worth it.  Maybe I will be able to sneak down there some night.  I'll just tell the wife I am going to a strip club.

Apparently that is only available on the weekends, so be warned. We started off a bit on the wrong foot, because we had made reservations in advance, only to be told when we got there that another, larger party had booked out the upstairs BBQ area, so they wouldn't be able to accommodate us. After staging a bit of a hissy fit, they were able to find a place for us, and the adventure commenced.\n\nSo, having had Korean BBQ in both New York and San Francisco, I can't say that I thought this was the best experience. The kim chi selection is pretty limited when you're used to being plied with multiple little plates of different kinds of tasty kim chi. Here, they only give you the pickled cabbage. If you're looking for vegetables, this is not your place. You can take marinated bulgolgi, kalbi, pork, and chicken, plus there's calamari and shrimp for seafood eaters. The chicken was really tasty, but the rest of the selection was a bit bleh. As one of my friends put it, the bulgolgi from Trader Joe's is better than what we had here.\n\nIf you go, be nice to your tablemates and try to rotate the cooking duties. It's really lots of fun to go with friends and to have a communal experience, so even though I'm not sounding like I had a great time, the reality is that we all had a lot of fun and enjoyed ourselves.

I've not been there for lunch or had the Korean food.\n\nMy most recent visit typifies each time I've had there. Upon arrival, the place is nearly empty. The service is attentive but indifferent, as if they realize you're a dirty dish that needs to be cleaned - you're taken care of like any other chore.\n\nThe miso soup arrived, and was very tasty. However, it was also past lukewarm to the point of being cool. This is pretty normal, as well. \n\nThe most disappointing part is the sushi itself. It is not inexpensive (really, sushi is rarely inexpensive), but upon arrival, it is a bit too warm, and just doesn't taste fresh. Being that much of this dish consists of raw fish, freshness concerns me a bit more than, say, french fries at a bar. Each and every variety is equally disappointing, with the end result being \"Meh\" to \"Yech.\" \n\nWith such a large population of sushi places in Pittsburgh these days, and even Giant Eagle in a pinch, there is not really a reason to frequent this place anymore.

The food that was delivered to us was simply inedible. Point blank. \n\nMy husband and I ordered a bunch of sushi for dinner with the plan of having tasty leftovers for lunch the next day, so we splurged a little, spent like $60 on various rolls. The presentation was pretty pathetic - wilting nori, leading us to believe these rolls were pre-made; hot pink ginger, meaning it's the MSG-soaked kind; glue-like rice, where you can't see the individual grains - but what really horrible was the smell. When we took the lid off the tray, the stench of rotten fish knocked both if us back. I honestly gagged.\n\nIt was so awful, we just stared at each other, amazed that we just spent our money on a pile of stinking rot. Determined to not waste everything, I picked up a piece of spider roll to sniff/inspect/try. IT HAD A HUGE HAIR IN IT, all wound around the crab. Totally disgusting. My husband attempted to try the inari - just tofu and rice, right? It tasted like rotten fish, as it had absorbed all the smells from the other fish rolls. \n\nWe had also ordered a vegetable and tofu soup, and a green salad with ginger dressing. Can't even believe this, but the salad leaves were brown and slimy on the ends! They actually screwed up a green salad. The soup tasted like the inside of an aluminum pot, all metallic and burnt-flavored. Horrible, horrible, horrible. We literally dumped everything down the garbage disposal. Total waste.\n\nWe tried to call and complain, but by the time our order was delivered, the place was closed. We will be calling again today to get our money back.

Sushi Kim is a clean and bright place with seats on all two floors. The Korean BBQ buffet is on the second floor and only available on Friday and Saturday evenings starting at 5pm. \n\nThe service was wonderful and the servers really helpful. The Korean BBQ is buffet style, so you help yourself to the raw proteins and vegetables at the buffet bars and then cook them on your hot plate at your table. It's a really fun and interactive eating experience. There weren't that many choices for proteins, but the choices that were available were all delicious. Protein choices ranged from mussels and shrimps to pork, chicken and beef. My favorite was the bulgogi beef. \n\nThere were a few things I disliked about the Korean BBQ at Sushi Kim though. First off, they offered no butter or oil for the BBQ. I understand that they are trying to keep things healthy and all, but without any grease, the food was easily burnt. Butter or oil should always be an available option. Secondly, I did not like the design of their hot plates--the interior cooking area was way too tiny so it took forever to cook the food. And finally, they need to add a DESSERT BAR. After eating all that grilled food, I craved something sweet and refreshing. But, Sushi Kim left me hanging. Sushi Kim is already charging a whopping $24 per person--it would be nice if they throw in a dessert bar to sweeten up the deal (pun intended). \n\nOverall, I'm very thankful there is a Korean BBQ place in Pittsburgh. For being the only Korean BBQ buffet place in the area, it deserves a standing ovation. I had a great time at Sushi Kim and would gladly recommend the Korean BBQ buffet special.

Since today is my birthday, I thought I'd treat myself to something I haven't had in a long time, bulgogi. \n\nI was greeted by a tiny Asian woman as soon as I walked in the door. \"Only one?\" as if I should be ashamed of being a solo diner. She wanted to seat me at a table in the front but, noticing an identical table in the back, I requested that one.  For some reason she didn't want me to sit there and lead me instead to a side room adjacent the bar as if to hide me. \n\nThe server came by shortly afterwards, with a menu and a glass of water. Although I had already made up my mind to get bulgogi before I even got here, I did take a moment to take a look at the menu and was almost tempted to get the kalbi instead. But stuck with the bulgogi when it came time to place my order.\n\nAbout 15 minutes later the server brought me a bowl of soup politely confessing that he almost forgot about me. I suppose the hiding of me was a success. The soup was a salty broth with a few slices of scallion floating on top. Not much to my liking, but hey, everyone's taste is different right?  I'll admit that at this point I was starting to regret my decision to dine here for lunch in the first place but that attitude changed in about five minutes when my plate arrived. \n\nThe plate was divided into four sections. If you look at the photo that I took of it, I'll go clockwise from the top left. The salad was scrumptious containing red pepper slices, carrot slices, cucumber slices, and a slice of orange on top of a bed of lettuce. Everything was very fresh and there was something that resembled candy coated seeds sprinkled on top. This was all dressed with a delicately sweet dressing. Yum!\n\nIn the second quadrant was some of the best kimchee I've ever tasted. The fieriness of it was perfectly balanced off with cooked, yet purposely chilled, broccoli alongside two pillows of something doughy.\n\nBelow that was the main attraction; the bulgogi. I suppose I can talk with some authority here beings that I spent two years in the Republic of Korea. Granted that was about twenty five years ago but I can still detect an imposter when it comes to bulgogi. This is some of the most authentic bulgogi I've ever tasted. Masitneun! \n\nOf course bulgogi and kimchee just wouldn't be complete without a generous serving of sticky rice. The kind of rice that you can easily pick up with chop sticks.\n\nThe total came to $10.65 which I consider a bargain for the quality of the meal that I had. Ms. Personality, the one who originally greeted me, took my check and credit card and rang me up. She didn't bother to look at me when in a halfhearted tone said, \"Thank you\".  Despite the \"hostess with the leastess\", I'm giving this place a four star based Seoul-ly on its authenticity and down-right deliciousness.\n\nkamsahamnida", "business_id": "dHDi4wCcjsOR6vcZ8oOIoA", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-03-13", "type": "review"}

Then he said I ordered 2 kimchi soon tofu, 1 beef soon tofu, 1 kalbi, and 1 kalbitang!  I said \"no I didn't\" and I repeated what I ordered.  Then he argued with me and said \"Yes you did! You ordered 3 soon tofu, plus kimchi jjigae, kalbi, and kalbitang!\"  I said \"are you kidding me right now?  Look here!  We're only 4 people!  Why would I order so many soups for?\"  The guy must be a moron, because he can't even count how many people there are to be ordering 7 items?  Do we look like we could eat that much?  We were two slim adults, and two kids under 15!!  Then he let out a big sigh and then stomped off to fix the order at the kitchen.  He comes back with our food and he literally bangs the soup bowl onto the table!  He is obviously emanating a negative attitude, bangs down the rest of the stuff and stomped off.  I just shook my head and we started to eat.  Half way through the lunch we needed more rice and napkin so I called him over since he was bringing stuff to the next table.  He obviously heard me and didn't bother turning around.  OK, so I'm thinking to myself, maybe he didn't hear me.  I call him again second time and he pretended he didn't hear me.  Then the third time, I called him loud enough for the whole restaurant to hear me and then he turns around, rolls his eyes, makes a face and then comes over.  I couldn't believe my eyes!!  I asked him \"are you giving me an attitude right now?\"  then he yells (yes he yelled at a customer) at me and says \"did I even look at you right now?\"  Then he passes by our table, goes to the next table and \"politely\" asks  \"may I take your order?\"  WTF?  I asked him to help me get something and he completely ignores me?  \n\nOk so let's recap here.  He takes the order wrong, puts in 2 too many orders of Soon Tofu, then gets mad at me when I correct him that isn't so, then he practically throws the food at us banging every chance he gets, and then he ignores me when I call him!  OMG!  At this point, I'm FURIOUS!  I get up and go talk to the owner who happens to be there today.  I reiterate everything that just happened and he doesn't say anything but to just look towards the direction of the kitchen!  Then I say to him \"is it ok for the server to do that to a customer\" and he turns and apologized.  He said that it's his fault for not training the staff correctly.  OK, so I'll take that for an apology, but then he should go quietly talk to the server, have the server come over and apologize to me personally!  Nope, that never happened, and guess what happened next?  The owner comes over to our table, being extra nice, and says he's going to take care of our lunch on the house.  At this point, I'm still shaking from rage and I can't even eat anymore.  I said I'm not making a scene, because I want free lunch.  I'm going to pay for what needs to be pay for, I don't want free lunch.  So while the owner's talking to me at our table, that server is standing near the kitchen talking to another server, looking directly at me, and laughing at me!  WOW!   Just amazing!  I've dined out at so many restaurants over the years in my life at all different levels, from Michelin starred to hole-in-the-wall scary places, but this was just the worst service ever!!\n\nStay far away from this place!  I called my mother after what happened.  She was at a luncheon with 20 of her Korean friends for a church function.  You can bet that she spread the word.  None of those ladies are going there in the future.  And neither am I.  To the Owner:  word of mouth is a scary thing.", "business_id": "PX3e3qtBx_5VC3vqq47jpQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-05-30", "type": "review"}

However, I've lived in both LA and SF for several years each, so I could be a harsh critique here.\n\nThis is the only Korean restaurant in Tempe (aside from the one-offs like Paradise Hawaiian BBQ) and so you're not exactly picking from a bunch anyway. The food tends to be well-portioned, though many of the dishes had been pre-cooked and are just heated to order (i.e. Yukkaejang). My biggest discontent is the price, which is quite expensive comparing against the price level of other Korean restaurants I've been to, and absurdly expensive when compared against the other restaurants of similar caliber in Arizona.\n\nThe best thing happening here is the pancake, so definitely try it out if you're new to Korean food. It's about $13 (maybe even $15?) and serves as a great appetizer to split between 3-4 people. Don't go for the happy hour stuff-- they are puny in portion.\n\nThe second best thing happening here is the service, though it depends on who you get. The younger servers tend to be really friendly, well-spoken, and willing to take your fight to the kitchen for you. For example, my Yukgaejang (spicy noodle soup) showed up with no noodles-- the girl server had the kitchen serve me a whole side bowl of noodles and soup for free!

I considered calling an ambulence. :( I truly felt like I was going to die.\n\nMy friend found me on bathroom floor. Rushed me to hospital. In the hospital, I blacked out a few times, saw the light, as they rushed to attend to me. I couldn't talk, walk, or function. I had severe food poisoning.  I had chills, sweats, shakes, and feeling hot and cold. Absolute worst feeling in the world. They immediately gave me fluids, nausea meds, and morphine for pain. I was there untill 3:30. My feeling is that soup was bad. It diddnt taste right to begin with, nor did it look right. Also, considering it was a veggie broth, I wonder if because it may be something the Asians there NEVER order (perhaps), they probably had a batch that went wrong, or... maybe something else in the soup wasint right. Lastly, the soup is usually super boiling hot. I felt like it wasint, cause my egg diddint cook right away as usual. Maybe it was the egg from samonila poisening. I'm going to talk to the manager, I want a full refund.\n\nThis has been the most traumatic health issue I've ever felt, and certainly the worst case of food poisoning I have ever had. :(\n\nUpdate: Sean the owner helped to get me a full refund.

It's really not the type of place you want to stay and hang out.  There is no atmosphere and it's located in a strip-mall.  Since the tag line is \"A Healthy Food Bistro,\" I feel like it's healthier for me than other Chinese in the valley... but I think that's just in my head!  Still, I tell them 'light oil' whenever I order.  I feel less guilty that way!\n\nUnfortunately, I'm not a big fan of the protein options.  First time around, I ordered shrimp with veggies - the shrimp did not taste fresh so I picked around it and ate the veggies and brown rice.  I went with chicken the next few times, and when I saw that they have eggplant (my fave) on the menu, I started requesting a combo of eggplant, mixed veggies, and chicken. Still, the chicken tastes almost processed - Once again, I eat the veggies and rice.  Maybe the key is to order beef or tofu... I'll keep trying until I get it right, or maybe I'll just have to find an alternative.  \n\nEither way, China Lite gets 3 stars from me.

And those that had been around for awhile, it appeared that they were getting a new surge of customers.  I was damn curious to see what the hype was all about and with a restaurant named \"Tofu Hut\", I figure it would satisfy my curiosity.  We actually passed another Korean restaurant first, a new one complete with the \"Grand Opening\" sign up.  I figure we'd try out \"Tofu Hut\" since it had been in Vegas for awhile and has lasted.  Usually, it's a sign that the business must be doing alright, right?  Wrong.\n\nSo, my first mistake was assuming that because it had been in Vegas for awhile, it would be decent.  The second mistake I made was not checking Yelp first to see if anyone had anything about this restaurant.  If I had done this first, I would have seen TWO 1 star reviews with no other good reviews to counteract the two.  If I had done this research first, you would not have seen me eating here.\n\nWalking in for an early Sunday evening dinner, our party of four chose the cooking table with the plan to cook some serious meat.  Instead, we ordered the Kimchee Beef Tofu Soup ($8.36), two orders of Short Ribs BBQ ($12.59 each), and a Kimchee Pot Stew ($8.95).  If you do want to do the table barbecue, it's a minimum two orders to do that.\n\nThey brought out a side salad for each person to start and then five banchan (side dishes) to share.  And yes, I said five.  I thought this was a joke - April Fools' Day, haha kind of joke.  No.  I know at some Korean restaurants they give out more banchan to the Koreans, so we even asked for more and they said that's all they had. I thought we were being gypped and looked over at the neighboring table of six Koreans to see if they got more than we did.  No, they did not.  Tofu Hut only gives out five banchan!  Blah!  They were this coleslaw concoction that I have never seen before, cabbage kimchee, fishcake, bean sprouts, and cucumbers.  I'm used to getting 5-10 banchans, you can imagine my shock and disappointment!\n\nWhen the tofu soup and pot stew arrived, the waitress asked if she wanted her to crack a fresh egg in there.  Sure!  As she passed over my hot tofu soup, she knocked over the BF's water glass.  No big deal, she apologized and cleaned it up.  (I was just glad she didn't drop the hot soup too!)  I had my tofu \"spicy\" and it was more mild.  There wasn't much taste going on here and I was less than impressed.  I did like the hot stone burnt rice that comes out with my tofu soup though.  My friend's pot stew was more soup-like than she cared for as well.  The only thing really good was the Short Ribs.  We ended up ordering another plate because it was pretty good.  Everything else fell below par.  \n\nTo close out our meal, the check came.  We asked if they had shikhye, which is a this cold beverage that is usually served at the end of the meal.  It's refreshing after a greasy meal and I'm used to getting this automatically after our meal concludes at Korean restaurants.  They told us they did not have this.  Oh my goodness.  Five banchans and no shikhye?!  \n\nFinal bill: $70 including tip and tax.\n\nThis restaurant is sparse.  Lots of Koreans eating here, but perhaps I just have higher expectations and Tofu Hut doesn't cut it.", "business_id": "UKKz4HdQC0aH9j5lLi4u8Q", "stars": 2, "date": "2007-04-02", "type": "review"}

We wanted to eat at Mr. Tofu, but they are closed on Sundays.  My fiance used to come to Tofu Hut a lot before discovering Mr. Tofu.  Since I have limited experience with Korean restaurants, I will be comparing Tofu Hut with Mr. Tofu, which is directly across the street.  The parking in both places could be better.  Tofu Hut has more seating and was busier.  Some tables at Tofu Hut had grills built into the tables.  As you may know, each meal comes with some complimentary sides.  The sides at Tofu Hut are better.  I like the fish cakes.  Also, they gave us slices of bread made from rice that was pretty good.  I always order the same thing, bibimbap dolcet.  They are equally good at both places.  Tofu Hut gives you a large bottle of spicy bean paste.  Mr. Tofu provides a small portion.  The rice never got crunchy, which is my favorite part.  I guess the hot pot cooled down too much before they could add the ingredients.  Perhaps an oversight because they were so busy.  A careless mistake in my opinion.  That is the best part of the dish.  At Tofu Hut, bibimbap dolcet also comes with spicy tofu soup made with spicy bean paste.  That was the best part.  Really good and hot.  They add one raw egg.  I love dipping the fish cake in the spicy soup.  I think the price is similar.  My fiance got her usual, which is tofu soup.  It was not very good.  Our friends ordered galbi, bulgogi, and some sort of spicy chicken dish.  The galbi was very good.  The bulgogi was disappointing.  The other chicken dish was really good.  Overall, I liked Tofu Hut better, but I doubt my fiance will agree, so you will probably see me back at Mr. Tofu.  Both are good.", "business_id": "UKKz4HdQC0aH9j5lLi4u8Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-03-14", "type": "review"}

Last night I started feeling a grumble in my tummy and I knew that I was hungry. I wanted to try a new restaurant but wasn't too sure where I could go at 10 pm on a Thursday night. I needed both a place  that could fill my food standards and my hunger. I had heard a lot about Tofu Hut so decided to give it a try.\n\nOnce arriving at the restaurant, the server was very prompt in seating us and taking our order. The Banchan came out just a few moments after. Most were different from the other Korean Barbecue restaurants I have been to, but they were all very tasty. My favorite of the dishes was the Oi Sobeagi, also known as cucumber kimchi. It had the right amount of spicy and wasn't too overwhelming like others I have had before. \n\nThe meat was all very flavorful and delicious. We ate the brisket and marinated beef mostly. For all you Samgyeopsal (pork belly) lovers out there, I recommend ordering it marinated. It adds a little more flavor to the pork belly making it even more delicious. \n\nMy only complaint is that they did not have the usual dipping sauce that is served at most Korean Barbeque places. The sauce the did have was unique, but not my favorite.\n\nRecommendation: They have a special there from 10 pm - 2 am where you can get AYCE for $13.99, instead of the usual $16.99!

I had only been to one other Korean restaurant prior to this, and it wasn't good.  But now that I am vegetarian, I am always afraid to go to a different place in fear that little fishies might be lurking in what I eat.  Well, after getting a coupon for Tofu Hut I decided to finally make a go of it and try some Korean food again.\n\nWe went in on a Friday night and the place was dead with only a couple of white 20-somethings sitting at the tables.  I guess that wasn't a good sign.\n\nUnlike most reviewers, I actually had a really great server.  He pointed out everything that was vegetarian or could be made vegetarian (2 tofu soups and 2 entrees) and even brought out the bottle of sauce they use on some of the dishes so I could look at the label (bonito- not vegetarian).  He was very friendly and was never annoyed with our questions.  He was also attentive and kept our water glasses full.\n\nThey started us out with a salad.  Not much to it- just some iceberg lettuce and dressing- but it was actually pretty tasty.  We ordered the bibimbap and buckwheat noodles, both without meat (of course).  The bibimbap came with an order of tofu soup which was a nice little surprise.\n\nThe tofu soup was really flavorful and my favorite part of the meal.  They were even nice enough to ask if they could crack the egg in it before they did so, knowing I was a vegetarian.  I was expecting good things from everything else, but sadly it just got progressively worse.  \n\nThe banchan were boring.  The kimchi and bean sprouts were iffy on their fish content, the pickled seaweed was ok but had little flavor, and the potato pancakes tasted like absolutely nothing.  The bibimbap was ok but lacking flavor and depth.  This could, of course, be my fault for my dietary restrictions but I don't think it should be that hard to season some rice and veggies.  The buckwheat noodles were just some cold noodles drowning in a salty liquid and covered with some iceberg lettuce.  Meh.\n\nIt makes me sad since I had such a helpful server, but he really couldn't save this meal.  Perhaps it's just me and my under-developed Korean food palate?  I really hope not. \n\nIt appears as though everyone comes here for the barbeque, so maybe you're better off ordering that.", "business_id": "UKKz4HdQC0aH9j5lLi4u8Q", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-04-13", "type": "review"}

A salad of shredded lettuce with a vinaigrette composed of soy sauce, sesame, chili flakes and probably a few other seasonings.\nThe only real knock for I is that they have no steak like a tri-tip found at some BBQs, but that's more a personal preference and tends to be usually a dinner option if it's available.

One side of jun was all black and tasted nothing more than flour. Sun-tofu was not bad but not good either. We ordered spicy but it wasnt spicy at all. Guk-su was terrible. Too much vinegar was used.. i almost threw up while eating. Staff was not bad. They walj around with ice water and refill it everytime you ask. Overall i will never go back. I cant believe tofu hut became this horrible. It wasnt used to be this bad. I will rather wait until mr. Tofu opens on weekdays.

In short, tofu is just the tip of the iceberg. This review is for the AYCE experience.\n\nAYCE is served differently here than most buffet style restaurants. Yes, it's all you can eat, however you place up to four orders of meat and they bring it out to you, which are actually perfectly portioned so you don't get charged for wasting items.\n\nFood wise, the food is fantastic. They bring you out six small appetizers to snack on while your meat arrived. We decided on the sliced ribeye, short ribs, beef tongue, brisket, and pork belly. All we satisfying. One of the things we wished we had was some kind of sauce (be it soy, tempura, teriyaki, anything) to dip our meat in. Granted, the natural flavors of the meats are great, however some of the meats other than the pre-marinated ones are lacking in seasoning. \n\nThe downside, the service is awful. We only seen our waitress twice, and that was to drop off our water, and present the check. We were never asked for any soft drinks, beer, etc, and we had to order from another server when we wanted refills on our drinks, and to order more meat. We just sat there wanting to eat more, and it was a good fifteen minutes before we grabbed the attention of a friendly male waiter. I know most traditional inspired Asian restaurants aren't known for their service, however if I'm giving you my money, I want to at least be acknowledged from time to time!\n\nDecent experience, food was great, kind of overshadowed by lacking service.

While the food was okay, the cleanliness level definitely turned me off from ever returning. \n\nI came here with my fianc\u00e9 and 10 month old son on a Monday afternoon.

Still had condensation rings from cups, and still greasy and sticky on multiple parts of the table. We ended up cleaning it ourselves with baby wipes. \n\nWe needed a high chair for my son - and oh how I wish I had a high chair cover for what was provided for us. Their high chair was the nastiest high chair I have ever seen. There were lots of dried up food, and it was sticky all over! I tried to clean it with baby wipes - but there was only so much I could do. I doubt they have ever cleaned that high chair. It was so disgusting and nasty.\n\nWe were seated against one of the windows and you could just see the amount of dust and dirt on the window sill. The floors were also super greasy.. You could literally slide around on their floors. And I just loved getting my banchan served on a filthy tray that had pieces of raw meat and rice on it. Would it kill them to wipe down their serving trays?\n\nNormally we wouldn't stay in a place like this after all the red flags. But we had an appointment to get to and didn't have time to go somewhere else.\n\nWe ended up ordering the marinated ribeye, short ribs, beef tongue, beef brisket and pork belly.

Theres a waiting list at the host stand that is used often, so try to get there before the lunch rush starts.\n\nPros: perfect for people who are new to korean bbq, good food at a good price, good service. Everything is pretty much on par.\n\nCons: can get busy easily, seats can easily become unavailable.\n\nAdvice: bring people with you, its suited for that obviously.", "business_id": "UKKz4HdQC0aH9j5lLi4u8Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-03-04", "type": "review"}

Their prices are the most reasonable in all of Vegas. $16.99 all day up till 10 pm then it is $13.99 for their late night special.  \n\nIt's a hit or miss with the service!  You can tell when they are in a bad mood or not.  When they're in a good mood, they're very kind.  \n\nThe food is great!  I always order brisket,  pork belly,  beef tongue, squid,  spicy chicken,  and the tripe. I don't really like the tripe,  I just order it for the honeycomb that comes with it. Ask for brisket sauce!  It's yummy!  They also have very tasty side dishes: japchae, cucumber salad,  fishcakes, korean pancakes,  and kimchi.  Oh and by the way,  they have the best salad anywhere!  I've tried a lot of korean bbq places and by far,  tofu hut has the best house salad! \n\nThere are definitely other places where you can get better meat quality and better service,  but you will never get this great of a deal!  \n\nHot tea is free too!", "business_id": "UKKz4HdQC0aH9j5lLi4u8Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-03-05", "type": "review"}

Tofu Hut is like a hut - only because it's tiny.  I've gone here about a handful of times, and even though it gets super packed, the wait times are never ridiculous.  Also, Tofu Hut is cleaner than most AYCE korean places that I've been to.\n\nThe best price - $16.99 for AYCE.  They have a late night special price, but I forgot what the dollar amount is.\n\nGenerous portions of meats.  It's not the kind of buffet you get up and grab.  They bring the meats to you.  I love the ribeye, the marinated pork belly, and brisket.  There's a list of about 10 choices for AYCE, but if you are sharing with one other person, 2 or 3 meats are plenty.\n\nAlso comes with a side of salad and of course kimchee, bean sprouts, tofu (the usual 8-10 side dishes that come with your meal for every korean restaurant ever).  \n\nWash it all down with hot barley tea.  A must every time I go to a Korean restaurant.", "business_id": "UKKz4HdQC0aH9j5lLi4u8Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-03-06", "type": "review"}
