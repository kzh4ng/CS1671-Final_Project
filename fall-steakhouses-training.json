If the rating was strictly based on food, I'd go with 5, easily. But, it's based on service, too, which is why I had to knock one off. Here's the deal...\n\nI love Morton's. Its old-school interior and no-gimmicks shtick is awesome. Plus, of course, the food is fantastic. However, I wanted to branch out, and Ruth's Chris had some great reviews, so I utilized Yelp's oh-so-convenient Open Table reservation feature, and scored a table for two on a Saturday night. \n\nOur reservation was for 8:30. We arrived right on the dot, but were told to go to the bar and wait. So, my boyfriend and I both got cocktails -- he had Glenlivet, which is obvs hard to mess up, and I got the Peachy Pear-tini, which was delish. And then, we waited. And waited. Around 9, our table was ready. \n\nOur waitress was Kristen, and she was fantastic. Very attentive, friendly, witty, and knowledgeable about the food. Here's our food rundown:\n\n- Barbequed shrimp app: I initially thought was BBQ sauce + shrimp, but it ain't. It's succulent li'l shrimp in a deliciously garlicky, white wine-infused sauce with a cayenne kick. Kristen suggested that we dip the bread in the sauce after the shrimp were gone, and we happily took her up on that. \n\n-Ruth's chopped salad: Holy crap. The most memorable salad of my life. I rarely rave about salads. In fact, I think this is the first time I ever have in my life. But, this salad was incredible! It has crispy onion strings on top, hearts of palm (which I love), and this amazing lemon-basil dressing, among other delicious things. So awesome.\n\n- Filet mignon: My boyfriend and I both opted for the filet. I got mine with extra butter, he got his with a bleu cheese crust. Mine was phenomenal. The sizzling butter really adds an extra dimension of flavor that puts it beyond Morton's. My boyfriend found the bleu cheese to be a li'l too generous, and he wound up scraping some off, but still enjoyed it.\n\n- Broccoli au gratin: Again, phenomenal. I've never enjoyed broccoli so much. Granted, it was swimming in bubbling, gooey cheese...\n\n- Potatoes lyonnaise: We took a risk here, as many people rave about the garlic mashed potatoes, and we saw mountains of them carried past our table. But, it paid off big-time. These were, hands-down, the BEST lyonnaise potatoes EVER. Pamela's has nothing on these. Every mouthful was a medley of crusty brown potatoes and caramelized onion goodness. I dream about these potatoes.\n\nSo, based on that experience, we went back again the next Saturday. Different waitress, same food (literally, we ordered exactly the same items, 'cause they were so damn good). I don't remember the waitress' name that we had the second time, but we waited longer for food to appear, were checked on far less, she took the cocktail shaker with my extra martini in it before I'd gotten to pour it in my glass, our steaks were not done correctly (he got my medium-rare, I got his medium-well), and it took forever to get the check. I really think it ruins the experience when you're done eating and ready to go, and you're just sitting there, drumming your fingers, looking around the dining room and wondering, \"Where the hell is the waitress with our check?\" \n\nThat said, we will definitely be back. We'll just request to be seated in Kristen's section! :)", "business_id": "0FgwBx7pgmNdUtsd_T8UYQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-11-14", "type": "review"}

One, I moved here from South Florida, where the best burgers in town came from your average diners.  They were the last bastion of American food in South Florida, so they served up REAL American food.  If you wanted a real burger, you went to a diner.  After returning to Pittsburgh, I found that every diner here has turned to serving up those frozen gray hockey puck patties and passing them off as burgers.\n\nSecond, (until the recent explosion of good burger joints in da burgh), I actually HAD been a fan of Tessaro's, until their hostess/manager flat out offended the hell out of me and my party of three.  The result is that I have never, and WILL never return to Tessaro's.\n\nMy best friend is a 62 y/o blind woman that I met doing theater in the 90's in Pittsburgh.  She lives with her 91 year old mother, and her father (the driver) passed away several years ago.  I don't drive, and rely on the bus system that Steve Bland is intentionally systematically destroying, so any outing that we make must be carefully planned.\n\nShe and I had met once at Tessaro's.  It was her first time being there.  She took the Access van for the disabled, and I met her there after work via bus.  I walked in, she was seated, having a drink, waiting for me to join her. No problem.  We had a great meal, with an awesome burger.  I can't say enough...they really do have mouthwatering burgers.\n\nMonths later, we decided to go again, and the plan was pretty much the same.  She took the Access van to the restaurant, and I was going to meet her by bus, and this time a new friend was going to join us, coming by bus from Oakland, and new to Pittsburgh.\n\nMy best friend called me at 4:30 (we were supposed to meet at 5) and said that her van had come early, and that she was already at the restaurant.  I told her I would get there as soon as I could.  I left work a few minutes before 5 pm, and arrived at the restaurant 5:15.  They were busy, but I was surprised to find my friend still standing in the doorway.  The blind woman had been standing there for 45 minutes.  \n\nI made my presence known, and the hostess/manager acknowledged, asked about our other friend. I explained that he was ten minutes away and coming by bus, new to the city, but WAS on his way.  She walked away from us.  We stood in the doorway fro another twenty minutes.\n\nFinally, the manager came back, and I caught her attention, and motioned my head toward my blind friend, and asked if we really had to keep waiting?  She'd been standing there in the doorway for over an hour.\n\nThe next statement sealed the deal on us never returning to Tessaro's.  The manager slapped her hands on her hips, and started barking:\n\n\"LOOK!  We don't have many rules around here!  In fact, we only have ONE, that you don't get seated until your whole party is here!\"\n\nAnd THIS is what really sealed it:\n\nThe woman thrust her thumb in my BLIND friend's direction, who had only been to Tessaro's ONCE before in her life, with me, and said:\n\n\"And SHE oughta KNOW that!\"\n\nShe oughta know that?  Exactly HOW should she 'know that'? The only other time she'd been there, she arrived before me, was seated, waited, and I joined her.\n\nAdditionally, the 'rule' was posted...on a piece of 8 1/2 by 11 copy paper, taped to the wall at the end of the counter, behind several rows of water pitchers.  I couldn't see the 'rule'...a blind woman certainly wasn't going to 'see' it!\n\nFinally, after another ten minutes standing there, the manager 'allowed' us to take a table and wait for our friend, who came five minutes later.  We ate our meal, paid our bill, and we left.\n\nAnd we will NOT return.\n\nYou can treat me badly, and if there's something I really love about your business, I might come back.  But do NOT badmouth a blind woman, or anyone else for that matter, who is disabled, and in need of a slight amount of extra consideration.\n\nTessaro's, you might make good burgers, and you'll continue making a fortune off them.  And I'm sure you really don't give a crap about how your manager treated this lady.  But we will NOT drop one dime more in your restaurant.  We'll take our business to Burgatory.", "business_id": "vgXE1I7c9ElcfYyZfQiN1Q", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-10-19", "type": "review"}

Although the service was just fine and the bread & cheese fries were tasty, the rest of the food was either wholly unremarkable or completely unsatisfactory.\n\nI ordered the 8 oz. sirloin (so cold and purple throughout that it could walk off the plate on its own; I know, go ahead and make a face...), with saut\u00e9ed mushrooms and a house salad (no onions, extra ranch dressing) as my sides.\n\nThe salad was very plain and had nothing about it to distinguish it from any other salad anywhere (including one you would make at home or one that you would get from any buffet salad bar anywhere in the nation). I did not expect the salad to be the highlight of the meal, but usually there is something (a spiced up ranch dressing, flavored croutons, etc) that add to uniqueness of a 'house' salad. Not this time. Meh.\n\nWhen my entr\u00e9e showed up, the steak was warm, light pink throughout, rubbery, and absolutely flavorless. No rub, no marinade, and the cut had clearly either been recently frozen or sitting in a fridge for an extended period of time because the flavor of oxidation was rife. Please note that I never expect there to be marinades or rubs on a steak, but then I do expect the cut to stand up on its own (which it did not in this case).\n\nThe saut\u00e9ed mushrooms were particularly disappointing. I love saut\u00e9ed mushrooms. Adore them. I require nothing more than a little butter or oil on them and then just go to town in that pan! The mushrooms I received were a mix of mushrooms that had been saut\u00e9ed to the point of shriveled brown lumps and those that had been held over a warm microwave for 15 seconds. On top of this odd culinary spectrum, there seemed to be nothing but water on them, which didn't do anything to assist in the flavor. A quarter through the meal, I'd had enough and claimed a full tummy (a white lie... forgive me).\n\nAlthough the server was kind and competent, the food was a severe let down and I would never return to this or any other location.

This always worries me:  is the food lousy? The service bad?  Is it overpriced?  The answer is no, no and no.\n\nThe server was pretty quick to get to our table and was very friendly.  She brought some really good roasted salsa and a side of some veggie stuff, and a big basket of chips.  She took our drink order and was a little delayed in getting back to us but apologized for the delay and took our dinner order.\n\nDinner was HUGE.  I mean seriously!  I had the Chicken Chipotle and my finance had the seafood dish.  REALLY, really good; especially the Chicken Chipotle; spicy and a lot of flavor.  And the prices were very fair.  And their HAPPY HOUR has really cheap prices for drinks and appetizers.\n\nSo why is this place so dead?  I have no idea but I liked it, and I'm pretty picky about my Mexican food (salsa makes or breaks a restaurant IMHO!). Food was fresh, hot, and served in volumes.  Service was quick and friendly.

It took us through a community and right to a locked gate. I could see the restaurant on top of the hill but could get to it. I ended up calling the restaurant and spoke to a confused young girl. She didn't understand how I could be lost and had no idea houses were right below them. \n\nAfter a few minutes of searching, I located the place. The parking lot was packed (it was Saturday night) but there was a nice gentleman there with a shuttle to help us to the top of the hill. \n\nThe restaurant itself is pretty rustic. There's a huge long horn steer outside, so the smell was a little strong but manageable. Inside was a live band and unique designed layout with a kid slide and all. \n\nWe had a nice window seat which overlooked the city lights. The view was great and so was the friendly staff. The issue I had the most was with the food. \n\nI was not impressed to say the least. We ordered the \"Cowboy Stuff\" which was basically a sample of ribs, chicken, fish, shrimp and filet mignon. The sides were potato wedges, spicy baked beans, pineapple coleslaw , corn on the cob and a side of veggies. The meal also came with rolls, biscuits and a salad. Overall cost was $47 and with a tip, about $55 total for the two of us. \n\nEverything was pretty bland and nothing that stood out as great tasting. I would much rather have gone to Pork on the Fork, a local BBQ place two minutes from my house. Instead I drove 40 minutes across the valley for this? Very disappointing to me. \n\nIf it wasn't for the cool atmosphere and helpful staff, I would give this place a two star rating.

He looks concerned.\n\nThe space is split into two, but I'm not sure how. I know this because when we asked for a table, the lady said that we could sit in some seats now, but other seats weren't available until later. I wasn't clear on which seats were available and which weren't, which concerned me greatly because then she said I could have a seat, and later I could have a different seat, which meant I had to figure out which seats were ok so we just sat near some other people. Eventually we switched to other seats, at which point, luckily, someone showed us where to sit.\n\nThe entire theme of this place is like, inside a barn or something. \"Western Cowboy\" or something like that.  Lots of wood, lots of steaks and meats, and people dressed 'country' style or something like that. People were wearing boots and I don't think it was because they were outside hanging out with the cow.\n\nThe food was pretty good. People complain about their meat not being done like they ordered it, but for the love of dog, you're sitting in a giant barn and there's a cow outside - the strangest thing going on here isn't your meat being cooked a bit off.\n\nThe service was ok - they weren't busy at the time, but when we needed a spoon to dish out the sides with, that took about 5 minutes, which isn't a long time, but it feels like a long time when you've got food sitting in front of you. I'm also not saying the waitress didn't have something better to do - she did a good job - I don't know what was going on during those 5 minutes. Might have been problems with the cow or something. Just saying - it wasn't speedy.\n\nBut hey, the place has a great view. I'd say to check it out, but it's not the kind of place I'd bring a date unless I was already drunk. More of a family place or maybe there's some whole kind of country-western thing I don't know about, so if you're into that you might like checking it out too.

We heard only great things about this place and wanted to experience their 'unforgettable' steak dishes. That, we did, unfortunately. \n\nThe restaurant was lovely dim-lit, adequate atmosphere for an expensive steak place. We were seated immediately and tended to by the waiting staff. The small roll of bread and two kinds of butter were good but insufficient for four hungry souls and we polished it up right away. No one offered to bring more. Our waiter told us about the daily specials, after which we ordered food and wine. After a short wait, four large dinner plates arrived. I was the lucky one, my steak (a large  rib eye steak, ordered medium-rare which tasted very good despite two large blobs of fat) was sitting pretty in the middle of the large dinner plate. Nothing else on my plate, just the steak. I looked around at my wife's plate and couldn't believe, her fillet mignon was laying there, in the middle of the large dinner plate without anything garnishing it, be that a glaze, a leaf, a slice of whatever! At the prices asked by this restaurant, it felt like an insult to each of us to have such a poor presentation of a steak!! We asked our waiter for a side dish, mashed potatoes with Parmesan, and when they arrived, we couldn't believe it! There were no more than two scraggly potatoes turned into mashed potatoes, or about a tablespoon of mashed potatoes per person. Mind you, they tasted good, but at over $9.00 per side dish?

Flemings puts themselves out as high-end, and they charge high-end prices.  So one expects more from them than, for example, a Black Angus.\n\nNormally I wouldn't go to a high-end steak house.  Frankly between my wife and I, we can do as well or better at home.  She does a couple of different seasonings depending on her mood, and I am pretty good at grilling them.\n\nAnyway...we were invited to a seminar and the deal was they would feed us here.  Flemings does have some menu options you won't see at Black Angus, which is fine.  On this occasion I had the filet medallions (I think that's what they called them) with mashed potatoes and green beans.  Really nothing that fancy, but done properly this would be really good.\n\nFirst point...I ordered medium well.  We agreed (the waiter and I) that this meant there would be a little pink, but not much.  Just a bit.  So when it come out it's medium rare.  VERY pink.  Not even medium.  Gotta mark them down for that.  Lots of places do that, and it's annoying.  I've given up asking anyone to cook it more because it always comes back either dry or burned.  Not Flemings specifically, but any steak place.  It's like they're annoyed...\"you want it done more, I'll show you 'done more', you cretin!!\".  Instead I just live with it.\n\nFlavor-wise the filet was good.  Basic seasoning, nothing fancy.  But \"nothing fancy\" works in this case.  Nice flavor.  The potatoes were a bit cheesy, not much garlic.  They were fine.    Nothing special.  I think a bit more garlic was in order as I couldn't really detect any. The green beans I thought were a little under-cooked but I know a lot of people like that crisp snap.  The seasoning of the beans was good.  More than just a little salt, they really jazzed them up.  I liked them.\n\nSo the verdict?  Well, given how they bill themselves and what you pay I simply expect more.  I expect exciting flavors (even with potatoes), and I expect them to know what \"medium-well\" means and how to achieve it.  The meal was fine.  Even good.  But was it truly \"high-end\"?  I don't think so.  I've had high-end a few times, and this wasn't it.  So they're \"OK\", but I can't go so far as to say I'm a fan.
