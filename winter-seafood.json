I mentioned the gritty redskins of the mashed potato.  We went with appetizers she recommended.  Not good.  \n\nSeared ahi tuna: horrible flavors mixed with the rub, the prep, the tuna wasn't cool inside, the chips were not good, there was no soy sauce but there was wasabi.  NOT good.  With heartfelt advice, compare this against Outback's ahi tuna appetizer and it's no contest.  The chef should do so.  (He's a nice guy like me I hope.)  \n\nBBQ shrimp: go try Redstone's (Philly) buffalo shrimp appetizer.  It is chilled, very delicious.  This appetizer was recommended and was garbage.  The barbecue sauce was horrible, overwhelmed and left an unsavory aftertaste in both my and my clients' palate.  Gordon Food Service or Sysco BBQ sauce.  A real \"must-miss\".  \n\nCod entree was OK.  The skillet beans were too firm, too mature, they need petite green beans.  Potato skin had grit in the mashed.  Why 1 star?

It needs to be fresh and cooked correctly. Don't get the Salmon or Tuna Steak. Tuna and Salmon should be easy to get right if you just season and cook it properly. Both tasted very fishy to me. Salmon that tastes overly fishy, to me, screams \"this fish is not fresh\". Mashed potatoes are not made from real potatoes. Don't get them unless you are looking to eat boxed potatoes.

A round of Patron Margaritas were horrible.  They tasted entirely like sour mix and we couldn't even take more than two sips.  Of course, when we ask that they be taken away and replaced with shots of Patron, we were got the \"oh, you're that type,\" look and it took a while to convince the waiter that there was sincerely something wrong with the drinks.  Being used to that look, black folks often stomach bad food just to not appear to be complainers, but these drinks were horrible!  \n\nSo in the spirit of good faith, we ordered the some appetizers. Shrimp cocktail, crab bisque, and two oyster samplers.

I ordered the beet salad with warm goat cheese (was not warm at all) and shrimp and scallop linguine. Both were not unique in flavor or presentation. It was as if I made it in my own kitchen. My boyfriend enjoyed his lobster bisque and his seafood jambalya that was perfectly spicy.\n\nI do applaud the venue for offering a diverse and affordable wine list. And, with all due respect to owners, I think the atmosphere needs a serious update in character and aesthetics. Especially since other key hotels are more pleasing to the eye.

OK, I'm pretty sure Pittsburg isn't the most awesome place for sushi, but let's give it a shot! I started with the gumbo, which came out warm and kind of bland. It wasn't good at all.

Now, everyone has their own take on spicy scallop, but this was by far the furthest from what I could imagine a spicy scallop roll could be. \n\nIt was a small roll cut into 6 pieces (maki). It had a very small amount of raw scallops, which didn't taste super fresh. Then the roll was topped with the \"spicy\". I can't identify exactly the spices that were on top, but I've had this type of spice combination on other Japanese dishes. So I know it's an off the shelf thing. Basically, this was the worst roll I could imagine.\n\nSo all-in-all, the food was sub-par at best. And the entire menu was overpriced.

We were a party of 12. Even though the restaurant was busy, they were able to get us a table. Apparently there is a second floor room that can be rented out for parties, but they don't take reservations. \n\nThe interior of the building is nicer than I thought, judging from the outside and other Yelp reviews. They have a lot of large televisions, which would make this an ideal spot for watching a game. \n\nOur server was very pleasant and friendly, but some of the staff has that native Pittsburgher gruffness, which some people might translate as rude. There do seem to be some staffing problems, though. A latecomer to our group asked another waitress clearing a nearby table if she was our waitress. The woman said \"no\" and walked away without offering to get our server. It was a little weird. Our waitress also had people at the other end of the table yell their lunch orders, even though it was very loud. She could have easily walked over, so that was odd, too. \n\nNot being in the mood for fish, I ordered the white pizza. It was very large, much bigger than I expected. I ended up taking the leftovers with me, and it fed me for two more meals. So, while the prices are a little more than you'd expect to pay at a similar restaurant, many of the portions are huge. Two people could easily split the fish sandwich.\n\n The pizza was pretty good, with a paper-thin crust and plenty of tomatoes and pungent garlic. I think the garlic was from a jar. The cheese was a tangy blend. \n\nAll of Roland's pizzas are oven-fired, and some of my pieces of crust were burned black.

It was pretty empty; a few early drinkers at the bar and a few couples seated at tables. I ordered a bloody mary which honestly tasted weird, so I'm not sure what was going on there. For food, we ordered clam chowder, a hot lobster roll, and a fish sandwich. The clam chowder was really tasty with good consistency and was a huge serving, much larger than we expected. The hot lobster roll was rich, buttery, and warm, and the lobster was good and fresh. The fish sandwich was gigantic... two huge fillets breaded and fried with tons of french fries.

In other words, this place oozes of old money, but you don't have to dress to the nines in order to enjoy service here; as long as you don't dress like you're about to attend a GWAR concert, you won't be denied service.\n\nOur attentive waitress, Beth, could not have been more instrumental in helping us decide what to eat. I was jonesing for a good red wine, but I wasn't much in the mood to down an entire bottle on my own (my wife doesn't like red wine, and I don't like white, so that negates our wine choosing); she recommended a rich and full-bodied Rioja by the glass, so smooth and elegant that I would have enjoyed another glass were I more inclined to do so.\n\nWe started with the prosciutto-wrapped mozzarella, lightly sauteed and garnished with fresh basil and vine tomatoes. Absolutely lovely, and the prosciutto is from Parma, and not the poser variety most restaurants and delis try to pawn off on you. The crostinis were a delight as well. My wife also enjoyed a wedge salad with a tangy blue cheese dressing.\n\nAs for the main event, my wife chose the lobster and crab-stuffed shrimp; think of this as looking akin to a stuffed tomato, lightly glazed and very delicious. I went for the steak Au Poivre, rubbed with peppercorns and served with a cognac (Courvoisier?) sauce. Oh. My. GOODNESS! Tender, with a swift bite to it, thanks to the peppercorns. We shared a neatly-prepped side of sauteed spinach, and the parmesan truffle fries; this was perhaps the only disappointment, as the fries seemed to lack the prerequisite amount of parmesan so as to not make the fries taste like, well, fries.\n\nWe topped off our gastric orgy with an off-the-menu layered carrot cake, large enough for two. There was no way we could finish it, but, man, we gave it our best.\n\n$180 for dinner? Yeah, so what?

So delish. That said, why not have two and really kick up your heels?\n\nStarters: I realize that shrimp cocktail might be considered a boring choice, but with jumbo shrimp and cocktail sauce with a kick, you'll be happy you choose this route. The mixed green salad with champagne vinegarette and the tomato mozzarella salad are also great starters (but you may want to split the later as it's quite large).\n\nMain course: I don't eat red meat, but everyone I've dined with says that Capital Grille has the best steaks around. The salmon is also very good, and the portion size ridiculous; you'll definitely have some to take home.\n\nSides: you must have the creamed spinach. Even if you abhor spinach you will love this dish (which tells you just how healthy it is). The asparagus and mashed potatos are also solid side choices.\n\nDessert (my favorite course): get the cheesecake; you will not regret it. The top is torched like creme brulee and it comes with whip cream and berries. I've also had some of their  homemade ice cream (mint), and it was very good as well. The chocolate cake is very rich, but with a bit of ice cream on top, the perfect chocolately end to your evening.\n\nThey have a very helpful slew of valet attendants out front for free parking, so defintiely plan to use them. It's just not worth it to try to find a spot on your own, especially if you're going uptown on the weekend for dinner (at which point, you should definitely make a reservation). \n\nIf you're looking for great food, service, and to save a little money, this is the place to choose when perusing the restaurant week menu.

Creme brulee to finish up and the chocolate espresso cake to go since my friend doesn't care for dessert, was a great ending to the meal.\n\nWith the gift card and the restaurant week pricing it made this meal with 4 glasses of wine and 2 cocktail about $43 pre tip.

The lights were set to a low romantic level and the place was buzzing with a sophisticated crowd. \n\nWhen we walked in and I got over the romantic candle lights flickering lazily in the dining area. The hosts and hostess were super attentive and We told them we had reservations. We were told there was still going to be a wait.,which I figured may be the case for restaurant week. They had some chairs to the side so we sat to the wayside, and watched a couple people get sat before us who came in after us. I went up and asked them for a menu and they realized we had been there for a bit. The hostess was great, and she put us at the top of the list to be sat. She apologized and we were fine. After we sat down we ordered, and the food came out in great time. \n\nHe ordered the 8 oz Kona Parmesan steak for his meal and I had the Salmon. The sides that came with these meals were spinach and mashed potatoes. Now, I've said that many places were good, and I've given many 5 star reviews, but MY GOD I think they should make an exception for even more stars for some places. \n\nWhen I took that first taste of my salmon... time stopped as my taste buds exploded.

We told him he didn't have to do that because we did have the one drink, but he insisted and said it would make his night to make this right for us. WOW!!!

This time around we made reservations to partake in their Restaurant Week menu, and it is the most affordable way to experience one of the better restaurants in the area.\n\nThe Capital Grill may be a chain, but it definitely doesn't feel like it. From the interior decor to the service to the actual food, everything screams upscale fancy-smancy...not something that is usually associated with a chain. We made reservations (highly recommended) and were seated almost immediately.\n\nOur server was very friendly and brutally honest. I guess she was forced to try to upsell us a $17 glass of wine but then told us how ridiculous it is and we shouldn't bother with it. When we did choose a bottle of wine she detoured us to a different bottle that was the same price but was more well-received. I'm glad we went with her recommendation because it ended up being an awesome bottle that we would have overlooked otherwise. \n\nFor the first course of the Restaurant Week menu I had the New England Clam Chowder. I am a sucker for clam chowda and this stuff was great. It wasn't overly heavy with cream and had a ridiculous amount of succulent clam chunks in it. This chowda definitely didn't skimp on the seafood, and the clams, potatoes and bacon were all melded nicely for some of the best I've had in awhile. The missus got the field green salad which was very nice, and came with an excellent champagne dressing that worked very well with the veggies. I was almost a little jealous of her salad, but I had chowder in front of me, so that feeling didn't last long.\n\nThe Restaurant Week menu was decent for entrees, with a few steak options as well as a chicken and salmon. I ordered the 14oz bone-in sirloin and this was one of the most magnificent steaks I've had in the Queen City. It was cooked to a perfect medium rare just as I ordered it, and it was a tender, juicy, tasty steak with an excellent beef flavor. It was such a huge steak that I only ate half and saved the rest for a leftover dinner the next night! \n\nThe missus had the Citrus Glazed Seared Salmon. It was a very nice piece of salmon that wasn't overpowering, and the glaze was really tasty. Her plate also came with some roasted asparagus that were cooked perfectly and had a nice sauce drizzled on top. Our table was also served shared side dishes of mashed potatoes and green beans. The potatoes were crazy rich, creamy and delicious, and there were still a few nice lumps mixed within the majority of the velvety mass, making these potatoes freaking awesome. The green beans were also tasty, and were tossed with tomatoes to give it a little extra pop.\n\nFor dessert we both shared the Cheesecake and Flourless Chocolate Espresso Cake. The cheesecake was actually more like a mousse, and so it was light as opposed to dense. It tasted wonderful and the top is caramelized to give it a crisp bite. It was served alongside a few berries and strawberry glaze, which made one delicious mouthful. The chocolate cake was just as good, if not slightly better. The espresso flavor is very light so if you're not a coffee fan don't be afraid to give this a whirl. The consistency of the cake was more like a chewy fudge, making it extremely decadent. \n\nThe Capital Grill is the place to go, so long as you have to cash. The food is all excellent and I would love to go back and try some other stuff out. The ambiance, service and food all scream swank, and it definitely feels like it warrants the extravagant price tag.", "business_id": "CChwRoYVXA3QZulS8a6xOQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-01-19", "type": "review"}

There were 5 of us. Let me just say, it was incredible. I've done the Restaurant Week thing before on numerous occasions and, it's very easy to come across servers and restaurants that are focused on getting you in and out as quickly as possible. This was absolutely not the case here.\n\nBeing that it was Restaurant Week, there was a set menu for us to choose from. Unfortunately, there was not a vegetarian option (my fiancee is vegetarian), however the server spoke with the chef and they were able to come up with an incredible vegetarian pasta that she loved. The server was very conscious to avoid any soups that had a meat broth as well. In addition, at no point were any of our water glasses ever empty, every interaction with the server was met with a smile, and what's more important, we never felt rushed. The server found out that it was my dad's birthday, and brought him a cheesecake with a candle for dessert (complementary). \n\nAs for the food, I can say that this was without a doubt the best steak I've ever had. The filet was so tender and cooked perfectly! For some perspective, I've eaten at Ruth's Chris, Del Friscos, and several other high-end steakhouses in addition to working at a very high-end country club. Capital Grille blew all of them out of the water. \n\nI truly can't say enough about our experience.

They are about half the price, but more importantly the quality of the meat is superior. Fresh Market filets are tender, almost buttery (not to mention consistent, we've grilled a good half dozen times with similar results). It's nice to have someone cook for you once in awhile, but really I'd choose quality every time over being served something that's just OK while being overcharged.  My husband enjoyed his lobster bisque and the lobster mac and cheese had several large chunks of lobster that were tender and perfect. My tomato salad came with underripe overly thick slices of tomato on top (which generally made the whole thing look unnappetizing). I'd say it's a reasonable request that if a tomato salad is offered you'd better have ripe tomato, otherwise perhaps not bother offering as a menu item. Under the thick slices there were some very tasty red, gold, and chocolate colored grape tomatoes that had marinated in the balsamic nicely- those were really good and I did enjoy that part.

I wanted to leave when we were not received for about 10 minutes, but we gave them some time to realize there were customers up front. After someone in the kitchen finally noticed us, we were seated at a table, with no menus... Then, our waiter introduced himself, took away extra silverware, and gave us no menus. We asked... Should we get out own menus? He said he would get us some. He then proceeded to chat with some waiter buddies in plain view. Since the restaurant was almost completely empty, it looked like we were interrupting a break. After several minutes of chit-chat, the waiter finally delivered some menus (how hard is that?). Perusing the menu, it was clear the Palm doesn't believe in meals, which I guess is because meals are... gauche. You can order a steak for $45, but you won't get a salad or a side unless you buy a separate $8 plate of veggies or $8 salad. I just couldn't believe a 9 oz. piece of meat would be worth that much (plus, I'd rather a 6 oz. filet). So, we ordered the Veal and Chicken Parm. (~$35), which do not come with any noodles unless you pay $4 extra (thus bringing the Parms. up to ~$40). I also ordered a coffee, which was just OK, and asked for a bread basket, which was room temperature and less enjoyable than the Mimi's bread basket. On the plus side, the entrees were excellent, and had there been half as much Chicken Parm., a vegetable, and some well-prepared noodles or potatoes, I wouldn't have felt so ripped off. As is, two chicken breasts was way too much chicken and too little fine dining. In addition, the lighting in the restaurant was not very romantic/intimate, and there was a noticeable lack of ambiance. We managed to escape from the restaurant for $110 total (no salads, no desserts, no alcohol), for a meal that was less enjoyable than many $60 meals ($30 per person) we've enjoyed at other restaurants (with at least 1 salad, 1 dessert, and 1 glass of wine). If someone else had been paying the bill, I had ordered the lacking sides, and I had never seen the price, I may have had a better experience, but the service and ambiance still were nothing to write home about.

There are just too many other choices out there for this kind of money and even less.  Not quite sure what the target market is for this place.  Pricing, menu, and wait staff lean toward fine dining, but the place has the look and feel of theme joint.  We sat in a room with 6 tables, no less than 4 wait staff attending.  Five tables were dressed and well-mannered and one table, parents with what could have been twin girls late 20's early 30's, definitely sisters sitting with dad in a t-shirt, all loud, and I'm fairly certain, all drunk.  None of the staff said a word to these people even after the table behind us dropped a subtle hint to the waiter. \n\nSure, the food is better than most restaurants per-se, but for that amount of dinner bill, comparatively it isn't good at all.  I can name five places off the top of my head that are 3 times the food and 10 times the dining experience for the same or less.  \n\nI went specifically for the swordfish which l read on the trip advisor menu but wasn't on the actual menu.  No bother to update that menu to reflect current menu omissions.  I am however contributory to that since a little more research on my account would have turned up the online menu from their site which is up to date.  \n\nI settled for the veal martini which was fairly flavorful but over kill on the basil.  The veal was tough also.  My daughter had the filet.  She was struggling cutting it in which our waiter literally came over and cut it for her and he struggled a bit himself.   It was daughter's night out so I just let it go with a soft smile.   I'm not a filet person, but it is the only cut my wife and younger son order.   We were at Sullivan's and she just about cut her filet with her fork.  Capital Grille two weeks ago, my son, same thing.  \n\nI gave it a poor rating based on the demographics of the market.  For 58.00 my daughter has to get red faced because the waiter jumped in to help her cut her meat like a she's 6 years old. (She's 15; God forbid Dad help never mind the waiter) And for 42.00 my wife can cut hers with a fork and my son the same thing for 44.00 and neither place had loud rude people in t-shirts!  If a $48.00 probably choice cut filet, $9.50 quasi caesar salad, $13.00 asparagus, $36.00 tough veal dish, wasn't enough, I had two 8oz diet cokes at $4.25 each!

There are different stations for custom eggs/omelets, meats, soup, desserts, seafood, cheese, fruits, etc.  Unfortunately the buffet area is in a small area, so it gets pretty cramped when you are getting your food. Waiting in line for food is something that makes me quite uncomfortable and medieval.\n\nThe tapas menu is probably the best thing about the brunch, as they will bring you small dishes of breakfast and seafood options.\n\nIn terms of quality, the prepared food, like the tapas and omelet station are quite good.  Aside from that, the mass prepared food is pretty average. The breads and dessert are below average, since they are both dry and flavorless. I think I would have been satisfied if the whole meal for two was less than $30, but sadly it was about double the price.\n\nFor the value, I do not think I would return for the brunch.", "business_id": "BOp3jcpYy31M85H1DLnEEw", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-12-12", "type": "review"}

I loved the menu that they posted online.  Me, Sweetie and 2 friends booked a reservation.  I called up and making a reservation was a snap, no problem. \n\nI have been to Upstream 2 times B.Y (Before Yelp), and thought it was just OK so it hasn't been on my radar.  I'm not a huge fan of crowds and Phillips Place is crowded. I was happy that they offered valet parking so I don't have to deal with parking.  \n\nThe menu was a bit confusing to start since it was their full menu with various upcharges for certain items.  Deal is for $30.00 and you could choose an appetizer, entr\u00e9e and dessert.  The waitress was very nice and explained everything and was upfront about the upcharges.  So, for example if you wanted an appetizer of the crab cakes it was an additional $4.00.  I got it now.....\"It's a profit deal\" (Steve Martin, The Jerk).\n\nI started with the Lobster Bisque which was served lukewarm, borderline cold.  It wasn't good.  The bowl that they served it in was hotter than the soup.  Me and my friend sent it back and it was returned just as lukewarm so we forged ahead.  It was just OK in my opinion, it didn't have any lobster in it and was creamy enough but I've had better.  Maybe they cheapened it for Restaurant week?\n\nThe Sake Marinated Sea Bass was on my radar from looking online at the menu and in a last minute decision I opted for the flounder.  I'm glad I did.  So, it was flounder, nicely grilled sitting on top of a black truffle risotto.  This was excellent.  The fish was nicely prepared and seasoned.  The risotto would have made Gordon Ramsey proud.  It was probably one of the best risottos I've had, flavorful not watery and the light sauce on top perfectly complimented the fish.  Sweetie opted for the Sea Bass for a $12.00 upcharge.  She didn't think it was all that great and it was drowned in marinade which was a bit gross.  It was flavorful, but frankly a good sea bass should be treated better IMO.\n\nI got the cheesecake for dessert which frankly, wasn't all that great.  It was clumpy and served with some dry granola or something with some golden raisins.  It needed a sauce of some sort.  I decided to save the calories and bring it home for my daughter.....she'll eat anything.  \n\nAll in all, it was worth it to go for the entr\u00e9e.  The goal of Restaurant Week IMO is to expose you inexpensively to places you don't generally go to.  I'm glad I went back and may try Upstream again soon to see if it's worth the trip.  It's been a round for a while and there's probably a good reason.", "business_id": "BOp3jcpYy31M85H1DLnEEw", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-01-19", "type": "review"}

We had the artichoke hearts, crab puffs, and escargots for appetizers.  I didn't get the sense that the seafood was fresh.  Rather it was definitely of the frozen variety.  And everything was made with frozen puff pastry.  Even the escargot were covered with puff pastry. I think it was to cover for the frozen seafood?  Anyway, the appetizers reminded me of Pinterest recipes.  \n\nA big red flag for me is when there are too many components in a dish.  That usually means that the ingredients aren't good enough to stand out on their own or the chef doesn't know how to edit.  I think we experienced a little of both.  \n\nMy husband and I both got the special. It was a blackened pork tenderloin with shrimp accompanied by mushrooms in a sherry sauce with red potatoes.  Each component sounded good.  However, the presentation and preparation was a train wreck.  \n\nThe tenderloin came on skewers.  What?  The shrimp were over cooked.  The meat and shrimp were served in a jumble of quartered red potatoes and mushrooms.  Everything was covered in some sort of Cajun seasoning that was reminiscent of Durkee or McCormick.  Then it was all topped with some sort of cornstarch thickened sherry sauce.  The whole thing tasted like it was straight off the Sysco truck  and reheated. \n\nOne of our companions ordered the filet.  She let us have a taste, and the steak was good.  But it came with a buerre blanc dipping sauce.  I'm not sure what chef would pair buerre blanc with steak to begin with, but just like my meal, it was clear that the buerre blanc was another corn starch imposter.  \n\nDessert was a dark chocolate creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e.  It was dry and pedestrian.  \n\nReally I think this place deserves 2.5 stars, but Yelp doesn't do half stars, so I'll be generous.  Lousiannes clearly has a loyal customer base and is a popular place.  I would definitely go back for the cocktails and even the appetizers because the price point wasn't outrageous for all the puff pastry and I could still enjoy them now that I know what to expect.  \n\nBut I would not return for dinner.  If I'm going to spend $30 for an entree, I expect fresh ingredients, sauces made to order, and a chef that knows how to cook.  Madison has too many restaurants that offer far superior food to Lousiannes, and that's what will drive my future dining decisions.", "business_id": "koRLvzIl-4fCybOIdk56jA", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-12-16", "type": "review"}

Yes, please!\n\nFirst, I'd like to clarify that the sandwich is NOT as big as other reviews may make it out to be. It's a standard French roll with a standard amount of fillings BUT the flavors are admittedly some of the best I've ever had.

What a cornucopia (nods to Candice G.) of beautifully tasty french creole goodness all nestled magically in compartmentalized order without any compartments in the take-out box. It traveled several miles successfully in the manner as well. The warnings of the menu and lady at the counter on the spiciness of the dirty rice and shrimp creole were accurate. It was a flavorful, creeping sort of spice that increased with each bite. Absolutely fantastic.\n\nThe name \"take-out\" is rather misleading because there is ample seating inside the place and many interesting jazz memorabilia to peruse over while eating so eat-in instead of taking-out as the name suggests.\n\nI'll definitely be making a stop here again whenever I'm in the Madison area for some good ol' N'Orleans style cookin'.", "business_id": "cpGv6ES2hzPCtCUQgipwXw", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-01-08", "type": "review"}

It was surprisingly busy for a weeknight, but the wait for a table was still longer than it should have been. Multiple tables at empty within view, but apparently they were low on wait staff so couldn't seat us.  That was frustrating. \nOnce seated, or waitress friendly and the bright spot of the evening.  The food and drinks are high priced, at least compared to typical restaurants like this. The beer selection was very poor.  No local taps are offered. The cheddar biscuits were heavily salted, almost to much to handle. We had the crab linguini, and it to was overly salted. The crab couldn't even be treated, as the salt overwhelmed everything.  We had a lobster tail that was rubbery and also lacked flavor, except for salt.  All the food was terribly disappointing.

We were first given a bowl of chips and salsa.  The salsa looked like a mix between red and green salsa, and since I have a weird aversion to green salsa, I hesitantly tried it.

Holy crap, it was delicious.  The garlic sauce for my shrimp covered everything, from the beans and rice to the secret fries beneath the shrimp (which magically didn't get soggy).  My fiance said his fish was the best he's ever had in America.  Mine also came with tortillas (I chose flour), and they were great, like the kind my mom bought from the \"tortilla lady\" back home.\n\nWe were so full we couldn't move afterward, but I woke up in the morning craving the garlic sauce again...\n\nThe place is small and quaintly decorated, like something you might find in a small town.

Favorites include Seven Seas Soup, Camarones Culichi, and of course their ceviche, which comes in several varieties.

I must say, I got the better of the trade! The green chile sauce was nothing short of orgasmic; just fantastically deliciously awe-inspiringly good. I could eat that sauce on a shoe and be happy.

I came solo with my two kids we got settled and the server took our drink order. He seemed less than enthusiastic about giving any suggestions other than the house margarita that was on special. I took him up on his suggestion and got what I expected. A standard run of the mill house marg which I poured some of my corona in to change it up. I  went with the 6oz sirloin and half rack of ribs. The steak was ok, low expectations from a chain. The ribs on the other hand were comparable to jerky. Over cooked and under sauced. This was my servers suggestion to get the ribs. I know this guy has never tried these ribs because if he had it would be the last thing out of his mouth. I can get a meal at hundreds of establishments.

Julio prepared the first two, while Roberto prepared the crab.  I was fortunate enough to ask Roberto what he was going to substitute the * w/.  He said he could use radishes and yamagobo (pickled burdock; looks like julienned carrots).  Had I not said anything, I may have been disappointed w/ the crab roll as I was w/ the other two rolls...

Had leftovers packed, then decided I'd say something to Leo, who was kind enough to comp. one of the entrees.  Fair enough, since I ate the equivalent of one.

I hadn't been to Fish Market in four years until I went twice in the last 2 weeks. It's my friend's favorite, but he's a big fan of their sushi happy hour, of which I was skeptical. Both times (on a Friday and a Saturday) this place was hopping.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, the host had flubbed our reservation, but was super apologetic and hooked up some free appetizers, when there was really no need.  The crab and bay shrimp cocktail was just alright, but the ginger lime prawns with cilantro sauce was savory and stellar in its own right -- they should make that an entree.   Last but not least were the calamari fritte, which my friend remarked was the best in town.  You be the judge though. For dinner I ordered the misoyaki glazed scottish atlantic salmon with grilled veggies.  For what I thought was a small portion the taste of the fish made me forget about portion size, and who am I kidding? - I was stuffed on appetizers!\n\nLast Friday I had the happy hour sushi and was impressed, especially with the Senorita roll. This $18 roll is pricey but at it's $9 happy hour price is well worth it. The crab roll covered in tuna sits in a sweet eel sauce and garnished with sriracha sauce on top. It's a heavenly mixture of spicy/sweet, east meets west. Their $4 house chardonnay is a great value as well. The setting of the happy hour bar and the mixing and mingling of patrons makes it obvious that this is a regulars sort of place.\n\nCriticisms?  Very little, except to say don't go expecting to be wowed with ambiance.  The look is nautical and fish markety - hence the name. Dur. I love the fact that they actually sell fish, but on second thought, who the hell buys any at $19/pound?

We like it so much we go there for our anniversary every year and since the first year we have always sat in a \"snug\" which is a private booth with a curtain so you can have a nice quiet meal with your dining guest.\n\nThe food is always fantastic and I always leave stuffed and satisfied.  I always order seafood (usually fish) and my seafood-averted sig other usually gets steak.  I think it can be romantic if you're dining in the snugs, but if you're out with the rest of the diners it's just another nice dining room and can be a little on the loud side.  We have no complaints and will continue the anniversary dinners and more.\n\nTheir happy hour is fantastic.  The drink specials aren't anything to write home about, but the food is worth the trip.  The burger seems to always be around and I recommend the fish tacos if they show up as well.  I've never had any bad meals and the ever-changing menu keeps us coming back for more.  I've had many, many desserts and they are all fantastic.  The creme brulee is a solid choice and the flourless chocolate cake with raspberry sauce is as sinful and decadent as it sounds.  The wine list is somewhat short when it comes to \"by the glass\" offerings, but I never have a problem finding one I like.\n\nAnother little-known perk is their Preferred Guest Membership.  You are awarded points for every dollar you spend.  If you are a frequent visitor like myself, then it's worth it.  Otherwise, it could take far too many happy hours to rack up enough points for anything substantial.  The best part - it's free.  Details are on their website.\n\nI've also been to two other locations in Seattle and Bellevue and have had great experiences there as well.

($4.95) and our drinks...(no discounts on the drinks.. but who really cares) \n\nWhen the food arrives, the burgers were cooked well ( no choice, offered, but heard that they normally come out pink...so did'nt even ask) .. with a generous side of fries ketchup, onion, lettuce and tomatoe. The tiny side of Russian dressing set my bud back $1.25.. but he said worth every shilling! \n\nThe Panko crusted zuks,, great... no lemon, but a small side of ranch... I understand the Shrimp quesadilla was ok... but not the favorite of the diner. \n\nAll in all... I'd come back with buds in tow. I think for the $20.00 I spent tonight for 2 Skyy and tonic and \"Angus\" burger was totally worth it. \n\nThe website has a much different menu for the bar food with accolades from 2005.. shame that they are counting on that to draw customers.

Kept forgetting that we had a $150 card from AmEx. This was our first visit to a location in the Phoenix area, we had been to the location in Columbus, Ohio several times and always enjoyed our meal and experience. This was no different. \n\nFor apps my wife had Lobster and Crab bisque, crab was very fresh lumb crab on top of a little tower of rice. Lobster bisque was poured over table side. Flavor was wonderful and I loved the texture of the bisque. Next up was oyster sampler, 4 oysters of the day. All tasted very fresh, my only issue was some shell pieces in one of the oysters (quite a few pieces) it happens when shucking, but it was quite a few pieces. We then had the Tuna Tartar (chopped Ahi with capers, peppers, onions, dijoin and egg) served table-side with some crisps. This by far was my favorite of the apps that we had. Flavors jumped in my mouth and the crisps had a great texture to compliment the tartar. \n\nNext up was our entrees. My wife ordered the Pancetta wrapped scallops and I had the Crab, Shrimp and Brie stuffed Salmon. We also ordered a mushroom risotto for the table. I had some of my wifes dish and the scallops had been cooked very well, charbroiled just right to give the ham some texture and the scallops had absorbed the fat and flavor. Very yummy. The side with hers was a sauteed spinach that was very flavorful with wine and garlic and not over cooked. My dish was very good, could not really taste the crab, brie and shrimp as much as i would have liked... this was due to much sauce being poured over the fish. Besides that the fish was cooked perfect and I liked the side cut presentation for the stuffing. Fish was mid-rare as requested and I was happy with the dish. The risotto for the table was pretty much standard fare for risotto in most places, I was very happy that it was not overcooked and mush. \n\nOverall our experience was very nice and I will return in the future even without a gift card. One thing I would like to point out compared to our several visits at the Columbus location is that the drink menu was alot smaller, my wife always enjoy trying a bunch of the bar drinks since they use really fresh ingredients and make their own syrups. We had been used to like 6-8 page menu and here it was only 2. \n\nSo overall I recommend the location and next time we will try the Scottsdale location and see if maybe they have a bigger menu.", "business_id": "MU3i2uEyUBntebU6pEyMbw", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-12-21", "type": "review"}

But while going through a pile of mail I had set aside as junk, I found a $50 off postcard from AM-EX to Capital Grille. We decided to give it a try and save Mastro's for another time.\n\nThe service was fantastic. Our waiter, Reuben, was just the right amount of attentive (I hate being asked after practically every bite if everything is ok), and the other staff was also excellent.\n\nWe got a basket of bread to start, which also held some matzo-like crackers. Don't pass by the dark bread- I thought it was regular pumpernickel at first, but it had a wonderful crust with a soft and slightly fruity center- totally unexpected and delicious. We also received an amuse- a great little bruchetta topped with micro greens.\n\nI ordered the caprese salad which was good, especially the yellow tomato slice, but I have had better mozzarella at Cibo. Hubby had the French Onion soup which came with a ridiculous amount of torch-melted cheese on top. The soup itself had great flavor (one of the best I've had), but could have been a little hotter for my taste. Hubby liked it the way it was.\n\nFor our entrees, Hubby got the Kona crusted sirloin (which was rubbed with a blend of decaf coffee powder, cocoa, and cinnamon) with shallot butter. He really enjoyed the flavor, although about half of his steak was really much more medium than medium rare. To me, the flavor was unexpected- I thought I would taste any one of the rub flavors before I tasted the steak, as they are all strong flavors. That was not the case, however- it was a subtle yet complex addition to the beef. I had the classic Delmonico rib-eye. Mine was perfectly done and quite tasty, although I must say that I have enjoyed my rib-eye at Bobby Q's every bit as much. The sides were fine- we tried the mushroom mix and the lobster mac n' cheese. We have been spoiled by our CraftSteak hen-of-the-woods mushroom ecstasy experience, so all else pales in comparison. I expected more from the mac- it was sort of mild and bland. I'm not sure what it needed- something that wouldn't overwhelm the lobster, but something nonetheless. Because we wanted to try a dessert, we took home plenty of food (the sides are large, and all share-able by 2-4 people).\n\nWe shared the coconut cream pie, which again was more than enough for two. It was in a tart style with a sugar cookie type crust, topped with a layer that we felt had cream cheese in it, then a layer of custard cream, covered by a mountain of fresh whipped barely sweetened cream and toasted coconut flakes. It was really delicious. The house blend coffee was truly outstanding, without even a hint of acidity. Hubby added Frangelico to his, and it was so good and rich that it did not need the cream he would have otherwise added. \n\nAll in all, Capital Grille gave us a very pleasant dining experience (aside from a couple of wasted chicks who were way too loud), and very good food.", "business_id": "QdbZyl-LWFS54u93Vjd5SA", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-01-19", "type": "review"}

It's my favorite spot for a great steak and large selection of wines. I judge a steakhouse by trying the Rib-Eye. Capital Grill only serves \"Prime\" and yes, you do pay the price. This is not a \"cheap date\", and has become one of special occasion spots...anniversary, birthday etc. \n\nThe Rib-Eye here has the perfect marbleization and has always been cooked to perfection. Sandra K usually has the Filet, and has never been disappointed.\n\nBut I better mention the Lobster Bisque soup before detailing the steaks and sides. It is like a special sunset. Dazzling light, luminescent colors and a special moment. Not sure how's it's made...but to die for flavor.\nSalads are exceptional, except I usually go for the soup, but when I'm thinking healthy, I have the wedge or Caesar, or on occasion the bacon spinach. All worth mentioning.\n\nBack to the steaks, again, I am a Rib-Eye fan but I have had The Dry Aged Steak Au Poivre with a Courvasier Cream Sauce. This steak is rubbed with crushed peppercorns and \"seared\" to lock in the juices. The cream sauce is such a delight. Don't mix the Lobster Bisque and this steak unless you want a decadent evening. \n\nBy the way, don't lke beef? Try the Double Cut Lambchops...fabulous! Seafood, I can't get myself to order seafood at a Steak House, unless I have Steak and Lobster/Crab. Then again, I get my Lobster fix with the soup or the appetizers.\n\nSides....This is why I like to take a group here. The sides are all \"shareable\" although there are several here that I don't want my companions to take too much. Parmesan Truffle Fries....ouch on the flavor scale (and other scales). Lobster and Mac N Cheese, again, I get my seafood on the side, this one is decadent to the power of 10 and one of my all time favorites are the AuGratin potatoes. To impress my guests, I will order a vegetable to share and it's usually the creamed spinach or asparagus. But sliding into decadence here means I throw out the rules of engagement and if I going to sin....here I am going to sin big, and that means dessert as well.\n\nCoconut Cream Pie or Key Lime Pie at a fine dining spot contrast the other offerings of Flourless Chocolate Expresso Cake and Berries and Cream. Go for it.\n\nI have had intimate dining here with Sandra K and most recently, hosted a luncheon for 60 persons in a private setting. Service has always been impeccable and the food is distinguished.", "business_id": "QdbZyl-LWFS54u93Vjd5SA", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-01-10", "type": "review"}

I cannot even begin to tell you!! ARGH! I'm getting ahead of myself... *deep breath* Let me begin...\n\nIt was Resturant Week and me and my neighbor Sharrita chose to come here for a couple of reasons: Meat and Creme Brulee. What ever homesick girl needs to feel better. :)\n\nWe entered the very clean and classy and dare i say it - swanky setting with their hostesses who ware blazers and they were very welcoming and were very glad to seat a yelper. (they asked how I heard about Resturant Week when I called for reservations) Our waiter - dang I can't remember his name! he was so attentative and had one of those table sweeper type thingies and he recommended I try the best drink of the night - the Stoli Doli. Fresh pineapple stewed with Stoli vodka for atleast a WEEK before it's dispensed for sweet drink lovers (like me) smooth, delicious and slightly sweet. I was in love. \n\nWe had standard salads, nothing to write yelp about. I had the Filet Mingon and she had this steak that was sliced in half (if I remember) it came with veggies, again nothing to really write yelp about but everything was so yummy. The steak was well rested and cooked perfectly. I was very impressed.  \n\nOne slight issue: we saw creme brulee on the menu on  the resturant week's website but when we got to the resturant, it wasn't there - boo... but our ever amazing waiter worked it out for us! YAY!! Thank Goodness he did because it was insanely good.\n\nIf you want a place that is swank, seriously fancy (I'm from the rez okay - so this is crazy fancy in my world)  and has GREAT service and even better steak... this is the place for you! But you better have the cash to pay for it all! lol but if you have the money honey and a need to wine and dine then trust me sweetie Capital Grille has the time!

So the fact that I ended up at Capital Grille for Valentine's day is actually a little embarrassing. But the combination of a $100 gift card that was about to expire, a fond memory of steak tar tar and homemade potato chips at their bar, and a failure to make any other sort of reservation landed us there at about 8pm on Sunday night. I really wasn't feeling like anything fancy, so we decided to sit at the bar, nosh, and watch the Olympics.\n\nFirst, cocktails. Mine: an expertly made Manhattan that was approximately the size of my head (hurray for oversized martini glasses!) My husbands: Hendricks, rocks, cucumber. Our bartender offered to go get cucumber slices from the kitchen as it was a garnish they typically had at the bar. Score 1 for Kevin the bartender. \n\nNext, food order. This had the potential to be the low point of the evening when they informed me they no longer had the steak tar tar on the menu. Or the ketlle chips. I now wanted to cry. We settled for a caprese salad, beef carpaccio, and the lobster crab cakes. Salad came out promptly, was very tasty and nice presentation. And then...nothing. The other apps lagged for like 15 minutes and the bartender was visibly irritated at the kitchen and wait staff. Luckily I had a full drink in front of me and it was the skating pairs short program on TV so I really wasn't complaining. When the food did show up it was actually worth the wait. Nothing I would have changed about it at all.\n\nFor the dessert portion of the evening we decided to try a Colheita port, which the bartender described as a single vintage tawny port. My husband loves tawny port and they had one that was fairly reasonable but still in the Colheita category. Rounded it out with the flourless chocolate espresso cake. Sadly, we were informed they no longer carried our port selection. And then, not so sadly, they poured us a much more expensive version for the price of the other one! Oh, and the dessert itself - freaking amazing. Best chocolate torte I've had in a while. \n\nThe actual shocker of the evening was that they took the appetizers off the bill without us saying anything about it. This really wasn't necessary but I think it shows that this place really does have class and that they wanted us to know that wasn't up to their standard of service. Well played.\n\nOh, and, right before we left the bartender leaned over and said \"Come back on a day when it isn't a holiday and we'll get the kitchen to make you some steak tar tar.  They do it for me all the time.\" Bless you, sweet bartender man. And thank you for a lovely Valentine's day.", "business_id": "QdbZyl-LWFS54u93Vjd5SA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-02-15", "type": "review"}

Had a 5:00 reservation.  Arrived about 10 minutes early and we were greeted by young hostesses with heavy make-up and just okay.  We were happy to sit in the beautiful bar (entire place is decorated wonderfully - music was upbeat, young and pretty loud).  Cops was on in the bar.  Our tender was fun.  Ordered martinis straight up, with GREAT blue cheese olives.  Good service at bar.  Got served some cold bread in a basket.  Nice variety.  But cold!  We sat there for over 20 minutes though.  Wished to be seated at table on time.\n\nTable was nice.  Servers and bussers do shuffle around and don't seem happy.  Our server was fine.  We dine at Ruth's a lot so we were happy to try a bone-in rib-eye here.  We were told that we'd find the steaks at PCG better.  Didn't turn out that way and not just because of overdone. \n\nAnother bread basket but this time it was hot.  Love the pretzle bread with big salt crystals.  \n\nInteresting that we didn't even open the menu.  What the server sugggested was what my hus. decided sounded great.  I agreed.  Nice red wine.  Lobster bisque came out pretty fast.  It was tepid.  Yuck!  Flavor was nice, lobster morsles good.  Temperature - awful!  The giant crouton it came with (same kind as bread basket) made it better.  Not enough flavor.  Just seemed to be creamy for creamy's sake.  Just a bowl of heavy cream.\n\nHeirloom tomato salad was good but the dressing was just alright.  Nice variety of tomatoes.  Was hoping for more pizazz.  \n\nPotato Au Gratin were heavily salted.  Sliced thinkly, good texture, but I like the simplicity of Ruth's potatoes better.  They were very tasty, but maybe just a little too salty.  I like to salt my own.  Neat, but not necessay to have an extra server scoop out a serving of potatoes.  No personality when doing it.  \n\nOur steaks were ordered meduim-rare.  They came out meduim.  The server asked, noticed, took out flashlight and agreed that they were both overdone.  My hus. kept his.  Hungry is his name (not really).  My new one came out pretty fast.  With my new one, came manager.  Man, was he stuffy!  He had his flashlight too and said for me to cut into it so that HE could be sure that I'd be happy with this one.  Well, it was rare, but I, too was hungry so I kept it.  I was happy to warm it up later in the broiler and then it'd be perfect.  \n\nThe meat itself was great.  Not salted or peppered at all.  Not much butter.  I love Ruth's WAY better.  I like the butter, salt and sizzle.\n\nServer comped steaks and gave us desset to go.  Overall, all our needs met.  Happy time!  Just prob. won't go back for steaks.  Ruth's and Hillstone are MUCH better.", "business_id": "QdbZyl-LWFS54u93Vjd5SA", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-12-17", "type": "review"}

Last minute anniversary idea totally worked in our favor, as we were greeted with a \"Happy anniversary!\", and led to a seemingly huge booth decorated with rose petals & cheap plastic heart pieces, which was a nice touch. \n\nThe drink selection consisted of standards like martini's and a massive wine list. We went for the basic. Dry gin martini, 3 olives. They pulled it off wonderfully, and it was shaken/poured tableside, as it should be.\n\nWe started with the calamari. They fry them up in a bready, salty batter. Almost too salty. Then, they do something awesome, and toss in chopped cherry peppers. The result is this concoction of spicy bready perfectly fried calamari. The peppers add this crazy flavor to the overall dish, which is completely unexpected and delicious. Great ratio of head vs body too. I hate it when restaurants just give me heads. I'm not afraid of tentacles! \n\nI had the sliced filet migon with cippolini onions and wild mushrooms, finished with a 12 year balsamiq reduction. Perfect crust on the steak. The saltyness of the crust brought out the juices of the meat, when combined with the reduction, resulted in a fantastic melt-in-the mouth feel.  That being said, I wish it was a little more rare.\n\nShe had the special, which was a lamb roulade filled with an herb cream cheese and wrapped in bacon. While this proved to be a winning combination of flavors, the lamb was slightly overcooked from medium rare. \n\nWe got the lobster mac and cheese, which had huge chunks of lobster. The cheese was mascarpone, which resulted in a soupier mac, but it worked well with the lobster. We also got the french green beans with heirloom tomatoes, which while tasty, wasn't anything special. \n\nFor dessert, we were brought an espresso chocolate flourless cake, finished with raspberry sauce & fresh raspberries. Rich and delicious.\n\nIn the end, it was a fantastic meal. The Capital Grille is not the best steakhouse I've ever been to though, it is a very close second. I recommend in a heartbeat.\n\nAs a p.s: The service was top notch. I even got a phone call the next day, wanting to know how the experience was.

You HAVE to love it, but it's not like the food is out of this world, the closest thing to atmosphere is watching birds chase after crumbs and you know it's not at all healthy for ya and yet...  Pete's has been in business since 1947 so it's quite an Arizona tradition to go at least a few times.\n\nPete's Fish and Chips are all around the valley, but I happen to think pretty highly of this location.  It's not far from my house so we're often running errands in the area or I can pick it up on the way home.  But also, it has more of an old-school neighborhood feel - even though you can sit at a table facing Central Ave.  Really great diverse crowd pretty much every time we go.  And so far everyone has been fairly friendly when waiting, which can be so important in a hungry crowd.\n\nPlain fish and chips are all good, as are their fish sandwiches.  Their shrimp is actually my favorite I think.  The sauce that comes with all fried goodies has some spice to it, but has enough ketchup-y ness that even the wimps at our table (cough-my girlfriend-cough-cough) can enjoy it.  They make a pretty mean burger too.  Prices are pretty cheap, though if you go hungry and think \"Wow, this is cheap!  Maybe we should also get sides of this and that too!\" it can get more expensive, but in a deep-fried-yummylishious kind of way that somehow makes it all ok. \n\nIt's generally service with a smile, but sometimes, well, folks might have gotten a bit of extra grease splashed their way or something.  It's never hurt the quality (Can I use that word here?) of the product.  \n\nAnd just to mix things up, my location at least also serves corn dogs, chicken and steak sandwiches, horchata and an assortment of Pete's goodies like bumper stickers, t-shirts and beanies.  And don't forget a quarter fed merry-go-round for the kids.  Gotta love it.", "business_id": "NXPuaH5R8rMfYqnnP5s1WA", "stars": 3, "date": "2007-02-10", "type": "review"}

My husband and I have lived in the area for 9 months or so but have always been a bit intimidated by just how much selection there is. To make matters worse, there aren't many Yelp reviews of places around here, so we keep feeling like any choice we make is uninformed. (Whatever did we do before Yelp?!) \n\nOne night, we decided to drive down Central and look for the restaurant that was the most crowded with locals. (Naturally, Poncho's was crowded but we have been there before and find it good but not particularly authentic). Las Glorias--a white and blue building with fish painted on it--was packed, so we made a mental note and decided to return. We came back on New Year's Day when it was decidedly less crowded but the food did not disappoint. In fact, it was downright delicious and this place is definitely our new local favorite. \n\nAs you can see from the pictures, this place is even more themed inside. There is kitschy nautical decor everywhere--my personal favorite is the lighthouse on the wall that lights up. This place could be covered in real barnacles, though, and I wouldn't care. The food was just that good. To start with, the tortilla chips were hot and fresh out of the oven and the salsa was perfect with the perfect consistency and flavor. \n\nFor our entrees, I got the Camarones Culichi ($12.50), and my husband got the Camar\u00f3n y Filete Empanizado ($12.50), which is essentially breaded fish and shrimp served with rice, beans and salad. My shrimp were the freshest I've had in Phoenix with a sweet flavor and firm texture and the culichi sauce (a spicy green chili cheese sauce) was creamy but spicy at the same time. Even when I had finished the shrimp, I found myself dipping chips into the sauce. Can't let something that good go to waste! My husband's fish and shrimp were also excellent, with a slightly spicy and crunchy breading. They were even better dipped in one of the provided hot sauces (don't remember the name but it had a brownish color and tasted smoky). \n\nOur experience at Las Glorias was so great the first time that we decided to order to go from there recently. It's nice that they have a website with a menu since most local Mexican places do not. That time, we sampled the Camarones a la Diabla (again, great shrimp and kickin' flavor), the Crab Enchiladas w/ green sauce (incredible flavor and not too rich, but we could have gone without the few shell pieces we encountered), and the Ceviche Tostada (super fresh and perfectly spicy and a steal at only $3). \n\nYou may have a local Mexican spot you love but there's something distinct and really wonderful about a seafood-only Mexican restaurant with eccentric decor and excellent fresh food. Venture on down Central (yes, south of downtown) and try it for yourself!", "business_id": "Bv3g-9R5wUevZPP0jzihqg", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-01-24", "type": "review"}

He spent a great deal of the night explaining where the fish was sourced, when they get their fish in, the difference between quality vs quantity ect. Once I ordered Mackrel, he told me it was from Norway, asked what other kinds of fish I liked --- Then offered me two pieces of Tuna to taste (as comparison) completely GRATIS!\n\nAlso, and I have no idea how this even happened...I was thinking out loud \"I wonder if they have fresh wasabi?\"  I see the owner walking toward me, and before I have a chance to inquire, he puts out a small bowl in front of me \"Tada!\" ...fresh wasabi!\" HOW DID HE KNOW!?\n\nThe meal continues to be amazing. The fish is super fresh (he showed me a picture on his phone of the tuna he brought in that day) and the service spectacular. These folks WILL take care of you...and make sure you leave happy.\n\nOther points of note: It was someone's birthday at the table next to me, they brought out a drum and a sang a song for her, which I thought was cute. Also, the oranges after the meal, a wonderful touch. They're cut into small segments, placed back into the orange, and served with a little toothpick to pull out each piece.\n\nThe ONLY issue: The restaurant is small, and tables crammed. But again, when we sat down at a small two seater, I think I made a face because he took our menus, and said \"let me put you here...\" and gave us a larger spot.

Whereas we were expecting some dried up rolls (made with imitation crab) on the buffet line, we were overwhelmed by the gifts of the sea we were about to receive.  The sushi chef was stationed and ready for our orders.  Yes, full size rolls ranging from the Vegas Roll to the New Mexico Roll (crab, cucumber, and avocado rolled in rice and finished with a spicy sauce, and topped with fresh tuna and lemon, garnished with smelt eggs) were there for our dining pleasure.  An assortment of plain sushi was also available, such as Salmon and Tuna.\n\nBut the wonder and awe at the generous helpings of Japanese cuisine did not stop there.  One of the buffet stations had fresh sashimi of Salmon and Tuna.  The tuna was incredibly soft and buttery, and had a beautiful texture and taste.  I could not believe it!  I easily had a half dozen pieces.  Furthermore, the salmon sashimi had great flavor, and was a decent grade - although a bit dry.  The seaweed salad tasted as good as any self respecting sushi restaurant would offer, the snow peas were just-picked fresh, accented with garlic and lemon.  Kimchee and seaweed, as well as cucumber and tofy were also available.  I had a raw oyster for my first time, as they were laid out so decoratively and invitingly - I could not resist.  Not bad once you get past the awful texture...\n\nNow on to the rest...if I only I had had four stomachs this day to try it all!\n\nThe fish was my favorite!  The Teriyaki salmon, (very flavorful but dry) Garlic halibut, (buttery and juicy, garlic sauce had a lovely sweet and sour finish) Sea bass, ( also had excellent flavor - lemony and salty, buttery and soft) Shrimp dumplings served on a sauteed onion ring, (fresh and plump) and tempura sushi rolls with avocado crab and a sweet eel sauce, also delicious. Crab legs, with drawn butter and lemon came last, and were also ideal for feasting!\n\nAnd the list goes on as I drolled over the lovely chow mein, the robust orange chicken, and flavorful chicken sesame.  The fried rice was greasy and under the heatlamp too long, but overall I could not complain.\n\nAnd then I moved on to more seafood goodness with the clams, which tasted fresh, and were served in a jalapeno scallion miso broth.\nThe Seafood scampi was excellent, buttery garlic dreaminess.  The Thai calamari (small calamari steaks, spicy!) did not suit my tastebuds, but they were appeased immediately by the delectable  walnut shrimp (tempura battered shrimp doused in a walnut dynamite sauce, wow!) and whole crawfish (impressive as the only place to get craw is AJs and costs about $40/pound.  After the crawfish I became a bit more adventurous and tried a Whelsh snail, that I had to scoop out of its beautiful, conical shell.  Wow!!!! Just like ordering snails in a bourgoise French restaurant. Surprisingly, meat was tender and flavorful, a cross between scallop and clam, but filled with a buttery garlic flavor.\n\nSo, the smorgasboard continued on, but alas my belly was filled and there was no more room.  There was a teppan/Mongolian BBQ station as well, at which you can select your own ingredients and sauces to have cooked to order - I merely sniffed at the wonderful aromas as I passed it on my way to the dessert. Of course I had room for the coconut macarron, the chocolate moussa cake, and the lemon bar.\n\nSpeaking of bar, another impressive element of Hong Kong was the extensive cocktail menu including such classics as the Singapore Sling and Great Wall of China.  Also included were sake tinis, plum wine and sake cocktails, as well as a slew of wines and sakes.  Average cost of a cocktail was $6.50.\n\nIs this a great place for groups? Yes! Could you even host a private party? Yes!  Would I return here? Yes!  Would I come here to impress a date? Dare I say...yes?", "business_id": "-Ogv7rpcgUHkFaSy3vD8Sw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-01-25", "type": "review"}

The place is the cleanest Chinese buffet in the United States unless you are obsessive compulsive.. The food is always fresh and hottest after 5:30 pm, the more people the faster it's replaced. Hands down the best Chinese buffet in Arizona. Very clean, friendly, reasonably priced. Food trays always being refilled. Have been here over 25 times with family and guests and not one complaint or issue ever. All the food is hot and tasty. Each item has it's own unique taste unlike other buffets that have all items taste the same. .whether it's fish , shrimp, spiced crab or low mein everything is very enjoyable. Unless you are looking for 5 star gourmet Chinese in a buffet you'll love the place. Lunch or dinner, both are excellent. Ask for the card , buy 10 dinners get one free. Card gets stamped for each buffet purchased. Anyone who writes anything negative about this buffet has mental issues. It's a buffet. Better than anything in NEW YORK. NEW JERSEY . FLORIDA OR ARIZONA.

Wow Freakin' Wow.\n\nI have never, ever had such a perfect dining experience from the minute they greet you, learn your name, cater to your every need, and give you FABULOUS, beautifully prepared food since...well, NEVER. \n\nI must say I did do my research, so I did know what I wanted to try and even though I kind of expected the JW Marriott to be more of a snooty place, I felt it would be closest to my house and wanted to find out for myself what all the hoopla was about this Roy person and his fish.\n\nI went with my friend Amy who was visiting from New York. She had been to Roy's before and is a fellow foodie. We got to the restaurant early and went outside on the immense patio area to sit and have a drink. It's December so a bit chilly but the HUGE, soft patio furniture was extremely cozy and we sat and had $20 martinis (LOADED with vodka. Warning: We had to ask for more fruit juice! And we are major drinkers - just gotta throw that in there.) Our waitress on the patio could not have been more accomodating and she even brought us new martinis even though we drank quite a bit of our strong ones. I am a people watcher and it was nice to see that there was an assortment of people sitting on the furniture, some of them looked like they could be relatives of mine, enjoying the late afternoon, reading, conversing....well, if I HAD any rich or classy relatives, that is. It was very nice and relaxing. Plus the Mariott property is stunning and I wish I could have looked around the property more than we did.\n\nWhen we meandered inside for dinner, the hostess greeted us by name and our server showed us to our table. She was very competent, could make recommendations, and was pleasant without being clingy. We loved her. She reminded me of Joan Cusack. Sounded just like her!\n\nThe complimentary appetizer of lightly spiced, steamed edamame was delightful and even though they gave us warmed wet washcloths we were complete heathens and ate with our hands without ever using them.\n\nWe shared the Roy's Canoe for Two, which had Lobster potstickers, Beef Satay, shrimp on a stick (not its real name), and Tuna Sushi Rolls. I must say - the Lobster potstickers - better than sex. The Beef satay was basically this ultra-tender beef on a stick, lightly flavored and grilled. Fabulous. But the pinnacle of perfection here was the Tuna sushi rolls, which absolutely knocked our socks off. I have never, ever had such an amazing piece of sushi before that moment. I think our  server, Joan Cusack (Not her real name) thought I was choking because as I ate it, my eyes were rolling back into my head in ecstacy.  She bustled over and once she got closer she could see she was merely interrupting a very intimate moment with me and my tuna roll and she went back to her post after giving me a thumbs-up sign. For whatever reason, these tuna sushi rolls were encrusted in what may have been macadamia nuts and it was completely divine. I re-live that moment over and over. MMM.\n\nBut you know, the showstopper was STILL yet to come. I could not believe my luck when my Roy's Trio was placed in front of me. It was a piece of Hawaiian butterfish in Miso sauce, a piece of Seared Ahi, and a piece of salmon. The poor salmon! It was the best salmon I ever had out, but next to those two it was like Cinderella's ugly stepsister. Just upstaged by the butterfish, which is melt-in-your mouth decadence, and the seared ahi - which surpassed the tuna roll I just got done fantasizing about as the most perfect piece of sushi EVER.\n\nAmy got the butterfish. We licked our plates clean. Amy tried my Ahi and declared it, like I did, the BEST seared Ahi on the planet.\n\nFor dessert, you KNOW I had to have the molten chocolate souffle. How good was it?? Brad Pitt could have walked up naked to our table and I would not have looked up long enough to stop shoveling it into my face.\n\nAmy ordered the 3 creme brulees - one had a Hawaiian orchid on it, and they were not only lovely but they tasted amazing. The coconut one was so fresh and it made me think that THIS is what every coconut cream pie in the world needs to taste like. I think the other flavors are vanilla bean (very good too) and maybe rum? (also very good) \n\nIt may not sound like I am doing the dessert justice but when you've been kissing George Clooney for an hour then along comes Rick Springfield, which one is better? They are both amazing, but by the time Rick comes along, well, you're kind of spoiled already.\n\nRoy's could not have been better - this entire experience was an A++ through and through. \n\nThe staff was extremely helpful (someone walked me to the ladies room when I merely asked where it was) (Oh and need I mention the corwn molding in the bathroom stalls was nicer than the crown molding in my house???) (And you know you are in a classy joint when a basket of tampons and maxi-pads is out on the marble bathroom counter, like party favors for down under)\n\nTHUMBS WAY UP!!!", "business_id": "corPOxxIBRJ7DSpryYvorw", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-12-04", "type": "review"}

After non-valeting my ride and walking the mandatory 100 yards to get to the resort, my breath was already taken away by the sheer grandiosity of the resort and the colorful flowers. Roy's is on the first floor of the resort...which will throw you off because the ground floor is considered the 2nd level.\n\nHostess and wait staff were super friendly, I wasn't sure what the reservation was under but they made the situation light and directed me to where I needed to go. Started off with the Crunchy Golden Lobster Potstickers in a Togarashi Miso Butter Sauce...Yeah, I don't know what togarashi is, but I think he was in the hot dog eating competition at coney island last year. Either way, it was good - the perfect amount of sauce to complement the lobster meat. Definitely a must try. \n\nAlso had the Golden Coconut Shrimp that came with a Mustard Mango Sweet & Sour Sauce and that I could've done without. The shrimp tasted fresh, but overall I thought it may have been a little bland. I guess I like a little bit more spice or lemony kick to my shrimp. I probably would have like to try the calamari instead.\n\nThe last appetizer I had was the Crispy Spicy Ahi Sushi Roll with Ginger Wasabi and I could have eaten this all day long. Hands down the number one appetizer to try. I never eat Ahi, but the wasabi kick did just enough for me to go back for 2nds and 3rds.\n\nFor the actual dinner, I started off with what seemed like the house salad. For this salad, you will need a knife in addition to your fork. It's not often I get confused by food, but I literally had to slice each piece of lettuce because it comes as one big piece. The herb dressing was super good and made the salad. You only get a couple of tomatoes and cucumber slices, but hey - your salad isn't supposed to be filling, so I was okay with it.\n\nFor the main entree, I got the Roy's Roasted Macadamia Nut Crusted Mahi Mahi....and with that I will make a qualifying statement that I don't eat much fish. I prefer beef and chicken over fish during every day of the week, but since the ahi sushi roll was so good, I decided to get a little fishy. I will also say that I've never had Mahi Mahi before, but for as much fun as it is to say Mahi Mahi, it tasted just as fun as it sounds. It has the perfect amount of \"crusty-ness\" and it just flaked and melted in my mouth. The Mahi Mahi comes layered on top of grilled asparagus, which is layered on top of medium sliced roasted potatoes. One bite - multiple tastes - and it all works. Usually I'm a little hesitant when chef's try to combine too much different flavors into one bite, but it really worked with this entree. \n\nFinished up with a dessert platter and the best one was the cheesecake, the crust was the best part. Pair it with the coffee and you've got a great ending.\n\nP.S.

We enjoyed food, the outdoor seatings, and the beautiful surroundings. \n\n- Crispy Karage Calamari -  This was definitely one of the best calamari I had! It was indeed crispy, and more flavorful with the thai basil dipping sauce, yum!\n\n-Misoyaki Butterfish - This white fish was light and somewhat creamy, so soft that could just melt into your mouth.\n\n-Brown Butter seared Salmon - A bit towards to the sweet side if you are not expecting, the fish was just a little bit undercooked for my mom, but it was a good combination with warm potato salad!\n\n-Pineapple cake/pie (?) - if you like sweet, definitely worth the wait to have this warm dessert. \n\nYay for a piece of birthday chocolate cake with a little candle :-)\n\nOur server was very attentive but somehow not so knowledgable about the food, I was expecting that she could tell us a bit more than 'this is a thai basil sauce'... One reason to take off a star was that even though we made a reservation and showed up on time, we still had to wait for about 10 mins to be seated although no one was in front of us. Also, yes, the outdoor seating was great, I wish they could have laid out the seating with some more spaces, the chairs between tables are almost hitting together...\n\nI wanna go back for some more calamari!!", "business_id": "corPOxxIBRJ7DSpryYvorw", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-02-03", "type": "review"}

Great wine pairing with the entrees.\n\nThe other trait I love about this restaurant is the time they give you to enjoy each course. We had appetizers, entrees, and dessert. For the 3 course meal it was about an hour and a half. I didn't feel like we were being herded in and out of a restaurant for quick turnover. We were allowed to enjoy our meal.\n\nWe did go for a birthday and I'll just say that the restaurant does something special other than a complimentary dessert. I won't ruin the surprise though.\n\nThe food itself is impeccable. The flavor was perfect and the everything was fresh. The braised beef peels apart with the touch of your fork and the macadamia nut crusted mahi mahi isn't overly fried. The souffl\u00e9 implodes as you poke it. \n\nThere's two reasons why I gave this restaurant 4 stars instead of 5. The first being as great as the meats were prepared, the veggies were undercooked and the rice was overcooked.

We were swayed to visit it since there was an hour wait at Charleston and other restaurants in the area. No waiting on a Saturday night should be a clue.\n\nWhen we came in, there was available seating, but were told a 10 minute wait was in order. We were the only one in the lobby. They actually waited until 2 other couples came in before they would seat us and continued to go through this process. \n\nRight before we were seated a gentleman and his wife came out and let us know that the food was less than okay. We ignored them, but probably should have listened. \n\nWhen we arrived to our dirty table (the table was sticky) we were given menus by a gal that rushed us down and mumbled someone would serve us. A few minutes later Anita came to help us. The company has a serious issue if all their wait staff is like her.  She dipped her pen in his tea (which had an old flavor to begin with) and similar items. \n\nShe started off with a bad attitude that was quickly going to get worse. After asking us if this is our first time here and rolling her eyes behind her rimmed glasses she suggested we start with an appetizer since there was a wait before our meal could be cooked. We said okay and asked her to suggest something. So we tried the crab wantons (1/5) based on them being her favorite. \n\nWell they were bland cream cheese and a fishy flavor with dough that hadn't properly been used. The plum sauce was inedible and we let her know. She gave us an evil glare and said what should she do about, then quickly changed her tone and suggested the stuffed mushrooms to replace it. \n\nAgainst our better judgment we agreed. She brought us back a tepid temperature side and then left. The dish has slightly better flavor (2/5) but needed a heavy dousing of salt to get much out of it. \n\nFinally our salads came out. The tomatoes had spots on them and the lettuce was brown and wilted. (1/5) The ranch was runny and lacked actual seasoning. But the sourdough bread that was included was perhaps tasting brilliant next to the bad items we had enjoyed. (3/5)\n\nFinally dinner came. My friend had the fried cod and a side of crab. I in turn had their crab treasure platter. It has Crab Alfredo, Crab Cakes and a Side of Crab according to the menu. Well, they should have left the crab cakes as a singular item. \n\nOn my friend's plate the crab legs were good (4/5) but the deep fried cod was overly battered and soaked up the grease so when he bit it, there was a squirt of grease that came out . Along with that I sampled a bite of one cod and it left a pool of grease in my mouth. Additionally the flesh was tough and there was absolutely no taste outside of the grease. (1/5)\n\nFrom my plate the snow crab legs were good again (4/5) but the Crab Alfredo literally had no flavor. I took some of the melted butter with a little salt and pepper and found it to be a little more edible at this point (1/5) and the crab cake was actually decent. It had flavor even though it was slightly burned. (2/5)\n\nThe waitress did her best to get us out the door and was very cold in the process.\n\nOverall the experience was bad, the staff was very rude and we are certain to never come back here. For $50 we could have had a nice time at Red Lobster where the food isn't as bad and we've never had a bad experience at.", "business_id": "6Ry-gjGqApTSRZkfdYlLmw", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-01-23", "type": "review"}

We give it almost a week thinking it will take a little bit to show up on the statements... nope still not there. My boyfriend went in last week to talk to the manager AGAIN and trys to find out what's going on. The manager then says AGAIN once I close out tonight then ill be able to reimburse you. STILL doesn't. Its another week later and nothing!! My brothers friend matt went back in the other day the manager then told him there's nothing he can do to help him. Really!??? Thats outrageous to not stand behind your company and the faults your company has made. To charge two people double then lead them on a few weeks saying he will refund then it gets down to it and says he cant help them!? I think is very wrong and not right to do to people.  I will not be in again! Which sucks cause I did love this place. I will tell everyone else not to go in either cause they'll rip you off!!!  *****UPDATE**** as of 2/5/2014 the manager did refund us back!!!!", "business_id": "k-KhKfLPjBxjSHppWoUyOA", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-02-01", "type": "review"}

I have never had a smaller glass of wine poured at a tasting! Hardley enough to taste the wine and enjoy it. Three small sips and it was gone. The wine was gone before we were served the food that went with it. I complained to the server and was told that they had to proportion the amount so everyone could have some.  ( So why not have more wine? I'm sure if we were paying by the glass we would have ample supply). Then came the first course Pizza. It looked like a personal Pizza, the kind you would get at  Happy Hour for\n $5. Then the ultimate insult!  We were served one pizza, small remember, cut into 6 pieces for four people! How do you figure? Math is not their strenght. Again I asked the server for more Pizza so we wouldn't have to fight over it. Again I was told- sorry thats all we have. I thought maybe I'm the only one complaining but as I surveyed my group I found that everyone was dissatisfied.  There were supposed to be four wines and five courses. I only counted four since they doubled up two of the main courses on one plate. It would have been too embarrassing to serve a piece of chicken 3 inches long or 4 raviolis separately. Of course I complained to the Manager afterwards to no avail, as others did in my group. He said and I quote\" I guess it was my fault because I told the servers not to pour much wine\". Well at $40 a person I don't think I will be going back. Too many other wine tastings where they actually give you some wine. I usually give a 20 % tip, but my only recourse was to give a lower tip to show my dissatisfaction so I left 15%. Upon reflection,  it should have been much lower.

It was a night I'll never forget. Red Lobster put the show on! Plate after plate after plate of meals came out. I missed the part on the invitation that said, \"Come ready to eat enough meals for the rest of your life.\"  \n\nIn the end the cheesy biscuits did me in. Gosh darn it!\n\nComplete Amateur Hour. If you've been to Red Lobster you are familiar with this breaded heavenly temptation. Unfolding napkins to the scent of bread is one thing. Slowly savoring the rich gooey cheese is...well...a moment you have to experience. \n\nI should have known better! \n\nThe Short Review:\n+ Good Food served in generous portions!\n+ Funny welcoming staff\n+ Kick butt drinks\n\nSTARTERS\nOut came a plate of stuffed mushrooms (6 pieces), decadently overfilled with lobster, crab and seafood topped with Monterey Jack cheese and baked. If you can, take a peek at my photos. (This advice applies to all of the food I'm going to cover. Words will not suffice here. Seriously!) \n\nIf you're looking for something with a kick the Sweet Chili Shrimp is for you! (12 pieces) It was for me. I absolutely loved the combination of light crunch and spice. It's not a hard crunch battered shrimp which is what I would have assumed if I was reading from the menu.\n\nOut came the Lobster Pizza. Perfectly thin crust and topped with generous amounts of lobster meat, mozzarella, fresh tomatoes and basil. The crust was perfectly balanced and not overwhelmed by the ingredients. (No sogginess!) I could readily see this being a meal for someone. You're still getting the \"Lobster\" experience and plenty of food. \n\nDRINKS\nWe must pause at this juncture to discuss drinks. As my +1 and I had arrived prior to the start of the event we cozied up to the bar. (He also drove. Blessedly. I was able to sample many wonderful things.) With high recommendations I dived into the Bahama Mama. Tall, fruity, Captain Morgan Spiced Rum. They leave a reserve of Captain at the top of the drink. So when you think you're done drinking, no. There's a special kick just waiting for you. Delicious!\n\nMoving into the special guest dining room armed with TWO drink tickets I was beside myself. \"Really? We can pick *anything* in the drink book menu? ANYTHING?\" Jeanne, our bomb diggity server, offered advice and answered many questions. Ultimately I wanted to compare a drink with my growing up roots. That's right. I went with a Top-Shelf Long Island Ice Tea. A premium blend of Absolut, Tanqueray, Bacardi and Patr\u00f3n Citr\u00f3nge. \n\nThe bartenders know what they're doing.\n\nLater. (Much later.) I was tempted into ordering the largest looking margarita in history. Grand Patr\u00f3n Margarita served with a cute sidecar of Grand Marnier. As we were attempting to photograph the ginormous nature of this treasure I was photobombed by a South African. All of the staff on hand, front to back, were super cool. We had a rip roaring time.\n\nTHE BAR\nSitting at the bar, however brief our time was there, was neat. It's a big u-shape and central to the restaurant. If you have time to kill before your reservation there's ample seating. + TV!\n\nBACK TO THE FOOD\nRemember, we ate tons! I was tired. But I channelled my inner gym monologue often, \"Suck it up Irene! Keep eating!\" (Also, the staff sent us home with shopping bags of doggie bags of food. My +1 scored big time as he took my goodies home!)\n\nDueling Lobster Tails.\n\"Where do I start? Traditional roasted with creamy shrimp and garlic sauce? Or stuffed with crab and seafood? Which one will I like better? There's mash potatoes!\" \n\nAfter pausing for a nano-sec.\n\n\"- And string beans. Not going to waste any space on those!\" Well, I did try the string beans because I felt guilty. Everything was wonderful. This meal is perfect for someone who isn't quite sure what they want. I had no idea there was still so much food to come.\n\nBar Harbor Lobster Bake.\nA roasted split Maine lobster tail, tender shrimp, sea scallops, mussels and linguini in a garlic and white wine broth. My Martha Stewart wanna be instantly thought, \"Hey. You could totally pick this up and pass it off as a creation of your own. Toss it in a nice bowl and maybe a fella will be sufficiently impressed by your \"cooking\" Irene.\"\n\nHey. If I stock the right beer fridge men believe anything. The mussels were my favorite part in this. Of course everything was delicious. I adored the mussels. They were perfectly prepared and not overly done. If I time the pickup perfectly a future date will think I'm an excellent cook. (Shhh!)\n\nLobster Lovers Dream.\nButter makes the world go round. Two very different styles of lobster + alfredo pasta.\n\nUltimate Surf & Turf\nMust do this again. A Maine lobster tail baked with crab and seafood stuffing. Peppercorn seasoned grilled sirloin topped with Maine lobster meat in a citrus hollandaise sauce. \n\nDessert came. I put my head down. Try the key lime pie.", "business_id": "k8q3ypIoIzchdp3RoRUsJw", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-02-04", "type": "review"}

I also learned that I prefer the Maine Lobster over the Rock Lobster (Rock rock Rock Lobster Down down! B52's Rock Lobster)  I had lobster for days, and I still am craving the sweet Maine lobster & sweet chili shrimp!  And if you love the coconut shrimp you should for sure try the Lobster in Paradise, omg the lobster in the coconut batter was amazing!! \n\nTo end the meal I tried the Red Velvet Cake in a Jar that was the perfect ending to a delicious feast! \n\nAlso was able to meet the Manager Carrie and many other staff members including the chefs!

I went with 4 friends, and had originally ordered a Mango shrimp dish that sounded fantastic.  About 5 minutes before they brought out the rest of the tables food (after bringing appetizers), they told me that they were out of the dish I ordered.  I feel like if they were out of the dish, this could have been told to me much more quickly so I could have updated my order earlier.\n\nThis was just one instance of the overall poor service we received.  One of my fellow diners kept trying to get his drink with just a little bit of ice, and only once did he accomplish this throughout the meal.  Every time they brought him a drink with ice packed to the rim of the cup you could see a look of defeat on his face.  Finally toward the end of the meal, he resorted to illustrating about how much ice he wanted using his fingers on the side of the cup.  When the lady returned with a cup full of ice, and Pepsi filled only to the level his finger  had indicated, we all burst into laughter.\n\nTo summarize: mediocre food, mediocre at best service...", "business_id": "z4KFTJQsAdxqMZA7Fx0A9A", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-12-28", "type": "review"}

It has been a while since I visited this place for just dinner, so I will keep this review to my recent visit for dim sum.\n\nIn my humble opinion, C-Fu is the best Dim Sum in the valley. I am a firm believer in having to switch up dim sum joints between here, China King and Phoenix Palace, to keep it fresh. That being said, when bringing someone new into the world of dim sum or when entertaining from out of town, C-Fu is old faithful for consistency and variety. \n\nThe owner is constantly walking around with the most exotic of the dim sum dishes, lobster, clams in black bean sauce, calamari, etc.  Plenty of the standard dumplings and spring rolls to be found for the timid while the next cart brings chicken feet, tripe and tofu wrapped egg rolls for the more experienced. \n\nI generally order the 50/50 jasmine flower tea instead of the normal fare, but both are solid choices, no matter what you end up with.  When the meal is done, you simply take your card to the front, tip is added automatically and you are on your way out.

Arizona is not known for having any great Chinese restaurants. I honestly find Panda Express the only better quality Chinese food around locally. Mostly what you find are buffets, and I hate those. C Fu Gourmet is different. It's actually a real Chinese restaurant! It's located in a shopping center in Chandler with a handful of Asian businesses. This is a non-discript place, but once inside, you get the feel of a real Chinese restaurant. It has the fish tank and handi-crafts for sale, but the work force is Asian and the customers were mostly Asian and that's a really good sign. One thing you notice is the servers going around with carts that have daily specials on them. They go table to table and offer you to try the Dim Sum or other option. We ordered off the menu. I had the Kung Pau chicken meal that comes with rice, a spring roll, and  soup. I wasn't crazy about the soup. It was wonton and it was okay, but there was something about it that I didn't like, not sure what though. The Kung Pau chicken was awesome! It had just the right flavor and it was the perfect amount for one person. The spring roll was pretty good too. It wasn't oily which makes all of the difference with a spring roll. Had a great time and a great meal. I found the staff to be friendly and they answered all of our questions.

The Mahi Mahi has been gone for years, and if there was ever tuna on the menu the price and the inability to cook it rare made it a poor choice. I went here with my family for one of our now rare trips there. The wait was short, and the service was pleasant. My main complaint was the menu. The only fresh fish were talipa, trout and one other option, I don't recall. \n\nI went with a full order of the trout, over their newish \"wood fire grill option.\" I found that it imparts a stubble smoky char taste that works well with the high surface area of the trout. \n\nAs usual the meal came with a Cesar salad that was acceptable, and their butter, salt and cheese laden biscuits that are great way to add mass to yourself.\n\n Due to the lack of fresh fish my parents opted for an old favorite, the fried flounder. This is possibly the best fried fish out there. It is also one of the cheapest items on the menu.

The negative: since I have to specify no butter or cream on anything, they were real good about making sure the fish was dairy free (yes, that is a positve too) the funny thing is, they served the maple glaze on the side \"just in case\"....huh? so, I asked, does the glaze have butter in it or something? \"no, but we put it on the side, just in case\" yeah. I still don't get it....... \n\nAnother annoying thing was the fact that my plate came with mashed potatos (note to my dairy-free peeps: restaurants like this DO NOT have dairy free mashed potatos....everything is pre-made, we're not special enough for the cook to go make our very own mashed potatos....) AND with the rice pilaf.....which, having visited here before, I'm pretty sure is not dairy free.

The hostess was very pleasant and seated us in a nice booth.   The restaurant is under construction, so it looks tacky and smells like chemicals.  Not a great idea to keep open while you are working on it.    Anyway that aside... Our waiter was the absolute worst!!!!  His  name was Bob,my boyfriend got Boston Ice tea and i wanted coffee.  I asked Bob if he would make a fresh pot for me because, i knew it is not popular on a Saturday Night and would be old.  He seemed really put off with that and said it would take a long time. I said i don't mind i am not going anywhere.   Within Minutes he came back with with coffee and the Ice Tea.   The Ice Tea has cranberry juice in it, which is their signature drink.   My coffee was old and cold, no surprise because, he did not make new.    When he came back with our appetizer i said, i am sorry this coffee is old and cold and i cannot drink it. Can i please just have a hot tea.  He said , well i can make a fresh pot. Huh, did i not ask for that the first time. I said, no , i will just have a hot tea.  He filled my boyfriend's ice tea with regular, not the Boston Ice tea he had ordered.    Then he continually ignored our table.  I had to up to the bar to get new ice Tea and hot water for my tea.   Another waiter brought us out our food. Though he could not find the table because,  Bob had put the wrong table number on our check.  This was expensive night out.

I couldn't believe the customer service that was not only received but being given to those around us. When we came in, a gentleman said he'd be right with us to seat us. He never came back. Another person came to get us but started giggling and laughing and said to hold on a sec. He was looking at the seating charts I suppose. Another individual came up to help him and they had a whole conversation about where to seat us and who just got someone prior, etc etc. I am standing there in shock because not ONE but TWO other individuals came to help JUST to find us a seat. 4 people and neither could decide where until 1 of them asked a girl behind him if he could seat us with her. She didn't even look up and said \"ya sure\" in a bothered way. What the heck. I am sorry? We came in just to have a meal and be on our way. Instead we had this circus chain of actions. It gets better. We finally sat down around the right side of the restaurant. I noticed a table near us who had a different waitress. A gentleman asked her if he could have his fork and knife changed out while handing it to her, she rudely asked twice \"excuse me what?\" and he repeated. She said \"Ok yeah\" and walked away without even grabbing the utensils he was trying to hand her. We immediately got up and just left. Don't get me wrong, I love Red Lobster, they got wonderful food and beverages. I am rating this based on our experience at this location and how it was handled. The place wasn't even busy that night.

Moreover, our server had great timing, was very friendly and helpful, and kept my iced tea filled. \n\nThe food is still chain food. It was pretty good, but chain food all the same. I ordered the Rustica pizza (if you read my post on LGO, you'll know how much I adore pizza). It had a lovely presentation, with large slices of eggplant and colorful peppers. It had a slight spicy kick to it, which I enjoyed, but was underwhelming on the whole.  The pizza was a bit oily, the crust did not have personality (I'm sure you know what I mean by that), and neither the cheese nor the sausage were particularly special. It was an average pizza. My date, who has dined here frequently, really enjoys the fillet with asparagus and it seemed to be cooked to order. \n\nOne thing that really bothers me about many chain restaurants is the recent trend to serve desserts in shot glasses. You pick your favorite flavor from a selection of 8 or 10. Three bites later, dessert is done. Excuse me, but custard covered with a little Ready Whip does not count as dessert! It is the same at every restaurant, and I find it very unimaginative and unappealing. Call me a snob, but if I'm going to order dessert at a restaurant, I want it to be a true dessert. \n\nOverall, if being strong-armed into a chain restaurant, Carrabas is a good choice with decent food and an excellent staff.", "business_id": "cKxXBvOithS-Ic5KnhEKrg", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-01-12", "type": "review"}

This review is for this location, specifically because I think that the food prepared in this location is better than in other locations.\n\nI eat out a lot and because I love local-fare, chain restaurants are definitely not on my to-eat-lists.   However, this Carrabba's is frequently in my rotation for 2 reasons - #1 I really love a few of their menu items and #2 the service.\n\nSo, the food is always good here.  I've never had a bad meal and from my experiences with other Carrabba's across the country, I think this one prepares their food the best.\n\nNow, on to the meat of my review - the service in this establishment is impeccable.  I've gone in here on more than one occasion and ordered things that were not on the menu - if they have the ingredients in house and can make it - its a done deal.  You know how you DVR a show and watch it 3 months later and see a commercial for something \"new\" Carrabba's is serving and get there and it is no longer on the menu?  I can't tell you how often that has happened and how often I was able to get the item prepared for me.  I've been there and had the manager offer to make a shrimp item with the shrimp prepared 3 different ways.  WHO DOES THAT?\n\nI was there for lunch recently with a friend and I overheard a manager telling a customer that this restaurant never had a particular item on the menu, but they have all the ingredients.  He informed her that the dish takes a while to prepare, so if she would call him an hour in advance, he could have it ready for her when they got there.  Uhm... Yeah.  That's  why this Carrabba's gets a 5 star from me.  \n\nThere are only a select few National Chain restaurants I would choose, this Carrabba's is one of those when I'm in Phoenix.", "business_id": "cKxXBvOithS-Ic5KnhEKrg", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-02-17", "type": "review"}

I've been eating at Carrabba's for the past twenty years (at the locations in Houston).  This was my first time trying the Carrabba's in Chandler and it was a letdown.  First of all, they don't have the seafood pasta that used to be my favorite dish (scallops, shrimp and mussles in a spicy marinara sauce).  Secondly, when I got my salad it was TOO COLD.  This sounds like a weird complaint, but it was so cold that it was unappetizing.  Some pieces of the lettuce were actually frozen!  It was also DRENCHED in Caesar dressing.  Third, portion sizes left a bit to be desired.\n \nThe best parts about the meal was the bread with olive oil dipping sauce and the Shrimp/scallop linguine entree was pretty tasty but nothing spectacular.  The scallops were actually pretty tiny...\n\nNot sure why this location isn't as good as the restaurants in Houston, but I probably wouldn't be back here.

As we sat down they were seating a family near us in another booth, the members of the family were bigger people and the booth proved to be uncomfortable for them and they asked for a table and were seated at a table, about 5 min later same person comes up with another family of bigger people, same thing...do they not GET that big people are NOT fitting in this booth? This happened one other time at this booth before they got smaller people in there. When our food finally came (about 30 min later) it was \"meh\" to say the least...the kids meals were water-y pasta sauce with one tiny meatball.
