The noise level was also at a nice working level - not too loud, music just barely audible.\n\nI do wish there was more seating.  It is nice that this location has a counter at the end of the bar for sole workers, but it doesn't replace more tables.  I'm sure this isn't as much of a problem in the summer when there's the space outside.\n\nThere was a treat receipt promo going on, but the barista didn't tell me about it, which I found odd.  Usually when they have promos like that going on, they ask everyone if they want their receipt to come back later in the day to claim whatever the offer is.  Today it was one of their new pastries for $1, I know in the summer they do $2 grande iced drinks with that morning's receipt.\n\nOverall, nice working or socializing environment.

Odd, but my group was hungry so we didn't question the kismet. \n\nThe restaurant is pretty enormous as far as cafes go, and it's nice because they don't pack the tables on top of each other so you're never going to be crammed next to a crying baby or having to scoot your chair in every time the table next to you needs a coffee refill. The furnishings all appear to be second hand finds as well as local art and LOTS of owl statues. It's a hoot, for sure. \n\nOne weird thing is the one bathroom with the sink outside, so if you're sitting in the back you can heavily monitor who comes out and doesn't wash their poopy hands. On the other hand, if you go to the bathroom here you'll likely feel like you have to make your hand washing some sort of big production so the other people in the back will take notice of your exceptional hygiene habits.\n\nI was feeling pretty sick still and actually brain washed myself  into believing that my weekend bug was actually morning sickness so on top of already feeling super nauseous and not hungry, and naturally my non-motherly instincts wanted to starve whatever demon might be brewing inside me but the hypothetical baby's daddy insisted I eat something and took it upon himself to order me the tofu scramble, which I was sort of excited to try despite feeling otherwise very green. It was actually very bland and dry and even though I think it was only like $3, I think I would have rather had the $3 in my pocket than the scramble so I took a few bites and then pawned it off on the boo who insisted I try his veggie breakfast burrito. The burrito was the total opposite of the scramble- absolutely outstanding and even though it was the size of a guinea pig, I think I could have downed the whole thing (of course, I would have blamed it on my imaginary incubating child and said I was eating for two). \n\nGoing around the table, everyone seemed content with their food, besides the grits order that were decidedly bland, but that's kind of how I've come to think of grits in general. Our service was great and though most of the table's food was just okay, that burrito, the owl statues and the house horchata I ordered as my beverage really made the experience for me. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I can understand the 3-star average on Yelp, but that I think you can totally come here and have a 4 or even 5 star time if you order wisely. Just remember: Burrito, horchata and time the bathroom-goers for extra entertainment. \n\nPS- I'm so NOT pregnant (in fact, can someone get me a heat pack a few dozen Midol?), but thanks for your concern.", "business_id": "PzG0XmAmtXFs6Fdnubf41g", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-12-13", "type": "review"}

It just has to be a parody of a vegetarian restaurant. Like, every time I start reading the menu I think Ashton Kutcher is going to pop out and tell me I've been Punk'd.\n\nA small disclaimer: I am not vegan or vegetarian and I never will be. I love meat. But I also love vegetables and fruits and pretty much the entire food pyramid. And these things can be combined to make tasty vegan food. But \"Texturized vegetable protein hydrated with seasonings\" is not food to me. Yep, that description of their \"chorizo\" comes directly off their menu. Eating vegetarian does NOT mean you need to subject yourself to these highly processed \"foods.\"\n\nLess processed substitutes like tofu, tempeh, and seitan are used as well, but they are mostly treated as a stand-in for meat. I guess if you are a vegetarian that misses eating meat, this may satisfy you. However, as an omnivore, why would I eat a faux-BLT when I can eat a real one? How about instead of trying to imitate the flavor and texture of meat, we actually come up with creative combinations of vegetables, fruits, and legumes that are delicious in their own right. What a concept! Have you ever eaten a vegetarian dish and thought, \"Whoa, I can't believe I actually like this better than meat\"? I have! But don't expect that feeling here.

Then he made me a cup of coffee with bean just out of the roaster, slightly cooled, he ground them in front of me, then put them in a french press and let it steep for 4 minutes. Damn, that was the best cup of Joe I ever had.

The connoisseurs out there might disagree with that statement but a beginner like me would never know the difference. Knowing the special flavor you get out of a freshly ground espresso I made a cup, unadulterated, the second I got home.

All of their coffees and teas are behind the counter and you have to get help to buy any of them.  I thought that it was odd and made looking at the different kinds difficult.  It was only after we left the store that my fiance said that they had lists of what they had to offer.  Whoops!  Next time I suppose that I will have to look at that.  The service for the two teas that I got was good and I was able to easily ask the guy for the right amount for me.  The coffee was also easy to order although I was surprised at the lack of coffee drinks that they serve for a place that specializes in coffee.  Thankfully they did have my go to drink, the Americano and my fiance and I both ordered one in the only size that they had.  After receiving it I asked for some cream and was pointed around the corner and found only half and half in the little pre-sealed cup.  Once again for a place specializing in coffee this was a bit disappointing. Thankfully the taste of the Americano more than made up for that as it was strong and extremely smooth.  My fiance also enjoyed hers as well.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I will be back here again in the future not only for their large selection of loose leaf teas but also for their Americanos.   Make sure that if you want anything from behind the counter to look at their lists as I surely will the next time that I am there.  I also hope that in the future they will have some milk in addition to the half and half but I am not holding my breath.", "business_id": "TASUnYvk_nvTUyKtroCJSA", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-01-11", "type": "review"}

From start to finish, the entire experience was just bad.  I'm all about second chances, but nothing about this place makes me ever want to go back.\n\nHaving not been to this part of town in quite some time, it took me a while to piece together that I had been to the shopping center this coffeeshop is housed in before.  In fact, although I'm not 100% sure, I believe I'd actually visited the coffeeshop many years ago.  However, it was operating under a different name and likely different owners at the time.  If my memory serves me correctly, it was a much better establishment back then.\n\nIn route to work, with some time to spare, I decided I was hungry and in need of coffee.  I pull off of the unfamiliar 485 exit and explore the shopping center.  Seeing the coffeeshop was a win that filled me with joy.  Joy that would soon be squashed.\n\nUpon entering I saw other guests seated in the small interior engaged in their personal conversations.  That said, no one was in line or waiting at the counter for beverages.  Two workers stood behind the counter and didn't offer so much as a hello.  I'm not looking for a robotic yell, like that of CiCi's or Cold Stone employees, but a simple acknowledgement would've gone a long way.  Instead, I got nothing.  In fact, the girl looked me up and down, even making eye contact, and waited for me to address her before begrudgingly strolling over to the register.  That and the handwritten sign offering refills starting at $1 should've told me it was time to leave.\n\nI proceeded with my order only to be told my one coffee was a mere $6.  \"Come again?\"  I thought to myself the coffee must be pretty good.  After all, there were others who had clearly coughed up the money, and the place had to be doing something right in order to be in business.  Wrong again.  Easily the worst cup of coffee I've ever had.  I couldn't even choke it down and wound up throwing out more than half of it.  It was so overly sweetened that I may as well have been drinking straight from the flavor syrup bottle.  \n\nOverall, I felt the coffee and pastry offerings were limited, and lacked originality.  The store felt dirty, the goods were overpriced, and getting into/out of the shopping center was rather odd.  The service was laughable, and I have zero desire to ever go back.  The quality of the coffee could be easily surpassed by the likes of McDonald's, and to true coffee drinkers, that says a lot.\n\nI wish them the best on their continued business adventure, but I'll surely not be recommending them to anyone I know.", "business_id": "_SEXb8Q6KIGAR7VlWBGKmg", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-01-30", "type": "review"}

It's nestled in the same building as the UPS Store, so make sure you take the left turn when you walk in the main door, otherwise you'll be shipped off somewhere.  \n\nUnlike the Caribou on East Blvd, this one's relatively quiet, allowing for a more intimate environment.  In fact, my partner and I we had our first \"date\" here.  It provided the right level of coziness for \"get-to-know-you\" conversation, yet it was casual enough so neither of us would feel awkward. \n\nCaribou's coffee is less bitter than Starbucks and they offer some interesting coffee combinations like the Lite White Berry, made with sugar-free raspberry syrup and white chocolate syrup.  YUM.   Unfortunately, it's not really that \"lite\" as the name might suggest.  For under 100 calories, I go for the Northern Lite Raspberry Latte.  Not chocolatey, but still fruity sweet.  \n\nDuring the fall, their pumpkin drinks rock.  There's so much more pumpkin flavor in their hot and cold drinks than other coffee places.

I usually try to get there kind of early and leave before it gets busy so I'm not taking up a table. I bought a big breakfast (as described above) and sat down to work. Just over an hour later, I was approached by a middle-aged man whom I assume is the owner or manager but whom I've never seen before. He asked if I was aware of their \"new policy\" about Wi-Fi on Sunday mornings, and how they don't want people just hanging out using the internet when it gets crowded. (No sugar coating, that's almost verbatim what he said.) For the record, I wasn't actually using their wi-fi, I was writing. Whatever. His point was obvious. I stared at him for a few seconds because I couldn't believe that a proprietor was actually asking me, a paying customer, to leave when I had been there only an hour and in fact still had toast on my plate. He suggested it was fine for now but that when it started to get crowded I should get out. I said that if that's how they felt I would leave now, and he responded, \"That's exactly how we feel.\" I was shocked, and still am. I have never, NEVER been treated so disrespectfully in a place of business. And I'm a regular, paying customer!! I always leave a tip!

The first time I stopped in, I couldn't help but feel instinctively that this was one of those magical curiosity shops from my childhood books: all crowded aisles and dusty shelves piled to the ceiling with colorful fare.\n\nThe primary product sold here is tea (of course), and they've got plenty of it in all brands, flavors, and forms.  Thankfully, they carry Traditional Medicinals, a set of herbal teas that are invaluable for getting me through the cold/flu season.  Many of the big brand teas (Harrisons and Crosfield, Twinings, Stash, Republic of Tea, etc.) are available in both loose-leaf and teabag form.  Reluctant about paying $10 for a box of tea that you might not like?  You can make up your own variety pack by buying from their stock of individual tea bags (usually less than $0.50 per bag).  \n\nIf you're a novice and just want to sample different kinds of tea, there is also the route of buying some of their self-serve bulk tea.  In the winters, I am a big fan of the Seattle Market Spice; for summers, I usually pick a mild fruity tea (like black currant) for brewing ice tea.  I do question their storage method (left in transparent glass jars on open shelves) as I'm pretty sure tea is supposed to be kept somewhere dark and dry to maintain freshness.\n\nAside from a variety of teas, they also carry bulk spices, bulk coffee, tea cakes/biscuits, jams, chocolates, and soup mixes.  The shop owner will help grind your coffee upon request.  Most of the candy and snacks sold here are quality items produced by small or foreign companies not commonly found in regular grocery stores.\n\nShopping for a gift?  You can find teapots and teacups (both classic European-style ceramic and some of the Asian variety), as well as other tea-time accessories (including strainers, spoons, cloth napkins, etc.).  Some of the teas are sold in old-fashioned, decorative tins--these make charming presents for a tea-lover you may know.\n\nFor the total foodie maniac, this place may not be all that impressive in the products they carry, but it's still more than adequate for a town like Champaign.", "business_id": "bmGEYg9Xw9XmCQXgeZ_Pyw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-12-15", "type": "review"}

Their apple cider, however, is stale  (store bought, non-local and just heated up from what I can tell) but I guess that's not exactly a hot ticket item.\n\nI have a problem with their pastry case because on MANY occasions there have been multiple flies buzzing around inside the case and landing on all of the food.  That is not so tasty to me.\n\nMy personal preference in caf atmospheres is one where each table feels like a cozy and isolated space and I do not find that Kopi's atosphere lends any feeling of coziness or isolation.  All of chairs are made of wood, so it may not accomidate the armchair and comfy couch types.  Many people go there to be seen and table hop, so I guess it works for most.  I prefer the outside tables in the summer as long as the homeless lady doesn't come by and ask for $2.", "business_id": "yzInxReAkf7r0aRbwj02Yw", "stars": 3, "date": "2007-02-12", "type": "review"}

If I was still in school, needed such a place, and they allowed smoking, I would give it 5 stars. Alas, those days are gone, so all I see this place as is a cafe with fairly decent sandwiches, meh soup, 2-3 choices for daily coffee (plus 1 type of daily decaf) for prices that are a little higher than I think is commercially reasonable.\n\nThe staff is friendly and the atmosphere is great: a very homey, anti-corporate coffee shop where the employees are friendly, competent and patient. The coffee itself is quite good, but I think Aroma (on the other side of the block) is a little better. The sandwiches are okay. They use high quality ingredients, but they are still just sandwiches. They definitely put thought and effort into the presentation of their meals, and this counts big in my book. Sandwiches come with a choice of healthy sides (apple, salad, Sun Chips).\n\nTheir soups are not great. Pekara and Aroma are better in this department, but they have good ideas (like today's pumpkin apple soup). Prices are a bit high: a half spinach salad with about 1/4 cup of tuna salad with a balsamic vinaigrette and a cup of that soup plus a large black coffee was $8.50 or so pre-tip. Get a sandwich with a small salad side and coffee and you are north of $10 real quick. If these prices don't make you immediately balk, please note that their portion sizes are not very big, and are at least third smaller than a meal at Guido's or Esquire.

I tend to order brewed coffee with a side of ice water and something to eat (usually a bagel or lemon pound cake). The brewed coffee is fairly quick but I was amazed at how long it took to throw a bagel into the toaster and return it! After standing and tracking my bagel on the next visit, I noticed that it was sitting in this food line after leaving the toaster getting cold.

I'm not sure if it's a chain store but it has an independent coffee shop feel which is pretty cool now days. The coffee tasted good and they seem to take the art of espresso seriously with the only knock being they do not roast the beans locally. \n\nWhen: Saturday Afternoon at 4:30 pm\n\nLocation: As stated in opening description it's a great central location to meet people but since it's in the same shopping center as a bank, Zen32, Safeway, Gelato, and other little shops parking was tight. (If you're a grumpy driver you will need to bring your patience along for parking). The one thing I noticed was the Gelato store next door. I would think on a hot summer day if you're a coffee fanatic it would be nice to have your coffee then enjoy some Gelato. \n\nFront and back patio seating, free wifi, \n\nAmbience: Hava Java has the obvious local art hung throughout the place. It's a little place so the walkways are very narrow and the  high tables are barley functional, and if you sit in the back you can smell the restroom. The best place to sit is out front or out back. I really liked the fact they have a back patio seating area. That's unique for a coffee shop. \n\nCoffee: I had 2 drinks: a vanilla latte and a coffee. Above average taste and presentation but it's not elite. The staff was proactive in asking my milk preference. The coffee came in a to-go cup and not a ceramic cup in case you care about that.  If you are a serious coffee connoisseur you may not like Hava Java due to the fact the beans are not as fresh as they could be if bought from a local roaster. \n\nFood: They offer the typical pastries. I didn't ask where they buy from but it looks like the typical Chompies verity. I didn't have anything to eat. \n\nPrice: Average: My small vanilla latte was about 3.50. My large coffee was 2.00\n\nClientele: Since it's in the Biltmore area its typical upper middle class people in there late 40s/50s. The one thing I found a bit odd was that the customers were overly friendly, it was a little unnerving but that could have been just me so I'm not knocking them for that. \n\nWait: There was not a line when I arrived so they prepared my order immediately. \n\nStaff: They had one girl working when I arrived and she was really nice and professional. No face tattoos or odd piercings. Not that tattoos and piercing bother me but at some coffee shops that is the typical staff look and it might bother others.", "business_id": "2h9LsLPdJ7OvZrYJZhVdAw", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-02-28", "type": "review"}

The wall of windows lights the place up awesomely, and even at night, it doesn't turn into one of those dark, moody coffee joints. They find new artists to show art every couple of months or so, and it's usually pretty good. Their couple handfuls of small tables are easy to shift around if you're joining a group, but big groups might feel uncomfortable since it's not exactly huge. There's a nice quiet room around the back for people studying, but it's not enclosed, so on open mic nights or nights when there are featured performers, it's not so quiet. I love how clean they keep the place; when the baristas aren't working the counter, they're wiping down the windows, bussing tables, and restocking the coffee condiment bar. \n\nSpeaking of the baristas, they're always friendly and attentive, good at showing off how to hustle (because when a coffee shop's busy, I feel better if baristas actually act like it), and totally interesting to look at--like fashion icons for today's college-aged generation, some with interesting piercings and tattoos, fashionable and stylish by not trendy clothes--seems like there's an appreciation for staff who are unique, interesting, and good workers. It's never uncomfortable, though--meaning, I never feel too old or unhip or out of place there. Customers truly run the gamut, from quiet middle-aged women catching up with each other, moms and/or dads with kids, suit-and-tie professionals stopping in for a cuppa, people hitting the wi-fi, and angsty artsy types having heated but civil political debates. \n\nI usually have the chai tea latte, but their coffee is always solid (I can attest to a decent caf\u00e9 mocha), and I hear a lot of praise about their daily specials--every day, a different bean, special coffee, and iced tea. Prices are a little cheaper than Starbucks (I think it was $2.50 for the tasty mango lemon iced tea, and the larger specialty coffees can go up to $4.50), but the drinks are better. Pastries are always tasty and include a small selection of rugalah (buttery, flaky, chocolatey goodness--also available with raspberry or apple), a bigger selection of muffins, big and puffy croissants, bagels, cookies, brownies, rice krispie treats--certainly not a fully stocked French patisserie, but what they have is usually really good quality. They also serve one or two different quiches every day, potato knishes, breakfast sandwiches, and omelets.", "business_id": "Mb46iSlA4qmTwXf-WrqtQA", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-01-15", "type": "review"}

The friendly Asian man and woman (owners?) and were friendly.  They didn't have a very wide variety at 11 on a Sunday, but I bought a ham and cheese croissant, glazed donut holes, and a frozen hot chocolate.\n\nHam and cheese croissant: It was okay.  The woman behind the counter \"heated it up\" but it was in a microwave, not a high speed oven or toaster that would have made it less squishy and more flakey.  Sliced ham and cheese were grocery store quality.\n\nDonut holes: Tasted a tiny bit stale, but still good.  I prefer BoSa's in Chandler though.  I imagine these are fantastic when warm.  I'm going to save some and try pop them in the microwave later.\n\nFrozen hot chocolate: Very heavy on the cocoa powder, and served without whipped cream.  Could've used some more  sweetness and a creamy vanilla flavor in it.  Added a couple pumps of sugar free peppermint syrup at home to wake it up and balance the bitterness of the cocoa.  I've yet to find a FHC that can beat Dairy Queen's, sadly.\n\nRainbow has a very convenient location with easy parking, though their hours are somewhat limited.

Read other reviews if you want to know how the coffee is.\n\nThe biggest selling point of this place is that it's open late. Yes it has free wifi, but forgive me for being underwhelmed, considering that pretty much every coffee shop that doesn't have a green logo does. Even then, their obnoxious password system resulted in problems getting the wifi working on my iPhone.\nThe indoor seating arrangement is odd, which has left me feeling uncomfortable if I don't get one of the few seats I like. The outdoor seating is nice, but you won't last long in the evening if you dislike smoke nor in the day if you dislike ducks.\nSome fools who go here see fit to feed the ducks, which during the day results in ducks coming to you begging for food and crapping nearing your feet. And god help you if you kick them way, you'll have to suffer the disdainful looks of the high school girls who often congregate here.\nThe various non-coffee/tea drinks I've tried aren't good. They're usually just a blend of ice, some sort of syrup or soda, and (depending on what you order) milk. A little fresh fruit, or frozen fruit, or any sort of 'real' ingredient, would go a long way. Instead they seem concerned with making these drinks as cheaply as possible.\nThe baklava I only tried once, since it tasted like it had been sitting out way too long. It's possible I just had some on a bad day, but I won't be ordering it again unless I'm really craving baklava.\nMost of the baristas are friendly, but a couple are real pr*cks who will wipe the smile off your face if you interact with them. I've also been harassed about ordering quickly, even in situations where the place is relatively empty. Sorry if I don't want to order and have my ice melt before the rest of my friends arrive!\n\nAs I said, the primary draws of this place is that it's open late and (for indie types) that it's not Starbucks.

This time, however, I had several disappointments that altered how I perceive this place (and ultimately alter my desire to come back again).  \n\nThis particular evening, my sister and I arrived and, though we weren't planning on staying and hanging out (I just wanted a latte), after what we experienced, we decided to leave quickly.  \n\nThe place has a nice, local hang-out feel to it - lots of random people, in groups, or on laptops, just chillin' enjoying their drinks.. the staff was friendly and all, too.  When I went to order my latte, I had a few questions on steam temperature for my milk (I'm slightly picky about that) and he kindly answered them and executed my shots as requested.  As I was paying (cash, since they only allow debit/CC cards at a minimum of I think $5), he asked if we were going to stay there for the evening or just to-go.. me, total optimist, thinking he is going to offer us the wifi password or even a sample of something or just plain being friendly and talkative, was surprised when he said \"yeah, because you have an outside drink and we don't allow those, so you'd have to leave\" adding a fake sorry face... my sister, next to me, holding her Starbucks water container filled with WATER... I'm thinking \"really??? are you serious??\" I was super surprised at that statement and frankly, really annoyed.  I just bought a product and am being told that because she has a Starbucks CUP (not even a Starbucks coffee), she has to leave.  WTF!\nYou can tell that totally did not sit well with me.  We kindly said we'd leave as we were going to go shopping anyway... \n\nTHEN, as I go to shake the nutmeg and the cinnamon in to my latte (this is how I fake myself out that my latte is sweet without the extra sugar), I shake and shake and the flippin' spices come mixed with SUGAR - both nutmeg AND cinnamon... what's the point?  There were already 3 different kinds of sweeteners there on the shelf for ppl to add as they please, why do they have to add sugar to the cinnamon and nutmeg shakers?..

It was still a good smell though. \nI let the barista know I was looking for something good, and then found something awesome. I told her I wanted the Rush coffee, and pointed at the sign. \nShe said \"Oh sorry, that is just the description of all of our coffees\". My mistake, but if that was one coffee, it would be wonderful. So I looked at the actual drink menu, and chose a black and white iced late with coconut. To my surprise, I didn't receive any weird looks like I get at Starbucks for being adventurous. Then I watched the red headed barista dance around (literally) while she made my coffee. It was a pleasant experience. I think people would be happier if they got to watch people serving their food/drinks/coffee/bag groceries/etc while dancing. \nSo my drink tasted awesome, and she explained the stamp card to me. \nAs I walked out, I walked right into a cloud of cigarette smoke. There you have it, the only bad thing about this place I found. I absolutely hate smelling cigarettes!

I was instantly impressed that someone can be so successful in today's shaky market and open restaurant after restaurant with business just booming.\n\nAs we walked in we noticed that there was a line in which you stand to order your food at a counter.  We joined the line and read the menu.  Already having decided on a margherita pizza, we also chose the caprese salad and I knew I wanted a glass of pinot noir.  As we stood, I noticed that there were very few empty tables and I mentioned to my husband that maybe I should snag a table.  I had my eye on one table but as I walked toward it someone else apparently also had their eye on it and sat there first.  I bolted over to the only other empty table that I saw.  I sat for several minutes, watching my husband inch his way up to the counter.  A manager lady came over to me and asked me if I had someone standing in line.  I said yes.  She informed me that they usually like people to all wait in line and then order before sitting at a table.  I looked back at her and thought about the fact that there were no empty tables.  I said okay, but I held on to my table.  So that part was a little stressful.  The couple next to me joked around saying that I wasn't following the rules and may end up getting kicked out of my table.  Thankfully my husband was finally able to order and made his way over to our table.\n\nWe sat close to several other tables which seemd to invite conversation from all sides.  We chatted with all the people around us which was fun.\n\nOur food came and it was delicious!  The pizza was perfectly cruncy and chewy.  The caprese salad was very tasty.  We devoured every last bite.\n\nOn our way out we were lucky to see Joe, the owner, and were able to compliment him on his wonderful restaurant.

I was not as thrilled to try this place because I thought it was going to be yet another typical breakfast place just like all the rest.  I just hate going out to battle the Sunday breakfast crowds just to have the same ole' omelet or other run-of-the-mill breakfast item that tastes the same as every other place.\n\nI convinced myself that the parking situation was going to be a complete clusterfuq like it is at just about any other trendy breakfast spot in Scottsdale, but it was quite the opposite.  There is ample free parking and we found a spot without hassle.  I was surprised to see that the area actually wants people there instead of making it a complete pain to visit like some areas up north.  It just pisses me off when the idiots of Scottsdale rope off 100 more parking spots then they need and use it for valet parking.  Ok, my rant is over.\n\nAnyway, upon arrival at the Liberty Market there was a giant line and the place was real busy.  I expected this but was a bit pissed.  Luckily our friends saved us a place in line so it wasn't that bad.  I would advise coming as early as possible to avoid any crowds.  We ordered our food, took our seats and waited about 10-15 minutes for our food.  A bit long but it was expected because of how busy it was.\n\nTheir breakfast menu is not huge and had the staples as well as some unique items on it.  I ordered the Western Scramble and it was excellent!  I love meaty and cheesy when it comes to eggs and this was perfect.  I was a bit skeptical of the horseradish sauce that comes with it but I think it actually makes the meal.  It was an awesome combination.  My wife ordered the grilled vegetable scramble with egg whites and it was excellent as well.  We especially enjoyed the fresh biscuit and honey that came with our meals.  I also recommend the scone which our table shared.  The scones come with a side of fresh whip cream which was delightful.\n\nAnyway, I was a big fan of the breakfast and would definitely come back if I am in the area again come breakfast/brunch time.....or maybe even lunch time because their salads and sandwiches looked great!\n\nI am a big fan of that little stretch of Gilbert Road and there are a few other places along it I would like to try in the near future.

Breakfast at Liberty was absolutely outstanding!\n\nThe Zombie Girl and I had an errand to run in downtown Gilbert this morning, so I suggested we try Liberty.  I'm a huge Joe's Farm Grill fan, and I've been to LM once before, long ago, but never for breakfast.  The joint was packed when we arrived and we almost headed to the joint next door, but grabbed a couple of open seats at the counter and were served immediately.  I had the basic breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, biscuit & potatoes.  Zombie Girl had some fancier scrambled affair.  Everything was heavenly.  Scrambled eggs rarely excite me, but these were just so.. perfect.  Fluffy, fresh, flavorful.  The bacon was great (and Brak loves bacon and is a huge bacon critic - this was definitely top-shelf stuff).  Pototaes were great.  And, the service was super-friendly, fast, informative, talkative, and really made us feel happy to be there.  LM is definitely getting into our regular weekend breakfast rotation.

Moist layers with just the right amount of spice. Loved the cream cheese frosting and 4 layers. We also had the zebra brownies, which was a chocolate cream cheese layered brownie and the salt river bar. The salt river bar was not what I expected (in a good way). It had a saltine bottom and delicious butterscotch and chocolate layers. Not very sweet, I wish I had ordered coffee to go with it but was full from the bottomless soft drinks (BTW, thanks for having Coke Zero, my fave drink).  \n\nThe chef came out and the servers came to check on us frequently. One of the nicest surprises was when the owner's daughter came by and checked on us. I said that I wish I had enough room to have a slice of red velvety cake but was stuffed.  I had noticed everyone around us had red velvet cake. She said it was a crowd favorite.  The very next moment she brought us a huge piece of the 4 layers of goodness!  She packaged it up and still brought us forks \"just in case\" we wanted to lingerand  try it. It was again the perfect balance. I don't like the really sweet type of red velvet cakes you get here in Texas.

However when you go to old town Gilbert to eat at Liberty Market, you find yourself transported to the \"olden days.\"  The area gives you a feel of what Gilbert was like decades ago.  Liberty Market provides fresh ingredients obtained from local markets.  I was told that they even have a garden of produce for their meals.   Below are some of the great dishes I've had the restaurant.\n\nSalmon BLT\nWhat a great twist on a classic sandwich.  I'm usually not a big fan of salmon, mainly because if cooked wrong, it can taste bland and dry.  However this grilled salmon was flaky, soft, moist, and melted in my mouth.  All the ingredients complemented each other and my taste buds were happy.   \n\nCaprese Salad\nWho knew a simple salad could taste so good.  Caprese is simply just mixed green, mozzarella, and tomatoes.   The large chunks of tomatoes and mozzarella gave a wonderful presentation to the platter.  The main thing I thought that set this salad apart was their balsamic vinaigrette.   The sweetness of the vinaigrette contrasted with the tangy tomatoes.  It's sweeter than the normal balsamic vinaigrette and a bit thicker than what I'm used to.  However that's the beauty of it.\n\nBread Pudding\nThis tastes essentially like a moist cake with real whipped cream.  A great dessert should satisfy my sweet tooth, but not so sweet that I can't take more than a few bites.  And this bread pudding gives me that please.  Great for a snack or to cap off a great meal to tend to your sweet tooth.  \n\n\nGreat food, interesting ambience, and be a part of the \"eat local\" crowd with Liberty Market.

The older gentleman who works there (my husband and I have had a lovely conversation with him before) was there again handing out menus as guests entered and we had another lovely conversation with him - we asked about the 'E61' name and he gave us the history of the Faeme E61 espresso machine one of the owners had brought over from Milan.. what an interesting story.  Needless to say, the espressos we had were outstanding - super dark and rich crema. The great thing we learned is that you can walk right up to the 'E61 Bar' and order your food/drink w/out having to wait in the long line (that is KEY to know!). Both our breakfast dishes were highly filling and very flavorful (their steak scramble is very tasty and I really like their honey biscuit). When the staff is continually friendly and prompt and their food is repeatedly tasty and filling - you are darn near 'as good as it gets'.", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-01-16", "type": "review"}

Juicy, meaty, and well seasoned. I also loved the pineapple relish that came on the side as part of the trio dip. Other two dip was ketchup and chipotle mayo/thousand island? or something that I didn't care too much for. We subbed the side of kettle chips for swt potato salad ($1 extra) which was pretty good. Kinda, sorta like candied yams but not as sweet. Pizza was eh. Could've used a bit more oven time to get some charred wood fire taste. I didn't really like the ricotta on the pizza either. Don't think I'll be trying pizza here again. \n\nI can't decide if I really liked the place or not. The burger was good but they also have good burgers at Joe's Farm Grill.

The roasted vegetables on the Farmer tasted fresh and were still vibrantly colored. The Rancher was the perfect blend of bleu cheese, beef and horseradish. Even the sides were delicious.

I noticed a sign that mentioned to order your food first before taking a seat. Now I'm even more impressed since they got us a table which allowed us to really figure out what we were doing.\n\nMy girlfriends and I split the salmon BLT and some other sandwich, I don't remember which one. We also got the kale salad and the sweet potato salad. My daughter got the cheese pizza. The food was good. Wish we had room for rice pudding.\n\nAs we were finishing up, one of the cooks came out and complimented us on our kids being so well-behaved.

I had to try and finish it all. The picnic salad is my favorite thing I've had here. I had it the first time for lunch and I had it again for dinner. A good solid salad and a good portion for 9 bucks. My boyfriend had the prime rib sandwich that the cashier told him was one of their sandwiches that sells out the quickest. Neither of us were really impressed with it, seemed like a regular french dip and the sweet potato salad side was not very good, he left most of it. \nWe ordered our friends the bread pudding which we all liked, and we had the red velvet cake which was dry and unexciting. Our friends also ordered the starter pizza with hummus which was pretty yummy but a little expensive for a bread based appetizer. I don't remember what they ordered and we didn't try their entrees but they seemed happy with them.\n\nSo, maybe we ordered the wrong things, the couple we were with love this place and also said breakfast here is awesome.

Also, they do not have a kids menu so keep that in mind.\n\nI got a steak, which was delicious with great flavor. My husband got a pizza with white sauce and we also got my daughter a cheese pizza. All of the food was good, and my daughter actually liked my husbands pizza more than her own, which was a nice surprise. We then had dessert, which we thankfully ordered while in line the first time. We had a Guinness cupcake and a Salt River Bar. The cupcake was good, nothing amazing, but the Salt River Bar was fantastic.\n\nI also love that they have drinks that are made and bottled ahead of time, so when you order one it comes right up in its own bottle. And the drinks I had (I can't remember which ones they were) were great.\n\nAnd, I love the bathroom there. I hate when you go to a cool place and go to the bathroom only to find that they have put zero effort into making it nice. It is a coed bathroom so keep that in mind, but it has closed off stalls so no worries. \n\nWe will be going back, maybe when it's just my husband and I.", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-02-07", "type": "review"}

The staff was nice, approached us several times to make sure we knew how to order and how the menu works. The food was expensive for what it was. I got a vegetable panini and it was OK.

Let's start with the environment. It's definitely edgy and different. It fits in with all the other trendy/hipster hangouts in the area, but seems to do it better than the others. Still, it's kinda annoying that this place like all the rest feel like they are trying too hard to be progressive. The staff weren't really all that helpful unless you directly assert yourself. I tried the lunch crabcakes, thinking that at $15 they were the marquis item on the menu. Wrong. They were pretty boring, and I think this is why they put Tabasco sauce in it...to take it up from boring to just ok. Also, the tables weren't really wiped down, so that bugged me as well. For all the hype, I just wasn't impressed at all. It's a place where people go who think this is the place to be, so they can overspend on food that's really nothing to write home about. Having said that, I will give it another try relatively soon just to check myself and give them a second chance.", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-12-06", "type": "review"}

When I finally found downtown Gilbert after moving to the east valley in 2008, I was searching for a restaurant that made me feel like home.  Thankfully I found Liberty Market and was welcomed with open arms immediately.  I was always greeted with a smile and the employees remembered my name.  \n\nThe only way I can think to describe the layout is innovative and exciting.  What other restaurant is showcased for their bathrooms?  Some of the individual bathrooms have recipes for some of the food written on the walls.  I can honestly say that this is the only time I have ever spent an extended amount of time in the bathroom.\n\nThe chef never rests on his laurels and has weekly and weekend specials that are always delicious.  My staples on the menu are the salmon BLT, the picnic salad, any pizza out of the wood fire oven, the roasted sweet potato salad, and the chai tea.  I've been told that they make the tea fresh from scratch and it is the best I have ever tasted.\n\nThe desserts change on a regular basis as well and they have some of the biggest cinnamon rolls and cakes I have ever seen.  One of the specials was sticky toffee pudding and it was to die for.  You get to look in the case while you stand in line so not some type of sweet treat is out of the question.\n\nI just love this restaurant and the owners!!  We are very lucky to have such a high quality restaurant in our own backyard.", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-12-07", "type": "review"}

We pick the Liberty Market over the other places in the area more often than not when we go to see a play at the theater. \n\nThe food ~ most everything is very fresh and taste very good.  I had most of their sandwiches, burgers and a few pizza's.  Everything is usually prepared very well.  On a few occasions we've been disappointed with their consistency of how some things are prepared but again overall a very good experience!  You should always try to save room for desert!  Their deserts are super delish especially their oatmeal and ice cream cookie and their carrot cake.  \n\nThe dinning experience ~ I'm not a fan of waiting in line to order then setting and waiting.  It's a self serve place, which is okay especially considering their prices are very reasonable.  The folks that work here are always very friendly.

This was not our first visit but each one has been consistently good. While waiting in line I watched the brick oven pizzas being made and asked which variety was being assembled since I liked the ingredients - thin crust with parmesan, mozzarella, bacon, chicken all baked in the hot brick oven and then topped with arugula when it came out - on the menu it is the White pizza, one of the more popular ones. Still waiting in line to order, I watched the salads being assembled. Again I asked which one was being prepared - chopped kale, chopped cabbage, jicama, a liberal dusting of finely grated cheese (which turned out to be cotija), dried chopped apricots, corn and then something that was clear yet hard and then broken into the salad (which turned out to be pumpkin seed brittle) - doh, that must be the chopped salad! When it was served and I took a forkful, there was some heat in the dressing. I found out that Chef adds a bit of cayenne to it - just enough to pique your taste buds but not so much that it numbs it. Hubby had the baby back ribs which came with coleslaw and fingerling potatoes. There were enough ribs for two servings. I found my pizza and salad were both light enough and the right combination that I finished both. Hubby needed a takeout box for his ribs though. The waitstaff is very friendly and Chef goes around from table to table greeting all the guests. He's done that everytime we've been and I find that to be very welcoming and personable. Not seeing that we had any dessert, he asked if we had ordered one yet. No, I said, but welcome any recommendations since this was our wedding anniversary. He congratulated us and insisted that we have the coconut cream pie - on the house. Hubby and I shared the large slice that Chef brought to the table and it was delicious. So while I still don't like having to stand in line to order, the atmosphere and the friendliness of the Chef as he makes his rounds made it an enjoyable evening.

I wouldn't recommend going here if you're absolutely starving. If you've never been before, it's not the type of place where you walk in and get seated by a host or hostess. You walk in, grab a menu, and wait in a line until you reach the register. The part that I do like is that you can see the food being made in front of you and everything looked so good, I sort of needed the additional time to choose from all the options. I felt bad for my boyfriend because he definitely didn't expect to wait as long as we did and he looked like he was going to pass out from starvation. We hadn't eaten breakfast and it was going on lunch time. Once you pay at the resister, you can finally sit at a table, but I think the employees purposely slow the line down because they can't seat people until tables open up. We actually ordered an Oatmeal Cream Pie since we saw it in the pastry window by the register and assumed they would give it to us right away. After all, I was afraid my boyfriend was about to pass out. Unfortunately, they brought it out with the rest of the food so it was kind of a waste, but luckily it was still pretty tasty.\n\nI decided to try the Red Bean and Rice Burger (red bean and rice patty, Cajun spices, Monterey Jack, red onion, shredded iceberg, grilled sesame roll, and dip trio). I liked the burger, but I got sick of it after a while. I think the patty is too basic and could use some vegetables or something. My boyfriend ordered from the breakfast menu even though it was after 1 pm. If you're able to grab a breakfast menu at the front and you end up getting stuck in like till after 1 pm like we did, they'll still make you breakfast which is really nice. He ordered the Smothered Breakfast Burrito (eggs, grilled chicken breast, cheddar cheese, salsa casera, Liberty potatoes, flour tortilla, smothered with tomatillo and chile pequin sauce) and it was really delicious. I actually liked his meal way better than mine even though I'm usually a big fan of vegetarian burgers. Additionally, I tried the Mojito and thought it was pretty refreshing. \n\nI would definitely give this place another shot, but I wouldn't necessarily jump at the chance to either (mainly because of the line situation). On the other hand, some of the Yelp pictures for this restaurant look pretty enticing and I love that everything is really fresh, so it's possible I could change my mind. Their Sicilian style pizzas look pretty good and would likely be the next item on my list of things to try if I decided to go back again.", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-02-03", "type": "review"}

It's always a battle between Press and Jolta - my coffee shops away from home.\n\n4 stars, bravo!", "business_id": "I2_yeLfTzXHGwi8an0tL4w", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-02-02", "type": "review"}
