Yeah, so I moved into a modest studio apartment at 52nd Street and Van Buren. It builds character. Sure, it was western exposure and I couldn't afford to run the AC. Shows endurance. And I learned to spend what little money I made wisely. Fiscal conservatism rocks! Well, part of that meant finding a cheap and nearby place to wash my chonies and other clothes. Finding good eats was coincidental. Every Saturday morning, I'd set my VCR to record X-Men Generation, loaded up my Sportage with a week's worth of dirty clothes and headed to the laundromat at 48th and VB. Initially, I'd stroll on over to the Circle K during the wash cycle, get something that was certain to introduce me to my toilet after the spin cycle and that was about normal. One day, I bravely headed north and stumbled upon Phx House of Pizza and Subs. Like a mirage in the desert, it called out to me with intriguing smells of delishness. It was lust at first sight. The 2 slices of pizza would keep me filled until afternoon and were amazingly tasty. Truly, I found happiness.\n\nAnd so it was, a Saturday ritual whilest my clothing was being laundered I succumbed to the garlicky goodness that is PHOPS. Sadly, I found love and moved to the other side of town and it seemed I was watching an endearing lover grow smaller in my rear view mirror as I drove on. :sigh: I did know what good, economically-friendly dining was.
