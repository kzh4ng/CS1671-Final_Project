Come in on a lazy Sunday morning, get the Nothin' Fancy, and you will see for yourself just how good tofu can be.

Plus, sandwiches!

It's a little out of the way, but once we got there, it's exactly the kind of place I want to live close to. It's spacious and relaxed; we sat there for two hours after eating our lunch and were not at all pressured to move on. It had a very good neighborhood vibe, and everyone working there knew the place and the area really well.\nThe drink options were pretty great- the coffee was just fine, but the ginger lemonade I ordered a couple hours after lunch was phenomenal. I wish I could have that more often. The food was great; there are lots of options and the portion sizes were exactly what I wanted. I had the Dagwood sandwich, which was a perfect mix of sweet, sour, and spicy with hummus, apples, hot peppers, cucumbers, and pickles... it came with an option of the side, and I had to try the mockamole. A big fan of guacamole myself, I was totally in doubt of a green pea-based mock version. I also really like peas, though, so I was open. And somehow they managed to make it work, and it really did taste very much like guac, with a slightly less heavy and maybe a bit grainier texture. But definitely worth a try. My friend had a wrap with curry and tofu and I honestly don't remember what else, but it was huge and really tasty.

They have rotating flavors and an excellent selection of specialty coffee drinks. They have a wide variety of flavored syrups and a few sugar free flavors. I haven't personally tried the food they offer but during a recent conversation with a barista, I found out that most of the food is homemade! The menu is also rotating with fresh offerings such as: pepperoni rolls, meatball subs, pulled pork sandwiches, tortilla soup, cookies & muffins. The prices for food & drink are very reasonable! Trust me :) \n\nTo pair nicely with the food & drink choices, the staff is incredibly personable! Even though I don't stop down often, one of the main baristas remembers my exact order! Now that's great service and quite the memory! \n\nSo, my yelping friends, next time you need your morning cup-o-joe or a mid-day pick me up, skip the Starbucks line & head over to Cool beans!", "business_id": "xMekAmDsCdhk21Buf9ucSQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-08-28", "type": "review"}

The kid (he knows nothing about customer service let alone food service) put the containers with the watery, rotting celery back in the case, to serve to other unsuspecting customers!

Does chicken salad hold a week in your fridge?  Also, whenever they lose an employee, they just shuffle their schedule and close at 6 pm for a few months.  They should be open till 10 pm as it is, with all the foot traffic in the neighborhood, especially in the summer. My guess is they see this place as nothing more than a loss leader for the bar they own next door.

I'll just say I received an order of hummus that was watery and had rotting celery in it.  Tried to get another and 3 or 4 of the orders in the case were all in the same condition.

I spend a lot of time there studying,  and I find the baristas (do they call people who work at coffee shops that aren't Starbucks that??) there to be just about the unhappiest lot I've ever encountered.  I try not to fault them TOO much for this, as I've worked retail before (though never food service, and I am completely aware that food service may very well be worse), and they probably deal with a lot of grade A d-bags (am I allowed to say that here?) in Shadyside.  But still.  I always go out of my way to be polite to them, and I come in nearly everyday, despite the coffee (which I agree is very 'meh'... watery and just basically pretty average, if not slightly below) and HORRIBLE pastries/desserts.  (Seriously, they taste like they've been around since the place opened.)  But never a flash of recognition, of any sort of 'hey this girl's usually pretty nice and polite so maybe when she quite benignly asks for a cup of ice in addition to her $4 iced soy-vanilla latte+tip, I shouldn't practically roll my eyes at her.'  Nothing like that.\n\nSo, why do I come here everyday?  For the same reason other people must come here, too... the people-watching and melding of inside/outsideness in the place.  It IS pretty lame that the internet isn't free, and especially with how Crazy Mocha has apparently hopped onboard with UPMC to takeover the city, you'd think CTR would at least want to keep up with the competition.  But, with a purchase, you still get 2 hours access, so that does go a bit of a ways in making up for it.\n\nIn terms of the wait for tables, I've never found it to be quite as bad as a few on here have said.  I've never had to wait longer than 3 or 4 minutes for a table, and especially if you're by yourself and only have a book or something, people are generally pretty nice about letting you share their table until one opens up.  \n\nSo, in summary, if you are a coffee snob, this probably isn't your place... if you're any other kind of snob, though, make sure you walk by the place a few times with your oversized sunglasses, gladiator sandals, & Sephora bag, carrying your Cavalier King Charles Spaniel puppy in your purse, so us scrubby kids taking up tables in the Coffee Tree have a chance to gawk at you for awhile.", "business_id": "1qUYk564SajvwTtkNM6KJA", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-07-22", "type": "review"}

So I can't really complain about such trivialities as parking (parking sucks all around here, so while the complaints are valid, I couldn't care less) and the fact that it gets crowded and busy. More on that in a bit. But when you walk into a particular Starbucks and the baristas not only know what you favor every day - in my case, a grande Misto w/non-fat milk - but also have it ready before you reach the wait counter.\n\nThe great news about this location is the recent renovation, which sucked for me considering I was without a workday coffee fix for exactly 10 business days, and when you have to rely on that shitty-assed Keurig-brewed coffee I have to endure at home, or force yourself to walk from Gateway to N. Tryon on a spectacularly and stupidly hot afternoon, which, by the way, I'd rather suck on a wet and frayed towel than have to walk 6 city blocks in 95-degree weather just for a delicious cup of coffee...oh shit, where was I? The renovation, right. The biggest complaint was the lack of space at this location, and when folks were getting their fix between 8-10am and 2-4pm, you know this spot would get crazy crowded, and you really couldn't move around without accidently brushing someone's ass, and then have to wait for some slow poke to finish languidly stirring their mocha choca latta yay extra soy 5-pump coffee, it got pretty frustration. Thankfully, the renovation has not just created a better use of space - there's a nice and cozy sitting spot in the back - but it's even cheerful-looking, in a rustic sort of way. \n\nAnd then there's Sarah, the shift manager, a pint-sized, smart-ass (I love smart-asses) that runs a tight ship but makes everyone feel like they're the most important customer ever.

It's a short bike ride from the 53597 and the Alterra Coffee (or is it Colectivo now, I'm so confused) they serve beats the pants off of what you can get from the neighboring Starbucks.  \n\nI wish the outdoors seating area took advantage of the nearby Pheasant Branch Conservancy.  Sipping coffee and watching the locals pick-up their dry-cleaning just isn't the vibe I'm looking for I guess.  \n\nI can't vouch for the breakfast or lunch selections, since I'm just a coffee and baked goods sort of guy.  As for baked goods, I've had some excellent scones and muffins at Prairie.  Like scream it from the rooftop great.  But not every time.  Just when I'm ready to proclaim Prairie my go to coffee and a scone hangout, I get a scone that's as dry as Atacama Desert.  And since I'm dropping some decent coin here, I want better consistency.\n\nThings I like:\n * Love the staff here. Even when the place is getting slammed by waves of morning commuters looking for their sugar and caffeine fix, I always get a smile and courteous service.\n *  Always love me some free wi--fi.  Never had a problem connecting or with download speeds.\n * The noise level indoors always seems to be a soft murmur, with some relaxing music wafting in the background.  Never had a problem carrying on a conversation with my table mates.\n * When the FDA approves Alterra Coffee for intravenous use, I'll be first in line.  There are always are four or five roasts to choose from and I've never had a skunky cup.\n\nThings I don't\n *The \"cash only\" thing was so hip in the 18th century, but it's 2013 now.  Start taking plastic, people.\n * The baked goods are not inexpensive.  It's usually worth it, but it's annoying as hell when I lose the muffin lottery.\n\nIt's a solid three star option with lots of upside if the bakery improves its consistency.", "business_id": "ShEYKerTwb2LSORE5o_s7A", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-08-28", "type": "review"}

Considering there are at least 4-5 other cafes/coffee shops in the vicinity, there must be something special about JBC that draws such a consistent customer base. I set off to find out!\n\nFirst impression? JBC is pure hipster. More hipster than tight jean shorts and handlebar mustaches.  I think my hipster level rose a few points just standing in line to order my coffee, and I love it! If only I could absorb lecture material that easily.\n\nI ordered the iced latte (easy on the ice), and found it to be much creamier than I am used to (probably because I usually get my lattes with skim or nonfat milk), but it was reallllyyy good and SUPER filling. My only issue with my drink wasn't the drink itself, but rather the paper cup that it came in. By the time I was half way through my drink, the cup had become a soggy mess that was barely holding its shape (which meant the lid wasn't staying on very well either). I ended up having to down the rest of my coffee quickly to prevent spilling on myself. So, JBC, new cups perhaps?\n\nI like the fact the JBC coffee has two separate windows for placing orders and picking up orders. It prevents the congregation of a large crowd in front of the cart which makes it difficult to distinguish between those waiting to pick up and those waiting to order. Do expect the drinks to take a little longer than usual though, unless you just order a brewed coffee - there's only two people managing the espresso machine.", "business_id": "yg-a8RuKe-_uiPyrwmGogA", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-07-26", "type": "review"}

They've posted a long letter on the wall about how nothing can be done about the flies in the pastry case because it isn't safe to use insecticide near pastry.  OK... maybe that time could be spent to kill the flies and keep the pastry case closed?  They act like flies are an insurmountable puzzle never before encountered by anyone else.  Try a flyswatter.

They have a grinder but it's manual and when manual grinders are used improperly they make horrible espresso... \n\nBasically if you can get past the really really bad coffee then go here, but I can't. \n\nIf only we could combine Aroma Cafe and Cafe Kopi.

I originally tried this place out because I got some coupons on the back of my Schnucks receipt (medium espresso or chai drink for $1.85/$2 off a sandwich or salad).\n\nI've become a slave to Starbucks over the past few years because there simply weren't any good local cafes where I lived (unless I felt like driving 30 miles away).  Cafe Kopi is exactly what I want from a cafe, and I'm happy to finally have a local coffee shop that is actually worth supporting.\n\nTheir coffee drinks are tasty, and their chai tastes like it's freshly brewed (though I can't be sure if they actually use a mix...I'll probably ask because I'm really curious).  I tried the Matty Pooh Pita today with honey chipotle pasta salad on the side and it was delicious (also, the plating was beautiful!).  I thought the pasta salad might be weird, but it sounded interesting and turned out to be pretty awesome.  The pita was served open-faced, with tons of hummus and sliced tomato, cucumber, and lettuce.  The hummus to veggie ratio was a little lopsided--I would have appreciated more veggies--but nonetheless it was a damn good meal.  Plus there were a couple tasty pieces of fruit on the side as garnish, which I happily devoured.\n\nFood and drink aside, Cafe Kopi is just a great place to hang out.  My boyfriend and I like to play games (Scrabble, Sumoku, UNO...etc) and there is PLENTY of seating with tables of various sizes.  The atmosphere is cozy and it's just a lovely place to spend some time.\n\nMusic selection is kind of weird (whiny sounding hipster music?  not sure how to describe it) but it's not too loud, so it's easy to tune out.\n\nBasically: I really like this place.  If I didn't have to pay for metered parking mon-fri I would probably be here everyday.", "business_id": "yzInxReAkf7r0aRbwj02Yw", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-07-23", "type": "review"}

I ordered the iced Cafe Miel (a single shot latte with honey and vanilla) after reading some other Yelpers' reviews.  After talking with the barsta, she assured me that it was good both hot and cold.  I thoroughly enjoyed it as I read my book on this quiet Sunday morning.

I recently returned to Phoenix after spending a few years in Oregon and when I stopped into Hava Java, not only did I recognize the barista behind the counter, but she recognized me, too.  That is pretty impressive after a couple years.  After talking with her for a while, it turns out that the owner takes really good care of his employees (full benefits, etc.) and they have very little turnover there.  She said that they have only lost one person since I have been away.  That is impressive for a coffee shop.  \n\nTheir espresso is pretty good and according to my wife, their tea is the best she's had in town.

I completely understand, as I had a very similar experience! I went this morning to use a $10 certificate that I had purchased for $4 through a daily deal.  I usually love discovering new places this way because it gives you a chance to spend less money at a new place and decide if you like it or not. And I've made the assumption that owners are happy to see customers with a coupon because it means the marketing they chose worked and new people are coming in.  You would THINK they would want to make a good first impression. But not the Coffee Lady! I came in and ordered an egg salad sandwich. She went to her fridge to get some egg salad and said \"The tuna and chicken are a lot more filling if you want that, but we are famous for our egg salad.\"  I wasn't sure if she wanted me to change my order, or if she was just making conversation, but it seemed like an odd statement to me and I started doubting my order, but I didn't say anything.  The next thing I heard was \"Ah, this is kind of skimpy, let me add another egg.\"  And when I looked over, I could see that the container she had pulled out with egg salad was nearly empty, which clearly meant she was using yesterday's leftovers (as it was 8 in the morning when I came in), and I was a bit disappointed that the egg salad isn't made fresh daily. She literally peeled and added an egg right into what was left. I was just surprised at how nonchalant she was. Then I ordered a latte, since I knew I had to use up my $10. The latte was good (nothing out of the ordinary) and she was very friendly to me while making my drink. But then it came time to pay...and when I pulled out my coupon she said \"Oh, one of THOSE....great, I have to start my day off with one of those, huh?\" WOW! Talk about poor customer service. If you don't want to get new customers into your store at a discount, then why did you agree to the deal???  Her attitude was a total turn off...So then she added up my two items and said \"OK, you're just under $10 but you do have to pay tax, which is $.84 and that doesn't include a tip either, if you care.\"  (and this was as I was putting a cash tip in her jar, which she did NOT deserve, and I kicked myself for doing that, though CLEARLY she is hurting if she's that upset that I'm using a coupon, and VOICING that it doesn't include the tip). Then she had the gull to inquire if I lived nearby because she wanted me as a return customer. UNBELIEVABLE. I will NEVER go to this place again. Even if they HAD the best egg salad sandwiches or coffee in town, which they DON'T (and wouldn't you know, I ended up with an egg shell in my sandwich), I wouldn't go back.  \nI do not like to be negative and truly do have better things to do with my time, but I don't appreciate being treated badly or differently for trying a new place on a budget.", "business_id": "e_kbfiEZ87L-ZryMZxvJkA", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-07-22", "type": "review"}

Very friendly and warm. Each guest was greeted enthusiastically and seemed to get their java fix efficiently. I'm by no means a coffee expert, but this was a good cup of the liquid bean. My local coffee haunt favorites are Copper Star and Lux. This is just below that. And just out of my hood. Not a bad place. Not a great place. But, hey, don't tell Mama on me. Oh. And don't even think about talking on your cell at the counter. I hear Mama will ground you.", "business_id": "Mb46iSlA4qmTwXf-WrqtQA", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-06-24", "type": "review"}

The night before, I had put my debit card, cash and ID in my pocket to go to a show, and forgot to transfer them back to my wallet.  I didn't realize this until I had placed and received my order. The woman behind the counter said \"don't worry about it, you win some and you lose some\" and then the woman behind me offered to pay for my drink. I dug into my wallet and gave them all of the change I had, which probably amounted to 32 cents.

Based on it's location, it seemed like it might be less pretentious than some of it's other centrally-located peers.  After several visits, I am glad to give it five stars for being one of my favorite coffee shops in the Phoenix area.\n\nOn my first visit here, I immediately noticed two things: 1) the roasting equipment and raw beans displayed prominently, indicating that they did indeed roast their own beans and 2) the prices, which are lower than the average coffee shop (I'm thinking Starbucks, which came to prominence with a reputation for high prices but has really fallen into the middle of the pack compared with the better local places that have cropped up) and far lower than most gourmet shops.  True, you're not getting a pour over for each cup, but you know that it was freshly roasted (and ground) and it's less than $2 a cup.  The beans are the real deal, though: $10.95/lb for freshly roasted, delicious coffee beans?  I know some good places for coffee but none of them can even touch that price, most hovering closer to $15/16 per lb.\n\nAlthough I usually go for regular coffee when exploring a new place, I decided to get a latte on that first trip visit, which did not disappoint - good smooth espresso flavor and the right ratio of milk for me.  The next time that I stopped in, I asked a few questions about the beans and bought a cup of coffee.  After some debate, I went with their Bold roast, which I later found out is also their espresso roast.  While it makes for a good espresso, I found it fairly light for a \"bold\" cup of coffee, and after adding just a splash of cream it tasted somewhat watered down.  In the future I'd probably go with one of their other roasts, particularly the Double French.  This is a mix between their dark Sumatra roast and Tanzanian peaberry.  I was a little concerned when I purchased it, as the barista told me to \"wait for the oils to come out on the beans.\" Though I don't know a ton about coffee, one of the things I thought I knew was that oily beans = ruined beans, but after making it at home on a French press, it quickly entered my upper echelon of coffees.  I also picked up some single source Guatemalan while I was there, a brighter and somewhat less flavorful roast, but still excellent.\n\nCompared to many of the other places in town, this place is perhaps a bit dumpy, but it's got good character and the baristas are super friendly and helpful.  They display art in the store and even have a special night for it each month (Second Saturdays?)  It's also very quiet and has outdoor tables, so I could imagine getting some work done there unlike more popular and louder shops.  I'll definitely be getting beans and drinks from this place in the future.", "business_id": "4eFIVmbeCvJGCrhzmd-VYA", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-08-02", "type": "review"}

Ok, sub ham for turkey and jack for pepperjack. Then he tells me they're out of iced coffee....now sure how, but fine...I picked something else.

If they're out of something, it's \"we don't have that,\" no apologies, or suggestions for anything else. No one seems to enjoy working there. \nOrders are often wrong. And baristas in the drive-thru don't seem to keep track of whose drink is whose. Orders made inside are sometimes forgotten, and I've had to ask for my drink or pastry multiple times.

This morning, even when she saw I was struggling to reach, she could not be bothered to extend her arm further (it was still half bent & she was standing away from the window just staring at me).  She did not issue a \"hello\", a \"how are you\", a \"have a nice day\", or a \"thank-you for coming\". Instead of greeting the customer with a smile, she looked like she was in an episode of \"mean girls\" and was very condescending and snotty.

Coffee Rush has always been a favorite place of mine, and I've never had any trouble with the staff.  \n\nAfter just a few visits here, the staff learned my drink preferences.  And when I say \"the staff\" I mean everyone I've ever ordered from.  Nathan, Stefano, and Bethany just can't be beat at their customer service.  Over the time I've been coming here they've actually taken the time to get to know me a little, and that's refreshing.  If I miss a Monday night, one of them is always quick to point out that I haven't been.  This is only surprising because Coffee Rush seems to have SO MANY regulars; it's wonderful that everyone here really does try to get to know you.\n\nThe menu has a lot of really wonderful drinks on it, from lattes to Italian sodas, and more types of tea than you can shake a stick at.  They're always willing to recommend a drink if you're in the mood for something different, and I've never had a bad drink.  My recommendation?  A first-time Rusher should get the black and white (hot, iced, or frost it's delicious).  I'm currently on a chai kick, but I order it with soy instead of milk for a little added flavor.  Delish!\n\nThere's not a huge food selection: mostly breakfast pastries and desserts, but it's all good.  They usually have a few different varieties of cheesecake, from the traditional to the utterly decadent.  However, if you're feeling a bit peckish, they won't frown upon you bringing in your own food.  Just don't bring your own drink.\n\nMondays are double-punch days, so there's extra incentive to go!  They're usually quite busy in the evenings on Mondays, but the staff has always been willing and able to accommodate our relatively large group when we go.\n\nWiFi is available with the purchase of any drink, or you can choose to get a computer code that lets you access the Mac minis in the back.  Codes expire after three hours, which I find to be more than reasonable.\n\nHours are great--open early in the morning until midnight, with a last call for drinks at 11pm.  The view is stunning, and there's outdoor seating (good for smokers and anyone willing to brave the Arizona heat) and indoor seating to spare.\n\nMost of the one and two-star reviews mention customer service, which I can somewhat understand.  My tip?  Order a drink before you sit down.  It's common courtesy.  Would you sit down in a restaurant for an hour before you were ready to order your meal?  No.  Coffee Rush is usually super busy when I go, so the staff is intent upon making sure everyone has an opportunity to get seated.  If you order a drink, they'll let you loiter for a LONG time.  So...just order a drink and you'll be fine. :)\n\nCoffee Rush is one of the things I will miss most about Arizona if/when I decide to leave.", "business_id": "l1MZjZK2tLxfFRB62lQmsg", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-06-19", "type": "review"}

I can always appreciate local, small coffee shops and am always looking for new environments to get my studying done. I had been to Coffee Rush several times before, and usually order something directly off the \"favorites\" menu for convenience. When I first got to the coffee shop this morning, I decided to sit down and study a little before I ordered a drink. The barista behind the counter appeared outgoing, interacted well with the customers, and worked quickly to make drinks. I particularly appreciated when a customer asked him to create a drink of the barista's choosing, and the barista gladly made something interesting for him. After about 30 minutes, the barista directly spoke to me over the back counter while I was studying and asked me to \"Come on up.\" I was a little confused-- was I obliged to buy a drink right away before I was allowed to sit down to study? I had full intention of buying a drink... I just didn't want one RIGHT now. I didn't want to be rude and it would have been awkward if I just ignored him, so I went up to the line to make a purchase. When I got to the front counter, I asked the barista if they made Jasmine tea lattes. He threw a bunch of jargon at me like \"London fogs\" and different styles of lattes, and gave me a judgmental look when I told him I wasn't familiar with the terms. I proceeded to suggest that he make a recommendation or come up with something tasty because I wasn't picky, but instead, he tells me aggressively that I needed to tell him exactly what was in the drink. For the third time I tell him I don't know what's in it, and explain that I just usually ordered a drink called \"Jasmine tea latte\" when I go to places like Coffee Bean. That's probably when I hit the wrong button. At this point, he condescendingly tells me he does not 'frequent that place' and still cannot tell me how to make the drink that I request. I'm standing there uncomfortably while a bunch of people are waiting behind me. Instead of doing his job, which I thought was creating drinks and coming up with new combinations/flavors, he forces me to just buy a drink that I didn't even want from the wall menu just to get the line going. And I thought he created a new drink for the other guy in front of me?! I didn't appreciate being spoken to that way by an unprofessional and pretentious employee, so I left as soon as I got my unwanted drink. I'm sitting here now at Coffee Bean writing this bad review and plan on ordering myself a Jasmine Tea Latte.", "business_id": "l1MZjZK2tLxfFRB62lQmsg", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-07-25", "type": "review"}

I'm giving them a firm 3.5 stars.\n\nI was really wowed by breakfast (working breakfast - always fun anyway). They make these amazing breakfast potatoes that, well ... Jim W and Abby W would have gone nuts over.\n\nThen came dinner with fellow Yelpers Marian and Kevin H. It was a really enjoyable dinner. Jim W and I split a burger and a chicken pizza. The company was terrific and the only dark spot on the evening was when the woman at the counter informed me that they don't make grilled onions for their burgers. I was really surprised by a place of this quality not offering cooked onions as a burger option.\n\nLast came my lunch meeting and the reason I've downgraded Liberty Market half a star. I was debating between the chicken sandwich and egg salad when I happened to notice that they offered caramelized onions on one of the sandwiches. Suddenly the burger appeared to be a viable option. Here's how that went:\n\nme: \"I'd like the tower burger - medium - with cheddar, bacon and caramelized onions.\"\n\nher: \"We don't have caramelized onions.\"\n\nme: \"They're on the menu for the rancher.\"\n\nher: \"That's at another counter.\"\n\nme: \"I beg your pardon?\"\n\nher: \"That's at a different counter.\" (this time with a bit of attitude)\n\n3rd employee at bar: (under her breath) \"We can do that.\"\n\nher: (after glare at 3rd employee) \"They'll be cold. They're for a cold sandwich.\"\n\n3rd employee at bar: (slightly louder this time) \"We can heat them up.\"\n\nWhen the burger arrived there were no onions to be seen. 3rd employee happened to be the one who brought the food and when I pointed that out to her the irritation was apparent. She looked at me, as sincerely as she could, and told me that she would have them heated and out to me as soon as possible.\n\nNow, I have to say that the tower burger is absolutely fantastic with caramelized onions and they should ALWAYS offer it that way. Once I had my burger the way I wanted it I really enjoyed the meal. But, seriously, it's at another counter?! I can't imagine anyone refusing to walk ten feet to make a customer happy.

The piece I tried had a pleasing-to-the-eye golden color to it, as well as a few lovely-looking cherries.  Wished there were more in the batter-- those cherries you see on the edges were pretty much the only ones I had (the middle was almost void of any!).  I originally had turned down the accompanying homemade whipped cream (sweetened w/ powdered sugar), but the scone was, as is usually par for the course, a bit dry (don't forget sorely lacking enough cherries!) and needed something extra.

So I venture up to the counter to inquire about my pudding and literally get accosted by a woman who starts following me like a rent-a-cop and *shouting* 'SIR!  SIR!  DO YOU NEED SOMETHING?!  SIR, DO YOU NEED SOMETHING?!'  Seriously, my first thought is 'who the hell is this woman?'  Ah, apparently some sort of manager.  Not the best demeanor to approach and address customers.  A few minutes later as I'm eating my pudding and thoroughly engrossed in reading something, the same voice begins *shouting* again from ten feet away, 'HOW DO YOU LIKE YOUR PUDDING?!'  and repeats herself because my look upward isn't to respond but to see who's being addressed and why is someone shouting at them?\n\nOverall, I was not impressed by the staff.\n\nI do plan on returning one more time in the future, only because the menu is so intriguing that I am curious to see if some other entree can be tasty enough to overcome the faults in this first visit.", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-06-25", "type": "review"}

Service, food, decor all excellent.  Everyone else who is offering reviews is doing a nice job of talking about the food so I am going to mention a few different items of interest.  But about the food I will just quickly mention if you are having breakfast it may sound unusual but get the meatball as a side dish. It blew me away. \nNot only does Liberty market offer Gilbert residents quality food, they do it at a reasonable price.  For a long time the Johnson family has been giving away free meals once a year at their flagship restaurant Joe's BBQ, right across the street.  In keeping with that tradition of bringing residents together they are offering a \"Community Dinner\" at Liberty.  The concept being that 30 residents can sign up for a dinner consisting of 5 or more courses including a chef's surprise course.  All for one very affordable price. The community part is that they sit you at a table of 6 or so offering diners an opprutunity to get aquinted with thier neighbors.  The dinner is limited to just 30 people on a frist come, first serve basis. Wonderful idea.  Earlier I was bragging about how good the meatball's are. I understand they have a Meatball sandwich which is not on the menu. Also not on the menu is a breakfast burger which is only served on the week ends between 11 and 1.  Not only does this dish sound wonderful but a menu item that is only available 4 hours a week has a strong allure for me.  While I was leaving I was looking at the pictures on the wall and I noticed that the family was pictured outside of the famous Culinary Institute of America Greystone.   I noticed that my waiter was pictured and after tracking him down again I find out that he was a family member, Willie Johnson, how unpretentious.  So that explains some of the good food.

I'm sure I've skimmed your edges, or skirted just around you many times in the past. Sometimes maybe even on purpose. Sorry. You've probably seen me drive by and thought - \"There goes that prick again. Who does he think he is?\" But you're miles away. We don't have any friends inside you. You lacked a compelling draw to pull us out of our mid-town cocoon. Until now. So I hope we can put the past behind us and shed our preconceptions about each other and just move on with our relationship. So...\n\nLIBERTY MARKET\nWhat a refreshing, rewarding surprise. A hip, family-friendly, easy-going place to get great food and beverages in a clean, clever setting. The website hinted at its authenticity, but how many times does that fail you??\n\nOn the street, it's a nifty setting that harkens back to an Americana that I grew up with in the midwest: water tower, mid-century neon diner signage, real brick, public sidewalks intended for human use, trees, etc. But the building itself is a clean juxtaposition of modern worked into a cool old (by PHX standards) building. Old brick meets steel beams and open space. Everything is functional, not just there to look cool. From the structurally relevant beams to the authentic wood-fired oven, it all serves a real purpose.\n\nWe (me, wife and 9mo old daughter) chose our seats at the pizza oven counter and clamped on our baby's magical floaty chair. We immediately struck up a rapport with James, at the oven, and learned that almost everyone we encountered, other than customers, were his family and friends. That's pretty cool. We've now been several times and the food has never let us down. In fact, we've been drawn back almost weekly on our little pilgrimage to keep exploring the menu. I don't see a James Beard award in the future, unless they give one for consistently delicious, honest comfort food. But we're all happy to drive out of our way for a visit that puts a smile on our faces every time.\n\nTHAT CHRISTIAN THING\nNow, to address something that really shouldn't matter, but often does to many people: \"The Christian Thing\". Due to the amount of interest in Agritopia and its \"Bible-based design\", I think most people know going in that this is a Joe Johnston place (Joe's Farm Grill, Real BBQ and now LM) and he's pretty open about his beliefs. I'm sure to the surprise of many who would avoid establishments that clearly identify as one religion or another, there is nothing in-your-face or proselytizing or patronizing about this place's pretty public Christian identity. If anything, the experience speaks volumes about the honesty of their description of their beliefs on the Liberty Market website. Yes, when you know about it going into it, you feel the presence of their faith. But all in a good way.\n\nI almost feel like bringing this aspect of it up was unnecessary, but at the same time, I think it needed to be brought up; simply because of how many people I've talked to who immediately jumped on that angle - \"oh, the Bible Thumper enclave in Gilbert\", or \"sounds kinda Stepford-ish\", etc. If you just wandered in without any background info I think your takeaway would just be - \"Now that was a friendly group of people and a great meal.\"\n\nOh, and check out the bathrooms. It's fun.\n\n\nSo for what it is: friendly, sincere, fresh, honest, well-thought out, comfy, delicious, consistent, complete and did I mention friendly? - 5 stars.", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-07-29", "type": "review"}

Today's burger was the wasabi burger, and being a fan of foods with kick, I was thinking about this burger since yesterday. It almost makes me cry to say I was underwhelmed by it. It was a burger with a creamy horseradishy sauce on it, and you got a little wasabi flavor, but it lacked that kick you get from eating wasabi. It also had an Asian salad mixture on the burger as well. Don't get me wrong, it was tasty, but when I think that I paid $11 for that and a side of potato chips, I feel a little slighted. If you eat ten of their burgers over the course of the month you can get a $25 gift card (save your receipts).

Furthermore, it was a quick and comfortable experience for my morning coffee needs.  Coffee was pretty good too.\n\nVisit #2: Lunch meeting with colleagues.

I ordered the Arizona Sky, which was a tasty ham sandwich, and enjoyed a wonderful sweet potato salad on the side.  The sandwich, with a cup of coffee, was roughly $9 if memory serves correctly.  While quite tasty, I hope the lunch prices come down as more worthy competition enters the market.  So, overall, great place for an occasional change of pace, but not something I'd do frequently. \n\nVisit #3: Another coffee meeting.  This time, I was feeling a little like having a snack, so I thought it was great that we were in a \"market.\"  And this is when I remembered that this place is not really a market at all.  Yes, that's what I thought was off about this place -- I knew something wasn't clicking for me.\n\nSo in summary, I'd say that this is a nice little breakfast/lunch restaurant, but not quite what I wanted it to be based on its name or history.  And hey, yet another interesting take on the classic casual cafe/diner vibe will only help this genre of restaurant move forward in Arizona, so I'll keep tabs and look forward to trying it again.", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-08-15", "type": "review"}

But, today changed everything.  I was completely disappointed and shocked with the customer service today.  I walked in with 4 of my girlfriends to have brunch and meet about an event we are planning.  We were immediatley met by the chef's wife, who quickly told us that we would have to sit at the high top bar due to the fact that they are trying to save their regular tables for people eating.  I explained to her that we would like a table because we wanted backs on our seats.  She told us that we needed to wait for two ladies by the window to leave (who were already done with their meal) and she would push two tables together and allow us to sit there, but we needed to wait at the bar until then.  We ordered our food and sat at the bar. There were several 4 top tables and I asked if two could be pushed together so we could sit there.  She told us no.  I explained that I was a paying customer and frustrated and irritated that we could not have an open table.  She explained that this is how they run things...that they want you to eat and get out and since we were meeting she couldn't let us sit longer than an hour.  I was in utter shock over this.  Have you ever heard of a place saying that to a paying customer.  For the record, we had spent $66 on our brunch.  I asked if we had not had binders with us if she would let us sit there and she said yes!  I told her how uncomfortable it was sitting at the bar so she agreed to push the tables together and let us have the tables, but only for one hour.  We ate our breakfast (which was delicious) and believe it or not, at an hour, she came and told us she needed our table.  Again, shocking!  Also, the table that she orginally promised us still, after an hour and ten minutes, had the same two ladies at it chatting!  \nI am sad about this situation as this is a place I frequent 5-6 times a month.  I love the food!  But customer service goes right along with it all.  I am now boycotting Libery Market, as are many of my friends.", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-08-15", "type": "review"}

My idea of a good breakfast is good service and an enjoyable, relaxing time, all three of which I did not experience during my visit. \n\nThe place is utter chaos. When you walk in you think that there are available tables, but then someone comes over to you and lets you know that she is \"seating the table right now\", and you can order and she will find you a place to sit. That's fine, but a sign near the door stating, \"please wait to be seated\" would solve about 99% of the \"hostess\" running around and rearranging people, and 100% of the confusion for first time visitors. They would almost serve themselves better by letting people seat themselves....It was stressful enough to watch the poor girl run around trying to seat people. \n\nOn that note, I saw her let people sit down until she had to seat a party, then she made them get up and stand, which I thought was incredibly rude. She also seated my party of two, and after we sat down, SHE MOVED US! To a smaller table. Fine, we are only a party of two, but once you make up your mind on where you are going to seat a party, keep it, its rude to make them move after they have been seated. \n\nWe ordered our food, I got the Chorizo Quesadilla...good, but nothing great that I couldn't get at other establishments. We even commented to each other how the food should be outstanding...it must be for us to want come back, but again, it was nothing to rave about. \n\nThe food took a long time, and the place is LOUD. The busers are around in flurries setting up and taking down tables, but it's beyond impossible to flag one down to get a box for your food at the end of the meal. \n\nWe left more stressed out then full in our bellies. Granted we visited on a busy Sunday morning, but customer service should always be a companies top priority, here it wasn't. I felt like we got nothing but a stressful expensive meal instead. I rated Liberty Market \"fairly\" at one star, because like the rating says, I think not.

I'm not normally a breakfast person, but this place has changed my mind many times over, especially when it comes to flavor, plus they've got something for everyone.  \n\nThere is almost always a constant line that can easily be 15-30 people deep at any given time, but it moves steadily and you never really feel like you're waiting and there's always a seat ready for you by the time you order.  Depending on when you walk in, menus are available for breakfast, lunch or dinner (or both breakfast and lunch if you come in on the weekend between 10am and 1pm) and you can peruse the menu at your leisure while you wait to shuffle up to the register to order.  As you amble through the line, you snake along a tall cooler full of beverages from cans of limonata and bottles of exotic juices and sodas to cans and bottles of craft beer (including some local).  Further along the line you'll pass the pizza making station, where you can watch the cooks toss dough and unique toppings around before gently thrusting a fresh-made pizza into the brick oven (you could even watch it bake if you aren't in a rush...or hungry).  Right after the pizzas, the sides/appetizers and desserts taunt you from a cooler covered with glass that seems to sparkle thanks to all the delicious treats inside.  Just before you can take a look, someone will come up to you and give you a number while pointing out your table for you.  Then you can admire the caprese pasta salad, roasted sweet potato salad, corn-tomato-and-bean salad, hummus, fresh fruit and vegetables of the day, zebra brownies, carrot cake, bread pudding, red velvet cake, ice cream cookie sandwiches, and a cupcake of the day.  When you finally get to the register to order, food is the first thing on your mind and you can't wait to try everything.\n\nAlso, if you're looking for some caffeine...order the cortadito.  Just do it.\n\nI could go on and on, but basically, the food is delicious and the wait times are manageable (the food arrives within 10-15 minutes after you sit down, if that).  It's not too fancy and it's definitely not plain, and yet it still avoids being pretentious while staying in the \"just right\" zone.  I'm not sure if that makes sense, but it's accurate.  \n\nQuick tip: they do not have a mist system outside, so they don't normally sit people on the patio in the summer, but it's well-shaded, so if you have a dog with you or just want to be away from everyone inside, they will sit you out there, you just have to ask.", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-07-14", "type": "review"}

Most of the time I am hesitant  to order a latte at a restaurant  because I am such a coffee snob but the latte was quite good, I could taste the espresso without feeling like I had a glass of milk with a splash of espresso. There was not much bitterness to the espresso and was smooth and flavorful. The food was even better than the coffee. Breakfast is one of my favorite meals. When my food was brought to me I asked for some ketchup for my potatoes but as soon as I tried them I didn't even use any ketchup since the were so delicious they way they came. \n\nI had a great experience with this restaurant and will be recommending it to anyone looking for a place to get some great food!", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-07-31", "type": "review"}

First, big props to Mr. Johnston for renovating an old (for Gilbert) buidling instead of doing a tear-down which is more common in the Valley. My architect cousin was seriously impressed with the structure. I remember Liberty Market when it was a ghetto liquor store that sold some decent chorizo. It's wonderful to have this space turned into a great restaurant where you can meet up with friends for breakfast, lunch or dinner.\n\nBreakfast is yummy. I always get the veggie scramble being a vegetarian. It's loaded with goat cheese so what's not to love? Biscuits, cinnamon buns, and sticky buns are fantastic.\n\nFor lunch and dinner, I stick with the caprese salad or sandwich. Their thin crust pizza is very good, but the caprese is exceptional so it's hard to venture from it. I've had this dish all over town and while some places may have better bread (pane bianco), the actual fillings are so much better at Liberty Market. The other item I have a hard time straying from is the sweet potato salad. It's unreal! No mayo here, instead it's tossed with chipotle (i think) flavored oil, craisins, and pecans. On a side note, I would love it if Liberty would over some veggie meat option a la Capriotti's so that I could try their other sandwiches.\n\nDesserts all kick ass. I've had the red velvet and carrot cakes here, both some of the best I've had. If you're only going to get one dessert, make it the bread pudding. A friend of mine who lived in France for two years said it was the best in the world. It totally is! It's a great value two considering you can share it among 3+ adults.\n\nIf you come here for nothing else, you must have some coffee. As a coffee drinker, it would be an abomination for me to visit Liberty and not get something from the E61 bar. The last time I went I got an iced latte, and I was actually mad because it was *so* good. Mad, as in \"Why isn't all espresso this good?\" and \"Why don't I drink this every day?\"", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-07-31", "type": "review"}

The atmosphere is definitely the main thing the place has going for it-- always packed, always lively, new and hip. I also give it props for using obviously fresh, local produce and meat. \n\nThat being said, the breakfast didn't blow me away. I got a traditional combo of scrambled eggs, turkey sausage and a blueberry pancake. My date ordered the veggie scramble with a buttermilk biscuit and homefries. The pancake was delish-- super light and fluffy but the eggs and sausage were kind of lacking in flavor. Same went for my date's, though he said the biscuit was the best he's ever had and I'd have to agree. All this, plus their yummy display of desserts by the order counter, leads me to believe that Liberty Market knows how to bake but needs to add a bit of spice to its cooking.

Yes, I know, there are already 250+ Reviews, what more could I add? Don't worry, I'll stick to the facts; consider this the cliff-notes version.\n\nTake the first parking spot you can find or drive the the lot west of the building. Walk in, grab a menu, and get in line.  With all of the goodness on the menu, try to make your decision before you get to the register.  \n\nA few of my favorites\n1. CORTADITO - coffee drinkers, do NOT miss this one!  Cuban miro-latte, on the sweeter side, served in a pair of espresso shots or a bowl, perfection!\n2. Rancher Salad - steak, caramelized onions, blue cheese, arugula, do I have to keep going?\n3. Sweet Potato Salad - a unique salad, SO much better than your average potato salad\n4. Cinnamon Rolls the size of a human face, if you're into to that kind of thing, share with a friend, or four.\nthere are more, but I promised to keep it short.\n\nBack to the line. As you're making up your mind, be ready to answer the number of people in your party so they can set you up with a table.  Try to resist the incredible looking, super-sized pastries and desserts in the case, or not, what the heck, just get it!.  Pay the friendly cashier, proceed to the fountain drink station to fill your glasses, and maneuver the maze of tables to find the one with your number.\n\nJust a few tips.  One, it can get a little noisy in there, so may not be the best place if you're planning a discussion over your meal. Two, LM gets busy and the staff is always trying to find a table for the guests in line by the time they finish at the register.  So, while the dining room attendants are friendly and attentive, they are definitely trying to turn the table as soon as you'll let them.\n\nAnd now you know what to expect.  If you don't like lines or loud places, this might not be your favorite place. Overall, delicious, fresh food and shinny, happy people to bring it to you.  Let's just say LM is enough to get me out of my five mile Ahwatukee radius, and that is hard to do! Now you know the scoop . . . I'm out!

Go with the fresh brick oven pizza, the sausage was succulent, the ricotta sweet and the crust perfect. The Sicilian style pizza I can not say the same for, it is a generic cheese thick crust already baked up an when someone orders toppings they simply slap them on and reheat the pizza with the toppings. Leaving the crust overly crisped like biting into a crouton and the toppings only slightly warmed. Anything that is made to order is a winner! Anything Pre made and waiting such as sides, sicilian, cake can be skipped without missing much.", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-07-06", "type": "review"}

We were in the middle of Mesa and overcome by corporate restaurants so I turned to Yelp as my foodie Northern Star to lead us safely! \n\nAll the reviews raved about this place and I would agree. Now I have to admit I am kind of a Scottsdale snob, the only reason I go below the 202 is for work. So I already had a pessimistic attitude about finding a good place to eat in Mesa/Gilbert that wasn't Joe's. I am glad to say I was  wrong. \n\nWe got there right at noon and the crowd wasn't that bad. The first thing that hits you is the cool hipster vibe they have going in there. Great layout clean and very inviting. Next step you grab a menu decide what you want pay then find your own seats.\n\nI went with the Turkey Sandwich with blue cheese caramelized pecans onions on sourdough. It was pretty good. The turkey was moist and the toppings all worked well with each other. But it could have used MORE turkey and the bread was a little dry. I think next time I would go with the burger or chicken sandwich everyone raves about on here. \n\nOverall a great diner that I would go back to and drive somewhat out of the way for!", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-07-14", "type": "review"}

Our first time, the line was really long and I thought it was going to be a huge wait.  It turns out that there is a hostess type who reserves a table for you while you are in line, and then by the time you order your food your table is ready.  The line moves fairly quickly too.\n\nThey have a nice sized menu - big enough that you have a nice selection, but small enough to not be ridiculous or overwhelming.  And as a former Portlandian, can I say how happy I am that they serve Stumptown Coffee?  The pot of French Press gives me warm fuzzies.  All of the food we have had there has been excellent.  I really love the biscuits.  \n\nThe atmosphere is sort of cafeteria-like, but not in a bad way.  I love that it is in an old market and has some character - soooo tired of everything being in a strip mall.  The little area of downtown Gilbert that it is located in is adorable.\n\nOh, and the service is great.  Despite not having a dedicated server, there are always people walking by who are checking on you, and ready to bring you something and take away empty plates.  Everyone who works there has been really nice.\n\nThank you Liberty Market, for giving me some hope that I can find sustenance in the desert!", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-07-16", "type": "review"}

The pizzas are great (and the perfect size for 1 while still sharing a slice), the burgers fantastic (be on the lookout for their burger of the week - always especially good), and their breakfast is wonderful. I'm usually here for breakfast, my favorite dish being the western scramble. (if you like horseradish.. just trust me on this. Don't even bother looking at the rest of the menu.)\n\nCouple of things that i think sets this place apart; you can tell they use fresh ingredients and cook from scratch. Their breakfast potatoes are more than just plain diced, unseasoned squares, and the fresh, always soft-&-warm biscuit they serve with most of their (breakfast) entrees. Also, the staff is always amazingly friendly.\n\nI wasn't a big fan initially of their style of  \"order at the counter and find a seat,\" but they do a good job of finding & having a table ready for you by the time you get your order in, and I don't mind getting up to get my own coffee / water / iced tea. Just be aware if it's you're first time in. It can be confusing to the uninitiated. (I came here the first time with my parents and grandparents... and my grandparents were completely confused as to how the system worked. And I wasn't too sure either) Also, if you walk in with just 1 or 2 of you, there's often room at the coffee bar, and you can sit over there, skip the line, and order from the barista.\n\none last tidbit; their espresso is pretty great. Ordered a vanilla latte with breakfast the last time i was in, and it was fantastic. Which sucks, because now I'll have to order it all the time...\n\nUPDATE: 2-3 weeks ago i wrote an updated review pointing out that they refused to serve eggs that weren't scrambled, which bothered me a little. I recently received a message that they've since changed their policy on this point, and are serving eggs as the customer requests, which is very welcome.

It's my favorite type of food and I can eat it anytime of day. \n\nMy husband and I were headed to the Gilbert Farmer's Market and needed food. We walked in, grabbed a menu and the minute I saw Buttermilk Pancakes with Chopped Bacon I was sold. There is seating inside and outside; when they're busy they go through the line and assign you a table number based on the size of your group. This makes things move smoothly unless you're rude and decide that your assigned table isn't good enough for you. Yes, people really do that.\n\nThere are several things that make these pancakes amazing. When they're on the griddle they sprinkle cooked, chopped bacon on the wet side, flip it and serve. It's genius. Then they put a wrapped butter pad on each pancake. This is awesome, because the butter starts to melt. There is nothing worse than rock hard, cold butter that tears apart your pancakes as you try to spread it. It comes with a side of syrup that is good, but doesn't overpower the flavor of the pancake itself. \n\nThey carry Revolution Tea which makes my hubby very happy. Their French Press of Stump Town Coffee is very tasty, but their latte tasted way too burnt and just wasn't enjoyable. \n\nAt some point, I will venture out and try one of their amazing burgers or pizzas which all look amazing.

In general we have found the food to be good, though at times inconsistent and unexceptional, but acceptable when in the area (not a destination eatery we'd drive to otherwise). Unfortunately, the service is uninspired or totally lacking. It galls me when a place charges the same (or higher) prices than other establishments that offer full table service and comparable (or superior) food.\n\nA recent visit there will be our last. The evening we went there were 4 of us who were meeting to discuss planning of an upcoming old town event and we wanted a quiet place to converse over wine and food. This time the service was not only uninspired but downright rude.\n\nWhen 3 of our party attempted to sit at larger table with chairs for six (allowing us to more easily view our materials), one of the staff said \"you can't sit there because it's ONLY for parties of six.\" He subsequently pointed to a small 4-top and said \"sit over there\". In many restaurants the 4-top he pointed out would have been a 2-top, so our casual planning session was cramped and uncomfortable.\n\nTo emphasize my point even further, the place was less than 1/3 full and it was near closing... in fact the 4th of our party, a business owner from across the street, arrived only a about 15 minutes before the manager locked the door. \n\nInstead of building customer good will and making us feel welcome, this staffer decided to convenience himself and inconvenience us.\n\nJoe's BBQ across the street definitely projects a feeling of appreciation for their patrons, but the management team at this restaurant where Joe is a partner, is worlds apart when it comes to \"community\".\n\nWe really wanted to like this place and have been going there since they first opened in 2009, but after this last encounter we will NEVER return as there are dozens of establishments in the area that make you feel welcome and appreciated, as well as offering comparable or superior food with the added benefit of full table service.", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-08-19", "type": "review"}

It was a acid bomb; orange marmalade and lemon up front.  As it cooled, a semi sweet chocolate rounded the predominate citrus notes, leaving a long finish.  My only complaint is the espresso was too hot.  As a barista I struggle with this as well.  And maybe I'm just sensitive to this because I really dislike drinks that burn the tongue.

Went there on a Saturday for lunch and expected it to be busy - it was, but no problem. Greeter was pleasant and immediately handed us menus and explained how the system worked (read menu while in line, order at end, take number and find table). The nice thing about waiting in line is that you watch the meals being made! I also watched a cook dump someone's plated lasagna on the floor - clearly a new cook. I ordered the Cuban sandwich with the side of roasted sweet potato salad, my lunch-buddy ordered the burger of the day, the bison burger, with chips. The food arrived pretty quickly considering the crowd (a very noisy crowd...but again, to be expected at lunch on Saturday), and nice and hot. But...the Cuban sandwich had absolutely no flavor. It was dry and I wouldn't have known it was supposed to be a Cuban. The roasted sweet potato salad was mushy and congealed  in goo - I took 1 bite and offered it to my lunch-buddy in case I was being overly picky. He made such a face, I know it wasn't just me. Since we split the Cuban and burger, I asked his take on the Cuban. He took a bite and dumped the rest. The bison burger, luckily, was great. The chips with the burger were standard out-of-the-bag chips. Three sauces were served with the burger - a bottled ketchup, a bizarre canned pineapple sauce(?!), and a tasteless orange mayonnaise that I think was supposed to be \"spicey aioli.\" I've heard such good things about Liberty Market that this was a real disappointment - most of the food we tried was dismal.

Here are all things worth noting, for those of you taking notes. (For those of you not taking notes, I can just text you):\n\n1) The ordering system is similar to a Corner Bakery, in that, you pay first then take a number, then they bring food to your table. What is nice/different, though, is that you get a hard menu to hold in line, instead of having to look up at a board behind the counter. This allows The Indecisive some intimate time alone to analyze and dissect each and every option without the board making their glances feel like they've overstayed their welcome.\n2) It's a better value than Panera, who's been sneaking up their prices and making my wallet whine. Places like Liberty Market are fighting back, so one day our kids will say, \"Panwhera?\" #forced\n3) I ordered the Farmer sandwich and a side of Hummus. It should be in the Constitution that hummus should always be served with soft bread, never hard toasty toast. (Note for next time, folks, especially if you want it changed to \"Life, Liberty MARKET, and the Pursuit of Happiness\"). \nThe Farmer sandwich was not as hot as it could've been, probably because of the waiter's poor pickup timing from the kitchen....\n...but how long could I stay mad at the waiter when, 4) he gave me free coffee? Or maybe he just gifted the coffee because I looked like I had to poop and he was just trying to push me over the edge...\n5) They REALLY won my heart, though, by playing my favorite Oasis song, \"Don't Look Back in Anger.\" It was as if they were spoonfeeding me through my ears.", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-06-03", "type": "review"}

If it's ever on the menu again, get it! Seriously. You'll thank me later.\n\nMy friends got the chicken pasta, and were practically licking the plates. Another friend got the salmon and orzo, and I'm pretty sure he DID lick the plate. My partner got the BLT, and was raving.

We still need to go there!!  I happened to be off from work one day and we were both up early.  And hungry.  I suggested we go somewhere for breakfast.  Being from California, I remember cinnamon rolls were a big deal, and they seem all that impressive anywhere I've been in AZ.  I did some searches on Yelp and then I just switched it to breakfast, and Liberty Market popped up!  OH SNAP!  The place was busy enough with a long line, but nothing obnoxious and definitely worth the 9 minutes we were in line.  He ordered the breakfast sandwich, I the breakfast quesadilla with chicken, a pitcher of sangria, and a piece of carrot cake to go.  It wasn't cheap.  Tip and all it came out to sixty bucks, but the sangria itself was about 25 - be ready to drop some coin, but don't worry, the place will earn it fa sho!  There was one particular employee who I think was a manager that was better suited for a non customer contact position, like data processing - or worker at DMV.  We didn't let her spoil the morning.  I may have mentioned it on FourSquare and Twitter, but made it clear we were LOVING the experience.  They tweeted back before we even left saying thanks for coming in!  The portions were plenty.  Especially my quesadilla.  It was SO big and SO full I chose to take the other half home so I could tear into it while no one was watching at home. HA!  The carrot cake...  how my hunt went from cinnamon rolls to ending up with a carrot cake, I don't know, but aw lawd it was to die for!  If anything of the desserts or salads on display at Liberty Market are from Cisco, I'd be shocked.  Oh, except for the mixed fruit salad... that looked like it was straight out of a can of Dole.  I can't wait for our next visit.  We left satisfied, not STUFFED, and the whole experience, and sangria, put us in a great mood for the rest of the day.

The cashier was very helpful in figuring out exactly what was in a couple of the dishes that piqued my curiosity. There was a guy helping out with seating while we stood in line, so there was no question as to whether there was a table at which to sit after ordering food.\n\nI ended up ordering the Chopped entree salad, which consists of kale, cabbage, grilled chicken, dried apricots, pumpkin seed brittle (I'm coming back to this), jicama, a couple of other ingredients, and a honey serrano vinaigrette. Everything on the salad was nice and fresh. I wouldn't have minded some more chicken in the salad, but what was in there was tasty. I ordered this in large part because of the dried apricots and kale, but when I got it and started eating, I quickly realized that the stars of the show are the pumpkin seed brittle and the honey serrano vinaigrette. The vinaigrette has a lovely flavor to it, and the spiciness adds a perfect level of heat to every bite of the salad. I'll admit that I'm a bit of a pepper belly and I love spiciness in practically everything, but this is really well executed. And every time I got a little chunk of that brittle, I got a little smile on my face. So good!\n\nI also had a side of the sweet potato salad. I saw sweet potatoes and cranberries and knew I had to have some. It was a solid addition to my meal. I just realized that the cup is only $1 more than the side portion--I'll have to remember that next time, because the side portion was a tad small for my likings.\n\nMy friend shared her Best Chicken sandwich and rice pudding with me. The chicken sandwich, though maybe not the \"best ever\" as the person delivering it claimed, was certainly good. The chicken was juicy and tender, the avocado spread and chipotle vinaigrette added some nice flavor, and the sesame bun added some great crunchy texture and flavor. The tomatoes were pretty flavorless, and I am never a fan of iceberg lettuce. But it was definitely a solid sandwich! And the rice pudding was excellent. It reminded me of the arroz con leche my dad always made for us when I was a kid, and I had to hold back from eating a ton of it.\n\nI saw other people's orders and thought that the pizzas looked great. The pastries and desserts all look excellent--I imagine that this place would be worth visiting just for those items. And brunch--I'm game.\n\nI'm a fan. It's a good thing to get past that initial impression, because the food really is good.", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-06-05", "type": "review"}

The manager accidentally spilled burning hot coffee on my brother today at the register.  Instead of tending to my brother's burnt leg, he simply wiped up the spill on the counter and offered up a weak apology.   \n\nI worked at Starbucks for 6 years and I would never tend to a small counter spill before I offered up a wet cloth or burn cream to a customer who had been burned.  Especially if the spill was my fault. \n\nMy concern for the employees who work here and customers who frequent this spot (which will no longer be me) is that there was no proper first aid to treat his burn.  When my brother asked for something for his burn the manager dug around for a bit before producing a bottle of NIVEA BOTANICAL HAND CREAM.  At this point, I approached the register and asked what they had in their first aid to treat burns because Nivea hand cream was not acceptable for his burnt leg.  He returned to the first aid kit and offered my brother a tube of antibacterial soap.\n\nThis should be of great concern to the friendly people who work there and to the loyal customers who visit.  Please consider that all food and beverage establishments should have, at the bare minimum, a BASIC first aid kit that includes burn cream.  This manager should sincerely hope that none of his employees are burned or injured at this establishment because he would have a serious lawsuit on his hands.

In fact, they were kinda rude.\n\nWhen I went in, the door was stuck and wouldn't open. An employee came around from the counter and opened it for me. He explained that it sticks when it's hot out and that most people just think they're closed and walk away. I made a joke saying, \"Well I guess I need to start hitting the gym, huh?\" Both employees just stared at me and smirked like, \"This guy's an idiot.\" Feeling a bit uncomfortable I ordered my drink. \n\nWhen my drink was made, the barista didn't say anything, he just set it up on the counter and began making the next one. \n\nI felt really uncomfortable and like my business wasn't wanted. At the location by Target the employees are warm, welcoming, and friendly. I'll stick to that location from now on.", "business_id": "BLuCVR5aqtXa9O7Fa5yZIA", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-06-17", "type": "review"}
