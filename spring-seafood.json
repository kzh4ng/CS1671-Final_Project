And actually, if it wasn't a chain, it wouldn't be too bad either.  The atmosphere was surprisingly pleasant - the room was warm and intimate, perfect for a date.  It wasn't too noisy or too crowded, and we were seated right away on a Friday around 7:30 pm.\n\nOur server was friendly, and happy to give recommendations.  I started with a house salad, which I told the server I would split with my boyfriend.  She brought it to us on two separate plates, which I thought was a nice touch, and more than what I expected.  Poppy seed dressing was okay, it's pretty thick and creamy as I remember, but tasty.\n\nI ordered from the special menu, since they had a bit of a lobster promotion going on.  My entree was a combo: lobster tail, and \"lobster pot pie.\"  Now, lobster is a beautiful thing, but I have to say....it wasn't beautiful here.  It wasn't awful, but it didn't taste as fresh as I like (I'm guessing that's because the meat was frozen originally).  It's just a shame.  Dipping the lobster in butter was a pleasant experience, but it's supposed to be an ecstatic one.\n\nThe lobster pot pie was totes not what I imagined.  I pictured a flaky, golden crust, a delicious creamy lobstery gravy, and big hunks of lobster and vegetables.  Instead....I got what sort of resembled a small bread bowl made of a biscuit.  There was a lot of sauce, which was surprisingly orange in color and very rich, with some lobster chunks and vegetables that appeared to come from a bag of frozen veg (I'd recognize those tiny square-shaped carrot chunks anywhere)!  Whaaaaaaaat?  It wasn't bad or anything, but not what I imagined.  I was a little bummed out.  \n\nSo everything we ate was just fine, and nice when you're craving seafood....but I think in future I'd rather just head to the Strip, get a lobster, and cook the sucker up myself.  I didn't try their fresh preparations, so I can't say how those were.\n\nI'd say in the Waterfront though, it's probably one of your better options.  Healthier and fresher than most of the other choices.  And the atmosphere is great, including the service.", "business_id": "usSROUMiAgPcxV3Ym0OxMQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-03-14", "type": "review"}

After biking on the river trail that led us to the Waterfront, we zoomed past what looked like a wonderful patio situation at Mitchell's, right on the river. We parked our bikes and were seated promptly at the patio. The waitress even filled our water bottles for us! The interior of the restaurant is very nice, sea-themed, and clean. The decor is really tasteful and classy. The outside was perfect. It was Sunday afternoon and the weather was gorgeous. Looking out to a serene part of the river is fabulous as well. Our waiter was professional, knowledgeable and friendly. We decided just on a few drinks and an app. The two drinks my bf ordered were AMAZING. The first, muddled basil, grapefruit juice and vodka (I forget the name). SO refreshing! the basil was flavorful and tasted awesome with the grapefruit juice. The second he got was a frothy pineapple-vodka with a huge fresh chunk of pineapple inside. Both were winners. I stuck with a fairly priced white wine but got to test his fun drinks :) The app we got was the Hawaiian Seared Ahi Tuna and it was delicious as well. It was a pretty decent size to split, and came with sushi rice, a red onion/cucumber relish, ginger and wasabi. I believe the tuna was also drizzled with ponzu. It was so good - definitely recommend! My bf couldn't help himself so he also ordered a cup of lobster bisque, which I don't eat, but he said it was very good. He also polished off some of the warm bread loaf that accompanied our meal. This place definitely earns the stars and I had no idea it was even a chain. The waiter said they were expanding, so hopefully the quality and service don't go down. I also checked out the rest of the menu and they use quality ingredients and the prices really aren't bad (it was the lunch menu - I'm sure the dinner menu is pricier.)

I ordered the Seafood Americana which was supposed to have saut\u00e9ed shrimp and scallops in a light butter sauce. What I got in return was a plate of small shrimp in a brown gravy with NO scallops whatsoever. I immediately returned the dish and the young and nice manager came over to make it right, so I reordered a different steamed shrimp and scallops dish which was much better- 5 larger shrimp and 5 sea scallops over spinach and veggies with a soy sauce on the side - very nice but wish they had drained the ingredients better so they didn't end up on a soupy broth.

I'm not too sure that qualifies it to be spicy with a dab of sauce.  The salad's ginger dressing was awful and watery.  I love ginger dressing when it's done right.

I've witnessed the people who eat their ENTIRE meal, then say it was bad and want another one...and they get another one!  Now that's messed up!  Asking for a little more soup, that's supposed to be a BOWL but looks more like a spoonful is hardly too much to ask for. \n\nNeedless to say, I will NOT be back. There are WAY better fish places in the city to fill my belly with, hands down! Go to Penn Ave Fish Co, It's opened a new location right on Fifth Ave!

Thank God I didn't pay full price for this slop.  \n\nFirst, lets talk about the decor.  Others have commented about the outdated 80s look of the place. I concur.  The chairs are ridiculously heavy and uncomfortable.  And don't even get me started on the hideous glass constructions hanging from the ceiling.  \n\nSecond, let talk about the staff.  Unprofessional to say the least.  When we were waiting for our table, I witnessed the hostess yell at a man from across the restaurant, instead of walking up to him and guiding him to his party.  \"Hey Anthony, your party's over here!\"  Ridiculous. \n\nThis restaurant has an open kitchen, which is usually a good thing - but not when everyone's yelling at each other.  We were seated near the kitchen and, I'm not exaggerating, heard someone yell \"order!\" approximately every 30 seconds.  Staff yelled at each other from across the restaurant constantly.  I felt like I was on a playground.  \n\nOur waitress was a nice, sweet girl, and she did the best she could considering the environment she was in.  I have no complaints about her.  \n\nThe food, though... Jesus.  We started with the \"margarita shrimp cocktail\".  Imagine tiny round pieces of popcorn shrimp floating in a glass of lime flavored water.  These were served with tortilla chips, which you'd think were meant to be used to scoop up the shrimp from the glass.  But, the shrimp are solid round balls, not a scoopable salsa.  We tried picking up the shrimp with the chips, but they'd just roll off and end up on the floor.  My date and I just laughed as we TRIED to eat this concoction.  When it finally made it into our mouths, it was gross anyway.  \n\nMy boyfriend ordered a sushi/sashimi combo platter.  I'm being generous by giving it a rating of mediocre.  Take out sushi from a grocery store is better.  \n\nNow, I admit, I made the mistake here - I ordered the fried fish platter.  I'm used to getting a variety at seafood restaurants.  At a place like Mitchell's Fish Market, you can get a dish with a piece of fish, a few scallops, a few shrimp, and a vegetable.  The Original Fish Market has no such dish.  The only dish I could get that had more than just one piece of fish with some plain steamed white rice and steamed spinach, was the fried fish platter.  So, I ordered that, with a side of green beans (vegetables were $5 - $7 extra).\n\nThe description said I would get a piece of tilapia, scallops, oysters, shrimp, and french fries.  I didn't realize this meant that the tilapia was fried, the scallops were fried, the oysters were fried, and the shrimp was fried, all on top of a giant bed of fried french fries.  It's just not what I pictured.  Like I said, it was my mistake for not reading carefully and not asking the waitress, but lets say for argument's sake that this is what I wanted.  \n\nIt was still disgusting.  The batter/flavor was exactly the same for everything.  The scallops tasted like the french fries.  The shrimp tasted like the french fries, the tilapia tasted like the french fries.  I didn't even try the oysters, but I'm pretty sure they would have tasted like french fries.  I ate barely a quarter of this dish, and I'm pretty sure I consumed an entire week's worth of saturated fat.  If you ate this entire plate, I think a heart attack would interrupt your dessert.\n\nThe green beans were good. \n\nOther people commented that you can't count on hotel restaurants being worthwhile.  I have to agree.  If everyone's just passing through, you don't have to worry about actually impressing anyone and getting them to come back.  And with business travelers, they're usually paying with their company's dime, so they don't bother to complain or expect much.\n\nI have learned my lesson.  I'm not coming back.  And I seriously question the sanity of people who gave this place more than two stars.", "business_id": "z4cCguoHdU48pj6sXMIzqg", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-04-27", "type": "review"}

My salad came out shortly after the appetizer sliders. I sat for 15 minutes without touching the salad as to wait for the rest of everyone to get their food. Finally it was delivered. My dad and boyfriend had the seafood stew which they said was good and my mom had the pasta di mare (she said it was just ok. Lacking flavor) and a salad (which she was never given and didn't realize until after we left).  No soup for me apparently. I requested the waitress please bring it out. She was unapologetic. \n\nWhen I finally got to dive into my hot lobster (now cold lobster) caesar, I realized it was just lettuce, a little cheese and the lobster. At this point I was so irritated with everything I didn't even care - nor was I surprised at the quality of my dish given everything leading up to it.  The lobster was good and there was a good bit of it plus the Caesar dressing which I always like. The Maryland crab soup tasted like chunky tomato marinara sauce and I gave it to my boyfriend to go home and use on his own homemade seafood pasta dish. My mom was disgusted by the clams in her dish and it was suggested that they were probably frozen. \n\nDo yourself a favor and go down the street to luke wholeys Alaskan grill where you get much better quality seafood for the same price.

It is a hidden gorgeous Pittsburgh oasis under the 31st bridge near Washington's Landing (note: the Yelp map is wrong) where you don't feel at all like you're in Pittsburgh, but instead on vacation.\n\nDisclaimer: I have heard that at night it is full of strange frat boys (from no actual fraternity), Cougars, tramps, creatures of the night  -- or undesirables.  I don't go at night so my credibility wanes here a little.\n\nI basically only ever eat the peel and eat shrimp.  It's just cooked shrimp - sometimes it's big, sometimes it's little.  But it's $17 for TWO pounds which isn't too overpriced especially since it can feed a tableful of friends.  Ask for extra old bay if you like it spicy and salty - yum! I've also had the fried cod sandwich - the fish is crisp and flaky and darn good!  I always take it off the bread to keep it as crispy as possible but those who know me know I have an obsession with fried crispy-ness.  The breading isn't too too heavy so that is a plus too.  I've also had the crab cakes which are meh  but fine for Pittsburgh standards and I would definitely steer clear of the crab legs.  \n\nOk, so really you should go to this place - if you like peel and eat shrimp, cold drinks by the river, and occasionally a keyboardist who plays and sings in the background pretty quietly.

We arrived shortly before 6 PM and with the nice weather we chose to sit on their patio.  Their patio is rather nice because it has an ample number of seats and looks out over the Allegheny River.  What wasn't so nice about the table that we were seated at was that for a while it was literally the only table out of about 20 or so that had the sun shining on it for about 30 minutes.  That may sound nice but it wasn't really as the sun was in some of my dining companions eyes the whole time.\n\nFor dinner three of the members of our party ended up ordering the all you can eat crab legs.  Our opening plates consisted of 2 crab halves (each half was 4 legs and a claw), butter and side orders of french fries and broccoli.  The french fries were actually pretty good and had a nice seasoning on them.  I rather enjoyed picking out some of the crab meat and putting the meat along with some butter over my fries and eating it all at once.  The broccoli on the other hand wasn't to my liking and seemed overly mushy.  As for the crab, well, it was pretty good.  The first couple of halves that they brought out to us were probably either not that fresh or were overcooked.  The reason that I say this is that the meat was hard to get out of the shells and more often than not you were left cracking and picking them.  Later in the evening though the crab seemed to get better (fresher or cooked better?) and was more easily pulled out of the crab without nearly as much cracking needed.  Throughout the night the three of us ended up eating 56 of the crab halves.  What was odd to me is that when we started they were only bringing out 5 or 6 to the table but that by the last two batches they were bringing out 12.  It seems like it would make more sense to do it the other way around as in the end we ended up leaving three of them.  Service of the crab was fairly consistent and it seemed like they were always putting in more orders for us.  However, the smaller amount of crabs meant that there was often waits of up 15 minutes between us finishing the crab and getting some more.  During one of these periods and having already been at the table for more than 2 hours I asked if I could get a refill on the fries.  I wasn't sure if they were included or not but figured that I would give it a try as the fries had to be cheaper and more filling than the crab.  The waitress told me that she would do what she could but never ended up bringing them out.  We finally ended up finishing out meals just before 9:30 PM and they quickly cleaned off our table.  At that point I was pretty antsy to get out of there since we had already been there for 3 1/2 hours.  That wasn't to be though as it took over 35 minutes for us to get the check and then another 10 to get it paid.  So the total amount of time spent at the restaurant was a ridiculous 4 hours and 15 minutes.  Yes I realize that eating a ton of crab legs is a labor intensive activity but I would like to think that we could have been in and out of the restaurant in 2 and a half hours or maybe 3 hours tops.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I don't know if I would be back again in the future.

I'd heard they were reputed to have the best fish sandwich in the city, so that's what I was looking for. \n\n(By the way, as a side-note to the people, on Yelp and elsewhere, who whine about how a restaurant with the word \"Oyster\" in its name should focus on gourmet oysters and not fish sandwiches: Jesus, grow up. I don't go to Red Robin because I'm in the mood for some robin carpaccio, and I don't go to the Silk Elephant because I'm in the mood for some broiled pachyderms. A name is just a name. This is a very old establishment, and if you didn't do your homework going in to know what's good to order nowadays, then the fault is wholly yours, and I have zero sympathy. To quote a wise Russian: CRY SOME MORE.)\n\nAnyway, back to the sandwich:\n\nI got a platter with fries, slaw, and the sandwich. Sounds very pedestrian, sure, but it was far from ordinary. The slaw was very substantial and was dressed well without being overwhelming. The fries were extremely fresh, had a lot of substance to them, and were satisfyingly crispy. The fish sandwich itself- heck, I can hardly write about it, because I couldn't help but to inhale it. It was the best fish sandwich I can recall ever having eaten, and I could hardly stop myself from wolfing it down, bite after intoxicating bite. It's something you really just need to experience for yourself.\n\nI ate at the bar, and your usual condiments (ketchup, tartar sauce, salt, pepper, etc) were easily at hand. I used a moderate dollop of tartar sauce on my sandwich, which was great, but I'm sure the sandwich would have stood up fine without it, too. A lot of places' fish sandwiches are extremely bland and dry, making the tartar sauce necessary just to swallow it down, but the OOH's sandwich needs no such crutch. The tartar sauce is able to do what it's really meant to do: complement an already-excellent fish dish\n\nSo, what else can I say? I feel like my life as a Pittsburgher is enriched just knowing that this place exists, and I can't believe I've been missing out as long as I have been. I'm a graduate student at Pitt, and I can guarantee that whenever I have a solid hour free for lunch, I'll hop a bus downtown to get another fish sandwich platter.

Or maybe you are a group of ladies who can't figure out why the Bravo TV Channel passed Charlotte over for the next cast of Real Housewives?  If you fall into any of these three categories, this is the joint for you.\n\nIn all honesty, I have seen all three scenarios mentioned above play out during each of the three times I've been to this restaurant (as for the third scenario, there must have been a Real Housewives convention or something in town...there were no fewer than 5 tables of cougars decked to the 9's trying to impress SOMEone....)\n\nThe food is good, not great.  Their steaks are great cuts of meat, but I can get their roasted chicken off the rotisserie at Harris Teeter, and their fish is always dry.  I won't harp on their oysters, as it was out-of-season when I got them, and that's not a fair shake, but still....No Bueno.  Go for the top tier steak...steer clear of apps. and other proteins.\n\nThe service, managers, and hostesses here are all as pretentious as the surroundings.  Funny story; my friends got turned away due to the places dress code.

If you want good food, and don't feel like taking out a second mortgage on your home to enjoy a nice meal, pass on this one.

Not only was the food delicious, but we were treated incredibly well by the staff, particularly our server Rebecca... I truly felt like a VIP!!\n\nOur meal included a complimentary amuse bouche (a cucumber slice filled with a lobster salad), and when our friend informed the staff that he's allergic to shellfish, they immediately produced an alternate dish for him.  \n\nThe salad I split with my fiance was a fresh mozzarella/basil/tomato/balsamic salad.  The server split this tableside for us, and even brought an extra plate with the 12 yr aged balsamic and EVOO drizzle.  Delicious.\n\nFor the entree, I temporarily suspended my usual vegetarian-pescatarian diet for a Filet Oscar (filet with crab served on top).  Medium rare as requested, as was my fiance's delmonico.  Again, delicious.  I should also mention here that the potatoes au gratin side dish were phenomenal and highly recommended.\n\nAt the end of the meal, we were presented with a complimentary champagne toast and four mini \"pot o' creme\" desserts.  These were incredible and somewhat like a ganache.  \n\nWe finished our experience with another bottle of champagne and three desserts to share between the four of us:  chocolate hazelnut cake, cheesecake, and creme brulee.  I have to say that this cheesecake is some of the best I've had and it has to to with the crust and the creme-brulee-like topping.  Definitely a must-try if you order dessert on your visit.

Armin and the crew were on top of their game. Rebecca did an admirable job of making the night special - even putting together an anniversary desert and picture for us before we left.\n\nEach of the main courses was amazing.

I really enjoy The Capital Grill most times and this experience left a poor taste for the Charlotte location. Our service and the food was, at best, two-star. I know I did not have the steak but typically I can count on this chain to deliver a good meal - if not great (my last visit in Downers Grove, IL in December was fabulous).\n\nWhen we were told we could not get a table for an hour we decided to sit at the bar.  After about 15 minutes the host said he could seat us - we should have been suspicious at this point. We went outside to our table that had trash and leaves around the edges of the patio (hey, wait they didn't just blow there last night).  Our tablecloth had stains and spots on the silverware. \n\nIt took a good 15-20 minutes for our server to come take an order after bread and water were dropped. We asked to start with the fresh mozzarella, tomato, and basil with 12-year aged balsamic. When it arrived it was two neat stacks on one plate and one empty plate. When we asked the server why it was not split his response was \"we can't split this salad.\" Ok - not as if we asked to split an escargot- the salad was almost perfectly portioned for two. Not to bother we just shared. The sliced tomatoes were mealy and flavorless and only one leaf of basil per stack. There was a nice marinated grape tomato as a garnish but I didn't pay for a tasty garnish. \n\nThe main course we tried the grouper special. I've had better. The grouper was ok (notice the theme) but the shrimp that came with the special was overlooked and tough. Our sides - saut\u00e9ed spinach and the wild mushrooms were good. We ordered a 1/2 order of both which is just perfect for two people. My only comment is we pulled eight whole cloves of garlic out of the spinach before eating it. Vampires beware ,,,\n\nOur drinks were never tended too and the front server never bothered to follow up on the salad. I hope everyone inside had a better experience.", "business_id": "CChwRoYVXA3QZulS8a6xOQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-03-20", "type": "review"}

But when you're on corporate account and/or just need to impress your lunch or dinner companions, it is very hard to go wrong here both in the wine and food departments.  And the jacketed dinner service?  Well, I always feel extremely well taken care of here.  \n\nAside from one of the best looking bars in all of uptown, the space is amazing, with a partially open kitchen with adjacent wine room and plenty of dark wood and rich, dense carpet.  It very much has that \"country club\" look and feel to it.  \n\nThat ambiance easily carries over to the menu, which is small but that just belies how big the typical portions are.  The same should be said for the calorie count of most offerings.  Friends, leave the diet at the door and prepare to splurge, it's just about impossible not to.  From the decadent lobster bisque soup to the crunchy, earthy goodness of truffled french fries, you simply can't stay within a reasonable calorie count for a proper meal here.  So just forget it, and enjoy.\n\nStandouts for me include the calamari, served with peppers which are not too hot but add a perfect tang to the rich savoriness of the batter than surrounds the actual rings and other bits of delicious seafood.  This could be a meal unto itself, yet it's just their most popular starter.  \n\nSteaks do reign on the entree menu, and I recommend going with the options which include the large chunks of fresh crab meat on top.  Why not take good to great?  But I am currently obsessing over the seared tuna with tri-dipping sauces and gingered rice.  Maybe it's the wasabi oil alone, with the palette cleansing bite that comes with every taste?  Whatever it is, I call it insane and it's a struggle not to order it again and again.\n\nBut you mustn't stop there, as dessert is just as over the top as everything else in the meal.  Mile-high cheesecake, a decadent chocolate layer cake, creme burulee, and more seasonal offerings.  One is typically plenty to share, or try a few and let the staff box it up for take-home enjoyment afterward.\n\nThe staff really cater to your special birthday and anniversary events, so long as you let them know ahead of time, so do share that at the time of reservation.  During late summer, they also have a wine event called The Generous Pour.  It's a fantastic deal that I highly recommend- wine all night long for a very reasonable beverage surcharge.  \n\nSo, chain or not, this place is great for putting on the swag and showing your guests or yourself a fancy meal out.

Deny me and all hell will open up.\n\nWith that said, I was invited to LeVecchia' s for my co-worker's going away party.  I am not from Charlotte, so I popped the address in my GPS and up I-77 South I went.  I drove past this place 3 times, because you cannot see if from the street. It is inside the Hearst building (which I did not know), which you have to walk up to and there are no signs on the street, that I saw, that tell you that the restaurant is there.  \n\nFinally, I get there and immediately ask about the WhiteWater Mussels.  YES! They are Prince Edward Island! Bingo! One order please. Fifteen minutes later, our server brings out this beautiful plate of mussels. They ahd the most delicious sauce and tomato concoction ever. Yes, I shared about 5 out of the 20 I was given, but I am stingy, so the rest were mine. They were so good and meaty. They were fresh and not gritty. If only they had been a little bigger, they would have been perfect.  I love mussels.  Beware of the price through- $11.95. Not bad, but it can cut you deeply when you read the rest of the menu.\n\nThe menu selection is not that great. It's only 2 pages and it's categories are Greens (Salads), Steak and Seafood. That's it. Why isn't the selection larger? Why are the prices so high? Why does a 6 oz Filet Mignon cost $26.95?  What's going on? I know inflation is bad, but give me a break somewhere please!\n\nSince the selection was slim, I ordered the 6 oz Filet, Medium with asparagus and red wine reduction.  It was very delicious, smooth and buttery, but I am still on the fence as to if it was $26.95 delicious.  I would have loved it I could have gotten 2 more oz, but that was not an option.  I don't know yet.\n\nAll in all, our service was good for serving 15 people and the food came out in a timely manner for a party that large.  The menu selection, location and the prices are what bring it down. I have no issue paying high prices in a restaurant. Believe me, I have done it before, but I would like it to be more justified in this restaurant.  It is a good seafood option, but I have been to better as well.", "business_id": "TLrX4FECQDFz-E45TI_9ow", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-04-23", "type": "review"}

First time I've ever seen a hostess at any decent restaurant sitting down smack at the entrance... something sloppy about that.  Our party of 4 decided to sit out on the patio.  We had to wait a good while before our waitress appeared (frankly we had to ask if she's our waitress as she walked right by us without acknowledging anyone), who wasn't at all enthusiastic or apologetic. She asked us for our drink order, yet we had no wine list.  She didn't even bother to light the candle that's sitting on the table.  We ended up getting the one from next table on our own.  The delivery of food was chaotic, 3 people for 4 patrons and it was all over the place.  I waited table before, 4 tops aren't difficult to manage.  Needless to say, verdict on service is: NOT GOOD, plenty of room for improvement.\n\nNow, food...  I ordered the crab cake appetizer and the crab & corn chowder.  Other items ordered were crusted halibut, stuffed shrimp and seared tuna.  I can't speak for others, but my crabcake was awful.  The crab meat was more shred-y than lumpy (to me an indication of lesser quality crab meat).  It was overly seasoned with some kind of vinaigrette based product that I barely could taste the crab.  It was simply overpowering and it was not complementary to the dish.  I never not finish my food, let alone crab cake, and I couldn't finish it.  The soup was good.  Creamy and a good balance between sweet & salty with the corn, and the crab meat was lumpier.  I tasted a bite of the halibut, it was good, but not sure if mashed potato is the best side option.  The stuffed shrimp was ok... at least the crab meat they used with the shrimp doesn't have that awful seasoning.  Verdict on food: HAD BETTER, for a restaurant that specializes in seafood, that was one disappointing crab cake.\n\nLastly, the surrounding.  We were very impressed with the patio.  For a space that overlooks the back of Connelly's... I was skeptical of sitting out there.  But it's well put together.  The big pillar actually blocks the non-scenic view.  With the nice early summer/late spring breeze, I think this was the most enjoyable part of the dinner.... that and the bread & herb garlic butter.", "business_id": "TLrX4FECQDFz-E45TI_9ow", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-05-01", "type": "review"}

You can have mundane dishes but when your service is lack luster....you'll lose me as a fan.  I've felt better served at Chic-fil-A than this place.  Sad.  We walk in, decide on the patio to eat.  Now, as most will agree when you chose to sit in a outdoor patio area, you always gamble on service.  Easy to be forgotten outside!  We were seated right away and I will interject at this point that the patio was actually impressive given the fact there is absolutely no city view, it's was still nice and probably a good spot to have a glass of wine and lounge.  There is a fairly large sofa on the patio that appeared comfy (although untested!)  Ok, back to the service issues, we sit down and that's where the service basically ended.  Hahaha...I mean it was a solid 10-15 minutes before we were even approached by our waitress.  And her first order of business was to ask if we wanted water? Why not just bring the water out, I mean my guess is 80% of people are going to want to have a glass regardless.  After our water order she said, \"What else would you like to drink\".  I promptly responded with \"I'm really unsure considering I have no wine/specialty drink menu to look at\".  Maybe a little forward but I have no patience for untimely service, especially if it's a place that's in a niche of restaurants that's striving to be in the upper echelon.  After drinks are delivered, we ordered our food.  During the wait for the food, the couple we were dining with noted that we had a candle on the table all be it, unlit.  ??? So my friend took care of that situation by taking a nearby table's candle in exchange for ours...hahaha....love it!  \n\nSo finally our food arrives, and it's like a shuffle game, three servers, four dishes all criss crossing each of us trying to figure out who ordered what.  I think I actually laughed out loud at this moment.  \n\nIn terms of the food, personally I had the grilled yellow fin tun (medium rare) served with baby spinach and jasmine rice.  No here, I can't complain, the tuna was fantastic, the rice was very light and the spinach was cooked to perfection.  I received another CPA (clean plate award) yay me!  \n\nSo in breaking it down:\n\nAtmosphere - 3 stars\nService - 1 star\nFood - 4 star \n\nThat's a 2.6 star average so bump it on up to 3 stars I suppose.  \n\nNote:  Right now you can get a $25 off certificate for 2 entree's for this location on Restaurant.com.

I normally stick with the asparagus friti or the three cheese mashed potatoes.\n\nI've had both the lobster and a few of the steak selections when visiting.

Palm has been on my list for quite some time and C and I finally pulled the trigger last night.  Happy camper would describe us both, oh yeah, full would also work.\n\nStarted with the calamari just to see if it would be better than Del Frisco's.  Apples and oranges in terms of preparation but, it was crisply breaded, still tender and served with lemon and some awesome Marinara sauce.  Unless you have 4 - 6 people dining with you, get the small portion.  I didn't realize there was a small and goodness, the plate we got was huge and piled high.  Sounds good for lunch today though!\n\nWe both had salads, her's the mixed greens with garlic vinagrette and mine a Caesar.  Mine was good, her's was really good with the dressing being a star.\n\nFor dinner, I went all out with the surf and turf.  A NY Strip, medium rare and half a 3lb lobster.  This was as good or perhaps even better than any other strip I've had in town.  Almost butter knife tender, juicy, flavorful and cooked to the perfect temp.  Lobster was good just cause lobster IS good but there was nothing overly remarkable here.  Sweetie opted for the chicken parmigiana which was also a huge portion so there is half of that in the fridge too.  It was delicious and the marinara makes the dish.\n\nDessert was a shared fresh berries and creme anglais.  5 stars here for the perfectly chilled raspberries, blackberries and strawberries and a just sweet enough creme to dip them in.\n\nService was friendly, professional and not too stuffy the way it can feel at some other high end steakhouses in town.  She recommended a very good bottle of Pinot Noir at a reasonable price point which was a nice addition to the meal.\n\nExpensive?  Ummmmm, yes.  If you eat as described above you will be closing in on 3 bills, pre-tip.  BUT.... There are other options to choose that are much less expensive should you want to not blow up the Visa too badly and I am quite sure they are prepared just as well.

My daughter had the bisque - flour-y and flavorless.  we had two NY strips and the prime rib.  The prime rib was HUGE and good.  The strips were okay - one was cooked medium well when ordered medium rare and one cooked correctly, but nothing much to it.  All in all, it was fine, the service was good, but without alcohol, the ticket was $200+ and for that money, it was not nearly good enough.\n\nGotta do better.", "business_id": "1gKBusJMk66ypwEKF0vOAA", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-03-09", "type": "review"}

We had teriyaki salmon, and it was just awesome.  Ever since, we've been meaning to go by and try their real food.\n\nSo we went.  I'd have to agree with a lot of others in that the atmosphere is just a little too stuffy for my own personal taste.  It's a nice place, and you really don't have to dress up - we went in jeans - but it's just so \"pretty\".  The staff is nice, they are relatively attentive and all, but it just seems so wrong.  I'd much rather go somewhere that's a little grizzled.\n\nIn any case the menus were delivered and we decided to try the spring roll appetizers, and they were actually quite good.  I liked that there were two of us, and they split the appetizer onto two plates.  That's a nice touch.  Most places give you one plate and you're left to do it yourself.  Another nice thing is that the bread comes with melted butter.  That's cool.\n\nI ordered the sea bass, on the suggestion of the server, who said it is \"far and away\" the best thing on the menu, while my wife had a sirloin.  The flavor of the fish was good, but it was just so sponge-like I had a difficult time eating it.  The texture was just strange.  The steak, meanwhile, was really good.  Odd, at a seafood place.\n\nOverall, it was decent, but it wasn't cheap by any means.  I think we'd rather go to the more fun and much better McCormick and Schmick's, as it's just more our style, and the food is typically better (and it's cheaper to boot).", "business_id": "BOp3jcpYy31M85H1DLnEEw", "stars": 3, "date": "2007-04-08", "type": "review"}

They have a complete traditional Thanksgiving spread set up in their bar along with sushi, cooked seafood and other goodies. \n\n\nAt the risk of sounding like George Costanza, they have one of the nicest restrooms I've seen in Charlotte. They also have a cute patio area with cushioned seats that's perfect to enjoy an after work cocktail on and watch the people of Phillips Place. And dare I say, even though it's in the heart of South Park-not an obnoxious number of misbehaved children .

The surroundings are nice to look at and they have a huge patio area! The parking can get a bit hectic at dinner but I don't mind a bit longer walk to help burn off the calories.\n\nI've been here once for dinner and several times for lunch. The decor is very upscale and trendy, although it can get a bit loud with the open kitchen. The time I went here for dinner, my friend Tom and I had just finished a gallery crawl in NoDa and weren't exactly dressed to impress in jeans and tshirts. However that didn't stop them from giving exceptional service! We were seated promptly by a cheery hostess and water glasses were discreetly filled during the dinner, every course was checked on to see if it was to our liking, and the food was excellent. They have some more interesting options for sushi here, I got the chef's special that night which was a butterfish bento, it was all extravagantly prepared fresh and delicious, and I was so busy enjoying my meal I didn't even bother to try out my friend's choice or remember much about it other than it had something to do with tuna. The only thing that might turn some people off is that dinner can get expensive, however if you stop by here for lunch the prices get much more reasonable while presentation and service remain phenomenal.\n\nA few days later I was in the mood for seafood for lunch and remembering dinner headed here. After being seated promptly I ordered some tea (which actually have an extremely nice selection of) and a tempura shrimp bowl. Food came out in a timely manner, hot, and a killer presentation. I kind of did a double take at the shrimp in my noodle bowl, they were so huge these shrimp are like baby lobster size! On the next few visits here the food has been consistently great, and on the second trip for lunch, the servers even remembered my name, the type of tea I order and how I like it.\n\nPersonally I feel that people eat here and get turned off by the feeling that it is too uptight, but if you give the place a chance it's a gem. The service have always been friendly and attentive. While the dinners here can be a bit pricey and probably best reserved for special occasions, lunch here is extremely affordable and delicious.

It was very tasty and not huge in size.\n  Kale salad was very pleasing to the taste buds as well.\n  Loved the bread, the dipping oil was very tasty and I also asked for some butter and that added even more flavor to the bread.\n  The Flounder with Risotto was perfectly prepared and just the right amount of food to risotto ratio.  The sauce over the entree was a great accompaniment to the fish and risotto.\n  Did you know how serious Upstream is about their food?  They bring their fish and seafood in fresh daily!  \n  I will definitely be back!", "business_id": "BOp3jcpYy31M85H1DLnEEw", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-04-17", "type": "review"}

Years ago this was my go to spot for Seafood.  However, over the last few years I have tried so many of the newer places I haven't gotten back here in a while, and that was my bad.  A few months ago I met up for drinks and appetizers with a Meetup Group and enjoyed the updated bar and offerings.  Although I have seen better Happy Hour prices, the food and drinks were great! I enjoyed the Shrimp Tempura, it was cooked to perfection. A light batter with an amazing sauce.  The sushi was great as well, and the others I was with enjoyed their choices as well.\n\nAfter being impressed with the food I have since been back for dinner and just this past weekend enjoyed Easter Brunch.  Let me say Upstream offers a great brunch.  Not only do they have a spread, and I mean an entire room, of salads, shellfish, carving stations, hot meals and desserts, they also offer a la carte entrees that can be served individually and brought to your table hot from the kitchen. Some of those items included a trout/crab cake benedict, shrimp and grtis, veggie frittata, and a few more. \nThe food was all delicous and the service was spot on.

Having never been to Louisianne's in the 5 years that I've lived in Middleton, I suggested we try it out.\n\nI give the atmosphere of this place a solid five stars. Although it has an rather bland looking storefront, the inside of the restaurant is anything but. You walk into Louisianne's and immediately head downstairs. It's all stone and looks like you're walking into a cool cave or something. It's dark, but there's a lot of ambiance. I've been to New Orleans, and it definitely has that sort of vibe to it. It's romantic, fun, and not what you'd expect from the outside. I felt like we were on vacation while we were there. Also, there was a live jazz band playing and they were really rocking. It was awesome!\n\nWe went at about 8pm on a Friday night had to wait about ten minutes for a table, which was fine. While we waited, we ordered drinks at the bar and watched the band. I had red wine, and my husband had Jameson on the rocks. \n\nWe were seated and ordered the Pecan Crab Cakes as an appetizer. They were good, probably just 3 stars though, as they tasted a lot like other Midwestern crab cakes that I've had before. They were heavy on bread and light on crab...with a lot of Old Bay seasoning. Again, they weren't bad at all, but not spectacular.\n\nNext, we ordered some more wine and our entrees (more on those in a minute).  We were given a choice of soup or salad with our entrees and we each ordered soup. They had two soups of the day: a shrimp -corn chowder (which I got), and a tomato-based pulled pork stew that was like chilli (which my husband had). Both soups were fantastic! Definitely 5 stars for the soup. \n\nI'll take a minute here to comment that I enjoy going to traditional restaurants from time to time, places where soup/salad and bread are included with your meal instead of everything being ala-cart. (It reminds me of dining in Wisconsin supper clubs as a child). By the way, the bread basket was delicious and was quickly replenished by the waitress after we ate all of the bread within 30 seconds of sitting down because it was warm and toasty (and served with soft butter) and we were starving! \n\nOnto the entrees! My husband absolutely LOVED his dish. He claims that it was possibly \"the best thing I've ever had in a restaurant\". He chose the Coffee Roasted Chicken, which featured a bed of (homemade) fettuccine topped with a coffee-crusted bone-in grilled chicken breast, in a \"hazelnut, orange, ricotta sauce\". I think there was spinach in it too. The pasta was perfectly al dente, the grilled chicken moist, and the sauce was rich and creamy. It almost reminded me of a Thai peanut sauce, but with hazelnuts instead. Although it sounded like something that could become cloyingly sweet, it was not. It had a nice subtle umami essence in addition to the sweetness. Delicious. 5 stars.\n\nThe reason that Louisianne's is not getting a five star review from me, however, is due to my entree, which I felt was very underwhelming. We don't eat pasta at home for health reasons, so I usually get it when we go somewhere nice as a special treat. I chose the tasso and shrimp fettuccine because it was homemade pasta, and because it featured authentic New Orleans style ingredients (for the unfamiliar, tasso is basically spicy ham). The shrimp and tasso pieces in my pasta were well-cooked, but they were sparse. The dish also featured mushrooms, and they were fabulous...probably the best part. However, the pasta was supposed to have a \"Creole mustard cream sauce\", and it didn't really. The sauce was very light, and had little flavor. It was kind of sad, because I was really hoping to be wowed and I wasn't. I'd say my item was probably 3 stars, and would have been awesome if only the sauce had been a bit more pronounced and flavorful. \n\nThe service was adequate. Nothing remarkable in either a good or a bad way.\n\nSummary: I'd definitely return. I think Lousianne's Etc. is a decently nice restaurant overall, and is great for special occasions. Their primary issue, from both my own experience as well as the reviews on Yelp, seems to be consistency. Some menu items are fabulous, and others are meh. The major problem with this is that Louisianne's  menu is at a price point where people only go occasionally...so the restaurant basically has one shot to impress, and if they fail at that, guests won't return for a second chance. I think this explains why the Yelp reviews for Louisianne's are so polarized.", "business_id": "koRLvzIl-4fCybOIdk56jA", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-05-07", "type": "review"}

Particularly South Phoenix where you can find great Soul Food at Lolo's Chicken and Waffles, Pizza at Amano, and of course various different types and regions of Mexican food. When I say Mexican food I'm really referring to the sort of hole in the wall, real deal family owned operations that are all over the south side of Phoenix. So many of them dot each street corner and call like the Sirens of the night. Marisco's Playa Hermosa is exactly what I mean by this.\n\n\"We bring the sea to the desert\" is their slogan and it's so true. Stepping inside you'll feel like you were just transported to Mazatl\u00e1n, Mexico, the only things missing here is the ocean. The place is just splashed with bright colors with hand carved tables and birds with a welcoming and friendly staff. With so much to take in it's hard to focus on any one thing, though with so many bird carvings hanging from the ceiling I almost felt like I was in the Tiki Room at Disneyland, less the chatter of the birds of course. \n\nChips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant can be a very good benchmark to judge the rest of your meal, Marisco's would have to be at the top of these tests. Their chips are slightly thick, warm and a little on the oily side, this way the salt can adhere well to them. Accompanying are 2 different salsa, red and green. The red has a certain sweet and hot bitterness that is tasty and even better when washed down with a cold beer. The green is made of creamy avocado and with a warm chip is absolutely delicious. Neither were very hot but that's the thing with real deal Mexican food, its not always hot and spicy. So you'll have no reason to expect the \"burning ring of fire\" the next day! \n\nWith so many different and tasty sounding items to choose from, deciding was pretty tough as I really enjoy some good seafood. So imagine this, 8 large perfectly cooked shrimp, swimming in a creamy tomatillo and cilantro sauce, then topped with a sprinkling of cheese. If this sounds like something you would enjoy then go ahead and order the Camarones Culichi ($13.99). You will also get a basket of hot fresh corn or flour tortillas for dunking as well as rice, beans and a fresh lettuce salad dressed with lime juice. The beans have a nice texture with good flavor but the rice is nice! Well steamed and seasoned, the rice has a bright white color which might look bland, but after one bite you'll be wrapping it up in a hot tortilla and dunking it into the beans. \n\nThe Mojarra Frita ($15), a fried whole fried fish, sounds and looks good, but decided to be more like a daddy's little girl and order something less involved. Crab Enchilada's ($13) are not only the house specialty but are good to the last bite. 3 corn tortillas over stuffed with sweet crab meat, rolled together with cheese and covered in a slightly spicy red sauce. Again with the rice, beans and salad this is a pretty large plate and for the money, a great value. The enchiladas were actually featured in Gourmet Magazine at one time, who knew?\n\nOn the back of the menu you'll find a section called Camida Mexicana which are plates of regular Mexican fare such as burritos, taco's and fajitas. Not trying the Carne Asada Taco's ($6.99) would be a real shame since the meat is so tender and the flavor so beefy. A plate full of 3 tacos, double tortilla, chopped beef and onions, with rice and beans is both satisfying and ample. Douse the tacos with some of the guacamole salsa and you'll have a party on your plate! The Quesadilla ($7.99) is just cheese and a tortilla, while good it was quite ordinary. However the smell from the Fajitas De Pollo ($10.99) was amazing! I'll have those to myself next time!\n\nFor dessert you can stick with maybe a Mexican Coke ($2) made with real sugar or a large glass of over ice Horchata ($2.50). Though for something more, the Flan ($4) was different than what you normally get. More cake like and dense than silky smooth, it was decent enough and a nice finish to so many savory dishes. Otherwise there aren't any other desserts offers, like you'll have room after such good sized portions anyway. \n\nMarisco's Playa Hermosa is a real gem and has the menu, friendliness and comfortable vibe to back it up. While the neighborhood feels a bit on the seedy side, as they say, nothing ventured, nothing gained?", "business_id": "Cp6JGY5YIRncTV_My9nf9g", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-03-20", "type": "review"}

This is literally the gold standard.\n\nNot to say there isn't amazing ceviche in other places, or even great ceviches at trendier spots.

When it's 115 outside, getting a lovely, air conditioned place to sit, drink a beer, eat great food....and leave for under $20 for two people makes this a true find.\n\nLast note: the place is freaking ADORABLE, the service is amazing, and if you go more than twice, they will start to remember you.

Beautifuuul, colorful decor. Very clean and plenty of seating with a full bar. We chose seats and our waitress came over for our drink order.

I was a liitle doubtful but with my first bit I was in love. Sooooo good and so flavorful without the guilt that comes with eating fried food. The rice is not a tomato based rice, flavorful nonetheless, white with veggies. Very good. The beans were also very good, reminded me of grandmas.\n\nWe all tasted each others food and there was not one thing I didn't love.

Just order a Dos Equis and the Molcajete Caliente with verde sauce. \n\nMy boyfriend and I found this place on the Yelp app, like most eateries we visited while in Phoenix. I cannot express how happy this place made us. We loved the restaurant, the service and the food so much that we actually came back and ate there again before heading to the airport.\n\nThe Molcajete Caliente is $22 for two people. You each get your own ceviche tostada and plate of rice, beans and salad (all delicious). They also bring a warmer with corn or flour tortillas. But the main event... a volcanic-like cast iron cauldron (a molcajete) teeming with bubbling green sauce with various kinds of grilled meats and seafood hanging around the outside. The smell alone will bring you halfway to heaven, but ZOMG, taste explosion! SO GOOD. \n\nIt comes with two breaded fish filets, two pieces of grilled steak, two of chicken and four big shrimp. Plus, there are little chunks of octopus in the sauce itself. If I had to choose a favorite, it would be the fish (or the seafood in general), but every bite of everything was honestly amazing. It may be the best sauce I've ever eaten. \n\nThe service was superb both visits---super friendly, fast and helpful. The server was the one who recommended the molcajete in the first place, actually. The prices are almost unbelievable ($22 for a VOLCANO OF FOOD??). \n\nThe restaurant itself is really clean and full ceramic tiles and colorful artwork. Some reviewers have commented about the dodgy location. The neighborhood seemed fine to me, though I don't live in Phoenix so I could be mistaken. It's mostly residential, but well-worth making a special trip (like, every single day) for this food!\n\nNote: If you're planning on ordering the ceviche as an appetizer, just be aware that you might not get your house ceviche tostadas. We didn't get ours the second visit because my boyfriend insisted on getting a full order of ceviche. He was hoping they would bring both (because he's insane and would eat an ocean full of ceviche if left on his own), but they didn't.", "business_id": "Cp6JGY5YIRncTV_My9nf9g", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-03-13", "type": "review"}

Note - I did not come for rice and beans ;-).\n\nOnce my wife ordered the Camarones Culichi Shrimps In A Green Sauce, Tomatill & Cilantro, which was excellent.  The waitress recommended it and she was right.  The sauce seems to have some cheese mixed/melted in that made it sinfully savory.\n\nAnother time I ordered tacos al pastor.  OK, I know it is a seafood shop but after the nice ceviche I was ready for some flesh.  The tacos were very good. I liked how their al pastor was crispier than some.

I've been desiring amazing Mexican restaurants in Arizona.  Since I moved here, I've been to several places that were underwhelming, at best, and generally just not good to me.  So, I'd given up on Mexican Food in AZ and I just didn't eat any.  Well, a conversation in Yelp Talk about Mexican Food inspired me to check out some different places and this one turned up in my searches on Yelp and other websites.\n\nI'm happy to say that I was so thrilled and enjoyed my meal very much at Mariscos Playa Hermosa.  Again, another hole-in-the-wall, but still quite the find.  Mariscos is located in a pretty seedy part of town, so don't get nervous going there.  They close early, so you'd better arrive early.  You will find that there is a full bar inside this colorfully decorated resto.  Don't eat at the bar.  That things not suitable for anything except decoration as the bar itself doesn't extend out far enough to make it comfortable to sit there.  (this is a tip from a person who opted to sit at the bar)\n\nI tasted a few items off the menu.  The shrimp in diablo sauce was my favorite.  I ordered extra diablo sauce on the side.   The sauce has a smokey taste with the heat of the peppers.  Perfect for my heat seeking taste buds.  They prepare the sauce \"fresh to order\".So there is a charge for $3 for the extra sauce on the side to go.  I used that sauce to make more shrimp diablo at home later that week.  \n\nI also enjoyed the camarones culichi... shrimp in green sauce.  Culichi is a tomatillio sauce made with some dairy product and cilantro and of course the poblano or tomatillio peppers.  The sauce is simply to die for.  I left there satisfied and happy!  \n\nI will return and take a friend for the Molcajete Caliente with verde sauce.  Can't wait.  I'm sure it will please.\n\nThey have a check-in offer too, so be sure to check-in.\n\nOh, that parking lot is TINY.

Their parking lot is small, the neighbor is not upscale, but it seemed ok. We all agreed the ceviche is great. The whole grilled fish was very good as was the breaded fish fillet. The crab enchiladas were horrible. The sauce tasted burnt and the crab meat had a very fishy taste. The side dishes were all the same: rice and beans and small salad. The rice and beans were tasteless and bland. The salad was iceberg lettuce and not much more. We may come back for the ceviche and to try some of their other entrees. The cost of most of the entrees is around $13-$14. The best part of the evening was the large supermarket we discovered , just before I -10, it has a large food court, ceviche bar, Mexican bakery and all sorts of specialty items used in Mexican, Carribean, and Latino cooking.

The outside pretty much looks like a crummy box but the inside is super colorful and lavishly decorated. I wasn't sure what to expect but the food sufficiently impressed me.\n\nYou get two salsas with a basket of chips--both of which are super delicious. The avocado salsa was tasty and not super watered-down like at some places. The red one, which is semi-spicy, is very tasty. I don't even know how to describe it. It was just so.... TASTY.\n\nWe received some salmon (I think?) ceviche on a crispy tortilla with our meals. Very yummy and the veggies in it tasted fresh. I ordered the enchiladas de jaiba and the others ordered fish tacos. Both were good although I think I liked the fish tacos better than my enchiladas. I thought the fish was really good and light. I noticed the rice seemed to be made with those frozen mixed veggies you get at the supermarket, which I thought was kind of funny, but it still tasted good so I guess it didn't matter.\n\nService was very prompt even though the server wasn't particularly engaging. I actually prefer my service to be this way, so if you prefer a waiter/waitress that likes to make conversation, then maybe this isn't the place for you.

The more questionable the neighborhood, the better.  That's by no means an exact science (nor meant to be demeaning to the neighborhoods for which many of these establishments undoubtedly take great pride).  But with apologies to the numerous suburban Mexican food establishments that dot the valley landscape, the working class Hispanic neighborhoods of inner city Phoenix are where I've always found the best Mexican grub.  When I told my Dad I wanted to try this place and where it was, he hesitated a bit thinking we were driving into a death trap.  Fortunately my food adventurist side convinced him to make the trip with me to try this place for the first time.  And oh, what a place.\n\nI first found out about Maria Maldonado's creation on a segment of the wildly popular PBS show Check Please Arizona (you can watch it on YouTube right now).  From the onset, you could tell this wasn't your typical Mexican establishment.  While they have all the usual Mexican staples you'd expect (burritos, tacos, fajitas, etc.), the emphasis here is decidedly on seafood.  But even the meat dishes here are completely unique to the valley (more on that in a bit).  Thanks to the Check Please segment and the fabulous Yelp reviews, we came in the door on a Sunday afternoon.  As I expected (though to the shock of my Dad), the place is a rainbow of colors from the furniture, to the walls, to the numerous photos and keepsakes on the wall.  And yet its small enough that it feels like you've walked into someone's dining room.\n\nWe got here just before the dinner rush so we got sat immediately.  My Dad and I first got a couple of Dos Equis Lagers to start.  I mention this because the beers that came out were HUGE.  The beers came in cold gigantic beer mugs to where there was at least 2 bottles worth of beer in each mug.  Did not see that coming, but a GREAT start to the evening.  Next, we (unexpectedly) each got a complementary appetizer of ceviche on a tostada.  Basically a variety of different fishes (I think I picked up octopus, shrimp and tuna) mixed with guacamole and other veggies with a hint of lime juice.  Very refreshing dish.  Then they brought out the chips and salsas (one of which was a green salsa that had a big kick to it).  All of this food and drink before we even ordered our own dishes?  Wow.\n\nMy Dad got the grilled shrimp skewers that were seasoned and wrapped in bacon and cheese.  I went with the dish this place is most famous for.  A giant molten bowl of green tomatillo sauce and cheese with shrimp, fish, chicken, and beef lining the rim of the bowl (see my photo).  This my friends is the Molcajete Caliente (even the name sounds intimidating doesn't it?).  Both of our dishes came with a side of beans and rice (though even the rice was different as it was more of a rice pilaf).  While the tomatillo and cheese is bubbling hot (and pretty much stays that way), its actually not spicy at all.  But it coated every piece of meat on the bowl beautifully.  The meats were all grilled and seasoned perfectly and with a coat of that tomatillo and cheese I was in heaven.  My Dad absolutely destroyed his bacon and cheese shrimps he loved them so much.  I was going to use the Yelp check in for the free tres leches cake (which they do honor), but we were both so stuffed full of food and beer we couldn't eat another bite.  Between the great food, festive atmosphere, friendly waitress and stuffed stomaches, our first venture here was a highly successful one.\n\nTotal tab for the 2 huge beers, chips and salsa, complimentary ceviche tostadas, main dishes, sides, tax and tip was $75.  The Molcajete is $30 by itself so that's what pushed the price a little higher (they also have a bowl for larger groups that runs around $40).  But trust me, this is $30 worth spending.  It can easily feed two or more people (though I stupidity tried to take it down myself).  I'll happily enjoy the rest for lunch tomorrow.  \n\nSo like I said, if you're craving good Mexican food, look towards the inner city area.  Even though i was pretty excited about this place, even I was surprised how generous the portions were and by all the freebees.  Its no wonder the place was packed the whole time we were there and why it seemed like every customer was smiling.  The Maldonados originally created this oasis in the desert to help pay for their kids' college education and achieve the American dream for their entire family.  If their cuisine, staff and happy customers are any indication, I'd say the hard work has paid off, many many times over.", "business_id": "Cp6JGY5YIRncTV_My9nf9g", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-03-15", "type": "review"}

My dad was craving ceviche, so I decided to take them to Mariscos Playa Hermosa. There is a reason the reviews for this restaurant is so high - it has great food, great service, and beautiful furniture/ decorations. \n\nBefore we received our order, we were given chips + salsa/guac. The chips were very oily and I wasn't a big fan, but that initial impression was soon overcome with the best tasting ceviche on top of a crispy corn tortilla. My mom, who isn't a fan of cilantro, said that it was the highlight of her meal. \n\nMy dad and I decided to share the House Special/ Molcajete ($30 for two people), which consisted of shrimps, two tilapila pieces, two chicken slices, and two beef slices in green sauce. It came with corn tortillas, rice, beans, and salad. None of my family members can eat spicy foods, but there is also an option for the \"Diablo\" sauce, which I heard is pretty spicy. We were definitely not let down - it was just the right taste and the right temperature. My mom got the garlic shrimp (I think it was $13?) and the portion for the main piece was relatively small-medium in size, but it also came with rice, beans, and salad. She liked the clean taste.\n\nThe service was great; our waitress constantly checked in to see if we needed anything. The noise level was loud because there were constantly people coming in and out of the restaurant, but that signifies just how many people are fans of this restaurant. Also, for anyone who's curious, there are TVs (might be good for game-days).\n\nAt the end of our meal, we got a free coconut cake by checking in to Yelp, and the cream on the cake was delicious; the icing tasted like a sweeter version of coconut ice cream. When we were finished, we were way too stuffed. Dad said that we should come back again with the aunts - that's one of the rare times I've ever heard him say, \"let's come back again\". \n\nHighly recommended!

After landing in Phoenix and having a craving for Mexican food, we drove to Mariscos Playa Hermosa. The restaurant was packed, but we had no problem getting a table.

Not too sweet, which a nice, but not overpowering kick of cinnamon. Highly recommend if you're a fan of horchata.\n\nWe ordered the Ceviche de Pescado as an appetizer, which was delicious and had a nice flavor from the fresh fish mixing with the cilantro and salsa. The fish was a little rubbery, but all the flavors still melded together well.\n\nFor our main courses, we ordered the Camarones culichi and Pescado a la veracruzana. Both came with a side of salad, homemade beans, rice, and fresh corn or flour tortillas. The shrimp was absolutely delicious, and the green sauce had a nice cilantro flavor to it. The only complaint we had was that the portion size was a little small for 3 people, and it was so good that we really wanted more. The fish was lightly breaded and sauteed, and was moist and succulent. The vegetables complemented the dish well too. \n\nIf you're in Phoenix and have a craving for Mexican seafood, I highly recommend Mariscos Playa Hermosa!", "business_id": "Cp6JGY5YIRncTV_My9nf9g", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-04-19", "type": "review"}

Although they were not super busy they were running around like chickens with their heads cut off... BTW... Today's special.... Chicken! ... NOT! \n\nIn reading previous reviews... The biggest complaint is the service... Or lack of it!  Boy oh boy... They were not kidding!  Why o why do they not have ample employees?  Or at least experienced ones? \n\nHEY OWNER... Do yourself a favor... HIRE SOME EMPLOYEES!!\n\nMoving right along... The place is small so you can imagine it would be loud... Which it was... but that's ok.. Made it feel more festive!\n\nIt took forever to just get water and for 10 people they gave only 2 bowls of chips and tiny saucers of hot sauce... Water glasses and drink refills RARELY happened!\n\nWe tried many item between all of us.\n\nThe larger whole fish was moist and delicious! This was the best part of the evening!\n\nThey served their complimentary ceviche which was enjoyable and might I add... A nice touch!\n\nThe shrimp and fish in garlic sauce... Let's talk about that for a sec....\n\nOk, just the other day I cooked some shrimp on the Barbie bathed in butter/garlic. Mine was equally as good if not better because my shrimps were larger.\n\nThey use a medium shrimp that's tasty but nothing the average Joe can't make themselves... The fish part of the dish was a saturated fried piece... \n\nDidn't try the rice simply because it looked unappetizing and did not care for the beans... I related them to baked beans... Like in hot dogs and beans... That's the initial taste.\n\nWe also tried the crab enchiladas ... Again not impressed... It was filled with crab meat but did not care for the taste ... Nor did anyone at the table.\n\nThe tortillas were tortillas nothing special.\n\nBack to the service...I don't want to hear excuses like \" it was very busy\" because according you all those 5 star reviews( which I just don't get) you should expect it to be super busy on a Saturday night!\n\nOne end of the table was almost finished by the time the other end got their food... The servers had absolutely no idea who had what so she pretty much passed the plates and we figured it out ourselves!  \n\nI had to ask for all the dirty dishes to be taken away as nobody came to take them.\n\nOn to dessert...they knew we were there for a Birthday and we had to remind them several times.  For the birthday girl they give a piece of cake and she chose \" tres leche cake\" the cake was unlike any Tres Leche I have had.. Had a raspberry? Filling and did not taste very leche... I am no expert at this but the ones I have tried sit in the leche which absorbs into the cake making it somewhat soggy and delicious... This was different ...  I am sure there are many different kinds but it was not a hit at the table...\n\nSo, they have this other deal... Where they bribe you to YELP a reviews using names of servers and when they confirm it was posted they give you a piece of coconut cake...so one of the kids at the table did it...\n\nI must say...the coconut cake was delish! Very moist and lots of coconut!\n\nGetting the check was another challenge and when we did get it they charged for 3 items of which we only had 2....\n\nReally makes me wonder... Between the REVIEW BRIBES and the mistakes on the check.... How much money they make this way?\n\nSince we live nowhere close the chances of any of us returning are slim ...\n\nOn goes my quest to find some great Mexican food!\n\nI imagine when a restaurant knows they are going to be on TV they make sure everything tastes great and service is great...\n\nBut on any other day you see how it really is... Don't believe everything you see on TV\n\nIt is a cute place and the fish was good... Give it a try... See what you think!\n\nNever base a decision on one persons review...

The bread they gave us was good. \n\nFor our first course, they brought out some potato soup for every one - including me, even though I said I wouldn't eat it... kinda wasteful when some of their dishes \"go to feed the homeless\" (whatever that means). \n\nThey brought out a salad as well - I ordered a Caesar which carried an up-charge from the standard house salad of 3.50. The Caesar was drowning in dressing and all the salads just seemed plopped on the plate after being slathered in heavy dressing. At these prices with courses and such, I kinda expect a little more attention to be paid to presentation. As I said though, we were a large group and they were very good about getting our food out in a timely fashion.\n\nOur entrees were also drowning in sauce. My Alfredo was tasty and the chicken was really good, but the noodles were a little chopped up and difficult to fork up and it was a little too rich and heavy for me. I still feel kinda greasy.\n\nI think this place would earn 4 stars if the prices were more reasonable. We paid 85 bucks between two of us and that included a bottle of wine for 24 bucks (their cheapest red - which I had before elsewhere and was actually very good). I think this is a good place, but I think it sees itself as being better than it is. In some ways, it lives up to these self-imposed expectations and in other ways it doesn't. I liked it, but I didn't love it.", "business_id": "3CSaqRNvYg7ZdN2zwxwzVw", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-04-24", "type": "review"}

Of course by the time I got my main course, I was full.

I did as well.  Little old bitties threw their judging looks our way from the bar, since our table of 20 is young, mostly female, we must all be lesbians, right?   Right.  \n\nConsistently good food, not great and not excellent, but good.   Modest soups and side salads here are part of the drill.  I ordered the chicken limone, breaded and prepared similar to chicken picatta but minus the capers.  I tasted my friend's grilled salmon and penne and it was delicious. Considering out large party, the restaurant handled us OK, especially given the the busyness of the evening since it was Dining Out for Life evening where they donate proceeds toward HIV charities.\n\nI extended the benefit of the doubt, but expressed concerns over the somewhat long wait time.   It was nearly 10 pm when we left given our 7:30 reservations, in which we were promptly seated.  Our server,  who was skilled at reciting the dozen or so specials of the day, was accommodating, up until the billing situation (which I prepared him for beforehand) - when he turned a little catty, but all was well in the end.

Mom didn't relish the thought of having to dine outside at RR's, so M&S it had to be.\n\nReservation was for two at 8p, and knowing we'd be slightly tardy (we arrived at 8:05p), I'd called before we left and was told that there wouldn't be any problems keeping the reservation.  It took about 10 minutes to be seated, which wasn't so bad, considering that the hosts seemed disorganized and slightly frantic, and there were about 10 or more people waiting in a scattered formation before us (it was VERY cold outside, and no one wanted to feel the breeze everytime someone opened the doors!).  However, it took another 15 mins. before our server greeted us, which also meant we had to wait that long before getting a sip of water!\n\nFood was, on the whole, delicious (w/ a few exceptions), but it was the timing that ruined the experience for us.  After being served water, we both ordered the Turkey dinner, each w/ a choice of side (Mom chose the sweet potato crumble, and I the macaroni and cheese), plus a side salad and dessert (cheesecake or upside-down apple pie- we both chose the pie).  Mom also wanted the calamari app.  How I wished I'd listened to our server when he recommended the crumble over the mac 'n cheese after I'd asked him which was better :(  The SPC was heaven (!), while the mac needed more cooking time.  Even the replacement wasn't any good.  The sliced oven-roasted turkey dinner was terrific, which included mashed potatoes, stuffing, fresh cranberry sauce, crispy green beans, and sliced carrots.  We were served cheesecake, instead of apple pie, and when we nicely pointed out the mistake, we were told that the apple pie would take a little longer as it was still baking, and the cheesecake was taken away.  Mom didn't care for the pie; I, on the other hand, really liked the homemade filling!\n\nRun-down of the timing of food delivery:\n\n8:25p- Water and server greeting.\n8:35p- Salad and app. delivered.\n9:25p- Turkey dinner entrees arrived.\n10:10p- Cheesecake slices placed on table and taken away shortly after.\n10:40p- Upside-down apple pie slices presented.\n10:55p- Credit receipt delivered and signed.\n\nAs I mentioned above, food was solid (w/ exception to the mac 'n cheese and cheesecake mis-step), but service was extremely lacking.\nEven the women's restroom needed dire attention...

We looked a each other and thought that at $19 a pop for a burger it better be good.\n\nFirst the fries came. Not sure if it was the hunger that was clouding the judgement but the fries were presented very nicely and were cut thin and crispy as I like it. So far so good.\n\nThe the well dressed butler (yes) served the burger with a bow and whispered \" Enjoy you meal sir\" lightly into my ears. \n\nThe burger was open faced with one half of the burger bread outside and the other half had this nice looking chunk of lobster and crab cake blended with Old Bay seasoning with a side of freshly prepared tartar sauce. \n\nI tell you this was the best tasting crab & lobster cake I have ever had.

Now let me start on the food. I ordered the clam chowder followed by the Mini tenderloin sliders with green beans. The clam chowder was mediocre nothing to write home about, the sirloin sliders were ok. While one of my sliders was cooked to the perfect medium rare as I had asked the other one was closer to medium well and a little charred. The green beans while they did have great flavor they were unfortunately not very hot. John ordered the clam chowder followed by the Wagyu Cheeseburger and truffle Fries. The cheeseburger was overcooked he has asked for a medium and it came out well, the fried egg on top was not cooked nearly enough if it were mine I wouldn't of been able to eat it because it looked way to slimey, the truffle fries were about the only thing that was tasty on his plate.

What a great meal we had last night!\n\nThe boyfriend and I had date night at Capital Grill last night and also participated in Arizona Restaurant Week. I was excited because they were on the list and only $30. However I wont talk much about the price, as the food was so good, who cares how much is cost. I feel under charged. \n\nI love the location, the Biltmore is my fave! Easy parking, lovely staff and valet, just great. We parked in the metered lot, but you get 2 hours free with validation, easy. The hostess was just adorable, took us on the scenic route to our table; it was very busy at the time so we were avoiding a large party receiving their entrees. \n\nThe wine list is extensive, anyone can find something they will love. The prices are very good! We got a bottle of the of an Italian red wine $30, it was great! We each started with a salad, a Cesar and a field green salad. I loved the field greens, the dressing on it was just perfect, peppery and light! He loved his Cesar. Then we both picked the fillet for our entree; to die for. First is was cooked exactly as we asked, and practically melted in my mouth. Delish! They came with mashed potatoes and green beans. Both excellent! Couldn't have made them better!\n\nThen..... my favorite part.... dessert! We got one of each to share; Creme Brule and Flour-less Espresso Chocolate Cake. I could literally eat that Creme Brule everyday of my life and it still wouldn't be enough. Amazeballs! The cake was very tasty, but being a flour-less cake is was incredibly rich, very good though!\n\nThe service was excellent!

I generally don't give 5 stars on a first visit and I also don't generally give 5 stars to a chain restaurant, but this place really blew me away. The BF and I went here last night for Restaurant Week. We had actually just gotten our reservation because we had a res somewhere else but then had to be out til after the other place closed....lucky I guess. So anyway, we get there and there is complimentary valet (which I generally find annoying, but was nice last night because we were running late). We came into the restaurant and immediately felt welcome, everyone was very friendly. We were seated right away and our waitress, Sarah, came by to explain the menu. She was super friendly and helpful and really on top of things, so that was nice. \n\n\nOk, the food: After being seated, they bring out an assortment of warm breads with softened butter. And I mean a real assortment: cracker type bread, a roll that looks like an everything bagel, delicious onion bread, and a wheat bread with raisins or some kind of fruit in it....each bread was delicious (take that Atkins!). The BF ordered a Manhattan ($11.50) and said it was 'damn good' and he is a regular Manhattan drinker, so I gotta believe it. So start, I had the french onion soup (on Sarah's recommendation) and the BF had the field greens. The soup was SO good. I generally am not a huge fan of french onion soup because it has a weird texture, but this one was full of flavor and had a ton of cheese on it. I literally was peeling cheese off the side of the bowl and eating it (I know, not so cool in a fancy restaurant...but it was so tasty!). The field green salad was light, with a flavorful, but subtle vinaigrette. It had several types of tomatoes on it, which the BF loved. For mains I had the filet mignon and the BF had the kona sirloin. They came with a little share plate of mashed potatoes and green beans. The sirloin was delicious...it had this amazing sauce on it (don't know what it was, but it has some great caramelized onions in it) and was cooked perfectly. The filet was equally good, it was simple, but cooked to perfection, it was melt in your mouth and had the perfect steak texture (no fat, gristle, anything weird feeling). I will say, the filet was even better with a little of the sauce from the sirloin, but I understand why the serve it the way they do (steak purists and all....). The mashed potatoes were divine. They were some of the most creamy, buttery mashed potatoes I have had. I wanted to lick the plate. The green beans were also delicious, very well seasoned and served with onions....yum! Now on to dessert- We shared the creme brulee and the chocolate espresso cake. Both were amazing.... When I had my first bite of the chocolate cake it was like the most intense chocolate explosion in my mouth. The espresso just adds to the intensity. I will say this, this is a dessert to be shared...it truly is too chocolatey (and large) for one person....and I love chocolate. The creme brulee was equally amazing, it was creamy with just a hint of crunch, but the most impressive part (to me anyway) was it had blackberries on it that had no seeds. What?!?! Where do I get these blackberries? They were phenomenal! \n\nAt the end of the meal, Sarah went outside and had the valet bring our car around before we even left so we didn't have to wait....ummm, seriously awesome service. \n\nSo, overall, the meal was excellent. I probably ate about 3000 calories....sorry thighs....but if I got to choose a place to destroy my diet, this would be it. The restaurant week deal was amazing too because my steak alone was 41$, but the whole meal was 30$ on special. Insanity.

I went to this particular location on Valentine's Day with my husband. Everyone from the front desk hostess to the bartender and waiter was phenomenal! To have your service just as spectacular as the food is a win win combination. The atmosphere is warm and inviting and very intimate. They have a killer wine list and your waiter will break everyone of them down for you! Capital Grille is a 5 star dining experience for sure! I recommend anyone to try it at least once!", "business_id": "QdbZyl-LWFS54u93Vjd5SA", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-05-21", "type": "review"}

After my visit, why did I wait so long to try here?\n\nThey have complimentary valet, and I recommend using this service.  Parking across is $2 or free with validated ticket for up to two hours, or park so far away and walk... or just pull up by the entrance and enjoy great valet service.  When we finished dining, the server suggested to give the valet ticket to him so by the time we were outside, the car was already ready waiting and we didn't have to wait for a few mins.  Very nice service, especially when I didn't want to walk more than 10 steps with my heels.\n\nWe arrived a few mins before our reservation time. It was Saturday peak dinner and they were busy.  We found two stools in the bar area and started enjoying our drink. The bartender was very nice and offered complimentary bar nuts.  They were sweet and spicy, so yummy I thought I could get addicted to this nuts.\n\nThey had our table ready 20 mins after our original reservation time, and apologized for the delay.  They offer black or white linen cloth napkins depending on the colors of your clothes.\n\nFor the restaurant week 2015 menu, they have a choice of salad (wedge or caesar) or soup. Entree of two types of steak, fish, and can't remember the last one. Entree comes with two side dishes of mushed potato and sauteed green beans.  To finish the meal, they had three different choice of desert.\n\nWedge salad I had was very good, creamy dressing complimented lettuces and crispy bacon.  I actually became full just after finishing the salad. (Must be the bar nuts? or could be large lunch I had earlier).  I ate about 1/3 of my steak. Too bad I wasn't hungry enough to finish it. They used very good beef. I could taste a very good beef.  I asked them to put my desert to go as I couldn't even eat my steak, but I tasted my friend's desert, Cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e.

The ambiance is great, the location ideal, and the food and service are, well, ok. To be brutally honest, I've only dined at a Darden restaurant twice in the past few years, and when my experience concluded, I understood why I won't again--there are better steakhouses in the Valley that out-compete The Capital Grille.\n\nThe experience wasn't as crisp and exacting as it should be for a higher-end restaurant. With the prices and reputation The Capital Grille has garnered since first opening its doors in 1990, my minimum expectation is perfection. Anything above perfection earns my loyalty. \n\nWe waited a bit too long for our table at 8:30 on a Saturday night, and we would have enjoyed sitting on the patio, but the offer wasn't extended. The restaurant didn't appear to be too busy as there were plenty of open tables, and I doubt there were many reservations after us, so why make your guests wait? Is the need to convenience your staff more important than to convenience your patrons? Food for thought. \n\nAgain, the fifteen minute wait for our bottle of Malbec to hit the table was just unnecessary. Maybe they had to stomp some grapes in the back. Maybe there's a lack of urgency. Whatever it is, it detracts from the experience. \n\nThe bone-in sirloin left much to be desired. Though cooked properly, the lack of seasoning and flavor were disappointing. Why I ordered a sirloin, I do not know. I think my mind saw 'bone-in' and equivocated it with a rib-eye. I had a couple bites of my girlfriend's filet, which was excellent. \n\nIn conclusion, if you have money for the finer things in life, go with the finest.

You cannot have lunch here for less than $11 unless you order one shrimp.  Any local chinese buffet will give you shrimp for a lot less than that.\n2. My shrimp looked like long barrels rather than a shrimp shape. This is due to the fact that they cut the shrimp in the middle and almost split it to make it look longer.\n3.  The shrimp had too much batter.  At one point the \"shrimp\"( what was left of it after I took a bite), came out and the \"barrel of fried batter\" was left\n4.  The french fries were from a bag --frozen.\nBeing from the East Coast, I know what fresh seafood tastes like. This is NOT it folks.  This place makes Long John Silver seem like a 5 star restaurant and it's a lot cheaper too.  \nIt is an outrage as a \"restaurant\".  All they do is fry up every piece of seafood that YOU can buy frozen at CostCo or Sam's.\nDon't do this to yourself.

My little guy got the chicken nuggets. And my husband and I shared a fried shrimp plate and a fried fish plate,then used those to make tacos for ourselves. So, first the kids chicken nuggets... Honestly kinda gross. The meat inside was much (like they deep fried canned chicken, for chicken salad) now almost every restaurant gives the kids menu short shrift and Las Glorias is no exception. This isn't a complaint just an observation. Now the main dish(es): the shrimp, the batter was ok, nothing flavorful or extraordinary. Not greasy which often happens when coming to a joint like this. The fish was equally adequate (and underwhelming) , except that was greasy. My husband picked off most of the batter and then ate it. Nothing about the meal was great. What was really good however was the salsa they brought to the table with the chips. That was particularly good and gave the tacos the only flavor (other than the limes) there was to be had. \n\nAs a non-food aside: the music was loud and incessant. Just like every other 'authentic' Mexican food joint. \n\nWould I go here again? Probably not.

Even though this place was very busy (~12:30pm with lots of business lunch patrons), you could watch as some servers stood around not doing anything. Rolls came out at a reasonable pace but we weren't even given a small plate to eat each piece off of and had to eat over our roll plates. We were only checked on once (not by our original server) and that was because she was resting her elbow on the booth section divider and casually asked us if everything was good.

We had to flag someone down to get our check. Unacceptable level of service from start to finish.\n\nFood: You could tell how they could offer such good deals on their lunch special rolls when they overload the rolls with rice and fake crab/mayo (I have no problem with either ingredient, but they pack the rolls with it to the point where many different rolls tasted very similar because they were so dominant with the fake crab mix). Each piece was extremely large and cumbersome to eat, often falling apart before you can find a way to fit it in your mouth. The rolls weren't even in the shape of a circle, but more like a rounded triangle. The sushi chefs were either rushed, new, or incompetent.

The site where it was listed offered no reviews or information besides a few pictures and location. I decided, being the risk taker that I am, to give it a whirl. We arrived at a little hole-in-the-wall place tucked into a small strip mall. Outside we found a packed parking lot and a line at the door... on a tuesday.\n  Sakana was just opening for dinner service and despite the tuesday dinner rush(still makes me chuckle) we were seated swiftly and with choice as to where we sat. Once nestled comfortably at the sushi bar we were greeted by Ramon, not my idea of a sushi chef, but boy was i wrong. \n  Itamae doesnt quite describe the skill level Ramon was on, he was masterful, and strangely I was not put off by him at all when he engaged me in conversation(I am not a public people person). Ramon you are great at what you do!\n  Now we are at the most important part of the journey, the food, which was delicious. We ordered sever different types of sushi: Eel, Blue Fin, Egg and Octopus. Lets start with the bad first, Octopus... I personally hate it, always chewy, tough and so citrusy i cant bear it. So thats the bad, now for the good. Blue Fin melted in your mouth with the consistency of firm butter and was excellent. The Egg was great aswell, sweet with a back end of head dizzying sake(not over bearing but noticable if you dont drink.)\n  Now for my favorite part of the meal, Eel, saying that I am an eel lover is an understatment, I dream of good eel, all I can say is that I was impressed and thats the highest compliment I could ever give to eel because I've never had bad eel. Also had a crunchy eel roll that was superb.\n  My wife ordered Calimari and Ramen both of which were delicous aswell, the sauce for the calimari was my favorite part of the plate. As for the ramen, if you want good authentic ramen with a smell that will cause people to come up to you and ask you what that is that you ordered, look no further.\n  All that for under $40 WHAT?! ive paid over a hundred for far worse!\n  After years of searching I have finally found my sushi destination. Thank you Ramon for the many wonderful times you have provided us with we will be back soon!\n\nP.S. I have never left that place with out atleast one thing gratis(fish ribs were great but im too lazy to eat them...)", "business_id": "0vzZ_Bcb02rJljeMU9XkBw", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-04-26", "type": "review"}

She responds, \"It's going to be at least 30 minutes until there's going to be a table, so...\" This is normally where said hostess would put your name on the list and tell you to have a seat, but this girl just blankly stared at us like they didn't use the crazy advanced technology known as a waiting list, which requires crazy things like a computer, or even paper and a pen. We awkwardly looked at each other for a few seconds, until I finally said, \"That's fine...can you put my name on the list?\" She actually responded, \"Oh, you want to wait?\", as if no one in their life ever waits for a meal at a restaurant. ...Darling, what is the purpose of the chairs in that little area in the front of the restaurant if not for waiting? I've never had a strong urge to eat my dinner there while people waltz in and out from dinner. She then asked us if we wanted to sit down immediately at a \"shared table\", which I thought might be something similar to the tables at Benihana - but no, it was literally a table we would have to share with two people already sitting having their dinner. Nothing says romantic date like 2 randos coming over with the hostess and sitting down to eat dinner with ya! We declined and waited however long it took, then went back to our own table.

I had high hopes, mostly because the reviews were good. However, in a nutshell, service is shoddy.\n\nI was in a group of four in total - my boyfriend, myself, and his two roommates. We arrived at a particularly busy time (7:30 PM on Sunday Night, which doesn't sound like a busy time). There was a bit of a wait as they cleaned up a booth for us - however they left some things on the floor, a napkin and some crumbs on the seat - so it wasn't really as clean as I would have liked. That's just me being critical though.\n\nAnyway, on to the actual food and service.\n\nThe menu was strange, and was pretty barren. There were only two ramen options, two udon options, and four miso soup options. Entrees were mostly tempura too. There wasn't a lot to choose from if you didn't want an appetizer or sushi. \n\nI ordered a bowl of miso, a cucumber roll, an avocado roll, and a rainbow roll. My boyfriend ordered the chicken teriyaki. One roommate ordered the udon, while the other ordered the ramen.\n\nMy miso came out first, and fairly speedily. It was absolutely delicious, although I was disappointed there wasn't any tofu - however that's silly of me considering I didn't order the tofu miso. It was delicious regardless. I loved it.\n\nThen was the waiting. The udon came out second, after around 15 or 20 minutes. Then came the chicken teriyaki, which was another 5 or so minutes - the udon was already half gone at that point.\n\nThen, ten minutes later, came the ramen. The udon was nearly gone. The chicken teriyaki would have been too, but my boyfriend was eating slowly and very little as a sort of respect thing for me, since I had been waiting for my sushi for what seemed like forever.\n\nFinally, after what felt like forever, my cucumber and avocado rolls came out. I will admit that they were to die for, although a little tiny bit salty. I don't mind saltiness though! I ate most of those before my rainbow roll came out. The rainbow roll wasn't actually that great - the crab mix inside tasted too sweet, and they used way too much.\n\nThe rolls themselves were fairly big and hefty, and I got full from the cucumber and avocado, and half the rainbow roll. I was really pleased with the first two, but that rainbow roll was a little \"bleh.\" I was actually really surprised at how the avocado tasted - it was firm, creamy, cool and very, very yummy.\n\nThroughout the night, there was in total of 4 waitresses waiting on us. It was very busy, which I completely understand, but I would have expected food to come out together rather than all separate. I had also heard complaints from my group on how dim the lighting was. \"We aren't vampires\" was a good comment.\n\nAll in all, the food itself was very good (aside from that crab salad filling, but it might be good for other people), but the service was spotty and spread out, and it was noisy, busy, dim and not as clean as I would have liked. Me and my boyfriend's check came out to be around $40, which sounds a little steep to me, but drinks weren't included.\n\nI don't recommend this place, and I don't plan on going back, but I do commend them for their cucumber rolls.", "business_id": "0vzZ_Bcb02rJljeMU9XkBw", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-03-09", "type": "review"}

Considering that I was still going to have something from the teppan grill I hoped I chose wisely.  \n\nMy friend ordered 2 of the spicy/hot sushi rolls, I had the Alaskan and Philadelphia rolls, along with the chicken from the teppan.  My daughter and her friend had the chicken as well.  We also ordered spring rolls for my daughter since she really didn't want sushi.  Of course, we made her try it; but her opinion doesn't matter in this review, lol, since she rarely likes anything.  Suffice it to say, that although she thought it was okay, she will never go to out for sushi.  As for my friend, he thought his sushi was excellent; it had a nice bite to it, and the heat was just right.  My sushi was actually quite good, considering I hate fish.  I couldn't taste the salmon (which is a good thing) in the Philadelphia roll and the cream cheese was a little on the heavy side, but still quite tasty.  The tuna was yummy; normally a hater of canned tuna, this is NOTHING like that swill.  \n\nNow here's where the 3 stars come in.  I wasn't impressed with our teppan chef.  He did his utensil tricks while the grill got hot and the oil heated up, but other than that, I wasn't impressed.  The fried rice was great (for an added $3 you can get rice and veggies with the chicken); the veggies were great, but the chicken was not only bland but dry.  \n\nI've read in other reviews how the service was slow; that was not the case for us.  Granted, we were not on the sushi side, and we were there at 5 when it was basically bare (when we left though, there was a line waiting to be seated).  I would say, give the place a try.  I had a great time with my daughter and friend, and it was fun trying something new, that tasted nothing like I expected it to.  The atmosphere is the same as any restaurant you find in a strip mall, but don't let that deter you.  I do believe if I go there again, I will just order off the menu and not get teppan.  I'll definitely try more sushi though.\n\n**Side note: in order to get a chef for the teppan grill, you must order 2 items from the teppan menu.  I believe it starts at $11.99 just for the meat/seafood.", "business_id": "0vzZ_Bcb02rJljeMU9XkBw", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-03-18", "type": "review"}

My family has been eating here for well over 10 years. I have lucky-cat polaroids from almost every birthday. Plus, I can't even begin to guess the number of out-of-towners I've brought in or locals I've referred here. Sadly, since about ten months ago, I have had something negative occur with EVERY visit. This is not an exaggeration. In the 6-8 times I've gone in or ordered out in the past 10 months I have NOT ONCE been satisfied with my experience. Whether it was forgetting soy sauce and chopsticks in the to-go bag, messing up the order, or--my personal favorite--FORGETTING TO EVEN PUT MY ORDER IN until I arrived to pick it up, I've been consistently more irritated with the \"service\". To top it off, no one ever seems concerned when I ask for things to be fixed. Today my handroll was made incorrectly even though I repeated my order several times over the phone and the waitress REPEATED IT BACK to me. The best part was, when I drove back to have it remade no one apologized for the inconvenience, and I even saw the sushi chef chuckle and roll his eyes over the request. Rude and unprofessional. Then, the new roll sat on the bar for way too long before the waitress brought it back to me, letting the rest of my order get warm in the car. Even now as I write this and eat, I'm noticing that my salad lettuce is turning BROWN. Pretty gross. It breaks my heart that after so many loyal years I'm going to have to look for a new sushi joint. I hope Sakana's staff decides to improve their customer service before they lose any more long-term clientele.\n\nP.S.\nDrives me crazy that they have no helpful menu on their site--just a list with no descriptions.

But we're still not back to where we were in 05' 06', so when my wife's birthday rolled around we thought it would be a good time to use the Roy's gift card we'd received as a gift from a family member. My wife, daughter (16), son (19) and I slipped into our goin' to town duds and we were off.  Considering the generous amount on the gift card, we thought we were in for treat. We used to be Roy's regulars at the Scottsdale location, but that was quite some time ago, and we were in for some surprises.  My wife had been thinking of sushi all week, but except for one quasi-roll, Roy's no longer serves it, so that's what my wife settled for. My Daughter ordered the short rib, and my son and I splurged, or so we thought, on the surf and turf which was billed as a petit filet and half a poached lobster. I understand petit, and I didn't expect an Aussie tail and an 8 ounce filet but what we got was shocking. If our filet's were 4 oz's I'll eat my hat, (which is about 8 oz). 3 bites and it was gone, the lobster would have been a decent sized prawn, 3 slivers of asparagus, a tablespoon of potatoes. I kept expecting Ashton Kutcher to pop up and tell me we were being punked. Again I didn't expect a Texas steak so big that \"If you eat it it's free\" but this was beyond the pail. I've eaten all over the world, I'm somewhat experienced.  I moved what little there was around my plate and then pretended that I was full from the calamari appetizer. I gave my son half of my steak, (1.5 bites) and all of my lobster tail. It was just appalling. My daughters meal was wonderful and my wife enjoyed the roll, we both had a glass of wine and we still had to cough up $140. on top of the $100 Gift Card. I left the place feeling like Clark Griswold after those Arizona Mechanics emptied his wallet for those 4 bald tires. Totally screwed.

This time it was the perfect night to sit on the patio and enjoy a couple drinks, some wine, a great dinner and great AZ weather.\n\nThe hanger steak was perfect, but what has always made Roy's the tasty experience you want is.. the sauces. They must have spent decades (OK maybe hours) making these sauces that add so much to everything they serve.\n\nWith that in mind, the Asian pork ribs for an appetizer were THE BEST. When i was in San Diego a few weeks ago we ate there and they were nice enough to make the appetizer portion into a dinner for me - WOW... i love those ribs. My client had the crusted Mahi Mahi (also my dad's fav) and it didn't disappoint - cooked perfect and again, the sauce reduced enough for flavor but didn't overwhelm.\n\nThe drinks are great, even their own house wines are good for the price. (Hey, after a couple great Mai Tais who needs a $20 glass of wine?)\n\nThe only issue this trip was that the Chocolate Souffle lacked that yummy runny explosion of chocolate sauce when you break it open BUT... seeing that, our waiter insisted on a new one for us. Hence.... 5 stars.\n\nThe service was professional and knowledgeable as usual and it's a pleasure to go somewhere once in a while where the waiters aren't \"almost helping you\" in between texts and meaningless chatter with the dishwasher.\n\nTheir reservation system actually works and automatically applies any promotional discounts to your bill. Nice to see efficiency.\n\nBravo again to Roy and his well trained people and well conceived concept. Try any of their locations and there's a 99.8% chance you won't be disappointed.\n\nHow do you say Bon Appetite in Hawaiian?

Wanted to try the Prix Fixe menu and took a friend who lives nearby as my guest.  Despite the waterside outdoor tables and attentive adjunct serving staff, this location didn't do it for me.  Our shrimp and papaya appetizer was fabulous, my dining companion's chicken with jasmine rice and red curry was adored by his palate, but I found my hanger steak wanting.  It's a very flavorful cut of beef but it was overcooked from my requested medium rare, and the presentation was monochromatic.  Brown beef on brown sauces with purple sweet potato fries (which means they darken externally to a brown black after frying) in a black ramekin, covering up the sauteed or grilled? fresh garlic stems that are akin to scallions.  One expects a pop of color on a plate from Roy's, and this one did nothing to whet my appetite.  The dessert was lovely, we both opted for the bread pudding with macerated strawberries.  Our server was amiable and the adjunct staff such as hostess and the food runners were attentive, but our server had lapses and the beverages took longer than usual to arrive.  This might seem like so much harping over nothing, but when you are being charged five dollars to park after validation for the privilege of eating at a location, you expect the service level to be ramped up on every detail.  Lastly, I don't know if it was attributable to the resort location, but I thought that thirteen bucks  for a signature cocktail was a wee bit excessive.  Maybe I seem petty, but it is my money.

It happens to be in a convenient location (in chain restaurant hell off of Stapley and the 60) and we've had drinks there a couple of times.  It's really a pretty restaurant inside....too bad the food doesn't live up to the atmosphere.  They've been advertising $5.99 lunch specials via their email list, so I thought it might be worth a try.  \n\nThe large  menu seems fairly impressive and includes fresh seafood, fried specialties, pasta, salads and a long list of sandwiches and wraps.  We opted to share the Calamari Salad and the fried  Alaskan Cod/Shrimp/Chicken lunch.  We should have been forewarned when the food suddenly appears within five minutes of ordering.  To put it nicely, the salad just plain sucked.  The menu describes it as a Greek salad....NOT.  Wilted romaine lettuce tossed with some sort of sickeningly sweet poppyseed dressing (WTH?) and a few pieces of calamari on top.  I will say, however, that the tender, non-greasy pieces of calamari are the reason why I'm NOT giving this place one star.  The fried platter was OK...she ate the fish and I ate the shrimp and chicken.  The fries weren't bad...just nothing to write home about and the cole slaw was barely passable.    \n\nThe service wasn't much better than two stars as well....I mean just because we're drinking H2O with lemon and not having cocktails doesn't mean you can ignore our need for refills. On our last visit we sat at the bar and ordered martinis...I guess that doesn't count.\n\nAnyway, we didn't pay for the salad (thank God) and I left starving..it really wasn't even the equivalent of sharing two appetizers since the portions are small to begin with and we weren't inclined to finish either dish.  I'm embarressed to say it, but I'm sure Red Lobster would have been a better option, or, even Long John Silvers for that matter :(", "business_id": "6Ry-gjGqApTSRZkfdYlLmw", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-03-12", "type": "review"}

After having to wait a ridiculous amount of the time while the manager got our table ready (It was not crowded at all, and he could be seen back in the kitchen doing things.) \n\nAfter a ten minute delay, we were finally seated, and we waited, and after about five more minutes we were about to get up and leave when the manager came over to take our drink order. About 7-10 minutes later a waitress finally came to the table, to verify our drink and appetizer order (why?) so we had to wait another couple minutes for our drinks (water.) \n\nWhen the appetizer finally came, my salad and my fiance's clam chowder were on the tray, at which point the waitress asked if we wanted the two items with our appetizer. We said yes, because why would we want to wait when they have already been thawed, and the waitress had already brought them. \n\nIt was another 10-15 minute wait till out entrees arrived, and mine was not what I ordered. I asked the waitress and she said \"Yes that is what you ordered\" then backtracked and said she would check with the kitchen. \n\nApparently the manager said it was okay to prepare me the proper order, but I was not notified. So after sitting and waiting another ten or fifteen minutes the waitress came by and asked if I had been told that they were preparing the correct dish. I said no, and she said it would be out soon. The Manager never came by our table, for I think he did not want to hear the complaints since it was obvious we were not happy, especially after all the wait time. Finally about 5 minutes after the waitress informed me that I would get the proper meal, it came out, and was obviously \"hurried.\" \n\nWe asked for the check, and received yet another ten minute wait, and when we looked at it, I was appalled that we were given no discount whatsoever for the issues. The Manager still never came by our table, and would not even look in our direction. \n\nThis place is such a disappointment, when we started eating there it was great, well priced, good service, good quality. The last 4-5 times we have been there it has been horrible, and tonight was the worst. I really do hope that the Owner/Managers see my review, for they have lost our business, and we ate there frequently, and we will not continue to tell people to try it.", "business_id": "6Ry-gjGqApTSRZkfdYlLmw", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-05-24", "type": "review"}

You go on Sunday, which for those not in the know is prime dim sum territory, and you are seated and served right away. No lines, no waiting on the carts, no \"shu mai is coming\" (it seems like most places run out that early even though they must know it is one of the most popular dishes), and fairly attentive service. \n\nWhy C-Fu when they food might be slightly better across the street? Well, the quality has gone down a bit. C-Fu which, by the way, was one of the first places to offer dim sum in the Valley, and one of the first around to offer \"real\" Chinese food, seems to,  once in awhile, rest on their laurels and ease up on yummy-ness. However, the food is still not bad and, because of new competition and the slight decrease in quality, you can get in, get food, and get out quickly.

I called in, a little frantically, and the staff was very helpful in agreeing to take the cake from me, making sure it stayed together, placing it in the freezer briefly, then the fridge, putting on the candles I had also brought from home, and then bringing out a small team of servers to present the cake to my very ecstatic boyfriend. When I arrived, the hostess still opened the door for me, even with my very heavy cake in one hand. Love love love it.\n\nOur group had called in to make a reservation for 20, but 7 or 8 didn't show. The restaurant was very forgiving of this and made sure to bring our food quickly once we told them we were ready to order. The bread and olive oil dip was DELICIOUS. I had to stop myself to save room for my salad and main dish. I had the Pasta Carraba, which was not the absolute best fettucini alfredo I've ever had, but it was good. I will say that some of the other dishes seemed a bit pricey, but I had leftovers, so I would say my dish was priced about right. The atmosphere was also lovely, with great music choice playing in the background.\n\nOverall, it is truly the service here that earns this Carraba's its stars. Thanks to the wonderful staff at this location, my evening went smoothly and the entire group had a fantastic time.", "business_id": "cKxXBvOithS-Ic5KnhEKrg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-05-12", "type": "review"}

I've never had to wait more than twenty minutes and they don't even take reservations, but if you have more than five people I would call ahead to get on the wait list. If you do have to wait, hit the bar for a cocktail it'll help the time fly. \n\nAt the table, you will get the traditional basket of bread (served hot) with EVOO and herbs. I always recommend starting out with a cup of Mama Dola's chicken soup. It's savory with a little kick. I've never had a bad meal there. I've been there at least a dozen times and I've only had one mediocre waiter out of all the great ones. \n\nI've ordered everything from the lasagna to the linguine pescatore. I've stuck to the pescatore for the past couple of years though for delicious consistency. It always hits the spot. If you like muscles, shrimp, and scallops, this is your dish. The sauce has a bit of red chile peppers to kick it up a notch. My better half recently ordered the Pasta Carrabba and I was very impressed. Creamy fettuccine with sauted mushrooms, peas, and fresh-of-the-grill chicken. \n\nI don't recall ever getting dessert because I'm usually stuffed by that time. \n\nMy four stars are based on great service, great food, and reasonable prices.

Bread came and was honestly the best thing we ate all night. I loved the olive oil and spice mixture! I ordered the pasta Carraba and a Caesar salad. The salad was really over-dressed and the dressing had quite a peppery kick. I like pepper but not overpowering. For the 2nd pasta helping, there were only 3 options and none of them resembled the pasta on the commercial. The pasta I ordered was very disappointing, very mushy. The chicken was grilled nicely but for $15.50, the pasta wasn't prepared better than what I could have made at home for a lot cheaper. We skipped dessert and took my leftover pasta home.

They really skimp on the salad dressing.  It was better than other places and up until tonight we loved it. Carabas sends a clear message about which patrons they value most, the bar patrons.  Unfortunately for us we have nobody to watch our youngest so she goes everywhere with us.  Carabas has only one table in the bar area where a highchair can be used and it was taken. I understand the safety issue involved in this limitation of not using high chairs in the bar area,  that isn't my issue.  My issue is that only bar patrons can take advantage of the half price appetizers. Long time customer status doesnt matter to this manager that we spoke with and neither does the fact that even though we didn't sit in the bar,  both adults did order an alcoholic beverage (which is the money maker)   So,  for those people who don't have a sitter or who prefer to not sit in a bar,  you pay full price...  because you sit on the other side of the dividing half-wall.   The bigger disappointment is that when we expressed our concerns to the manager,  he tried to argue the reasoning for not having children in the bar.  Completely ignoring my concerns about why a few square feet in seating location meant we couldn't take advantage of the better price.  Once he addressed it,  it was still no.  No offer to grant this one time the lower price.  We received better customer service and problem resolution at AppleBees.

We always sit at the bar because we really enjoy the interaction of a bartender.\n\nHowever, last night, we went on a date to celebrate...and something went wrong right from the beginning.  While the bartender said hello, she left us sitting there with no drink menu and no offer to get us something to drink for about five minutes.  The well was NOT slammed and there were a total of three bartenders, a bar back, and a manager behind the bar during that entire time.

We went to the Keg with their birthday club coupon (see instructions below) and had a great meal for a steal of a price. I feel like I got away with something to good to be true, so much so, that I want to go back to make a deposit in my karma bank. \n\nFirst of all, Keg has a great happy hour that I always seem to forget about until I go there for dinner. This time, we remembered right as we were walking in and decided to sit in the bar for dinner (good decision #2, #1 was going there in the first place). \n\nBriana was our server and she was great! Very friendly, the perfect balance of attentive but not overly so. Never seemed like we were annoying her with our \"one more minute\" or \"on the side\" requests. Nor, did she seemed bothered by the fact that we had the email birthday coupon for a free prime rib dinner ($23 value). The best part is you don't even have to get the prime rib, you can get anything you want want and they credit your check for the $23. \n\nHappy hour is M-F 4-7 with a few $5 appetizers, half price wines by the glass, draft beers, and $3.75 Orange Crush Martinis (one of the best martinis ever!). The only thing is that HH is only in the bar or the patio. So, if you'll take a moment to connect the dots with me, I can have dinner in the dining area and pay full price for glass of wine, or I can eat dinner in the bar and get the wine for half price. Um, I think the answer is obvious. \n\nDinner was great. We both ordered from the seasonal crab menu. I got the mushroom and crab crusted sirloin and the birthday boy got the sirloin topped with crab and roasted red pepper sauce. Both came with a potato side (baked for me, mashed for him). Everything was cooked perfectly to our request and so delish! \n\nToward the end of my meal, I reached what I like to call the \"point of no return.\" This is where there is not enough to take home, but just enough to push me over the edge of way too full if I eat it all. While I was just about to go in for it and stuff myself, Briana showed up to check on us. She easily made the decision for me and said \"Take it home!\" Maybe three to four bites of my sirloin left and she not only didn't make me feel like an idiot for wanting to save it, but she encouraged it. I heart her! Added half of the baked potato, a piece of the delicious soft bread, and the thick tomato slice garnish from the boys plate.  Plenty for lunch tomorrow!\n\nOh, and one more thing I love about the Keg; Keg size glasses of wine. A nine ounce pour at a great price. Perfect for two people to each get one when they want a little more than one glass, but not quite enough to finish a whole bottle! And with the 1/2 price wines by the glass during happy hour, it's AMAZING!! \n\nOK, here is what I think you need to do. \n1 - go to kegsteakhouse.com and sign up for their newsletter (birthday club). \n2 - check your email at the beginning of the month of your birthday. \n3 - go to the Keg (with the coupon, if you can wait that long, or when ever you just want a good meal) \n4 - sit in the bar, M-F, from 4-7, for happy hour drinks and appetizers. \n5 - if you're still hungry, order dinner and eat in the bar area, getting the best of both worlds! \n6 - don't forget about the draft beers for $3, the Keg size wine pours, and the ultimate Orange Crush Martini!!! \n7 - rinse and repeat, I mean go back again and again . . . \n\nI'm going to!", "business_id": "xMK01ZbVUYLLoyqoeWAIVw", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-05-26", "type": "review"}
