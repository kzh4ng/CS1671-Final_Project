My father had the skirt steak which he loved, and my son had a sausage pizza.  Both said they were delish!  I usually get the eggplant parmesan with their spicy arribiata sauce but this time I had a pasta dish loaded with artichokes and shrimp in a spicy sauce.

Before sitting down make sure you get in the proper state of mind and prepare yourself for a long night of indulgence. This being my first dining experience at Alla Famiglia, I was unaware of the challenge that I had undertaken. We had A Party of Five, empty bellies and an optimistic mentality; we couldn't resist the tempting appetizers recited to us and ended up ordering the mega meatball, calamari and shrimp, and sausage over polenta. All were amazing. The meatball was the highlight: twelve ounces of perfectly cooked beef, filled with mozzarella and covered in sauce and provolone (kisses fingers). Big plus for including the tentacles in the calamari. I've noticed these legs less and less while dining out, when did they lose suction as a staple of a calamari appetizer? Also adorning our table were a few clothing options in which to dress the bread, all of them enjoyable on their own or as an ensemble.\n\nOne would think after such a hearty opener all that remained was the main course. How wrong of an assumption that turned out to be. Before we could even think about crushing our dinners, we had to face two formidable courses of salad and pasta. As mentioned by other reviewers, the salad is great. Nice dressing, nice fillers, nice roughage. The pasta that's included with the entree was a fusilli bucati in a vodka sauce served family style. Unable to pass up the promise of a great carbonara with guanciale and fresh egg, we had two pasta opponents to tackle. Both were cooked so perfectly al dente I would have put them on my NHL all-star ballot as a write-in if voting hadn't already closed.\n\nAt this point in the meal, I had completely forgotten that I still hadn't even seen my main course. And I was fine with that. As a table we compiled quite the culinary collection: bistecca fiorentina, veal milanese, veal marsala, mussels in a diavola sauce and the sea bass special for the evening. You know when a meal is so utterly divine that you just stop talking to everyone around you and have a one on one pow wow with the gastro-gods? Yeah, that's what happened. I will say at one point during the meal, my brother had to get up and take a walk around the restaurant for fear he would wake up two days later in the ICU if he didn't fight off the impending food coma that threatened his existence. Instead of napkins they should have given us a white towel and a trainer to throw it on the table for us because we were doing our best impression of Apollo Creed...and our food was Ivan Drago.\n\nOur waiter, who we thought was our friend, then had the nerve to ask if we wanted dessert, some balls on that guy. Of course we wanted dessert. We decided on the tiramisu which I hope had a clean bill of health because it blew our minds. It was so good that I was upset with myself. I did exactly what I hate seeing someone do on any and every food network show. I took a bite, put down my fork, closed my eyes and just said, \"wow!\" I just hope it was as good for the tiramisu.\n\nOther housekeeping items: you can bring your own wine for which they charge a corking fee. All the water is bottled, but I didn't see it on the bill so I figure it's included. The chef/owner is extremely friendly and accessible, as he is cooking basically right next to your table. Parking at the meters next to the building is free after 6pm, despite what it says on the signs; our waiter informed us they have an unspoken agreement with the parking authority.\n\nHeavy on the belly, heavy on the wallet, heavy in our hearts!", "business_id": "qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-01-31", "type": "review"}

I've heard very mixed things about this place, and after going in a couple of times for a happy hour I decided to get dinner one night. I didn't really know what to expect because the menu online listed dishes but no prices (as a side note: I HATE when restaurants do this!). I don't mind paying $15-20 for a good dish of food, but the quality of the pasta and sauces are totally average. I could boil a $1 box of pasta and $2 bottle of general marinara sauce at home and it wouldn't taste much worse than this food. It's definitely nice to go out for meals, particularly at a place like this that has such a well lit inside and a soothing vibe- however, I simply didn't think the quality of the food was good enough for the type of restaurant it strives to be. Furthermore, I found the people who work there to come off as a bit pretentious about the food and drink selections. In general, I would say the food and staff are a bit off putting and I wouldn't recommend this place to friends who have never been here before.

Red flag should have been when I heard them 86 the mozzarella app we got. She brought out the appetizer, and just didn't mention how there was no mozz. I guess she figured we were new and didn't know any better. It was just this ricotta ish cheese and no mozz. Okay so the app was meh, main entrees yay! (An hour after putting the order in - dying of hunger lol) \n\nHe ordered a pork dish and I had lobster ravioli. His would've been great BUT it was barely warm and tasted like it died in the window. \n\nMy ravioli (5, don't order this if you're hungry), weren't even turned upright, which yknow whatever but what disappointed me is that it looked like they had dumped it off the tray they microwaved it in. And it tasted SO MICROWAVED.

On that note, I must point out that your meal comes with salad, bread, your entree, and iced tea, AND spumoni for dessert! If you choose not to get the tea and dessert, you get to knock $1.50 off the cost of your meal. \n\nThat means that my large, tasty plate of pasta and the salad cost me $6.50.That's right folks, dinner for $6.50!\n\nThe place itself is pretty charming.

Fortunately, portions are very generous, prices are quite reasonable and The Old Spaghetti Factory scores on that basis.  The lasagna was loaded with meat and just enough ricotta to balance.  Not enough mozzarella was buried under a thick coat of ho-hum tomato sauce.  Several other cheeses were (literally) throw-in's, the dish would improve with their removal or replacement with adequate quantities of garlic, basil, oregeno and/or onion.

I wasn't sure what to make of a place with a walk-up takeout window. Last night, I followed a group of friends there for a late dinner. Didn't try any appetizers. I just split a 14' Italian special pizza--sausage, green olives and fresh garlic. The pizza was pretty good, not spectacular but definitely a couple steps above a place like Mamma Mia's whose pizza has a fast-food quality at times. Red Devil is very generous when it comes to toppings, at least on this one. I am an olive lover but haven't had green olives on pizza before. I enjoyed olives in every bite. But if you think olives are just okay, you might have found it a bit much. The pizza was kind of big for two people and with tax, it was about $18. So, I'd say it's fairly priced. \n\nI have to say that the service, more than the pizza, would draw me back. Servers who think of the little things before you even ask are much appreciated. We had a party of nine and our waiter was super patient. We also brought a birthday cake on the premises, which they allow. Our waiter started clearing all our plates and silverware and before I could ask, he said not to worry, he'd bring us clean plates and forks for the cake. He also saw someone with a camera and asked to take a picture. He just gave off a genuine vibe of being helpful.

The service was alright, great but they were pretty busy! The food came out fast and it was pretty delicious. I love the Udon noodle soup and the shrimp tempura. It's kind of expensive but the food was really good so it was worth it. The lunch specials was still a little on the expensive side but my friend got a chicken katsu and it looked really good.

There were A LOT of seafood options, but no vegetarian (they were able to accommodate but it wasn't listed) and only one chicken option. I was hoping to see at least 2 chicken options for those of us who don't love breaded chicken. There were also a lot of beef and pork options. \nThe chicken was similar to a Cordon Bleu without the ham, served with gnocchi and some sort of cheese sauce on top. I loved it but others in the party didn't care for it as much as some of the other options you can get when it's not a holiday. \n\nWe then finished with desert. \n\nService was wonderful, the food was great and we will definitely be back.", "business_id": "3CSaqRNvYg7ZdN2zwxwzVw", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-01-07", "type": "review"}

If your Vegan, getting a decent pie is tough, tougher if you are in Phoenix, tougher still if you reside in......mmmm...let's say Mississippi.\n\nWe are planning a move to CenPho and trying to try out our new hood before we actually get there so it's exciting to try some new places, hoping you will find your new favorite \"spot\". Unfortunately on my first pass, Pizza Heaven only gets 3 stars.\n\nWe did take-out and the person taking the order was friendly and nice enough but it took him 3-4 times to get the order correct. We just wanted 3 veggies on one half, a different 3 veggies on the other half. Somehow they couldn't do that or it would have been more(which I really don't understand, yes it's a different vegetable but it's only a half order....anyway) so we only got two and some breadsticks and marinara. \n\nThe place seems cool enough, good location, cozy atmosphere inside - next time we will definitely dine in. We got our pizza promptly and headed home. The large(14\") pizza was $18.50, I'm no whining cheapo but that's certainly not cheap, average maybe, but not cheap. \n\nVegan cheese is a bit tough to master(Daiya is the best and at more pizza places now). I think this is either Teese or Cheezly which are both decent but the problem was it was barely melted at all. The temp needs to be high enough and maybe I just got one that had a bad spot in the oven, we had to throw it in the oven and broil the top for a few minutes before eating which is kind of ridiculous but whatever, no biggie.\n\nThe pizza was good, seemed fresh, nothing extraordinary but decent. The breadsticks and marinara were excellent.\n\nKudos needs to be given for a pizza place in Phoenix that offers a vegan pie, as well as gluten free crust options. Most owners would scoff at the idea so I commend them as they are one of the few.\n\nI will try this place again and dine in next time, maybe they will grab a star back from me.", "business_id": "auorqdHiATGZHVd-sd79ZQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-01-22", "type": "review"}
