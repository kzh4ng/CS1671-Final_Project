We'd never dream of eating there because we like healthy yuppie food. And we only drink cheap drafts OR drink cocktails during happy hour.\n\nYour visit is largely determined by time of day, expectations and whether or not you eat their food. If you come on a Friday night, the lines will be long. You'll pay $150 for the two of you to eat, drink and play for 3 hours and you'll be left with a very sour taste in your mouth.\n\nThe staff is really excellent; any issue with a game not paying out tickets results in immediate help and extra tickets or a swipe for a different game from an employee. \n\nNote the \"drinks are weak\" reviews. Also notice it was people buying shots and ordering multiple drinks per person. That's typical white trash behavior. Bartenders here are savvy; they mirror the behavior of the guests. All of our drinks have been consistently strong and well put together because we're courteous and tip well. I have witnessed bartenders bypass tattooed, loud guests and address me and take my order first. This is rational, logical behavior. \n\nAlso note the \"prize center games suck\" comments. You're supposed to stack tickets over multiple visits and use them on a big prize. Like life, delaying gratification nets you bigger returns. Every other visit I've seen someone walk out with a video game system (Wii, Xbox360 and even a few Xbox One's). \n\nThe thing about Dave & Busters is the crowd changes depending on day of week and time of day. Sunday afternoon it's all families and Friday and Saturday night it's all drunk 20 somethings. The atmosphere changes and that's why the reviews are all over the place.\n\nThis review is based on 8ish months of 1-3/monthly visits. Most visits are 5 stars, some are 4 stars.\n\nUsing survey receipts for Buy Ten Get Ten, avoiding Wednesday, Friday or Saturday evenings (and Sunday afternoon, families) and avoiding the food entirely and drinking cheaply, you'll have a great experience for $25-40/person.\n\nI really enjoy the staff too, they split the difference between fun and professional.

The karaoke host was just lame. He was an older guy, and seemed rather cranky and jaded, which really kills the mood when you're a karaoke buff looking for a good time. And he had a CD setup -- seriously, CDs, in 2010. His song list was waaaaaay out of date.

He harassed my dinner partner and myself with a condescending tone regarding a sandwich that we order nearly every visit, which happened to be just last Sunday, in which we had great service (she must have worked at a steak house somewhere and SHOULD be the manager, her name is Erika, thank you Erika... and she was rewarded with a 30% tip.  Prior to the plate landing on the table, the waitress commented on its appearance. \n\nWe both agreed with her, tasted it as per our request to be nice, and sent it back to the kitchen as she recommended it prior to us tasting it.  It came back to the kitchen in the same condition, supposedly \"remade\"... which by that time, my sandwich was cold from waiting, in which I kindly requested it to be reheated if that was possible..  We have also ordered the same sandwich from about a dozen other Pittsburgh restaurants.. we know what it's supposed to look like and taste.\n\nNot to mention, our order was delivered wrong.  My offered sandwich toppings were not on the sandwich.  And my dinner's partner side was completely wrong.\n\nSo I complimented the waitress, I told her that she was great.  She told us that she did not know what was going on in the kitchen and that she was sorry for the third or fourth time... something that the \"Manager\" could learn to use in his vocabulary.\n\nSo after the second sandwich landed on our table, and we decided not to eat it.  My partner and I agreed to simply leave and eat elsewhere.  We were planning to pay for our drinks, and tip the waitress, and simply leave as we did not receive the food that we ordered... \n\nThen the \"Manager\" came out.. a loose cannon that has no business even working in an establishment.  He harassed us, we showed him the sandwich, a smooshed example of their culinary art that \"his guys worked so hard on\".  He did not understand the concept behind keeping customers, \"you can get it right 6/7 times a week, but tonight you got it wrong, and we are not paying for an ill-made sandwich\".  Those were my words.\n\nWe even politely called over the waitress to mediate his attitude that had no firsthand experience in our situation.. as she was readily available for us.  She flipped her story, so the sandwich and kitchen that was off in her opinion was suddenly on their A game tonight.  I guess the three to four prior apologies from her was also none of the \"Manager\"'s concern.   \n\nHe threatened to call the police and told us that he never wanted to see us again.  This was after he personally insulted myself for having a couple of light beers...as I was \"welcomed back to enjoy drinks since I enjoyed them so much.\" I told him that a personal insult was unnecessary and with that, I also advised him to attend a management school and that we will not pay for our meal.  He then harassed us more, asking us what was wrong with my sandwich.. at that point I was done.  I simply told him that we were not paying because of the way he treated us.\n\nThe staff illustrates the faces behind the business.  The Saloon would be great in the right hands, but it's in the wrong hands, run by people that may have over 30 years of ownership, but zero concern for their customers nor any competence in organizing and managing their business.  And that lends itself to a less than mediocre ambiance, low food quality, and inconsistent service... hence the 3 - 3.5 star rating seen around the Internet.  And the 5 stars... they had Erika and no \"Manager\" presence nor drinks from the bar.  Not to mention, the bartender has little competence in mixing drinks, hence the long beer list.  Save some money, fire the manager and the bartender.\n\nAfter walking half a block home, we changed our clothes from our traumatizing, filth of an experience from our lovely, family friendly neighborhood restaurant, and headed to the Walnut Grill, where we sent back the sandwich only once (thanks to a kitchen error on the order), there were only smiles and no threats.  There's a reason why Walnut Grill has several locations, the ambiance is killer, the service is stellar, the drinks are mixed the correct way, and the food is just as edible the next day, because it's that great to take home.  \n\nIF the owners were savvy and recognized that they live in 2015, they would know that this review alone can hurt their business by up to 20% or more.  I hope it does.\n\nA $8.99 Sandwich and incompetent service.. lost a tab + tip which was going to be paid.. weekly patrons.. and has initiated an interview with our dedicated lawyer.", "business_id": "jJfTh2O3M2Q716akd9Dr9w", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-05-10", "type": "review"}

Suddenly, they have a bacon night, the interior is hipster chic and the food has been significantly upgraded.\n\nI just recently went there again this past Saturday with my daughter Muff and my sister Luch and we had a pig-out moment. There is no good reason why three people should order entrees and several appetizers for lunch, but we did that.  My sister and I ordered the Salmon BLTs. (She tried to be healthy by ordering a side salad with her sandwich, but I went all the way in by ordering the fries to go with!)  Muff ordered the \"I Can Has Bacon Cheezburger?\" and tatter tots. (Muff could only finish half of burger since we got the appetizers too.) We also ordered the Hush Piggies, which are home-made tatter tots with bacon and cheddar cheese (What's wrong with that?) and Chimichurri Flurry wings.  (Those wings were delightful and delicious!  I usually ask that my wings be fried on the hard side, but they instinctively knew that's the best way to serve them.)\n  \nWe also ordered the Cookies-N-Cream dessert which is a hot chocolate cookie served in a small cast iron pan with a scoop of French vanilla ice cream and hot fudge sauce.  I'm not really a dessert person, but I have to say that that warm chocolate chip cookie with the ice cream was tasty.  Go on Harris Grill, you have stepped up your game! \n\nIt's nice when an older restaurant in a quote, unquote \"chic\" neighborhood decides to do a remix of their space and menu.  That has been the death knell of many established restaurants. (I miss Eddie's Restaurant in the Hill District for a good old-fashioned soul food breakfast.

We like just about every other place in Charlotte have had an Issue here and I warn you, the wife ordered a steak prepared a certain way and the waiter brought it out cooked Hawaiian or something along those lines and the kitchen told him to bring it to the table and offer it to her.\n\nReally she ordered it prepared one way and you want to bring what she did not order to the table? Mind Blowing.\n\nI told the waiter do not let the kitchen jeopardize your tip by offering what the customer did not order. \n\nThe biggest part about this was that the ease the restaurant offered us the wrong order knowing it was not what we ordered. So it brings 2 questions to mind:\n\nDo they make a lot of these mistakes?\n\nDo they offer the wrong order and people take it?\n\nManagement may need to get a hold of their kitchen staff and make it clear how they need to pay attention to detail and serve ONLY what was ordered.\n\nOkay, I understand if they did this why the 4 rating? Well we have been here 5 times, you get 3 strikes in my book before you are out. and 1 out of 5 visits is not a killer.\n\nJust focus Harper's you have potential but as my standard for Customer Service \"Devil is in the Details\"\n\nPS\n\nWe did go one other time and the wife's steak was cold and had to be sent back for warming.", "business_id": "hIQRiE3UsYH7UsrsDwJwLA", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-05-14", "type": "review"}

The brisket was smashing, the pulled pork was very good, ribs were spot on (this was before I became a Yelper).  So we decide to go last evening and MAN were we disappointed.  Now, I hate that my second review rivals my first inasmuchas I am not writing a good review, but I feel that this must be done before any Yelper out there goes and blows good money on dinner here.  \n\nThe most disappointing aspect of our visit was the smoked beef brisket.  I cook and understand that to keep brisket moist, there needs to be a fat content to the meat.  What I recieved last night was underprepped and under cooked brisket (It was done to temperature, but for brisket to be done correctly, it must be cooked until the fat renders more making the meat tender).  There was so much fat, and it was fairly tough.  \n\nMy wife ordered the Chicken Portobello ($13.95) and got a grilled chicken breast (Dry) next to a stuffed protobello mushroom (burned).  I still haven't figured out what we paid that preposterous price for.   \n\nThe kids enjoyed their meals: a dry chicken breast for my son and a slightly overcooked burger for my daughter, but she mainly ate the fries (which were good!)\n\nThe shining star of the meal was the St. Louis ribs on my combo plate.  Smokey and just tender enough to eat easily without literally dropping off the bone.  Unfortunatly they no longer keep BBQ sauce at the table (you have to ask for it?!?!) and I used to enjoy mixing up the varieties to make new flavors.  \n\nThe food was disappointing, but what further bothers me is that had I been the waiter, I would never have served the food to my wife.  It was visibly dry and not terribly appealing.  I worry for the service industry when servers are expected to serve unappealing food rather than taking it back to the kitchen and getting a fresh plate (Bottom line restauranting).  \n\nAnyhow, I am not a problem customer, I just expect a little more for my money than I got.  We will not return, so I will have a new restaurant to review as we search for a good meal!\n\nEAT WELL!\n\nVic", "business_id": "KxJ5DRcSo83N-GW4f_gMQQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2008-04-16", "type": "review"}

This was the only one. For a good reason. \nWhile it is agreed that the place is not very good to look at, the food and service was exceptional. The atmosphere was very typical to a college pub on a weekend, though it was not very busy for a Friday night. \nI ordered the Big Daddy burger and it was among the best I've ever eaten. It is 2 patties, I believe quarter pounders, standard toppings lettuce, tomato, pickles and (super fresh) onions, 3 types of wisconsin cheese, mayo, ham, summer sausage and bacon. All with a knife through the crown bun. All for only $11. The fried cheese curds were also the best I've ever had. The clam chowder wasn't the best I've ever had, but it's worth noting that they don't skimp on the clams. The kids ordered chicken strips, and devoured them. I sampled some gumbo, the prime rib sandwich and sweet potato fries off of my sister-in-law's plate and they were delicious as well. \nThe waitstaff was very attentive and friendly. There were televisions in the dining area as well as the bar area to watch the local baseball game. Heck, they even let me charge my phone b/c it died trying to find the place from my hotel. \nI suppose the only negative is that the women's bathroom was very crammed. My 13-year old daughter told me it was very small, even for her. \nThere were video games there too, but the kids wanted to get back tot he hotel to swim so I' can't comment on their quality other than they are there.\nOverall, the amount of food for the money is unlike anything I've ever experienced.", "business_id": "G1qUGBNYNS220jKlPAlFsA", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-04-20", "type": "review"}

(See Pointe Hilton Tapatio Cliffs Resort for my hotel review.) The primary differences between my experiences at the restaurant seem to center around the volume of people and the time of year you go.  The service AND food were much better during off-peak season.  Phoenix is a very seasonal city and the restaurants and hotels are sometimes overwhelmed when peak season hits in February.\n\nFirst of all, yes, come for the view.  And if you want fancy, this is where you go for fancy.  So don't get all worked up because they don't have a ribeye or burgers.\n\nYou are mostly paying for the view and the ambiance, and both are wonderful.  If weather permits, ask for an outside table when you call for a reservation.  \n\nSecond, prepare for the expense.  Dinner is about $29-$45 just for your entree, and the wine, while excellent, is commensurate with the food prices.  \n\nI have had the lobster bisque, which is out of this world, and the pan-seared diver scallops, which were average, as appetizers.   The lobster bisque is, of course, really super rich and fattening, and even though I wanted to slurp the whole thing down (which would be frowned upon in a place this upscale) I controlled myself, but I still felt like I was going to pop by the time dinner came.  Maybe share one with a friend.  (It was worth the popping feeling.)\n\nAt my first two visits here, the bread came out early and was delicious.  At the last visit, I had to ask for it three times and just gave up when it still wasn't there when my entree arrived.  The three sauces they bring with it are all yummy (again, fattening).\n\nIn my continuing quest to reacquaint myself with my hip bones, have tried three of the four salads, including the hierloom tomato carpaccio (tasty and light but nothing out of this world), the crisp apple and micro herbs (much more interesting and really delicious), and the blood orange and rocket arugula (very tasty and interesting).  Salads will run you from $11-$13.\n\nAt $43, the filet mignon was probably the tastiest entree I have had there, and it was well prepared and had cooked to my picky little specifications.  One time I had the Chef's feature, which was sea bass and was delicious.  I tasted friend's plates and the pork tenderloin was really quite good.  Another friend has the osso bucco and said it was good, but I really wouldn't know as I don't eat baby lambs.  \n\n I have had the scallops as an entree and found them to be mediocre at best.  I actually felt pretty ill after eating them for dinner, but again, that was a very busy night and they fell down on all counts that night.  I would have given them one or two stars that night, while both other experiences were at least a three or four.  \n\nI am not a big dessert eater (again with my missing hip bones) but we did the wine and chocolate sampler one night and it was fun enough and interesting enough to be worth the $16.  I shared that one with three friends.\n\nIt is worth a visit, especially if you are staying at the resort and have budgeted for an expensive night out.  I would, however, suggest you go very early if you go at peak season, and try to avoid a very chaotic rush.", "business_id": "3Zsjlum5kl5N5KV712aTMQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-04-01", "type": "review"}

They have a nice array of fresh fruit, pastries, yogurts, morning meats, eggs, potatoes to go along with the BEST granola I have ever had. The granola had mango's, banana's and pineapple in it and I made sure to eat a hearty amount of it every morning. \n\nI would highly recommend starting your day here if you are a fan of breakfast.", "business_id": "faitVIiNezSN0ogZQSZPWQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-03-15", "type": "review"}

We've been a few times and the food is probably a 3 overall, it really depends on what you order.  The service staff have always done a good job, but I think we always get the head waitress (or is she the owner?).  But the place is just cool, so we keep going back.  If you go later on a Saturday evening, they have karoke and the people are actually pretty good.  They have a crowd of regulars, who want to make sure you feel welcome.  It's mostly an older crowd (I'm in my 20s), but on an evening when you are just looking for some chill entertainment, and if you love country music, check this place out.  It's like going to the Buffalo Chip in Cave Creek before everyone found out about it.

A hotel bar in the middle of nowhere if you don't feel like taking a cab somewhere cooler.  I, for one, cannot stand being confined to my hotel room for hours.  I happened to be staying next door at the Courtyard and decided to go for a walk here to see if the scene was any more entertaining than the atmosphere there that can only be described as the result if Starbucks and a hospital decided they were going to combine thief boring forces to make a bar (if you're staying there, you know what I'm talking about).  Thus, I was excited as I wandered the hallways of the ugliest Hilton hotel I have ever seen to hear the chatter of men and women having a good time.  As i turned the corner, I was even more excited to find myself in a dimly lit sizable full bar with 6 flat screens in sight from my perch on a high bar stool as I write these run on sentences.  ;)  I'm not a hockey fan, but with no other sports in season, I'll take it.,  I'm not eating yet, but the menu looks like cheesy southwestern food - good enough if I pound a few more salty dogs from the friendly bartender.

Don't blink as you drive down 40th Street, or you'll miss it between the junk yard and the industrial complex.\n\nThe interior is an eclectic mixture of sports memorabilia (go Bears!), circa 1986 wall art, and kitchen decorating on a dime. Tables and chairs mostly match and are of the church basement variety. You'll also find a pool table here, but no play until after 2pm so that customers can lunch in peace.\n\nThe menu contains a standard bar and grill offerings, and everything I've had has been quite good. The salads are huge with fresh toppings, though I admit I wasn't a fan of the sherry vinaigrette and had to turn it in for ranch. I've also tried their pierogi special, which was as authentic as I'd find in the Red Apple in Chicago (but less greasy).\n\nThe staff are the best part of this diner. My waitress was happy, funny, and very attentive. I'm annoyed by waitstaff who show up when I don't need them and hide when I do, but our server was perfect. I'd recommend this place because of her, even if the food was bad.\n\nPlenty of parking available off street. They also have a full bar for afternoon meetings.
