That was my experience of Tessaro's. Had I never heard of it before, it may have gotten an extra star. But, this restaurant was on the Pittsburgh's top 25 a few years back. This is supposed to be the best burgers in the 'burgh. If that were the case, I'd stick to making my own. \nHubs and I stopped at T's on a recent Friday night after conducting some business in the area. Baby on board, we walked in and waited to be greeted. The inside looked a bit old and run down. Tip: they do not have highchairs only booster seats which is impossible to get a squirmy baby to stay in. I would not suggest bringing a baby here. The tables are also very small and close together. We actually had to move the table out to get in and out of the corner booth. I decided on the basic cheeseburger and ordered the boiled red skin potatoes for the baby and a side of chips for me fully expecting homemade chips. Not the case. I got a handful of what seemed to be a ruffles knock off. The potatoes were very bland despite being served with warm butter on the side. Great for a picky baby. Bad for an adult who is looking for something tasty. Now to the burger. Huge, yes. Juicy, not even close. Despite ordering my burgers well done, I expect them to still be tender and juicy. This was not the case. My burger was as dry as a burnt piece of chicken. I ate half of it. We were in a bit of a hurry so I didn't mention it to my server, though I'm not sure it would have made a difference seeing hubs medium burger was also dry.

Hey 'Burgh...what's up with all your decent establishments being closed on a Sunday?  Harris Grill wasn't, and we're certainly thankful for that.\n\nThis review should actually reflect 4.5 or 4.75 stars if possible- just a neat place.  We ventured over and found parking without issue.  I can imagine on a Friday or Sat evening this might be a little more challenging.  Since it was a beautiful fall evening, we opted to sit outside and we were approached quickly by our waitress with water, and asked for a moment to review the hysterical drink menu.  Much props to a place that doesn't take itself too seriously.  Just read the menu and if you have an ounce of humor in your body, you should at least salts (smile a little then stop).  I salt because LOL is so yesterday.\n\nI opted for the manly Sangria, which was outstanding, and she got some lemonade concoction with vodka.  Both were hits.  We also read a lot about the hummus, so we were followers and went with it...very pleased we did.  A great appetizer.\n\nShe went with the skirt steak mac n cheese.  I went with the lobster and crab mac.  I'm just going to laugh at my kids when I make them microwave mac n cheese from here forward.  THIS is mac n cheese- it's creamy and fattening and has a crunchy topping and soft noodles (but not too soft) and well...it's perfect.  There were generous portions of lobster and crab in my dish and it was delish.  Her steak was seasoned and cooked to perfection.  I was almost jealous I didn't get it, but then I'd grab a huge hunk of seafood and quickly realize the mistake of my ways.  Both are very rich dishes.  If you can finish the big plate of mac, God bless you---you're a better person than I am.  However, it does make for a wonderful breakfast.  Don't judge me.  \n\nShe finished with a dessert type drink that featured Rumchatta and strawberries- not my thing (said the guy who ordered Sangria), but she enjoyed it.  Dessert looked tempting, but the button on my jeans was already stressed, and not wanting to hold my pants up on the walk back to the car, I shook off the waitress and asked for the check.\n\nIf memory serves, 3 drinks, an app and 2 fine dinners came to roughly $75 plus tip, so, roughly $90....and if I lived there, I'd do it at least once a month or more.  The menu is diverse (and funny).  The service is timely and I saw a manager deal with a couple 'difficult' customers in a way that I'd want my manager to treat any customer.

Unfortunately I have noticed a marked decline in the quality of their food (at both locations).  Though the portions have remained relatively generous, I would rather have a smaller amount of better food, if that is what is required to up the quality.\n\nAfter an especially harrowing few weeks, the boss decided to reward me for not going on a homicidal rampage by giving me a gift card for Harper's.  So, on a Wednesday evening right after work, off to Harper's I went to spend the balance of my gift card.  I say this only in that if I were spending my own money, rather than the boss man's, I would not have ordered a steak at Harper's, I would save that for a steak place.\n\nTheir menu is on the smaller side, but it contains a variety of beef, chicken, pork and fish dishes.   I decided to splurge and try their prime rib served with a loaded baked potato ($25).  It was an inch thick, medium as requested and looked delicious.  Upon cutting into it - bleh.  Tough and chewy, and the dull knife was not helping out.  I had to saw at the piece of meat to get bites cut and immediately dipped it into the tasty au jus (salty meat juice, yum) to get any kind of flavor.  It honestly tasted like a hunk of meat taken off of the roast beef carving station at some kind of buffet.  Harper's isn't a \"steak\" place, but I expected better.  The loaded baked potato was delicious.  \n\nFor dessert, there was a \"homemade\" pumpkin cheesecake ($6).  It was fine, nothing special.  It was not very creamy, and not very pumpkiny, but that might be a personal preference of mine as far as cheesecake consistency and flavor goes.  I wouldn't bother to order it again.\n\nMy server, Tonji, was spectacular.  She kept my ginger ales coming and continued to check on how my meal was going, without being interruptive.  The manager did stop by and ask how the meal was and I should have spoken up, but I hate being \"that girl\".  \n\nI have spent all of the $50 gift card and wouldn't intentionally return to either of the Harper's locations any time soon - the meal from the Carolina Place location on Saturday was mediocre and the dinner at the Southpark location on Wednesday wasn't anything to write home about either (though the wait staff at both locations was quite good). \n\n(Another piddly comment I have - wait staff shouldn't set up in the rest room changing clothes/getting ready for shift and gossiping.  As a paying guest, I shouldn't have to shuffle around them to get to a stall and then again to wash my hands.)", "business_id": "hIQRiE3UsYH7UsrsDwJwLA", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-10-17", "type": "review"}

First off, the menu.  Their menu is very vegetarian friendly.  Hummus, spin-art dip, soft pretzels, tater tots, pizza, cheese plates, 2 veggie sammies, some salads and a Spicy Beer Cheese Soup that I wish I had tried.  So I definitely give credit to a place that tries to be veg-friendly.\n\nI ordered the Hippie Burger (veggie patty).  It was OK.  But the thing was that it came with a side, and I asked the server if the potato salad had bacon in it.  She said no.  But the first bite had bacon in it.  So, I'll just say that I was very dissatisfied with that.\n\nWhatever, I kept trucking.  And anyways, the real reason to go to this place is the beer.  I'm sure other reviewers have gone into great detail about their gigantic beer selection, so I'll keep it short.  While the idea is great, it falls a little short.  While the size of the menu is supposed to be its selling point, its just too big!!!  And it has a lot of filler.  I noticed one reviewer who said that this is the biggest beer selection in NC.  Well, maybe, but biggest is not necessarily best (innuendo unavoidable :)  It's hard to take a lot of pride in a beer bar that has a bunch of macros and second rate micros, but (if my eyes don't deceive me) not a single saison?  And barely any lambics to speak of.  Whatever, they still have some pretty good stuff, I'm just being picky, but it seems like with a little quality control their selection could go from good to great.\n\nThis one was a little tough to rate.  Part of me wants to give it a 2 (bacon), part a 3 (atmosphere), part a 4 (beer and food menu), and part a 5 (the idea).  So take that 3 I gave it according to what you want out of this place.\n\nOh yeah, this place can be REALLY loud inside.

Overall, though, it is far and away my favorite Food Fight place and a fairly reliable spot to get a good meal.\n\nMonty's food is better than hit-or-miss but not quite consistently good.  Most of the things I've eaten there, especially the breakfast foods, have been delicious (and huge), but I've had a couple of very sub-par meals (one was so bad I literally could not eat more than a couple of bites).  The things that I ate and disliked are now off the menu, so that does say something for their ability to identify what's working and what isn't.  What I can say is that the egg-based breakfast-y menu items are almost universally good.  The \"scrambled something-or-other\" never fails to disappoint, nor does the newer Blue Plate Omelet (the one with cheddar, avocado and bacon... good lord!).  And the breakfast burrito is especially good, even without chorizo (which is how I usually order it).  As for the breakfast side items, the potatoes are just okay; the biscuits are great.  Most importantly of all, the coffee is superb (even my mother thinks so and she drinks a hell of a lot more coffee than I do).  Unfortunately, I tend to shy away from the lunch and dinner items so I can't really speak to their quality.  The pies, though, are heaven.  And it's certainly worth noting that the menu pays special attention to including veg*n options.\n\nThe atmosphere is pretty awesome.  Outdoor seating is spacious and comfy.  Indoors, the blue-topped tables are fun for making patterns with the wet bottom of your water glass.  Get a booth if you can; the tables are a bit cramped.  The waitstaff are generally friendly and attentive.\n\nThe upshot is that if you think you'll enjoy eating at a diner that's 70% greasy spoon and 30% hipster hot spot, and if you like breakfast foods and are a \"good orderer\" (you choose from menus wisely), Monty's is an excellent choice.", "business_id": "fjaQ3Ixkofh8xGhklUtDnA", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-09-14", "type": "review"}

I was definitely impressed by the modern stylings and decor. To give Majerle's some credit, they did actually honor their agreement to participate in the pub crawl, offering a drink special, but it turns out that the disgustingly sweet $3 Stoli strawberry lemonades were available to everyone. There were also no food samples. Why did we buy pub crawl wristbands again? \n\nWe attempted to make up for the slowly-worsening pub crawl experience by ordering vodka shots. There was some miscommunication between the bartenders because when the girl we ordered them from disappeared and another bartender approached us to ask if we needed help, we somehow ended up with two rounds of shots. Naturally, we didn't want to pay for both, a statement that got us quite a bit of attitude from the bartenders. The mistake wasn't entirely their fault (we could have been clearer, I supposed), but I could have done without the 'tude, especially since you can just pour vodka back into a bottle.

Luckily the waitress hadn't cleared the wing plate and I was able to use the ranch to get 1/2 of my sandwich down.

He waited patiently for 15 minutes for our waitress to reappear, finally asking some other server for mayo. She also refilled our drinks.

Between my group we had a Hurricane, Gin and Tonic, Whiskey Sour, a Little Birdy, and an order of Poutine.\n\nHappy hour drinks at $5-6, you don't expect much. But these staples actually hold their own against bars that would sell theirs for $10+. The gin and tonic was refreshing with the addition of lime juice. The Whiskey Sour had a nice balanced tart flavor from the fruit. And the Hurricane was basically alcoholic juicy goodness.\n\nFrom the food, literally comfort food at its finest. The Little Birdy - that in house biscuit, plus that awesome succulent fried chicken and slice of cheese - some of the best $5 I've ever spent. And the Poutine is glorious. Probably some of the most conservative, it's close to the traditional sense of just gravy and cheese, but they opt to use a peppery country style gravy and cheddar cheese. It's makes you feel a little worse and better at the same time.\n\nThe fact that this place is basically in the middle of a sketchy neighborhood actually added to the appeal for me.

It was still an operating pharmacy and soda fountain as recently as 1991, at which time the pharmacy side of the business surrendered to new era competition. Fortunately, the soda fountain remains. \n\nI'm awarding five stars, partly out of annoyance with snarky one and two star reviewers unaware of the spot's historical significance, but mainly out of love for MacAlpine's ice cream concoctions. Moreover, how can you not award five stars to the establishment where Wayne Newton was discovered in 1962? Note to the one and two star reviewers: Wayne Newton is an American singer and entertainer who is best known for his 1963 hit song Danke Schoen and more recently as a surgically enhanced Las Vegas headliner.\n\nI must confess that I'm not a huge fan of the food at MacAlpine's. How often do you read that in a five star review? Let me clarify. The menu is fine, but why would you want to risk eating a Sloppy Joe and not leaving room for a sundae? Another note for prospective one and two star reviewers: The ice cream at MacAlpine's is not hand crafted. It's basic ice cream, served in a manner consistent with the tradition of a soda fountain. Just as it should be. If you want Sweet Republic or Churn like flavors, go to those establishments and please don't write a negative review for MacAlpine's. \n\nMacAlpine's is amazingly kid friendly. Also friendly for anyone else who still has a little bit of kid within. There are roughly 100 flavors of soda from which to choose. One hundred!!! Want a sundae instead? How about Bears at the Beach, a Carousel or Dirt & Worms? They also have a variety of sundaes that cater more to adult tastes (if you must). Or instruct the waitress construct the customized treat of your dreams. The location on Seventh Street is an ideal stopping place before or after a downtown trip to the Science Center, a Dbacks game... Note to one and two star reviewers: Sure, there is a lot of dusty and worn old stuff on the premises. Just remember, you too will one day be old and worn if you're lucky enough to make it over 80 years (and it wouldn't be polite to point it out to you). I suggest you travel back in time and embrace MacAlpine's quirky nature.

It will give you a little yellow token that you can validate when you are leaving and will save you the hassle of trying to find a spot in this busy location. \n\nNow for the restaurant! This is one of my favorite restaurants to go to and the only Cheesecake Factory location I really like. The atmosphere is very lively sometimes noisy and most workers are very friendly and helpful. The lighting is rather dim in certain seating locations. I would say it is \"too romantic\" when it comes to the lighting if that was a lighting setting. \n\nAlmost all of the servers I have had in the past were great with timing, knowledge of the vast menu, friendliness and attention to your needs. The food is always great and I have never regretted my decision when ordering. The Red Sangria and Moscow Mules were perfect for drink choices. I even ordered an A.M.F. (a dangerously blue heavier alcoholic drink. Those who know understand) which was not even on the drink menu. I was surprised on how accommodating this location was. They even bring an extra plate if you are sharing a dish and have split it up before. I recommend the Shrimp Bistro Pasta or Chicken Madeira for a main entree and the Portabella, Avocado and Zucchini Fries for an appetizer. Those are just my go to choices. \n\nThe only problem, as with every other Cheesecake Factory or Man vs. Food competition, is trying to reach that last bite and in this scenario it's the cheesecake. This cheesecake is probably more total calories than all the food leading up to it and it's worth it. If you ask for a cheesecake to-go container you will put it in the fridge only to open it up before bed and finish it.\n\nI highly recommend this location and restaurant chain and don't forget to validate before leaving.", "business_id": "2r8jGeuYvMkyP2ik_X-Bxw", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-09-14", "type": "review"}

Our order was simple- burgers, etc., but it took nearly a half hour to be served.  The restaurant is relatively large but only one small area was open to guests and that made it very loud and gave a crowded feeling to dinner.  When we did get our order, there was little or no  follow-up with more coffee, etc.  The evening was full of apologies and reassurances.  It may have been a fluke, but that evening, the place was not even up to  the moderate service standard at most Coco's.  The coconut custard pie was excellent, though, when it finally arrived.

I even liked the cleverness of the name and was looking forward to a nice experience, but unfortunately I was sorely disappointed. While the view and atmosphere were very nice our service there was inexcusably poor. We ended up with a guy named Larry who was extremely inattentive, unfriendly, and all around just unprofessional. When he would finally come around he would walk away literally after two minutes WHILE we were still speaking. He was curt and abrupt in his responses and almost hit me with a knife when he dropped the silverware and did not even excuse himself or apologize. Unfortunately his brusque, rude behavior was not merely limited to our table. However, the hostesses, bussers and other waiters around us were all great, so much so we were tempted to move to another table. Maybe he was having a bad night, but for this type of establishment and for the amount of money you're laying out you would expect half-way decent service. The food was hit and miss. The Kobe short ribs were great- flavorful and tender- the tangyness of the balsamic reduction was a nice foil against the mild sweetness of the perfectly creamy polenta. Consequently, we had great expectations for our entrees- if the service was bad at least our food would be good, but alas to our dismay again we were somewhat disappointed. The central elements of our meals, the steak and halibut, were both flavorless and overdone though the supporting casts of sauces and sides were very flavorful and well prepared. The shrimp with the lemon fennel reduction was fabulous, but it could not mask the dryness and lack of flavor in the halibut. The steak was tough and flavorless and when sent back returned somewhat less tough, but still flavorless. Definitely not at all in the caliber of a Ruth's Chris, JnG, or even Fleming's or the Keg. The creme brulee was nice though nothing outstanding and the chocolate amandine had a flat pre-packaged taste- after a few bites we left the remainder. There are too many other great restaurants in Phoenix with fantastic views and ambience to waste this type of money on poor service and mediocre food.", "business_id": "3Zsjlum5kl5N5KV712aTMQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-09-28", "type": "review"}

Yelp doesn't seem to have a separate listing for it.  This review is for the bar/lounge and wine list.  Although I do get food when I am there, they change the menu often so i don't feel it's fair to review food that won't be on the menu in a few months.\n\nI have been going here for five years now and I never get sick of it.  They have a fabulous wine list and one of the most breathtaking views in all of Phoenix.  This place is a hidden gem and I'm always amazed when people say they have never heard of it.\n\nThe bar/lounge is completely walled with glass so you can see the city view from any seat within the bar/lounge.  The seating outside is a fabulous set up.  You can sit in a circle seating area around a fire pit, at a communal couch area, or at separate tables right at the edge of the mountain.  There is also a hidden seating area off to the West side that gives you a completely different view of the city.\n\nSometimes in the winter the chef will make homemade marshmallows infused with different liqueurs.  The cocktail servers will give you sticks to roast your marshmallows at the fire pit and they also provide different dipping sauces.  This is one of my favorite times of the year!!!  Don't miss out if you are there in the winter time!\n\nThe only complaint I have about this place is that it can be rented out so it is frequently closed for private parties.  ALWAYS CALL AHEAD TO  FIND OUT IF THEY ARE OPEN!\n\nThe staff is always amazing.  Bill, the manager, is always making sure you are enjoying your visit and April and Richard down at the Terrance Room are fabulous! \n\nDon't miss out on a drink and view at the Terrace Room!", "business_id": "3Zsjlum5kl5N5KV712aTMQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-09-24", "type": "review"}
