We have heard that their wings are great and decided it was finally time to check it out. Their wings are whole wings and crispy, which is a nice change of pace. I got their wet Cajun sauce and garlic butter wings. The Cajun did not have a bold enough flavor for me and their sauce is too thin. The sauce was also thin for the garlic butter, but that is more expected. They were better than average, but I don't like seeing all the sauce resting at the bottom of the boat. I would definitely come try this place out again to sample some of the other items on the menu, but this will probably not become a regular stop for wings anytime soon.", "business_id": "UsFtqoBl7naz8AVUBZMjQQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-03-29", "type": "review"}

Too bad I never took piano lessons and I'd probably end up mumbling half the lyrics other than the chorus. Unless it's Salt n' Pepa's Shoop. \n\nThis is a really great place to go when you have out of town guests or are looking for a fun place to take someone for a birthday celebration or a fun night out. It's just something different to do other than boozing it up at the bars on a Saturday night. \n\nKeep in mind you'll be paying around a $5-10 cover plus whatever drinks and food you get. The good thing is the food is coming from the attached Rock Bottom Brewery. So a lot of it is restaurant quality good. Plus the brewery beer is actually pretty good! OF course you will be paying restaurant price drinks...so of course they're up charged a bit. But you do pay for the whole experience....so you gotta get into the spirit with some spirits! \n\nThe guys who play are incredibly talented. There's 2 guys that will take requests and play songs on the piano. They pretty much play ANYTHING you ask. Contemporary songs, throw back songs, fight songs, rap songs, pop songs. You name it, they play it. \n\nMy favorite part is when they switch out to another two guys. They'll all four get on stage and play two piano's, a guitar and drums. They usually rock out with some fun familiar songs (um, Journey, of course!). \n\nThe birthday song is seriously the best. They sing to you....and call you some names....with expletives.

I was excited! I haven't been to this Dave and Buster's since I was younger and was ready to go back and play me some games! I went with my cousins, mind you, we hadn't ate all day and were very hungry. So, we decided to do the Eat & Play Combo, naturally. Here's where it gets bad. First of all, we get a very snobby hostess that shows us to our table. Then, we wait...and wait...and finally after about 25 mins we get a waitress. Her name was Ashley. We had plenty of time to decide what we wanted, so we quickly put our order in. Next, we were sitting and talking, waiting, we had empty glasses and our waitress had never even come around to see if we needed refills except for one time. She said she'd come back right away with our refills...yea, right. 20 mins later we get our refills. Mind you, our food still hasn't came yet. I see other people getting their food that had come in after us. I was frustrated. After waiting 45 mins for our food, I asked to speak with a manager. One of the servers who I asked replied rudely with \"Well, he's really busy right now. I doubt he'll be able to come out and talk to you\". Finally, 15 mins later...that's one hour, folks. We get our food. What do you think the next problem was? Yep, the food was cold. I was completely fed up at this point, and told my waitress how disappointed I was, especially after driving one hour just to have this terrible service. The manager never came to speak with me, and we didn't even receive our meals for free. The only compensation we got were $10 game cards. Woopty-doo. The only thing good about this place is the games, but the prizes you get for your tickets are all junk and worthless. So, in conclusion...I DO NOT RECOMMEND THE WATERFRONT DAVE AND BUSTERS OF HOMESTEAD, PA.

It really is a Pittsburgh staple but come on....\n\nFood is really, really average. I love the ribs and wings, but it's about the same as any other rib place in the city, only they charge an arm and a leg for it. This place is for the people that feel that they are at a real rib place, but don't want to cross Centre or Penn Ave. to get real ribs. It, technically is in Shadyside so your Mercedes will be safe! \n\nThe ambiance: The restaurant is always crowded. Not just crowded, but packed with teens underage drinking, families with too many kids that overflow to your \"space\" and collage kids who also spill over from the bar. IT'S LOUD AS HELL!!! Forget about a nice quiet dinner. There seems to be no consideration for customers at all. Last time I was there, there was a St. Patrick's Day party (it was NOT St. Patrick's Day) that took over the whole place. Though the staff tried (nah, they didn't really try) to keep them in the so called \"party room\" I was bumped into several times, spilled my beer, and couldn't hear my wife speak. But as long as they got their money; they could give a crap. Oh and there are like 100 TVs to interrupt any conversation at your table.\n\nWant to sit in the bar area? Good luck. You will see a mix of drunk people, women who look like high-end prostitutes and college kids who are only missing a beer bong. Also IT'S LOUD AS HELL!!!!!!!!\n\nThe \"wonderful\" Staff: It seems like it's everyone's first day. To put it lightly; the staff suck! To be sure, you will be waiting for your your drinks, food and bill for a very, very long time. Expect to be there for about 2-3 hours. The wait staff are forgetful, inattentive and very sloppy at their job. It pains me to leave any tip for them. Most of the staff are hot, stacked, absolutely stupid and should be working at Hooters not a place where your bill will be upwards of $50 for two people. Be prepared to be met with this saying, \"Oh, like ohmygod, I am so sorry i forgot that, he he!\" (oh she's twisting her finger in her hair while she's talking). You will get bad service...period (in fact, I can't remember the last time a wait person actually wrote down my order, and they're idiots so no worries).\n\nThe food: Kinda good. Menu is huge, you'll find something you like. But I go there about 2-3 times a year for the food. It is way too expensive. Do not take a date there. Your average bill for a meal with actual proteins will run you in the high 40s without booze. There are so many bar-food places that don't claim to be high class that are just as good as this place. I grew up with the rib sauce and love it, but for your average consumer, skip it!\n\nThis place is a wannabe sports bar that tries too hard to be high end. Just watch out for the vomiting college kids with trust funds...they're everywhere!!!!!", "business_id": "Ts4xsKPU7FNPPZRj-nRjIg", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-05-08", "type": "review"}

Mac n' cheese should be creamy, salty, buttery. So sorry but this weenie came up flat too. I did like the Mason Dixon! The crunchy-ness of the coleslaw made a huge difference but the meat was still chewy and too salty. Could it be that I am too picky when it comes to my meat?

Berryhill Store for 70 years. During the 60's & 70's, the building housed multiple businesses, from a paint store, a thrift store, grocery store and delicatessen. In 1983, Michael Alexanders neighborhood tavern opened for business. \n\nA popular neighborhood institution, Al Mike's retains some interesting building characteristics, such as the supporting pole almost directly in front of the women's restroom door, which lends itself to many a bumped head as well as built in coolers that are original turn of the century ice box coolers. \n\nWe dined on the Spicy Crab Soup, which one of my dining partners characterized as melted Velveeta with crab and while that description might sound rather unappealing, it was quite yummy. In addition to the three cheese on Texas Toast sandwich, which was ok, but a bit on the dry side, my other dining companions had other basics, such as sandwiches and burgers. This is tavern food, so don't go expecting high end meals. The appeal of this restaurant, as a visitor to Charlotte, is that it is located in the Fourth Ward, a small district of brick and Victorian buildings and the unique history of the building that houses Al Mike's.", "business_id": "ePP0Eqz8JKSbtdt2phiB4A", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-05-27", "type": "review"}

To be fair, we knew it was pricey.  So we were happy to give it a go, considering that someone else was picking up the tab!\n\nIn any case, wanting to try something unusual that I can't get anywhere else, I chose the Wild Boar.  Four slices of tenderloin and a small chunk of shoulder, served atop a bed of spinach, which in turn was on top of some sort of risotto (rice-like) mixture, and the whole shebang was highlighted with berries (huckleberries, I think).\n\nThe tenderloin was average.  Good, but a smallish portion, and nothing really special about it.  The shoulder was excellent, and rivaled a tender pot roast.  The risotto was good, as was the berry that highlighted the plate.  The spinach just looked nasty (and I _like_ spinach), so I didn't try it.\n\nBeverage service was excellent.  Rarely did I drink more than a bit from my water glass before it was refilled to the top.  Same with my ginger ale.  Bar service appeared to be pretty speedy as well.  But food service was horrid.  Slow, slow, slow.\n\nSeveral of the people in our party ordered a chocolate cake dessert at the time they ordered dinner - apparently it takes a while to prepare.  Well, our server didn't really seem to notice that other people at the table might want some dessert, and was almost shocked when two of us asked for dessert menus when the cakes started arriving.\n\nAn order of ice cream and another of berries went completely unserved, though we waited twenty minutes or so for them.  I understand if one of the little cakes was ordered, it might take a while to cook.  But how long does it take to scoop some ice cream and throw some berries on a plate?\n\nI doubt we'll be back, but it isn't completely about the service.

Looking like nothing so much as a northwoods WI tavern dropped into near east side Madison, this cozy throwback is a fine place to waste an evening. The drinks are big and strong, the jukebox is better than you'd think, and the clientele is worth the random conversation. Plus the famous shuffleboard table. So, why only three stars? A couple of reasons; first, cramped is a generous way to describe the atmosphere. Second, the beer selection is really not good...unless you're striving for legitimacy with your bottle of Pabst/Schlitz...then, by all means, let your affectations fly. And third, the prices are surprisingly high, which is a problem of perception as much as anything. The \"townie\" atmosphere makes you assume your $20 will last all night with change left over. Not nearly true. The times I've been there, pints were around $4, which isn't bad, but not what you think you'll spend. But, hey, I quibble. Go in on a night Don is working and have him make you the biggest brandy old fashioned you've had in a while. Then have another. Then take a nap on the shuffleboard table.", "business_id": "pSYCSXgabSKKJrIEJG-FLQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-03-26", "type": "review"}

You should find a job that doesn't involve customer service.\n\nMy friend and I were super excited today for Wing Wednesday ($9.99 all you can eat wings). We walk in and are greeted instinctively but the female bartender who also tells us to sit wherever. I choose a table next to the double doors that leads to the outside seating area. For 10 minutes we sat there without even so much as eye contact or a smile from any of the waitresses. I see that there are two moderate groups outside (6-8 people each), but don't give it a second thought. Still no acknowledgment from anybody. After 15 minutes, my buddy walks up two managers who were fiddling with a tv monitor and 3 other waitresses surrounding them. My buddy goes, \"Umm, can we get some service??\" The female manager immediately appoints someone to go to our table. \n\nThis blondie informs us that **Brittany** is our waitress, but she would take our first order. A few minutes after she takes our order, the lovely Brittany shows up. We had already watched this girl walk right past our table about 10 times back and forth prior to talking to the managers. She apologizes, like a child whose been forced to do so, for \"not seeing\" us. A) Simple acknowledgment would have sufficed. B) My buddy is a BIG tall guy with a mohawk wearing a bright red shirt. How the heck could she not have seen us? She then makes a pathetic attempt to explain that she got slammed, and says that she will now take our order. I tell her that our orders have already been taken. We get our first round of wings in a fair amount of time after the order was put in by Blondie. I asked for ranch and never got it. My buddy's cajun wings were too salty so he only ended up eating 6 wings. Brittany came back and only asked to refill my friend's drink. He told her Mr. Pibb, and she brought back coke. She took his plate away and didn't bother to ask if he wanted more wings since it was all you can eat. He's a big guy!!! Oh that's right. She didn't take our order so of course she didn't know. Shortly after I finished my own round of wings. Typically, the girls will see that you have finished your wings halfway and immediately ask you if you want the next round put it. No one asked us this. So I finished my wings and asked my friend if he wanted to go or keep hoping that the service will improve. BTW, those big tables were long gone by then. It was actually pretty empty by then. The whole time we just watched Brittany try to calculate her tabs and collect her tips. \n\nMy friend wanted out, and he said he'll refuse to pay if they asked us. We head straight to the door and NO ONE bothered trying to stop us. Instead we heard Brittany,\"Sorry guys.\" as we left. They knew what was going on. This is the very worst service that I have ever had. I would have still tipped had we stayed til the end, but it was so terrible. My wings weren't even that great. \n\nIf you come here, and you get a girl that is tan, has shoulder length curly hair, and is named Brittany, ask for another waitress.", "business_id": "qsWxbgQwuomXvMseg23DGg", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-04-11", "type": "review"}

My husband and I and a few other people decided to stop in for food and drinks before the Tool concert but I think everyone else had the same idea and they were pretty busy, the wait was too long so we just decided to order straight from the bar and get our food and drinks to go.  To start with, there were only 2 bartenders behind the bar and like I said, it was super busy.  My husband had to pretty much push his way  up to the bar.  He had to wait about 5 minutes to place our order (he got a vanilla vodka screwdriver, a water for me, my daughter and I got the John O' Hurley Buffalo Chicken Wrap, and my husband ordered the Johnny Beef Depp) which wasn't too bad, but then the bartender just took off before my husband could even ask how we were suppose to know when our food was ready.  She ignored us and talked over my husband to other people.  Finally, when she did come back over, she was rude and said \"just stand over there, I will yell at you when your stuffs ready.\" and pointed randomly over to the side.  My husband then asked her if she wanted his name and she responded rudely again, \"we don't have that information.\" But his name was on the receipt... ??  Ok then.\n\nSo, we just waited off to the side and in the meantime got yelled at by a waitress and a bus boy that we were in the way.  The bus boy actually took the time to rudely show us a line in the concrete floor that we needed to stand behind, when we were standing where we were told to by the bartender.  Finally after about 20 mins our food was ready and the waitress yelled very loudly while pointing at us, \"Hey you!! come get your food!!\"  So my husband went over to get it and she had two different orders sitting there and she basically shoved one of the bags at him and said, \"is this yours...yeah I think this is yours.\"  Then our friend that was with us, who ordered before us had to ask her if the other order was his and she shoved it him and said, \"I think this one is yours.\" and walks away. He had to actually open up his bag and check to make sure that order was his.  She didn't even check the orders before shoving them at us!  Granted the bar was getting crushed with people and they were understaffed so I understand that, but being rude doesn't equate to return customers.\n\nWe ended up sitting outside at one of the picnic tables to eat.  My buffalo chicken wrap was minus the buffalo!! It was just a plain old crispy chicken wrap with ranch, way too much lettuce, a few diced tomatoes, and some cheese (I think in maybe 2 bites I had).  My wrap wasn't even hot.  It came with 2 sides....I chose fries and apple slices.  The fries were o.k. really had no seasoning on them and the apple slices were just the basic bagged apples, one of them was actually kinda soggy.  My daughters order was exactly the same as mine.  It was o.k. nothing impressive.  My husband said his sandwich was  made with good quality beef but without the au jus it would have been dry.  He said it was actually pretty good.  My husband thought the fries were good.  His screwdriver was VERY strong, which I would believe it to be a result of over pouring, but the bartender said when she handed it to him that she made it very strong on purpose because he was patient.  \n\nI know Alice Cooper is a huge sports nut so the ambiance is geared more towards that with T.V.'s all over the place, very little music related decor, kinda just comes across as a typical sports bar.

Secondly, I have never been into a more judgemental place with truly rude patrons and staff in my life. I understand I don't look like a lesbian anymore, but that's no reason to treat me with disrespect at this establishment. Also, I do not care how old you are and if you're friends with the owner or not, I will not stand quietly in the corner while you talk shit about Trans people. On top of it I got kicked out after just showing up because I was \"too drunk\" when really the bitch who picked an argument with me cause she wanted to say shit about another lgbt community decided to go tattle on me. You're right tho, I was too drunk, too drunk to deal with your dumb lesbian bullshit. Basically, if you're not a lesbian don't go anywhere near this place as you will get treated like shit and then get kicked out for voicing your opinion. If you are a lesbian, then enjoy hanging out in a port o potty all night with fellow closed minded members of your community. Worst lesbian bar in the nation.

Most weeks I end up ordering a couple beers from the rather large selection.  The drink prices, while high for some people's tastes, are comparable to what I've seen in other places.  Imports are going to cost more, it's the price you pay to have a selection of Boddington's, Murphy's and Guinness all in one place, among other things.\n\nNormally on trivia nights I don't end up getting food, as although I find their portions proportional to the prices, I don't feel I need to eat half my weight in fish and chips in one sitting.  I have no qualms with the quality on the few occasions I've grabbed some eats, for example the curry chicken is very flavorful and highly recommended.  The dragon wings are another of my favorite, spicy but not overwhelming.  The fish and chips, as previously mentioned, are served on a giant platter and have generally been excellent.\n\nI recommend at least one visit to this bar.

The F.C. scarves adorning the ceiling, British booze advertisements on the walls, and the cozy but not claustrophobic seating arrangements make it a unique place in the middle of the desert.

A month ago, I took out-of-town guests for Sunday brunch. Part of the reason I chose City Grille was because they had a promotion where you could get a free appetizer for checking in on a Smart phone. All you had to do was show your server. Well, my server, no matter how nicely I approached the matter, kept insisting that deal was only for people who brought a print-out of an email--even after I showed her on my phone what their own restaurant's Facebook page stated! She just shrugged and said \"Well nobody explained it to me.\" I don't fault her if nobody told her. But I do fault her for not even bothering to say anything like, \"I don't know anything about that but let me go check with a manager\" after I showed proof. It wasn't even the appetizer but the principle of the matter.\n\nI left a comment on the restaurant's Facebook page--very diplomatic, not with any self-entitled overtones. Their social media person asked me to email him directly outlining what happened. Less than two days later, he wrote me, with the owner copied in, apologizing and offering to send me a gift certificate for dinner for two! \n\nThis update is not to say \"Woohoo! I got a free meal.\" It's just an appreciation for when a restaurant is willing to own up to a mistake and try to make up for it. It also sounds like because of me, they will remember to make sure all servers are aware of promotions like that. And when I did go back for my free meal, that same server was there, lol.

I generally don't give 5 stars on a first visit and I also don't generally give 5 stars to a chain restaurant, but this place really blew me away. The BF and I went here last night for Restaurant Week. We had actually just gotten our reservation because we had a res somewhere else but then had to be out til after the other place closed....lucky I guess. So anyway, we get there and there is complimentary valet (which I generally find annoying, but was nice last night because we were running late). We came into the restaurant and immediately felt welcome, everyone was very friendly. We were seated right away and our waitress, Sarah, came by to explain the menu. She was super friendly and helpful and really on top of things, so that was nice. \n\n\nOk, the food: After being seated, they bring out an assortment of warm breads with softened butter. And I mean a real assortment: cracker type bread, a roll that looks like an everything bagel, delicious onion bread, and a wheat bread with raisins or some kind of fruit in it....each bread was delicious (take that Atkins!). The BF ordered a Manhattan ($11.50) and said it was 'damn good' and he is a regular Manhattan drinker, so I gotta believe it. So start, I had the french onion soup (on Sarah's recommendation) and the BF had the field greens. The soup was SO good. I generally am not a huge fan of french onion soup because it has a weird texture, but this one was full of flavor and had a ton of cheese on it. I literally was peeling cheese off the side of the bowl and eating it (I know, not so cool in a fancy restaurant...but it was so tasty!). The field green salad was light, with a flavorful, but subtle vinaigrette. It had several types of tomatoes on it, which the BF loved. For mains I had the filet mignon and the BF had the kona sirloin. They came with a little share plate of mashed potatoes and green beans. The sirloin was delicious...it had this amazing sauce on it (don't know what it was, but it has some great caramelized onions in it) and was cooked perfectly. The filet was equally good, it was simple, but cooked to perfection, it was melt in your mouth and had the perfect steak texture (no fat, gristle, anything weird feeling). I will say, the filet was even better with a little of the sauce from the sirloin, but I understand why the serve it the way they do (steak purists and all....). The mashed potatoes were divine. They were some of the most creamy, buttery mashed potatoes I have had. I wanted to lick the plate. The green beans were also delicious, very well seasoned and served with onions....yum! Now on to dessert- We shared the creme brulee and the chocolate espresso cake. Both were amazing.... When I had my first bite of the chocolate cake it was like the most intense chocolate explosion in my mouth. The espresso just adds to the intensity. I will say this, this is a dessert to be shared...it truly is too chocolatey (and large) for one person....and I love chocolate. The creme brulee was equally amazing, it was creamy with just a hint of crunch, but the most impressive part (to me anyway) was it had blackberries on it that had no seeds. What?!?! Where do I get these blackberries? They were phenomenal! \n\nAt the end of the meal, Sarah went outside and had the valet bring our car around before we even left so we didn't have to wait....ummm, seriously awesome service. \n\nSo, overall, the meal was excellent. I probably ate about 3000 calories....sorry thighs....but if I got to choose a place to destroy my diet, this would be it. The restaurant week deal was amazing too because my steak alone was 41$, but the whole meal was 30$ on special. Insanity.

The 4-star average Yelp rating was the reason my wife and I chose to dine here during our stay in Phoenix. Yelp, you really let us down this time.\n\nSo I was on company business travel in Phoenix the week of March 12th and my wife was traveling with me. We had a French impulse that Tuesday night and tried to crash Petite Maison in Scottsdale, only to find out that reservations were required and there were no tables available. The following night, still craving French cuisine, we decided to stop in at Sophie's French Bistro in Phoenix.\n\nThe first warning sign was that the place was entirely empty during peak dinner hours. However, encouraged by the strong reviews on Yelp, we decided to go ahead and order. We took advantage of a couple of happy hour specials and ordered the following...\n\n3 Cheese Plate\nChef's Pate\nCalamari\nCrispy Duck Breast\nCreme Brulee\n\nThe food was average at best. My wife and I both tend to critique food as we eat it, and we both found ourselves commenting that the portions were small and the food was overpriced for what it was. Most of what we ate was bland and the pate had a very odd flavor and consistency.\n\nThe fun started about 4 hours later when we were back in our hotel room. We both started experiencing various internal moaning and groaning, followed by the onset of stomach pain. No big deal, I thought... \n\nBy shortly after midnight, we were each fighting for time in the bathroom, taking turns to vomit up everything we had eaten that night. I'll try to spare you the details, but this was the kind of violent and uncontrollable vomiting that I have only experienced perhaps once before in my entire life. Needless to say, diarrhea was also involved.\n\nAfter going through this for a good two hours, my wife and I were both thoroughly exhausted and dehydrated. My wife even told me she felt like she was dying, and said that she had never felt this bad before - not even during child birth. o.O\n\nSo by around 2:30am, my wife was begging for me to call an ambulance. For a while, neither of us could get up off the floor to reach the telephone. I eventually found a break in the vomiting and managed to sip down enough water to recover slightly. I carried my wife out to the car and asked the hotel receptionist for directions to the nearest hospital.\n\nWe drove to John C. Lincoln Hospital on Dunlap, which I recommend if you ever get poisoned by Sophie's French Bistro. I managed to get there without hitting anything, which was remarkable since I could barely see straight and could barely function at all. \n\nOnce inside, my wife completely collapsed and was unconscious briefly. The nurses and doctors rushed her into the ER and brought her back around. They gave her a shot of morphine and then hooked her up to an IV drip of fluids. As I waited, I continued to experience vomiting and tried to keep myself hydrated. Despite being in a hospital, I was determined not to check myself in for treatment, not wanting to add further medical bills.\n\nSometime around 5:00am, my wife was ready to be discharged. The official diagnosis was acute food poisoning. We were never able to identify the specific meal at Sophie's which poisoned us, as we both shared the same courses and ate equal amounts each.\n\nHowever - and this is the kicker - when the doctors asked us where we had eaten dinner and we told them it was Sophie's, they remarked \"oh, that place!\". We learned that the ER at John C. Lincoln has seen 3 other cases of food poisoning caused by Sophie's. The hospital took our information for the purpose of compiling a complaint against Sophie's with the AZ Department of Health Services. They told us that once they have at least 10 confirmed cases, then they are required by law to report the incident as a disease outbreak.\n\nThis all would have been nice to know before we chose to dine at this place. I can only assume that the other poisoning victims either don't use the internet, or are still laying in a pool of vomit somewhere, too weak to write a review.\n\nPlease, please, PLEASE don't put yourself through the same hell that we went through that night. After this experience, we lost all desire to dine in Phoenix ever again. Thanks, Sophie's, for ruining our trip.\n\nFor the record, we did have an excellent meal at CIBO Pizza the night before we were poisoned. I highly recommend CIBO. Great food, without food poisoning.", "business_id": "PuHucejs4LG3hSXnrwi9-g", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-03-17", "type": "review"}

The vibe is just mellow and coooool (with my hand flat, slowly motioning from right to left). We had a long wait for a flight and thought we would stop by for their 11-7 happy hour. They had a nice selection of $5 wines and pitchers of premium beers. For $5 you really can't go wrong, but despite the low price the quality of everything I had was fantastic. \n\nYou must also try their bruschetta. We tried a selection of them and they were all amazing. My favorite was the goat cheese with roasted peppers. The service was great throughout, especially since we took up a prime table for about 4 hours. Our goal was to taste everything and we almost did it before our flight! \n\nJust another reason why Phoenix is a pretty cool city.

Beer was good enough I had two tall ones - good selection on tap too :-)", "business_id": "zBGfa6Vx4K59v8OR81gzJg", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-03-01", "type": "review"}

If you're expecting fine dining Italian, not the place, you're better off at Brio.  But if you want no non-sense, dirt cheap food at fast service, Olive Garden fills that roll.  \n\nThey always have specials going on, so its best to go for that.  I went for 2 for $25.  That's unlimited soup and also salad, 2 entrees and your choice of desert or appetizer.  Salad is alright, just a house salad nothing special and also you can choose from 4 different soups and you change your soups.  I tried 3 of them.  They're not the best soups but they're not bad.  It is what is.  The entrees are alright too, good portions, the Seafood Lasagna had actual seafood and even the scallops are real and plentiful. which was surprising to me.  Overall the quality and taste are sup-par nothing special.   But you already knew that.  everything is on the cheesy side if anything.   \n\nAs long as you come go to Olive Garden with the right expectations, fast italian for cheap, you'll have a good dinner and a good experience.  If you're expecting fancy high class authentic Italian... you  will be disapointed\n\nPro\nCheap italian food\ngood selection\nunlimited soup and salad\n\nCon\ngeneric tasting soups and pasta", "business_id": "bbmuF6LtbP51bk0Ia0p1rw", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-03-20", "type": "review"}

It had blue cheese \"liquid\", not blue cheese dressing. 25% of my 16oz steak was fat. Excuse me, but I have enough of that already. As for the remaining 12oz, if it were not for the salt, this steak had NO flavor. I had salt at home I could have eaten. My wife's baby back ribs were as dry as the Sahara! Fry's has better ribs for HALF the price. Service was OK.....I mean, as our waiter was bringing us the check, he asked if we wanted dessert. So he must have known our answer would be \"no\" or he was going to comp us dessert to make up for the over-priced and low quality food. Black Angus.....you've been Black-listed. Btw.....Yelp says I have to leave a star rating, so against my desires, I rated you 1 star more than I would have liked. Gosh, I'm so mean; but then again you did take me for my money, so we're even,", "business_id": "OreqUicD2AP5QW2HblqRoQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-04-08", "type": "review"}

I saw that there were about 10 dancers.2 of the girls were pretty hot.Most not so much, some were quite big and older. They were friendly for the most part.The problem is the black haired waitress in the miniskirt.$13 for 2 drinks. .I gave her a $20 and she nodded like she would be right back with my change. I didn't see her again.I had to hunt her down after watching her go back and forth thru the room. She gave me my change  after I saw her at the bar without even a sorry.

From the Yelp description I only knew it was a pizza place with good reviews - I didn't realize the atmosphere was so chill and modern.  \nPesto's is not just a little hole in the wall with white walls and pizza sauce stains by the floorboards.  Instead, it's a very nice spot to take a date, or to just belly up to the bar solo (as I did).\nService was friendly and fast, and a good selection of alcohol (especially liquor) is on hand.\nGreat atmosphere, friendly service, and delicious calzone.
