They live within walking distance of my home, so it's no problem getting here and the temptation for sushi is always in the back of my mind! Admittedly, the price of the food here tends to keep my cravings in check for a couple months at a time, but when I do come here, I enjoy every bite. Occasionally I also order take-out since they have very reasonable lunch deals, but really, I prefer to sit and eat at the restaurant itself.\n\nSpeaking of: the place itself is very quiet, which I actually like; I can just sit, talk with a friend or read a book, and then (what a radical concept) enjoy my food in peace. This is a big deal for me because the other places I know of where I can get sushi are loud, busy, and quite frankly, a little limiting options-wise compared to Sushi Three's menu. If I want sushi, I either come here or I get a small pack at Giant Eagle. That's how much I dislike eating in the other sushi places I've visited in Pittsburgh to date (although with more and more places opening this opinion may change soon!). If I'm going to pay as much as I do for my fish, I want to be in a place I can sit and actually enjoy my food.\n\nBy the way, Sushi Three does serve things other than sushi, so people looking for some Japanese food that isn't rice and fish are definitely going to find something. There's some really delicious beef, chicken and pork dishes (one family member of mine absolutely adores their pork katsudon). But of course, a place with the word \"sushi\" in its name is going to specialize in sushi, and there are pages and pages of sushi options available here. The orders come in various styles and sizes as well, so couples can get something to share or just get something smaller for themselves. The combos all come with soup and salad, which are also very yummy. My personal routine order as of today is a large salad and an order of softshell crab rolls. Sure, I'll occasionally snag a bite from someone here with me, but the truth is that Sushi Three makes such enormous orders that I need to be reeeally hungry to eat all of any other order I make. \n\nBut hey, at least you get your money's worth! I say definitely give this place a shot if you're a sushi fan.", "business_id": "QnyzlVMyx0Exri-Lay10cA", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-12-08", "type": "review"}

We've always had to wait at least a half an hour to be seated, even when we've had reservations. In the past its been forgivable, mostly because its close to home for us, the food is okay (albeit a little pricey), and my Grandmother absolutely loves the entertainment of hibachi. But that all changed last night when we went out with a party of 8 for my and my mothers birthday. \n\nI made reservations two weeks in advance for our birthday dinner. When I called they were almost totally booked and only had a few spots left that evening. Our reservations were for 7:30. \n\nWe arrive a little early at 7:20 and I let the hostess know that we are there and she checks us in. Then we basically just wait and wait and wait. We notice the hostess turning people away, and we notice two tables who have been seated for about 30 minutes now haven't even gotten their soups or salads. By now its nearly 8 O'clock. Then my mother overhears the hostess telling someone that they are short staffed and the wait is going to be extremely long. By this point we've been waiting for 45 minutes. My sister takes a walk through the restaurant and notices there is only 1 hibachi chef working, but there are SEVEN tables seated, all waiting for food/drinks. So I ask the hostess how much longer before we are seated. She informs me that it will be at least another half an hour before we get a table, because two hibachi chefs and two kitchen chefs called off sick. It would be another hour after were seated before they would even start taking our food orders. \n\nThis is TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE. First of all, the hostess should have informed us when we arrived that they were short staffed and we would have a very very long wait. OR, the manager should have phoned people with reservations and asked if they could reschedule. Either way, we should have been informed instead of letting us stand in the lobby for an hour, not knowing that it would be another hour and a half before we would actually eat, on an evening when we had reservations. \n\nWe decided to call Ichiban to see if they could accommodate us. They told us we could walk right in and be seated immediately. As we were leaving we ran into a gentleman who was outside smoking who told us that his party had reservations for 6:30 and they still had not ordered their food! It was now about 8:20pm. \n\nOur first dinner at Ichiban actually turned out to be much better than our previous dinners at Benihana, so I don't think we'll ever be going back there. I think Ichiban will be our new hibachi restaurant of choice.", "business_id": "1vQLTKwmcmZXtNzfKEvMmA", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-12-30", "type": "review"}

After being rather dissapointed with Chaya last night, I decided to go to Umi tonight.\n\nThe staff was friendly and service perfect. There servers watch for you to dictate the pace of the meal.\n\nBeggining with the typical salad with ginger dressing: I was very happy with this dressing, just about perfect.\n\nNext the miso soup: I'm not generally a huge fan of miso soup, but this was probably the best preparation I've had. I could have gone for another bowl. \n\nFor my entree I chose the dinner sushi assortment. This was by far the best sushi I've ever tasted. As cliche as it may sound, every piece (including fin which is notoriously tough) was melt in your mouth good.  The accompanying sauces are not overbearing in the least, they merely enhance the flavor of the fish.  The pieces of nigiri themselves are bite size - as in 1 bite without looking like you're stuffing your mouth.  This is smaller than the giant balls of rice with large cuts of fish you often times see at other places. I rather enjoyed the size, but just wanted to make note of it. The tuna roll was also very tasty. I did not sample any other rolls tonight, but I'm sure I will be back to do so.\n\nMy dining companion had the chicken teriyaki.  The dish came out sizzeling from the back kitchen.  Again, this was probably the best preperation of the dish I've ever tasted. The serving size was perfect, about 5oz of very tender breast meat, with accompanying vegetables and a small side of rice.  More than enough to satiate, without the need for a nap afterwards. \n\nI didn't sample the desserts tonight, but I've seen others rave about them. I will definitely be back, as often as I can.

It's not just the best Japanese restaurant (which it is by an extraordinarily wide margin), but the best overall restaurant in the city.  Why such acclaim you might ask?  The answer lies in Umi's consistency in providing delicious cuisine with outstanding service.\n\nI'm embarrassed to say it, but when I first went to Umi about 10 years ago (has it been that long already?), I didn't like sushi.  I thought the texture was strange and it tasted too fishy.  The first time I had the omakase at Umi, the veil was lifted over my eyes.  Never had I imagined that Japanese food could be so delicious!  The constantly changing flavors and textures with each subsequent course was mind-spinning.  It would not be hyperbole to say that it was life-altering because it opened my eyes to the world of finer cuisine and made me want to seek out foods that I had been too afraid or stubborn to try in the past.\n\nOn a recent visit to Umi, I was surprised to see that there had been a change to the omakase menu.  It was always as big as you wanted to make it (like Troy Polamalu who likes the $250/person omakase), but now there were 3 options of a 7-course plus dessert, an 11-course plus dessert, and a \"trust Mr. Shu\" omakase.  When I inquired what that meant, they said \"that's what the Steelers get.\"\n\nOn this occasion, my buddy and I got the 11-course omakase.  It was delicious as always and included a dizzying array of sashimi preparations, the much-acclaimed miso cod, and spicy and tender rock shrip tempura.  A very pleasant surprise was a new course served in two spoons.  One had poached lobster and the other had Kobe beef.  Each was covered with fois gras.  This was absolutely decadent and brought back memories for me of the fois gras sushi in O-Ya in Boston (which was the New York Times best new restaurant in the U.S. a few years ago).\n\nUmi's biggest criticism has always been that it's too expensive.  Although it's true that it can easily be the most expensive restaurant in Pittsburgh, you absolutely are getting your money's worth.  From very personal (and somewhat disappointing experience), high-end Japanese restaurants in bigger cities are just as good as Umi but MUCH more expensive (like sometimes twice as expensive).  I'll also make the bold statement that for what you get, Umi is a steal and Pittsburgh has been very lucky to have it.\n\nService is always outstanding.  On my most recent visit, Drew was our waiter who in my opinion is one of the nicest and best waiters in the city.  That really adds to the experience.  Also on my most recent visit to Umi, I was very pleasantly surprised that they had a free valet!  Parking has always been terrible in that portion of Ellsworth Ave.  The valet made it so simple, and it was free!  Kudos to Big Burrito for making that outstanding decision.\n\nI don't think it's fair to blame the restaurant for not seating you if you don't have a reservation.  Umi is very small and is always very crowded on the weekends.  As mentioned in other reviews, you can sit at the normal tables or the sunken \"traditional\" Japanese tables.  Some advice from my wife is that if you're wearing a dress, don't sit at the sunken tables.

The host was very friendly, taking our coats when we arrived, and our server was equally gracious.  Umi is a place with truly skilled service, one of the few places I've eaten in town with utterly professional staff.  They are knowledgeable and skillful, and they added tremendously to our dining experience.\n\nThe Omakase dinner is pricey, I think around $85 per person for seven courses and dessert, which is what we got.  The eleven-course meal, at around $130, just seemed like too much for our first try at this.  Alas, time has passed since our meal and I failed to write the courses down anyway, but here's the general scoop: Most of the seven courses were prepared raw.  I'd say five out of seven.  There were 3-4 sashimi courses - just raw, unspeakably fresh fish dressed delicately in various sauces and flavorings.  One course was gently fried tempura rock shrimp, another was cooked - I want to say black cod, but the rest were sashimi or sushi, appearing incredibly simple but tasting complex.  We took our server's recommendation for sake - it was pricey, but floral and delicious.  \n\nMy boyfriend raved about the meal as each course came and went - we both had a wonderful experience.  I will give it five stars, but I hesitate only because it was such a pricey experience.  I have no doubt that the fish was impeccably fresh and certainly worth paying for, but the bill for two of us was well over $200 including the sake.  And the food, while excellent, was extremely light and delicate.  Now I'm not a big fan of being stuffed to capacity, but with an $85 meal, I hoped to have a little bit more food.  I was also hoping to have a little more variety - perhaps this was my ignorance, but I was surprised that 4 of the courses were sashimi - just four thin, amazing pieces of fish on a plate.  They were all wonderful - but it was a lot of sashimi.  I was hoping for something more substantial, more bold, perhaps?\n\nBut that doesn't change the fact that every bite of food we did have was of impeccable quality.  I'd recommend omakase only to those who are celebrating a special occasion, love raw fish, and are willing to pay over $100 per person for food and drink.  I think in the future, I'd come back and just order a variety of sashimi and maki.  And Umi was a class act, from start to finish, with outstanding service and chefs who are clearly passionate about their product.", "business_id": "Cy9XgM3ZG2jZ1ganvolb6Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-02-06", "type": "review"}

After visiting Umi twice now, I can, for a fact, say that I have had the best fish here.  I cannot emphasize how flavorful and fresh the sushi and sashimi is!  \n\nOf course, the freshness of the food doesn't come cheap.  I have been here twice with my boyfriend and our bill, excluding drinks, has always exceeded $100.  Servings are on the smaller side so you have to get a couple of entrees.  \n\nAnyway, the last time we went to Umi was on Valentine's Day.  I have a feeling that making reservations is always the way to go for this place, especially on special occasions and holidays.  During our visit, we got the oyster sashimi, miso soup, mixed seaweed salad, squid \"pasta\" with garlic sauce, the assorted sashimi entree and two different kinds of makis.

I was a bit disappointed until I actually ate one.  It was the freshest oyster I have ever had and I am not exaggerating.  Also, another pleasant surprise for me was despite the fact that the assorted sashimi entree was only supposed to come with one serving of miso soup and salad, our server (during both visits) served the both of us with the soup and salad without having to be asked.  I thought that was pretty neat.  The miso soup tasted like it was made from scratch.  I could taste the flavor of the miso and the soup was not too salty or watery.  The texture of the seaweed salad was what I expected it to be.  I mean, you can't really go wrong with a seaweed salad, right?  The squid \"pasta\" was just like how the name made it sound - squid that was thinly sliced like pasta, served with a sort of buttery, garlic, ponzu sauce.  They served this with white rice on the side. The sashimi entree had five different types of sashimi: red snapper, yellowtail, mackarel, tuna, and salmon.  Goodness, I could go on and on about how absolutely delicious the sashimi was but I will not waste your time and just tell you to try it for yourself.  That is, if you are a fan of raw fish.  The makis we got were in small portions but were also delicious.\n\nIf I could go back and eat at Umi every weekend, I would.  Alas, the prices do not fit my meager monthly budget.  However, Umi will always make the top of my list when dining out for special occasions.", "business_id": "Cy9XgM3ZG2jZ1ganvolb6Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-02-26", "type": "review"}

Highly recommend the lobster miso as there was a decent amount of lobster in the soup. \n\nFor my meal, I ordered the black cod with miso. The quality of the fish was incredible! However, the portion was tiny. I was not satisfied after my meal. Looking back, I should have ordered a side of rice to complete my meal. My boyfriend ordered the sushi platter which was much better value for your money. If I go back, I will definitely order that. \n\nWhat did fill me up was the dessert: the chocolate pretzel.

Luckily, neither of these turned out to be an issue.  In fact, my boyfriend and I were able leave feeling satisfied and without spending over $100 (not including tip).\n\nAlthough I had heard rave reviews about the Omakase tasting menu, we decided to order off the menu.  We went with the Vegetable Tempura appetizer and ordered the sushi and sashimi platters to split as our entrees.  The platters both came with miso soup and ginger salad.\n\nThe sushi platter came with one small 6-piece maki roll and 8 pieces of sushi.  The sashimi platter was presented in a bowl of ice and consisted of five varieties of fish.  Everything was very tasty and obviously high-quality.  A pic of our order: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/umi-pittsburgh?select=AhZ3Ixr2boyQFTtvVKeQHg#AhZ3Ixr2boyQFTtvVKeQHg\n\nAt this point, we had eaten Vegetable Tempura, Miso Soup, Salad, and a variety of sushi and sashimi.  We were still a little hungry, but decided some dessert would do the trick.  We observed what some of the diners around us had ordered, and decided to go with the ice-cream sandwich dessert.  If the sushi and entree portions here are considered small, the dessert portions are definitely normal or even large.  The table next to us had ordered a delicious looking banana sundae with three scoops of ice-cream, and I've heard the chocolate pretzel dessert is awesome too...next time!\n\nWhen it was all said and done, my boyfriend and I had ordered two drinks, an appetizer, soups and salads, two entrees, and dessert, all for about $98.  Not too bad, and probably comparable to other high-end restaurants in Pittsburgh.\n\nMy only complaints...I wish the lights had been a bit more dim, and we were absolutely freezing during our meal.  It seemed as though a door or window was open somewhere behind us and was letting in a gust of wintery air.  However, the ambiance overall was very enjoyable, and I would definitely recommend this restaurant for a date night or special occasion.

People get really territorial about sushi and what is qualified as \"the best\" in each of our heads.\n\nAs for Umi, they get high marks in my opinion for for quality of sushi, quality of toro specifically, taste of rock shrimp entree and sea bass with miso.  Our server Benjamin was friendly, delightful and professional as well.  \n\nIt was good and I am glad we went to experience Umi, but life is about managing expectations and despite my 3 stars, I too am not sure if I would go back.\n\nI want to give it 4 stars on food alone, but the negative points which made me more inclined to give it 3 stars were:\n\n1) only being able to get a reservation past 9pm any day of the week for many weeks in advance on Open Table (built up my expectation of what I thought Umi would be)\n\n2) being turned away from Valet at our 9pm arrival because it was full (again, built up my expectation of how in demand Umi is)\n\n3) the long flights of stairs to reach the restaurant is a haul if you don't like or cannot walk stairs with ease.  Although we are fit and able, we were advised that there is not an elevator to get patrons to the restaurant, but a person could be served Umi menu from Soba restaurant on first floor.  Not sure where the ADA compliance is here, but even if they are up to code, seems bizarre in the 21st century to hear from someone that it is almost incredibly inconvenient to show up with an issue that would prohibit you from walking up stairs in order to be served at Umi.  But regardless, \"stairway to almost heaven\" again almost feeds into to expectation of \"what is at the top\" and what my experience will be. \n\n4)  venue space is indeed small and thus explains limited reservations.  It is a calming, welcoming, dimly lit designed room...felt cool, hip, modern in a way.\n\n5)  sushi quality was indeed there, but sushi portions are indeed small.  The Rainbow Roll is my barometer on sushi and thus my bar on comparing one sushi establishment to another.  Portions do not need to be large to be considered great when it comes to sushi, but for $27 for a Rainbow Roll, the expectation is there that this is going to be so amazing it is going to rock my world.   Quality was very good, roll was very fresh, but not $27 good.  The slices of fish on top of roll were too thin to be warrant the price.  I am happy to pay $27, but the restaurant set my expectation up and I was a little disappointed.  If the Rainbow Roll was $20, I might feel differently.  \n\nLife is about managing expectations, so go to Umi and try it for yourself and you be the judge and write your own review.", "business_id": "Cy9XgM3ZG2jZ1ganvolb6Q", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-01-10", "type": "review"}

As we embarked on our quest, we ended up near the Arboretum, and as we drove through the parking lot, we were amazed to find a whole new section of the shopping center that neither of us had even known existed.  \n\nWe were shocked to see a row of restaurants representing all different cuisines from standard American fare like Chili's to Chinese (Cherry Blossom), quick Mexican (Qdoba), Asian (Malaya Kitchen), Breakfast (Le Peep), to many others...As we both mocked each other for not knowing about this \"bizarro Arboretum\", our eyes simultaneously came upon a Sushi restaurant called Sushiya, so we chalked it up to fate and decided to venture inside to give it a shot, as you shouldn't go against fate right???\n\nAs we entered the unassuming storefront, we were greeted with a huge welcome from the staff, a la Norm from Cheers, and the hostess/waitress said we could sit wherever we liked.  Not much in the way of ambiance, as there was a small Christmas tree at the front and a few assorted decorative pieces scattered about, but we weren't there for the decor, we were there for the sushi, so we didn't mind at all.\n\nTo put it mildly, the sushi menu is HUGE..about three pages worth of \"house rolls\" and \"specialty rolls\", and no pencil and paper was provided to mark selections, so it was a true test of our collective memories to keep track of all the various rolls we wanted to try, since we have nothing to note our choices on.  After multiple times through the extensive menu, we settled on a total of 6 rolls so we could try a little of everything.  Solid value on some of the specialty rolls by the way, as a lot of places these days price most of their specialty rolls in the $12-$25 range, but Sushiya had some creative rolls under 10 bucks, which was a definite plus.\n\nThe server was friendly throughout and did a nice job of making sure to ask if we wanted our waters refilled before they even got down to 1/2 full.   She was around just enough without being overly intrusive on our meal, and she was personable enough without being irritating if that makes any sense.\n\nThe sushi was fresh and overall I would say that 4 out of the 6 were hits while 2 were misses.  One of the misses was just devoid of flavor, while the other was overly drenched in a sweet mango sauce that was just too much in our opinion.  The hits were all solid but not spectacular.  I would say overall the sushi was better than what we found at Koishi, 18 Asian, Liu Liu, and other similar places, but a notch below some of the selections at Nikkos, Cowfish, NZ Cafe, etc.  \n\nDefinitely solid and worth a trip to check out for yourself as this place to me would be the definition of a 3.5 star yelp selection, but I decided to round up to 4 stars instead of rounding down to 3, because of the variety of options available from a specialty roll perspective.  Again, if you are looking for decor and ambiance, this probably isn't the right place to find those things, but if you are looking for a solid place to get sushi on a Saturday night that you can walk into at 7pm on a Saturday night, get a table of your choosing, and not spend triple digits for 6 specialty rolls, then definitely give it a shot.", "business_id": "4glD2-evDFddHjQaEVpCPQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-12-09", "type": "review"}

I've seen it multiple times, but it never really registered to me.  \n\nWhen I entered the building, I was surprised at how nice it was. Hardwood floors and dimmed lights made it appear very upscale and trendy for being in the Arboretum. It was mostly empty except for two couples at side tables. Our drink orders were immediately taken and it only took a few minutes to get the drinks. We then ordered our food. I, and most of my friends, ordered the California Roll sushi. It was super affordable at $4.25 for eight rolls. The presentation was gorgeous and the service was ridiculously fast. Our waiter was so kind and constantly checked on our drinks and food. I found the sushi to be okay. I've never had sushi before and I'm not a huge fan of anything that is in the California Roll, so that's probably to be expected. My friends, who have had sushi before, both liked and hated the California Roll. The salads were delicious and several other foods that were ordered by my counterparts were really great (meat dishes). My final bill (for sweet tea with tons of free refills and the California Roll sushi, with tip included) was around $8. \n\nOverall, the great service will have me going back to Sushiya (tonight, actually).

They have a display of the 2 boxes in the front that you can check out. It is such a good deal, you only pay about 8 bucks for either box. The lunch sushi box B comes with 10 pieces of sushi, 6 regular rolls, 2 larger ones, 2 slices of sashimi on rice, some kind of mayo based salad, miso soup, and peanut sauce salad. Box A usually comes with a rice and meat dish and a ramen soup, although it can vary many days. Both are mouth watering.\n     For dinner, I love to get the Nabeyaki Udon Noodle. It is awesome, it comes out burning hot so you have to be careful. You cannot take this to go, so be sure to finish it. It has egg and lots of vegetables, and tempura shrimp and tempura veggies. The dinner teriyaki bento box is very good, but a california roll is the only option for the sushi portion. Other things I enjoy are the pork katsu-don, ramen, curry katsu, and the agedashi dofu is excellent. Really, no matter what you pick, you can't go wrong. \n    On a rare occasion, most likely in the winter, be sure to check out the sushi specials. If they have TORO tuna(fatty tuna), be sure to get it without any questions, and do not get the roll, just get the whole slab. Its really expensive but it melts in your mouth. Worth every penny.\n    Overall, Musashi is a great place with pretty good prices, Lunch is definitely cheaper than dinner. It is in a small but comfortable and not too fancy place. But when the food is that good, it doesn't really matter. It doesn't have any of the over-the-top sushi roll specials, but rather it is just rolled well with perfectly cooked rice. It is the most authentic Japanese place in Charlotte that I have come across.", "business_id": "Y_OeiGhTm6ZEfZ1UQgM_wA", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-02-20", "type": "review"}

Definitely better than the others I have been to around Charlotte. \n- Tonkatsu Bento Box: My friend's husband loved his bento Tonkatsu box. \n- Katsu Chicken Entree: My husband had the Katsu Chicken and it was alright.  \n- Salad: The salad ginger peanut dressing was good.\n- Off the menu Shrimp Tempura Roll: Just shrimp tempura and the roll.. no.. other veggies - what?!\n\nService - They are good about getting to you, when you ask for their service..  When they are busy, it may take them just a tad bit longer to get to you.\n\nPrice - Was alright, not too shabby, and reasonable at best. \n\nSo bottom line, I like the food... but I am in no dire need to come back.

We rarely eat at hibachi grills, but decided it sounded good tonight. The food was okay. Life's too short and there are way too many good things to eat to settle for okay!\n\nI think one thing that makes it tricky when reviewing a hibachi experience is that they all basically have the same menu - right down to the salad dressing!  Therefore, comparisons are natural. \n\nI found the soup salty. The salad dressing was okay, but missing something. Rice was good, noodles had a nice garlic flavor and veggies were standard. I ordered the teriyaki steak and it had zero teriyaki flavor. Had the sauce not been visible I would have sworn I got the wrong item. The meat itself did not taste good. It wasn't spoiled tasting, more like a really cheap cut of meat. I only ate about three bites.  In another environment I would have gone so far as to complain, but not here.  The shrimp were good. Maybe most disappointing was the ubitiqous white shrimp sauce. It was very watery and bland:(. Major disappointment as that stuff is the highlight of a hibachi visit!  In sum, the food was filling, but not good enough to come here again.  \n\nThe positives are that the staff were friendly and worked quickly.

Armed with this knowledge I was bracing myself for an... interesting experience. Hibachi is generally standard across the board for me. It's not a hit or miss type of cuisine. In terms of the actual hibachi, everyone does the same exact thing with some minor twists here and there, so it's all about the quality of ingredients and service. Lets just say I held my toungue when asked how I liked my meal at the end of the day.\n\nThe Service:\n- A little slow honestly, it took them forever to get my beer (not cool bro) and even longer to come get my order. Friendly people as per the usual, but for some reason they are on asian standard time when it comes to serving you.\n\nThe Food:\n- Standard hibachi food, solid but nothing special. A big plus for me are the portions. They tend to give you larger portions than other restaurants along with the traditional soup, salad, shrimp, and veggies. In fact, this is the only place I've seen that gives you noodles with your dish at no extra cost. Well played Nakato. \n\nThe Ambiance\n- Gotta love the ambiance. My cook was playful and had fun with the kids (which is a must, they love attention). The decor was great, modern with a little rustic feel to make you ease into your surroundings. \n\nOverall, wouldn't jump the gun saying its the best hibachi I've ever had, but I also won't be coming here regularly.", "business_id": "xLZilmaLXY0r-dBFaiLxww", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-12-03", "type": "review"}

I know that the economy has been hard on everyone, but whoa. I commend this restaurant for taking actions to minimize the amount they spend. This nice restaurant I believe sunk $5 million dollars on the property. Now, I'm going to update my review from my 2011 review. And the outcome, as you can tell by the stars is ummm... not good.\n\nNow, lets start off by the menu. I came with a party of 5 and we all got seated down at the hibachi grill. Menu is pretty standard as far as hibachi grill food items goes. I came to Nakato because from word, the owner owns a farm out in Colorado and farm raises all the animals and also their freezer blast freezes their seafood. This is an important fact because when you blast freeze seafood, it's usually 50 or more below 0 degrees Fahrenheit keeping the seafood fresh and bacteria free. So, this was definitely a reason to try this restaurant out.\n\nSo, lets get back to the menu. Looking at the items something pops out. Fried Rice..$1.75. So, fried rice doesn't come standard with the meal that costs $15+? Steam rice on the other hand is free (which I picked). I ordered the combination of Chicken and NY strip. My party all got the fried rice when it was asked because they were under the assumption that it came with the meal, and I'll break down to you what that fried rice consisted of.\n\nFried rice: Eggs, Sesame seed, and Soy Sauce. That's it. No green onions, carrots, and all that other good stuff. On top of the lack of extras with the fried rice it had no taste. Bland.\n\nMeats that I ordered weren't bad on the other hand, but the portions were a little too small in my opinion. Their noodles that also came with the meal wasn't filling, and just left me a feeling of not full but at the same time not hungry. And mind, I ate two of my party's portion on noodles.\n\nWe also had some tempura. The tempura, I had no taste for it. I've definitely had better. The batter had no taste, as well as the sauce. The veggies that was served in the batter surprised my mother, which found out it was just a whole half of an onion dipped and fried in the tempura. She also wanted to tell me that what made it worse was that the onion had no flavor, the batter, and on top of all that the sauce!\n\nFinally lets get on with the end when we pay our bills.\nSitting with us at our grill was another party of 5, 3 kids and 2 adults. One of the child's birthday happened to be that day. So, you usually get a dessert, or a cupcake, or some ice cream right? Not here! This lucky girl got a nice candle, in a sauce dish. Well, they did sing the birthday song to her.\n\nBut wait! That's not it! The table sitting directly across from us also had a birthday. So, they take the candle the little girl just blew out and lights it again to give it to the other birthday person. Mind, these meals cost I believe $15+. Easily.\n\nWay to cheap out your customers there, Nakato. Charge extra for fried rice that's bland, and some pretty expensive dishes, with no complimentary birthday dessert. Now, that's how you run a business: Cutting costs, and try to recuperate losses.", "business_id": "1PSnPPFVfp03iPfJRPWWQw", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-02-24", "type": "review"}

From the looks of it, one would expect a dingy little hole in the wall, but it's actually very clean inside. I secretly did a happy dance when I saw shakers of Japanese chili powder and black sesame seeds on each table.. two of my favorite condiments! \n\nAs we approached the counter, we were greeted by a cheerful and helpful lady, whom I later deduced is the owner's daughter. My friend asked which dishes were the most popular and she said, \"chicken teriyaki, panko chicken, pork katsu and chicken curry.\" I ordered the (dark meat) chicken teriyaki combo (comes w/ rice & salad) since that was my craving at the time and the BFF ordered 1/2 chicken 1/2 beef teriyaki combo (it's not on the menu, but the lady was nice enough to accomodate the request). \n\nOur heaping plates arrived a few minutes later and we hungrily dug in. After the first bite, I realized I was kind of disappointed by the chicken teriyaki because the meat was very dry and it was heavily marinated in sauce. I think they gave me white meat, but we were short on time and the lady was busy serving others so I didn't bother asking. The BFF enjoyed his beef & chicken combo which doesn't surprise me since he's very easy to please when it comes to food.  \n\nI ate a few more bites so I wouldn't starve during the game and packed up the rest for the BFF to take home. Oh yeah, the salad was OK. Nothing special about it, but I should have figured it wouldn't be since it was only an additional $.80 from a regular teriyaki bowl. \n\nThe lady working was not only very nice & helpful when we ordered, but she also went above and beyond what one would expect from a fast food type place. She asked us once or twice if we're doing OK, asked if we needed more rice and as we were about to toss our plates, she offered to do it for us. I also noticed she was just as friendly to the other patrons.. even offered a guy a sample of the chicken teriyaki because he didn't know what to order. \n\nI'd really rate the food at 3 stars, but added an extra for the super nice lady.

From what I've heard, this place has been around for quite a while which is a testament to the food they serve. It's important to know that this place isn't authentic Japanese, it's American Japanese, so prepare your taste buds accordingly. So far, this is the only place that I've found in Phoenix that serves Japanese curry. This isn't like hot sauce over a dish, this is the real deal.\n\nAs far as the food goes, it definitely hits the spot and is always sure to please. My usual tends to be the chicken curry. They really know how to pack in the flavor and make a portion that's not too big and not too small. My only complaint is that they tend to go a bit over on the onions. Another thing to pick up while you're there is their Japanese soda. I forget the name of it, but it comes in a glass bottle and it has a glass ball that rolls around inside. It's refreshing and fun to drink as well. The sushi here is kinda \"eh\", but it fills you up and chances are that if you're eating there you're not looking for top quality sushi.\n\nMy impression of the place is that it's family owned by the women that work there.

It got pretty spicy the more you ate. \n\nSoon the sashimi came. We had peppered and seared salmon (yum), extra white tuna, ahi tuna, yellow tail and salmon. Each piece was very good. The sizes were generous, too. The sahsmi came with two small dipping bowls, too. Sort of a mild spicy sauce, an alternative to soy. The sauce was a great complement to the meal. \n\nMy friend wanted more. Man, she can pack it away! So, we ordered some mackeral nigiri and a caterpillar roll. The mackerel was very good, although I thought the rice it laid on was a bit too sticky - hard to chew. The caterpillar roll was good, though. It was your basic eel meets avocado. The eel sauce was sweet without being overly sweet and overpowering the taste of the roll. \n\nOverall, a great meal! The service was also great - although a bit too attentive. Considering we were the only patrons (minus a couple sitting at the sushi bar), they were just waiting around to serve us. In fact, they tried to take our miso soups away twice before we were actually finished. \n\nAlso, there was the chattering - the owner striking up a conversation after we paid, when we are about to get up from our seats. First it was about basketball, since on the big screen I saw that it was about to be Bedlam (Oklahoma State vs. OU). Funny, considering I went to OSU and my friend is a big Sooners fan. I think the owner wanted to see us throw down. Who knows. In any case, basketball talk soon turned to travel (Hawaii was a hot topic) and the outdoors. We gradually weened the conversation to a flutter and left. \n\nAs we were pulling away, my friend said, \"Oh god, he's outside waving to us.\" It was true. He was outside, alright, bidding us adieu. Some may call that spectacular service. I think that was over doing it a bit much. Yet, what else had he to do? It seems the FBR had devoured most of his dinner patrons. Besides, he did admit that Ichi Ban is more of a hot lunch spot for the surrounding businesses. \n\nAs for the bill, it came to about $100. True, we did order some more expensive fish (like the white tuna), but it was not worth $50 a person. No way, no how. Especially since you felt like you stumbled upon an obscure shopping plaza and into a sushi diner, not a restaurant. (Case in point: They have a seperate counter to take orders for teriyaki rice bowls and the like.) The decor didn't so much bother me, though. It was the extra attention. I guess I just don't like being spoiled (that's one way to look at it). \n\nPlus, the owner is Korean. We know this because they were speaking to each other in another language, and my friend picked up on it. He was Korean alright. She should know. She married one.", "business_id": "oSKT5oZX1NWYaHwOWL5lag", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-01-29", "type": "review"}

After munching on the most ethinically eclectic breadbasket (read other reviews, it's so true!), I had the udon with tempura shrimp and OMG I was stuffed about halfway through the steaming bowl of slurpy good noodles, flavorful broth, and giant, meaty shrimp covered in a tempura that, amazingly, had not disintegrated in the liquid. True comfort food, but I will warn - you may become drowsy after eating this. It's like Ambien was the secret ingredient. :) \n\nAt Matsuri, the line was long (as they were at almost every food booth) and I will say the $7 may have been a tad much for the styrobowl of ramen with bbq pork slices, but that was quickly forgotten as I tucked in. The steam rising from my precarious bowl promised flavor and did not fail to deliver. The pork was oooh so good; even my picky 5-yr-old was slurping up the noodles and munching on the smoky-tasting meat. The broth was filling and so good, perfect for what turned out to be kind of a blustery day. \n\nYeah, there's a wait sometimes. It's a small place, and helloooo... if it sucked, there would be NO wait. Man it up and chat with a stranger.

Our server was a little slow getting to us, again, this is not a chain, so that was overlooked. \n\nI ordered a Summer Roll (per menu - Shrimp, lettuce, avocado, cucumber and rice noodles) and a Shrimp tempera roll. When the orders arrived the summer roll looked great, but was stuffed with a \"bonus\" of that weird crab lookalike stuff made from fish heads and fins.. YUK! Not a problem, I'll just scoop it out onto the appetizer plate... \n\nso when I counted, the Summer roll with shrimp, did have shrimp.. 2 of them, and I kid you not, 1/2 cup of that crab stuff. \n\nWhen my \"shrimp\" tempura roll arrived, guess what?? its a fake crab tempura roll with one shrimp... lol... The rice...VERY sticky... By the time the meal was over, my app plate was mounded with about a cup of this crab scented stuff... such a waste... \n\nMy friend's pasta ( Marsala Chicken) was great... the chicken was all breast meat, with a really good Marsala sauce...it was impressive! ... So overall... weird experience... will it keep me away??... no, well not unless it happens again...\n\nThe strangest thing about this whole ordeal is the fact  the main ingredient of my appetizer and sushi roll was not even on the menu.", "business_id": "AkOruz5CrCxUmXe1p_WoRg", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-01-05", "type": "review"}

I can get clam linguine in a white wine sauce, along with spicy Korean bbq beef in soba noodles, which is exactly what we did one night.  The flavors were excellent, although a little muted, and the amount of clams were amazing. There was a little bit of sand in some of the clams, but to me, that shows the dedication to having a fresh piece of seafood on the plate. \nI also thought that my wife's clams were swimming in the sauce, as there was a TON of it on her plate. Conversely, while my plate was cooked well, I felt that 1) the beef needed to be spicy, and 2) there needed to be more of it. I really felt like I was eating more noodle than anything else. \n\nAnd that's what keeps this place from getting a 5. The little things, like a lack of spice, too much sauce, the absolutely dreadful & schizophrenic decor, and, well, on our night, the single server handling the entire restaurant.  \n\nThere are some nice little touches though.

It's like the guy or girl you are super attracted to but they have a shitty attitude. I wholeheartedly agree with the previous reviews that the food is great but service is inconsistent and mostly bad. I was being generous with the 3 stars for this experience but have had higher star experiences in the past. Just not this weekend. We went on Saturday night against my husband's better judgment and at my insistence. Sorry, babe, I take the blame for this one. We go in and the hostess seats us (two adults and a 2 year old). Five minutes go by and it is apparent that no one is bringing us a high chair. My husband had to go ask for one and the hostess (who sat us) was like, Oh you need a highchair? I suppose my daughter COULD sit in a regular chair but I envision her falling out, dropping food everywhere, etc. This hostess/server has been there FOREVER and as a matter of fact, we have bad experiences when she has waited on us in the past. Anyways, we order our food: side of steamed rice, crispy calamari as an appetizer and for dinner, the sushi combo for me, the miso sea bass for my husband. We also ordered a large Asahi and small, hot sake. The drinks came promptly. I remember thinking that the calamari app was taking a little while to come out and sure enough, it comes out with my sushi combo and side of rice. Okay, whatever. This doesn't bother me TOO much even though the calamari looked and tasted like it had been sitting under a lamp too long. Maybe the server forgot it. The main issue was that 10 minutes after we got that, we are still waiting on my husband's dinner. Seriously? I'll be honest in that I prefer that the whole dinner be brought out at once so that the table can eat their meals together but hey, I am flexible. But 10-15 minutes later, I am almost done with my meal which my husband has been helping me eat since he hadn't gotten his. The Miso Sea Bass was a special of the night so maybe the restaraunt had alot of orders for it. That's fine but if the kitchen is backed up, it is the server's responsibility to let us know. But, no, the server disappeared after dropping off the food and never came back. He only came back after my husband walked up to the front to cancel the entree to apologize and see if we wanted dessert. Um, no, not having anything else. About 5 minutes after that, the hostess dropped off our check and again, we waited awhile and still no server came to get the check. So, my husband went up to the front to drop off the card. Then the manager dropped off the receipt, not the server. Terrible, terrible, service. It is SUCH a shame, because I love going to CherryBlossom. The sushi combo (choice of two rolls, with miso soup and salad for $11) is a great deal and mostly everything I have gotten there is very good. I also love the mixed bread basket with dinner rolls, cinnamon toast and banana bread. But it isn't worth the crappy service. Beware, too, if you do take-out, they try to avoid giving the you the soup, salad, and bread that would normally come with your meal. They tried telling my husband that they don't give that for take-out. Um, unless they are discounting the take-out food (which they are not), they should be giving everything that would normally come with the meal. Sigh, I hope this place gets their act together...", "business_id": "AkOruz5CrCxUmXe1p_WoRg", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-02-15", "type": "review"}

There I said it. I always enjoy the food, there's not been one thing there that I've eaten that I didn't like. That being said, food isn't going to make me return to a place to eat. We usually get takeout from CB because their service flat out sucks. My wife made me go with her this past weekend, because I've been making her get takeout form Hula Modern Tiki the past few times (Hula's great). So against my will, and because it was on the eve of Valentine's day, I decided to cave against my better judgement. I should be totally ticked, but because they didn't fail my expectations and screwed up my meal/deliviered craptacular service, wifey won't be making me go again. Win, I think.  I always make it a point to order the dinner special from places with the idea that the chefs are sick and tired of cooking the same stuff on the menu, and will be invigorated at cooking something new and exciting. This particular night, I opted for the Miso Marinated Sea Bass. Sounds great, right? I'll never know.....the server never brought it to me. Appetizer arrived, wife's meal arrived, daughter's bowl of steamed rice arrived, beer arrived, sake arrived, check arrived. Not in that order, but you get my drift. So my meal consisted of some of my wife's sushi, some of my daughter's steamed rice, some of the appetizer, beer, sake and table bread. Happy Valentines to you Cherry Blossom!  If anybody's thinking of checking this place out, get takeout. The food's good, but I can get better service at QT.

Cherry Blossom's version is not like any I've had before-I usually simply order the cha su ramen in whatever size is not the gigantic bucket full.  Cherry Blossom's was not a clear broth, rather it was almost a creamy white laden with seaweed and pork and those wonderful noodles....I could eat a WHOLE lot of this...coupled with eight pieces of California roll, salad with some pretty solid ginger dressing, and bread (??) with a tropical iced tea set me back $11.  \nVery good food and good value I'd say too!

I fell in love with ramen at Santouka Ramen in San Diego and Los Angeles.  When I heard about Cherry Blossom I was hoping to finally have a place to go to in Phoenix that would give me my ramen fix without having to drive to California.  My wife and I visited Cherry Blossom and I was disappointed in their lack of selection for ramen.  Cherry Blossom serves asian dishes of all sorts and even Italian dishes.  It is a very odd concept to me but it all revolves around noodles.  They have five choices for ramen.  I'm used to getting pork miso ramen at other ramen houses.  Cherry Blossom didn't exactly have that. They had miso ramen with salmon slices.  I relented and got the miso ramen with salmon slices.  When I was served I was immediately encouraged by the color of the broth which was a light brown and not transparent, just as it should be.  I could tell there was less oil in this ramen broth than at Santouka.  The broth was pretty good, but a hair on the salty side.  Don't get me wrong, I expect the broth to be very high in sodium and cause me to gain several pounds of water weight, but this was saltier than I am used to.  The fish was done properly but I hadn't looked forward to that as much as the noodles.  The noodles weren't bad.  The noodles were good but not quite the quality as places I visited in California and Las Vegas.  I expected to have more vegetables and/or seaweed in the dish.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed my dish and it was priced appropriately at $8.60 plus tax, but it didn't wow me.  If you compare Cherry Blossom to Republic Ramen in Tempe, AZ, Cherry Blossom wins hands down.  The noodles and broth have so much going on and is far superior to Republic Ramen. \n      Cherry Blossom has Japanese beer on tap and good house saki.  Both were reasonably priced.  The cocktail recipes didn't appeal to me at all.  I have been to Japanese bars before and they had some complex recipes that showed allot of thought and passion for bar tending at those other places but these Cherry Blossom recipes looked uninspired and like they were written by someone that wasn't used to making cocktails professionally.  \n       All in all, I would go to Cherry Blossom if it is near you or if you are just dying to get your ramen fix and you don't have a lot of options living in Phoenix but I prefer other ramen houses I have been to in Vegas and California much more than Cherry Blossom.", "business_id": "AkOruz5CrCxUmXe1p_WoRg", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-12-18", "type": "review"}

While there was a huge amount It was not Sashimi quality ... in fact, it was almost white in color, bland and hard to describe texture.... more Wasabi helped hide it so I could choke it down.

The Extremely Spicy Gyoza Hot Pot sold me on this place the first time I went and I return over and over again just to have it. That said, I've tried relatively few things. \n\nThe sushi is fine, not amazing. I like it enough to order it most times I go but I wouldn't go there just for sushi. The lettuce wraps with shrimp and vegetables are good but messy to eat since they are served with thinnish romaine leaves rather than the round butter lettuce leaves most places use.  My husband gets the pasta every once in a while and loves it.  I've tried his plates a couple times and I think it's good, not great, but that could be because he drowns it in shredded parmesan and I can't taste the real flavor it came out of the kitchen with. \n\nNext time I will get Tan Tan Men. Other Yelpers have raved about the Ramen and, although I've never tried it, I expect it to be delicious because it's made with the same soup as the Extremely Gyoza Hot Pot which, as I already mentioned, I LOVE. \n\nNow for the not so good...(but not so bad either)...\nThe last time we went we sat at the bar for the first time. Like other reviewers, I definitely recommend sitting at the bar if you can for two reasons: 1) when the place is busy, which it often is, the food takes a while to make it to your table and being able to watch the cooks provides a bit of entertainment to make the time pass quicker; 2) there's more space at the bar than at the 2-person tables. We usually feel pretty cramped at the 2-tops once we have drinks and an appetizer on the table but there's a little more elbow room and room for plates and drinks at the bar. \n\nHowever, sitting at the bar has a downside also...when you can see the cooks putting all the plates together, though it's entertaining, you can also see all the things they touch without wearing gloves.  I've never been sick after eating here and I will continue to eat here frequently despite having seen all this, but it does make me pause to think a bit when I watch a cook dip his bare hand into some seafood (which he throws into a pan presumably hot enough to cook off any germs) and then wipe his hand on a repeatedly-used wet towel as he grabs a bunch of lettuce leaves for a salad plate (without any heat to cook off germs) that goes directly out to the customer. Admittedly, I don't know much about proper food handling and what's ok and what's not, but bare handed food touching always weirds me out a little.  \n\nThat said, the food is delicious. It does take a while to get from ordering to eating but the cooks are hustling so I can't complain. Try the Gyoza Hot Pot. It's awesome. 5 stars without the wait and bare (but potentially clean-ish??) hands on food.", "business_id": "AkOruz5CrCxUmXe1p_WoRg", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-02-15", "type": "review"}

Well, when I got a text from Dave inviting us there, I knew it was time. Boy was I happy! The food here was great. They brought out bread at the beginning of the meal (which is very strange for an Asian noodle place), but the bread was good, especially the cinnamon toast..yum. I ordered the spicy gyoza soup on happy hour for only 5$. It was large enough for two meals and had tons of flavor. The gyoza was nothing special, but the broth was amazing! So spicy and flavorful...it was awesome. I got to try Becca's Tantan noodles (or something) which was spicy noodle soup with ground pork.....ohhhhh definitely what I would get if it weren't happy hour. It was so delicious, similar to the gyoza soup, but with more smokey flavor. It was wonderful. The two guys got the beef curry noodle soup which was odd, but in a good way. It had a middle eastern flavor that was really delicious and something I had never tasted before. It wouldn't be something I would order, but it was very good. The prices were also reasonable, about 10$ pp. Needless to say, I will be back without hesitation!", "business_id": "AkOruz5CrCxUmXe1p_WoRg", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-12-05", "type": "review"}

I used to live in Japan and it's some of the best Japanese food I've had outside of Japan. Their Tonkotsu ramen (Hakata ramen on the menu) is best I've found in PHX. Their other menu items are also pretty tasty. Their prices are also pretty reasonable. \n\nThe only reason they don't get 5 stars is because of the service. It's rather sub-par. The wait staff are friendly they just aren't overly attentive and often seemed a bit confused or disjointed. I often find myself waiting for sometime after I sit down for a waiter to even come by with water.

The rice was a bit on the wet side so didn't keep it's form well under the Salmon. However, the flavor was there and tasted best with a touch of wasabi and a light dipping in soy sauce.\n\nThe Hakata Ramen was pretty basic, I can tell they use powdered broth for their ramen as my tongue got a little bit funny feeling from the MSG. It comes with stick straight ramen, green onion, char-shu, wood-ear mushroom (ki- kurage) and my side order of egg- poached. The broth is Hakata style, made with pork bones and appears creamy, fatty and white in color. Though it is Hakata style, the flavors aren't complex as other ramen I've had and as I've stated was apparent they use a soup base mix/powder. The noodles were okay- though not always a fan of stick straight noodles, but the portion was just right. The char-shu was on the thicker side, but seasoned well. The egg, I wish was soft boiled instead of poached and lacked seasoning/flavor. Another thing that bugged me was that the ramen wasn't hot, it was warm ... perhaps sitting out in the pass a little too long?\n\nOver all I would come here for more Nigiri and pass on the ramen, the ramen is doable for the price point but nothing to get overly excited about. Thus far, their pasta and sushi seems the most promising here.\n\nThe service is also pretty good as everything is friendly and quick!", "business_id": "AkOruz5CrCxUmXe1p_WoRg", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-12-05", "type": "review"}

Once walking in one of the servers seated me and I sat up at the counter that they have by the cooking area. I enjoyed sitting there because I got to see all the many different dishes. As I am sitting down my server (Kenny - I asked another waiter his name) asked me what I would like to drink and I just said a water. I sit down and start looking over the menu and as I am doing this Kenny is waiting on a young lady RIGHT behind me. She is asking some questions about the menu and he rudely cuts her off and rattles off some options on the bento box and she asked another question (as you could tell it was her first time there and wasn't familiar with the menu) and he rudely states \"Like I just said, I told you the options.\" She then was trying to speak to him and he states that same sentence not once, not twice but four times in less than a minute. I was so shocked I actually turned around in my seat and looked at him! I have NEVER heard a waiter with such attitude! Maybe he was having a bad day...who knows...he proceeds to come to me to take my order and I try ordering and he CUTS ME OFF mid-order!!!! I would have like to have asked a question but I knew better!! Two more people were sat in his section and he proceeded to run to the back (as I can see from where I am sitting) and yells right in a female co-workers face about why people are sitting in his section! Why would you treat someone like this!!! I mean he was RIGHT in her face. I was so embarrassed for her even though she didn't see me noticing this. I was in utter shock at this point and one of the chefs could see this and asked me what was wrong. I told him that I have never seen a ruder employee than that and pointed to Kenny. He apologized and tried to make it better. I could tell the chef was very embarrassed as he took pride in his workstation, the customers and his service and this one employee was ruining it for everyone working around him. I tried not to let this A-hole of a waiter ruin my lunch. My soup came and that was very, very good! then about 10 minutes after my soup came he said my california roll will be ready soon. As I am done with my meal I am waiting for Kenny to come back to get me some to go containers. He walks over to get them and I noticed that two bowls stuck together when he went to get one and he threw the other one on the lower counter like he was VERY annoyed! I just was speechless at this point. Again, I talked to the chef who was amazing and made my lunch as he was very sorry for his co-workers actions. \n\nI eat out a lot and I have never experienced this kind of service EVER! I will be actually calling and filing a formal complaint as this was unacceptable. \n\nI will be back but refuse to sit in his section...EVER!", "business_id": "AkOruz5CrCxUmXe1p_WoRg", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-01-16", "type": "review"}

The Asian nachos app. was actually pretty interesting (in a good way). The sushi was pretty good too. Not the best, but good. \n\nOur server was a little strange. We couldn't decide if she was a little rude or just ditzy. But the host/door guy was great so at least we know they are capable of decent service.\n\nMoto is a pretty solid place.

The owner (who splits his time between CO and AZ) doesn't mess around with \"typical\" beers. You won't find Budweiser, Miller, Coors, Heineken, Corona or any of their \"lite\" varieties. Usual beers found on tap are from Four Peaks (local brewery), Stone Brewing (San Diego), Avery Brewing (Boulder, CO) and various other craft brewing companies. \n\nAlong with the beer comes an in-frequent \"beer celebration\" held at Moto. This happens for Stone Brewing Anniversaries along with other random events. Usually advertised on tables a few weeks prior to the event. \n\n\n2. Non-sushi menu items. There is a good selection of pre-made bowls along with a make your own bowl option. I consider all of these bowls to be \"to-go\" options, I can never finish a full bowl (I'm 6'3\" and 200+ lbs, to give you an idea of my size/appetite). Also, the buffalo burger and salmon entrees are good sized and won't break the bank.\n\nI've had every appetizer available on the menu and can say that they are all good to excellent. The spring rolls come with a wonderful sweet sauce. The chicken quesadillas are large and filling. The asian nachos are piled high.\n\n\n3. Desert - The \"Mojos\" are probably one of the best frozen deserts I've ever had. Ice cream wrapped in rice crispy treats. The ice cream can change daily, the servers usually do not know what flavor it will be. The menu states this as well.\n\n\n4. The \"Underground\" menu. This is the menu of specialty rolls that are made. These clock in at $12 each and are very good. The Jalapenko is spicy and very filling for an 8 piece serving. \n\n\n5. The \"all you can eat\" on Saturday. This is both good and bad. The good is that yes, you can get all you can eat (of the available sushi, not everything is on this special). The bad is that once it gets busy you will need to wait for your items, Moto runs two sushi chefs max. If you expect 20 orders of 5+ sushi items to come out in 5-10 minutes, you need to come back to reality. Get there early and order in a timely manner, be prepared.\n\n\nAnd now the downside:\n\n1. Sushi - The regular menu has, in comparison to other sushi bars, a very small selection. As mentioned in earlier reviews, only smoked salmon for some items rather than regular salmon. The sushi available is of good size without the \"rice bloat\" that some sushi bars have, you know what I mean, when the roll has more rice than contents (fish/veggies/seaweed or soy wrap). I recommend ordering a regular roll, such as spicy tuna and an \"underground\" roll (mentioned above).\n\n\n2. Wait time and servers - This is a neighborhood restaurant, through and through this is how the owner markets the establishment and runs it. If it is very busy you will need to wait for a table. You will need to wait for your order to be prepared longer if it is busy.\n\n\n\nThat's all I have to offer you in the way of advice and opinion on Moto. Overall it is above average when factoring in the experience and goal of the restaurant. I wouldn't call it a \"sushi experience\", but rather a nice sushi restaurant in a good neighborhood. Go to have a nice lunch or dinner, or to watch a game and drink some great beers.", "business_id": "c0RSs2KYK5Y-ZlSrNq9LyA", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-12-12", "type": "review"}

Overall excellent.\n\nSadly, on my second visit, I encountered a hot restaurant (eeew, raw fish and a hot environment?) with mediocre service. We arrived at 12:30 and attempted the All You Can Eat Sushi, two full hours later we had eaten exactly about two rolls and two nigiris each. minus soy sauce for the first order since we never got our soy sauce bowls. We were told the AYCES would take about 15 minutes to prepare when in actuality it took just under an hour for each order. \n\nWe watched as two different families sat at a table across from us and left after waiting for about 10 minutes to give a drink order, nobody ever came.  \n\nFinally, this little grandpa with his two grandsons came in they, like us waited and waited. the grandfather told the server he felt he had been waiting too long (45 minutes), she offered an apology and sent the manager over who began to actually argue with the man, she actually asked if he had ever eaten at a sushi place before.  Excuse me? Not professional.  Then tried to tell him that the server had placed his order only 20 minutes earlier. He was confused as he had ordered a good 40-45 minutes earlier.  The manager, again, argued with the man telling him he didn't order 45 minutes earlier.  \n\nBottom line: AYCES is horrible, we actually overheard the manager tell the man \"The AYCES is prepared AFTER other regular orders, regardless of when placed, so that customers who order order off the regular menu get their food hot.\" Really? So the sushi chefs are also in the kitchen preparing soups and noodle dishes? Not likely.  So, take the 18 bucks, add on the automatic 20% gratuity and you've got yourself a meal a little over 20 bucks a piece and you've only eaten 5 pieces of sushi.  \n\nI will not return for AYCES, but for a dinner?

So I go and grab my friends to alert them that the table was ready, and when I walk back in, some stupid little bitchy server is standing there glaring at me telling me she \"needs a minute to move the table\" while huffing and puffing and sighing and just generally being a little queen about having to move a freakin table. I'm sorry, isn't it your JOB to accommodate patrons? I thanked her as she stormed off, and say something shitty to her about being such an inconvenience. I never saw her again throughout the duration of my visit. \n\nStar removal #1.\n\nWe all sit down, and continue waiting for our drink order to be placed. Finally, after about 10 minutes, this happens, but were without menus, so no one *really* knows what they want, Waitress huffs, rolls her eyes, and goes to grab menus. We look, she takes our order, but only for about 6 of the 8 people at the table. She somehow forgot about the tallest man at the table and the girl sitting across from him. Once she comes back, after 3 attempts, she gets the order wrong, serves me my sake without a cup or a glass for my beer. Seriously?\n\nStar removal #2.\n\nWe finally order. Mind you, this was the longest lunch in the universe, because at this point we had already been there for an hour. Luckily our waitress got the order correct, except a few of us ended up waiting at least 45 minutes for our rolls to come out.. specifically the Avocado rolls.. did you run to California to grow and pick them yourself because.. wow. \n\nStar removal #3.\n\nThey managed to Eff up the most important part, which was the SUSHI. My unagi was not fresh, the spicy tuna tasted like plastic, they only had smoked salmon, no raw. They waitress *highly* recommended the dessert roll, which was ice cream rolled in rice krispys.. I know that sounds awesome and all, but im here for sushi, not ice cream. Also, on the menus, it says they have the choice to put a grat on ANY size party.. this to me is absolutely absurd.\n\nStar Removal #4\n\nI'm sorry, but when you see a PARTY OF EIGHT slide in, you do everything in your power to make these people happy, because if you don't, you can expect that \"We can grat anyone we want\" to be the only grat you get. Nothing additonal.\n\nGet your shit together Moto, and maybe remind your waitstaff that their JOB is to make sure your patrons enjoy themselves, not make us feel like a burden. If it weren't for them, this review wouldn't have been so shitty.\n\nP.S. Start to finish, lunch took 2.5 hours. \n\nFAIL.", "business_id": "c0RSs2KYK5Y-ZlSrNq9LyA", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-01-03", "type": "review"}

Only you would have a sushi place with the chairs up on the tables at 9:40 on a Saturday Night.   \n\nI stopped by to check this place out after some christmas shopping errands, around 9:30 this Saturday.  Being a fan of sushi and craft beer, this was on my list to check out. \n\nThe waitress came by and handed me a list of beers on a folded piece of paper from her pocket.  I was really stoked with the selection.  I ordered a Dogfish Head 90min IPA.  The lovely waitress returned only to crush my hopes by saying that was an old list and that they didnt have any Dogfish Head on tap.  (Insert trombone failure sound effect here.  :::Waaahhh Wahhhhhh:::: ) Then she gave me a newer folded piece of paper with a slightly less appealing selection.  However, i found a tasty IPA and pulled the trigger.  \n\nI perused the menu... everything has \"Krab\" which must mean its artificial crab.  Most rolls also have something tempura.  This is classic tell-tale sign that they keep minimal fresh fish on hand.  Given that it is 9:30p on a saturday night and there is only one other table there, it's probably a good thing. This place doesn't get much traffic, so a lot of fish wouldn't sell fast enough.  \n\nI asked the waitress if these \"inside out rolls\" were their specialty rolls.  She said, nope, i have another secret list for that.  She slips me the folded paper list.  I'm starting to feel like i'm on a treasure hunt!  So exciting.  What other fun lists might she have up her sleeve?!  I ordered a Senorita roll because it is one of the only ones with fresh tuna on top of the roll.  The roll was large.  It wasn't cut with precision, some pieces were much larger than others, some smaller. (The place was empty, so it wasn't that the sushi chef was busy and rushed, he was just lazy.)  The Krab filling was Meh.  The tuna on top was tasty, but was certainly frozen, so it wasn't super.  Overall, the mediocrity of the roll was hidden by a lot of sweet eel sauce and some tempura crunchies.  \n\nAs far as sushi places go, i'd give it a C.\nHowever, thanks to their good beer list and given that most suburban peeps wouldnt notice the difference between fresh never-frozen and frozen fish... As far as suburban restaurants go, id give it a B.\n\nIf you really like sushi, go somewhere else.  If you just want a good beer in the neighborhood and a passable roll to fill you up, then this place is perfect.  (I'll probably be back for that exact reason.)\n\nIf you've recently been on a date to Olive Garden or Red Lobster.  You will think this place is amazing.

Wifey got the Las Vegas Roll ($9.95) that had crab, cream cheese and shrimp and it was fried. Again, a great roll. I also ordered the spicy ribs. They were sauceless and SUPER crispy!!! I was expecting more grilled ribs (like my fave at Sochu House) but there were VERY good.

This review is long overdue.  \n\nIve been coming here off and on for 4-5 years.  \n\nCONS:  \nBeer glass/drink size: Im an IPA beer snob (this part of which will also be a pro, later on in the review) and it just bugs me that the beers are served in 12 oz glasses.  By not serving the beer in a pint glass, this is the message i get:  MOTO is trying to make just a little more profit off the beer by shorting you the extra four ounces you are accustomed to.    Case in point: Sculpin on draft (delicious), 12 oz for $7.  This is what I pay for Sculpin at places like Federal and Postino, unfortunately i do not think MOTO is the same caliber place (service, food, etc).  I expect a little more beer for my $7.\n\nFood: Average.  Its like guilty pleasure / junk food with Asian flare.  Not the freshest, not the tastiest, but i keep coming back (when i feel like being bad), so it can't be all that bad!\n\nAnd now for my biggest gripe, CLEANLINESS:  There are several decorative metal grates hanging from the ceiling over the bar and the area where sushi is prepared.  For the last year, I have noticed that these grates have an insane amount of dust bunnies and dirt on them.  Its SO gross.  On my last visit, the cook was preparing sushi at the bar and i couldn't help but think how many particles of dust and debris were falling from those grates onto the sushi.   PLEASE CLEAN THE GRATES!! \n\nPROS:  Great beer selection, always rotating, and always updated on TapHunter!! Whomever manages the Facebook site is really on top of things and posts witty things.\n\nVibe! Its a good vibe.. the kind of place I want to pop into after hiking squaw peak.  Nothing too fancy, not pretentious at all, and just laid back. The ambience is nice and the menu is full of witty statements.\n\nThere is enough about this place that I like, and i will keep coming back.

I'll start by saying that this place hovers between 3 and 4 stars for me. The food is good for the most part... I did have a bad this or that once or twice. Otherwise though, good fresh ingredients. \n\nIf you walk by a fish restaurant and it smells like fish, run away or you'll be doubled over the toilet that night or the following morning. The stronger the smell, the sicker you'll be. Zen hasn't ever smelled fishy when I've been there. A definite plus for me.\n\nWhile they use good ingredients, I find they don't roll their sushi very tightly and it tends to fall apart on me. This probably depends on the chef that day/night. And speaking of that - this place depends entirely on when you go and what you're in to... At night and especially on weekends, this place is buzzing and it's difficult to get seated or move around. It's a popular spot. During the day, especially during the week, it's pretty chill and a solid choice for a good quiet lunch. \n\nPeople come here at night for the bar atmosphere behind the partition... it often bleeds into the main dining room - and this place isn't that large. This sort of thing can ruin a quiet evening. Good suishi places tend to have a busy bar though, so you probably have come to expect such things.\n\nI have to note that the bathroom is great - classy and clean. The whole place is clean and well decked out. The biggest complaint with this place really should be the space - it's very cramped. Even when it's empty, it feels small... not really a problem though unless it's full of people - at this point you'll feel right at home with the sushi as you'll be a little packed sardine.\n\nThe last time I ate here was a few days ago and I noticed the little specials card in that plastic stand that sits at every table smelled like a construction worker's arm pit. Don't ask me how I know what a construction worker's arm pit smells like or why I smelled the card - just know that it was totally rank. I had the waitress smell it and she agreed and promptly took it away for disposal.\n\nMy advice is to go here when it's not so busy and have your night out somewhere else.", "business_id": "NDKkce5Au-o_OhIt5f2ZBg", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-02-02", "type": "review"}

I enjoyed the sushi we all ordered.  Most of it , I hear, was the basic, not exotic type of sushi.   We all shared, california rolls, shrimp tempura, philly rolls, spicy tuna, and some weird sweet like tootsie roll. I thought all of it was good, and so did the rest of the people that I was there with.  \n\nI did not try the dessert, but, someone at our table did order a chocolate type of dessert, it looked pretty, but definitely NOT worth it.  It was more like a giant brownie, I don't know about you but, I'm not paying $10 for a brownie. Just walk on over to the Gelato Spot afterwards instead. Oh, yeah, PARKING SUCKS!!!

The waitress was attentive, keeping the dishes clear and my drink full as well as giving some very yummy suggestions! My only complaint is that the menu tells you what is included with a roll but doesnt specify whether its on the inside or the outside of it.

The rolls were quite expensive, and all the fried asparagus and other strong ingredients covered up the fish flavor. It seemed as if they knew that the fish had no flavor so they intentionally tried to cover it up. Everything was either rolled with asparagus, fried, or covered in spicy mayo or chili sauce. Any of the roe that was used as garnish was so dry it would roll around the plate. The appetizers were good, but way over priced. Ten dollars for 5 lettuce leaves and a half a cup of filling is a bit much. \n\nTotal bill per person for half an appetizer, iced tea, and a roll and a half each? Roughly forty dollars.

Zen 32's spicy tuna was not spicy at all and seemed to lack the use of siracha (chili sauce) that I have come to know and love. \n\n-The rice in each roll lacked the traditional sweetness and stickiness that makes sushi rice different from just plain white rice. \n\n-Each roll seemed to lack any flavor of fish whatsoever because everything was overpowered with ridiculous amounts of cream cheese and sauces. Makes me wonder what kind of fish no no's they're trying to cover up but bottom line is that I eat sushi to enjoy the flavor of the fish and there was none of that to be had here.\n\nOn the bright side, this place apparently has a great happy hour and serves sushi until midnight which is great when you're craving late night sush.

Seriously!\n\nI'm still angry over how bad this place was.  My brother who was with me agrees.  So here is what happened...\n\nWe sit down, look over the menu and instantly notice that the place is super expensive, even for lunch.  Then my brother points out that everyone sitting down seems to be over the age of 50 and eating huge piles of colored salads.  I'm guessing this is the turkey salad.  \n\nMy theory is that for the price everyone went for quantity.  We skipped the original plan for sushi and rolls because at $12 - $15 at lunch this place did not have the atmosphere or the token chefs to warrant those prices.  We decided to start easy and try the Panko Udon noodle soup with tempura.  \n\nMy false expectation:  Thick udon noodles, in a nice translucent dark broth, with tiny green onion bits floating on top, paired with a plate of assorted vegetables covered in a light fluffy batter.  Add battered shrimp or fish depending on the place.  All this would then combine in my mouth into that great saliva generating Udon freshness that I have come to love.  \n\nIt arrived...\n\n-INSERT EXPLETIVE HERE-\n\nThe not even joking reality:  Placed in front of me was a white bowl of soy sauce with a pile of store bought rough spaghetti noodles.  Floating in this disappointment was a horror show of deep fried unrecognizable straight from the freezer bag vegetable shapes.  I say shapes because vegetables  usually have flavor which is the whole reason for including them in a dish, these could have been cardboard cutouts soaked in grease.  I wish I was joking about the soy sauce or the noodles.  It tasted like something a Home Ec student from Beverly Hills would have made first day of class.\n\n-INSERT EXPLETIVE HERE AGAIN-\n\nWell we didn't find the hidden camera and only got a few bites into the mess before giving up.  Here is the best part, the bus boy was not at all surprised when he picked up the plates mostly unfinished.  Weird wait staff aside, Shogun is absolutely hands down the worst Sushi place I have ever eaten at.  If you can't do Udon Soup don't put it on the menu.  They should be ashamed for taking that much money from innocent people who don't know what good sushi tastes like.\n\nAvoid the disappointment and save yourself some money.  You're better off at East Wind 1 mile north at Thunderbird and Tatum.  Better yet head to over to Hiro Sushi at Shea and the 101, its absolutely worth the drive.\n\n-INSERT FINAL EXPLETIVE HERE-", "business_id": "r7Ge8_c5Y2TXthb4CSjzaA", "stars": 1, "date": "2009-02-18", "type": "review"}

Note that Shogun is truly one of the original sushi bars in Phoenix.\n\nEntering Shogun you will view the restaurant is divided into three distinct areas:  bar, sushi bar, and dining room.  You can select whichever you prefer and can order from the same menu at each of the three areas.  The hostess is there waiting and greeting you at the door, along with a sign of their daily specials.\n\nTo enter Shogun, is to enter a diverse world of Japanese specialties.  \nMy absolute favorite is their Shrimp and Vegetable Tempura - six Jumbo shrimp and fresh vegetables - just the right amount of crunch and big in size.  You will not go away hungry when having their Tempura special.  Ordering any of their sushi is always fresh and delicious.  Particular favorites are their California Roll (for those looking to ease into the sushi experience), or their Caterpillar Roll for those more versed in their sushi.  If you are looking for other entr\u00e9e options, their menu also boasts sandwiches, Donburi style of meal (selection of meats simmered and served over rice), or other entrees such as Teppan Chicken, or Samurai Steak.  \n\nShogun Sushi Restaurant is a gem in the middle of the many delights Paradise Valley has to offer.

It was fairly busy when we showed up but we were seated right away which was nice.  Half of our party (the guys) were going to be showing up a little later but we went ahead and ordered some drinks and appetizers to tide us over until they showed up.  The waitress was nice if somewhat lacking in her knowledge of the menu but we didn't really mind.\n\nAfter getting our appetizers and initial drinks we really didn't see our waitress, well actually let me rephrase that, we saw her at other tables around us just not at ours.  Now, I understand that we had told her we were going to wait to order until our party shows up so it's not like we expected her to show up and take our whole order, but she wasn't even coming around to fill our water glasses or to check and see if we needed refills.\n\nOnce the guys showed up and we ordered the food came out and I was kind of underwhelmed.  None of it was bad but it was all pretty average.  The only thing memorable were the Panko Breaded Onion Rings which were fantastic.  Honestly I would go just for those babies.

He spent a great deal of the night explaining where the fish was sourced, when they get their fish in, the difference between quality vs quantity ect. Once I ordered Mackrel, he told me it was from Norway, asked what other kinds of fish I liked --- Then offered me two pieces of Tuna to taste (as comparison) completely GRATIS!\n\nAlso, and I have no idea how this even happened...I was thinking out loud \"I wonder if they have fresh wasabi?\"  I see the owner walking toward me, and before I have a chance to inquire, he puts out a small bowl in front of me \"Tada!\" ...fresh wasabi!\" HOW DID HE KNOW!?\n\nThe meal continues to be amazing. The fish is super fresh (he showed me a picture on his phone of the tuna he brought in that day) and the service spectacular. These folks WILL take care of you...and make sure you leave happy.\n\nOther points of note: It was someone's birthday at the table next to me, they brought out a drum and a sang a song for her, which I thought was cute. Also, the oranges after the meal, a wonderful touch. They're cut into small segments, placed back into the orange, and served with a little toothpick to pull out each piece.\n\nThe ONLY issue: The restaurant is small, and tables crammed. But again, when we sat down at a small two seater, I think I made a face because he took our menus, and said \"let me put you here...\" and gave us a larger spot.

We decided to come here for my boyfriend's son 7th birthday. This was what the birthday boy wanted to do with the rest of the kids for his birthday.

Our waiter, Josh, took our orders right away but once he did, he was MIA for most of the evening. We barely could get a hold of him. A friend and I had to help ourselves to getting napkins, utensils, emptying the table when we were done with our soup and salad and getting to go boxes for our leftover food. He forgot to bring my bf's Kirin so we had to hunt him down for that. But he, also, forgot to bring us our appetizers which was included in the Teppan Special. We were busy with the kids and watching Moonie, our Teppan chef that we didn't get a chance to hunt him down for our appetizers. I understand that he got busy but it is uncalled for when we barely saw him nor came to our table to make sure everything was good or if we needed anything else. He should have had the manager assist him. I had to hunt him down to get our 4th sushi roll. Our Teppan chef, on the other hand, was awesome! Moonie totally entertained the kids so that helped make our dinner somewhat special. Overall, I wasn't happy with the service but the food was good. If it wasn't for Monnie, I would have told my bf to not tip Josh but we felt it would be unfair to Moonie...good thing we gave him a little tip earlier after he cooked for us.

The place was not that busy at all (I can see why) We were not greeted by a server for at least 15 minutes. Then a bus boy walks by and we asked him if we had a server (it was supposed to be Nichole)  Then a manager comes by and sees us looking at our watches and all around for \"Nichole\" I see a blonde servers back to us a few times (Nichole) never even looks over at us. The manager takes our food order back to the kitchen. Nichole makes an appearance and before I can ask for a drink she swirls away. We ask the server from another area if we can order our beverages from her, so she takes our drink order. Finally my salmon carpaccio comes, luke warm, and the sauce is NOT the correct taste too much wasabi-mayo.... not even close to Mesa or Scottsdales carpaccio... my co worker gets her miso soup and is not even finished when \"Nichole\" walks up grabs the bowl and says \"are you finished?\" my friend doesn't like people touching her food while she is still eating... so she tells her to go ahead and take it. It has been 35 minutes now... NO drinks, and the rest of our lunch nowhere to be found.... So we just walked out...

Whereas we were expecting some dried up rolls (made with imitation crab) on the buffet line, we were overwhelmed by the gifts of the sea we were about to receive.  The sushi chef was stationed and ready for our orders.  Yes, full size rolls ranging from the Vegas Roll to the New Mexico Roll (crab, cucumber, and avocado rolled in rice and finished with a spicy sauce, and topped with fresh tuna and lemon, garnished with smelt eggs) were there for our dining pleasure.  An assortment of plain sushi was also available, such as Salmon and Tuna.\n\nBut the wonder and awe at the generous helpings of Japanese cuisine did not stop there.  One of the buffet stations had fresh sashimi of Salmon and Tuna.  The tuna was incredibly soft and buttery, and had a beautiful texture and taste.  I could not believe it!  I easily had a half dozen pieces.  Furthermore, the salmon sashimi had great flavor, and was a decent grade - although a bit dry.  The seaweed salad tasted as good as any self respecting sushi restaurant would offer, the snow peas were just-picked fresh, accented with garlic and lemon.  Kimchee and seaweed, as well as cucumber and tofy were also available.  I had a raw oyster for my first time, as they were laid out so decoratively and invitingly - I could not resist.  Not bad once you get past the awful texture...\n\nNow on to the rest...if I only I had had four stomachs this day to try it all!\n\nThe fish was my favorite!  The Teriyaki salmon, (very flavorful but dry) Garlic halibut, (buttery and juicy, garlic sauce had a lovely sweet and sour finish) Sea bass, ( also had excellent flavor - lemony and salty, buttery and soft) Shrimp dumplings served on a sauteed onion ring, (fresh and plump) and tempura sushi rolls with avocado crab and a sweet eel sauce, also delicious. Crab legs, with drawn butter and lemon came last, and were also ideal for feasting!\n\nAnd the list goes on as I drolled over the lovely chow mein, the robust orange chicken, and flavorful chicken sesame.  The fried rice was greasy and under the heatlamp too long, but overall I could not complain.\n\nAnd then I moved on to more seafood goodness with the clams, which tasted fresh, and were served in a jalapeno scallion miso broth.\nThe Seafood scampi was excellent, buttery garlic dreaminess.  The Thai calamari (small calamari steaks, spicy!) did not suit my tastebuds, but they were appeased immediately by the delectable  walnut shrimp (tempura battered shrimp doused in a walnut dynamite sauce, wow!) and whole crawfish (impressive as the only place to get craw is AJs and costs about $40/pound.  After the crawfish I became a bit more adventurous and tried a Whelsh snail, that I had to scoop out of its beautiful, conical shell.  Wow!!!! Just like ordering snails in a bourgoise French restaurant. Surprisingly, meat was tender and flavorful, a cross between scallop and clam, but filled with a buttery garlic flavor.\n\nSo, the smorgasboard continued on, but alas my belly was filled and there was no more room.  There was a teppan/Mongolian BBQ station as well, at which you can select your own ingredients and sauces to have cooked to order - I merely sniffed at the wonderful aromas as I passed it on my way to the dessert. Of course I had room for the coconut macarron, the chocolate moussa cake, and the lemon bar.\n\nSpeaking of bar, another impressive element of Hong Kong was the extensive cocktail menu including such classics as the Singapore Sling and Great Wall of China.  Also included were sake tinis, plum wine and sake cocktails, as well as a slew of wines and sakes.  Average cost of a cocktail was $6.50.\n\nIs this a great place for groups? Yes! Could you even host a private party? Yes!  Would I return here? Yes!  Would I come here to impress a date? Dare I say...yes?", "business_id": "-Ogv7rpcgUHkFaSy3vD8Sw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-01-25", "type": "review"}

Server quickly asked what we'd like to drink ans we began our food adventure right away.  They have many food stations so people are spread out.  Best part is that they have a Mongolian grill and a made to order sushi bar.  The staff that handles the grill and sushi bar dont talk much but they cook/ make everything to order.  The food is not bad.  Coming from san francisco, ca its hard to find impressive chinese/asian food.  The food isnt greasy, tastey, hot, and love the variety.   Everything is fresh and the food stations very clean.

The place is the cleanest Chinese buffet in the United States unless you are obsessive compulsive.. The food is always fresh and hottest after 5:30 pm, the more people the faster it's replaced. Hands down the best Chinese buffet in Arizona. Very clean, friendly, reasonably priced. Food trays always being refilled. Have been here over 25 times with family and guests and not one complaint or issue ever. All the food is hot and tasty. Each item has it's own unique taste unlike other buffets that have all items taste the same. .whether it's fish , shrimp, spiced crab or low mein everything is very enjoyable. Unless you are looking for 5 star gourmet Chinese in a buffet you'll love the place. Lunch or dinner, both are excellent. Ask for the card , buy 10 dinners get one free. Card gets stamped for each buffet purchased. Anyone who writes anything negative about this buffet has mental issues. It's a buffet. Better than anything in NEW YORK. NEW JERSEY . FLORIDA OR ARIZONA. Been to other very good ones, this is the best, and all our guests agree. We are a middle class down to earth family. Not upscale nose in the air I don't eat in a buffet family.

I love the  great classic Japanese dishes and the presentation was unbeatable. \nAs for the atmosphere, the other reviews paint a picture, not renovated, but for some of us we don't look for a snazzy decor, the food is simply right on.  \n\nI consider this place a true family restaurant.  its located right across from the Hospital near Mesa community college on southern.  \n\nWell I don't  have personal suggestions but I would like to state, that this place has so much potential to be recognized. the food passion and quality is there. It makes me wonder why Tokyo bowl has long lines and I've never see one here.  \n\nGive it a try and yelp, this place needs the big yelp love, I just ate more Nagasaki Grill, at a JACL, (Japanese American Citizen League) event.  Best Bento in the Valley. \n\nFive stars, most authentic Japanese Restaurant in town.  \n\nSincerely,\nKevin", "business_id": "BBPkwpj9kSeDuy0uOwWHJA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-12-07", "type": "review"}

If you're looking for some awesome, authentic udon, you've found the right place.\n\nMy boyfriend and I stopped in for dinner. I can only assume they do a lot of business at lunch because there was only 1 guy sitting in there when we arrived and only one other couple came in while we were there. How do they stay open? Anyway. They guy behind the counter handed us menus and we sat down. After a few minutes we hear \"you ready to order?\" we yell back \"no.\" A few minutes later we were ready and the guy came over to take our order. I went for the tempura upon and my boyfriend ordered the beef udon. We also ordered a spam musubi to share.\n\nThe musubi came out first. It was disappointing. The spam was thin and overcooked. The whole thing was just kinda smooshed down. Not great. Luckily the udon made up for it. Mine came with a huge bowl of noodles, and an even huger bowl of tempura - several shrimps, eggplant, squash, potato, tomato -it was a ton of food. My boyfriend's was loaded with beef and again a large portion. Both came with 2 pieces of some kind of sushi I'm not familiar with, it was rice wrapped up in an eggy pastry-like shell and it was cold. Neither of us cared for that so we just enjoyed the udon. We stuffed ourselves silly with the noodles and tempura, and I loved it.\n\nWhen we were done we just went up to the counter and paid. The guy was very nice, just don't expect a lot of table service. \n\nIt would be nice if they played some music though. When it's only you and one other table sitting in silence it can feel a little awkward. But otherwise this place is great.

We have never ordered anything else, so I can't speak to the broader menu selections, but the sushi... :') We've been to restaurants that have just had \"bad days\" and served abominable sushi, but Ninja has never disappointed us. The nigiri are beauteously prepared, and the variety of rolls offer opportunities for a diversity of palates: sauces, no sauces, spicy, not spicy, crabstick, Krab meat, fried, and unfried. Their use of sauce, whether it's ponzu, spicy mayo, or sriracha, is very well-apportioned and not overwhelming.\n\nWe have spent the last two years ravaging restaurants that offer all-you-can-eat sushi, since the quantity that we put away would cost around $120-150 on the \u00e0 la carte menu. After we discovered Ninja, we never let go. Every experience is rewarding, and the staff are all incredibly friendly and welcoming.\n\nThe caveat to that last sentence, of course, is that you be deserving. Which is true for anything, but a lot of people don't seem to realize it. If you're a rude or self-entitled customer, you're not going to get the same quality of comfort that we do with the staff. This leads us on to the next section... \n\nSERVICE:\n\nSometimes, when it's busy, the quality of service declines. They sold roughly 1,500 Groupons (and counting), which brought in an impossible amount of people. Ninja was, frankly, unprepared for that kind of demand. With three sushi chefs, one of whom doubles as a teppanyaki maestro, the output is understandably limited when it gets that absurd. But honestly, if you walk in to a restaurant that's filled to the brim and you see sushi orders lined up on the bar, you should not expect instantaneous service. The poor reviews that complain about horrible timing and disinterested staff are inaccurate, because they only portray a single viewpoint: that of a slighted patron who felt entitled to magnificent service on a night that was busier than hell. Yes, I obviously won't deny that the service slows down when it's busy, but when it's not, the service is conversely excellent. Therefore -- like ANY restaurant -- the quality of service is dependent on the level of demand.\n\nThe best nights of the week are, predictably, Sunday through Thursday. Friday and Saturday are the most crowded, but it's occasionally hit or miss; we've gone in on Saturdays that were totally empty. There's no telling whether the hoards of dinner-goers will be in the mood for sushi or some other fare at another establishment.\n\nSPECIAL OCCASIONS:\n\nMy fianc\u00e9e and I became engaged when I proposed to her, in Ninja, in October. I talked to the staff, who were enthusiastic about helping me prepare the proper presentation and surprise, and they were wonderful. The engagement ring came out on a sushi boat, and the chef had prepared a special roll - I still don't know what was inside it, but it was fabulous - with each piece in the shape of a little heart. They took a video and pictures for us, with my camera, and are generously hosting my wedding reception there in late December (2012). They've been so accommodating and friendly that we feel warmly welcomed every time we step inside.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nNinja is definitely worth the return trip. If you have expectations of brilliant service, go on a night when those expectations are realistic.", "business_id": "5vgmIwBB48fwo_WC8vGiXA", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-12-18", "type": "review"}

However, I've also now experienced Ninja on pretty much every kind of night, so hopefully I'll be able to write a better overall review. Or at least a longer one. haha!\n\nTo begin, my fianc\u00e9 and I are drawn back again and again not only by the delicious offerings on their AYCE sushi menu (which they have recently updated to include a few more options), but also by the incredibly welcoming and always-helpful chefs and wait-staff. We now know everyone who works there by name, and I'm excited to go back to Ninja on our sushi nights not only because it's freaking yummy but because I'm excited to see everyone again!\n\nI'm actually very confused by all the negative reviews for Ninja on this site. I'm not going to deny that it gets incredibly busy on Friday (and some Saturday) nights lately, most likely due to the sale of an incredible number of Groupons, and that service slows down as a consequence. That IS a fact. However, the people that work here are hardly at fault for the fact that the majority of their customer traffic is concentrated on one or two nights per week. :P The last few Fridays, every single table in the place has been filled up at dinner time, with more and more people lining up at the door, and there are so many sushi menus stretched across the LOOOONG sushi bar that, once spread out, they need to be layered if they're gonna fit. Yes, it gets crazy, but the servers and the chefs really are working as fast as they can. Conversely, on week nights, the place is DEAD. \n\nAs an additional note, my fianc\u00e9 and I bring our own chopsticks when we come, and this is the first place where our waitress has ever washed them for us!\n\noh, and another warning to keep in mind: sometimes the music does get a bit loud. However, if you express displeasure to a server, they're always prompt and ready to turn down the volume. My impression has always been that they honestly care about their customers, and they truly want them to be happy and comfortable.\n\nI've eaten a LOT of sushi in my time, and my fella and I have prowled loads of establishments in the Phoenix area, in Tucson, and in Washington state, and Ninja honestly reigns supreme. We've loved a couple enough to become regulars, but we honestly don't care to go anywhere but Ninja anymore. Tried polyamory and failed. Oh Ninja, you make an honest woman out of me. \n\nOn the topic of the food, nigiri is my personal weakness, and the nigiri here at Ninja is exceptional. The amount of rice that they use is quite conservative, with a proportionally generous slice of melt-in-your-mouth sashimi on top. Further, the pieces are quite dainty compared to what I've been served elsewhere, which makes eating them a much more pleasant experience. And their albacore... They serve their albacore like I've never had it before, topped with minced garlic, scallions, and a light drizzle of ponzu sauce. It's absolutely spectacular, and you MUST order it if you go.\n\nAs for maki, if you like spicy or fried, my fianc\u00e9 swears by the calamari tempura roll. According to him, the spicy sauce is an amazing complement to the overall flavour, and MUCH better than the stuff we've been served at other restaurants. As for myself, my personal favourites are the rainbow roll and the alaskan roll (the latter is one that has been recently added to the AYCE menu, and is basically a california roll topped with salmon, masago, scallions, and ponzu). I personally order it sans masago. \n\nSpeaking of ordering things special, the chefs and wait staff have always been incredibly accommodating when it comes to removing certain ingredients from the rolls. To cite an extreme example, I really enjoy salmon and avocado rolls, but there is unfortunately no such roll offered at Ninja. However, those ARE the ingredients in a Philly roll if you remove the cream cheese, so that's just what I do. It's a little ridiculous because a Philly roll gets its name from the cream cheese, but it doesn't matter: the staff at Ninja are happy to bend the laws of the universe for my sake, and I get my Philly roll without the Philly whenever I go. ;)\n\nWe've brought scads of friends with us to dinner here, and everyone becomes an instant convert and starts bringing THEIR family and THEIR friends. Sure, I might be a bit biased in their favour, but I'm biased for a reason: they've earned my loyalty, over and over again. And besides that, AYCE sushi for $20 is a flipping AMAZING deal -- especially when you consider the quality that Ninja delivers. You don't have to sacrifice quality for quantity in this case.\n\nCan you see why I'm surprised that so many people have had unhappy experiences at Ninja? I really don't get it.", "business_id": "5vgmIwBB48fwo_WC8vGiXA", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-12-18", "type": "review"}

Price is a key setter of expectations, so if you are paying $19.99 for all the sushi (AND sashimi) your hungry little stomach can provide, maybe you shouldn't be expecting the fish to taste like it just got sliced off the coast of japan by Shiro himself.\n\nThat being said, 3 stars is an evening of satisfaction without completely flipping about the amazingness of the food. The price/food ratio is amazing, the service is good and the food itself is very decent. I was not fond of the volcano rolls but my friends swear by it.

The server put on quite a show - spinning and twirling knives right in front of our faces. Wait - I don't remember signing a waiver! Hope he wasn't drinking earlier! So after that he chopped up the meats and did all sorts of hocus pocus and alchemy with sauces and lit flaming fires here and there. He did this one thing he called a \"volcano\" which was onions sliced up and arranged from large rings to small in the shape of a volcano. He lit that sucker up and it went whoosh - singed my nose hairs while I took pictures. He then neatly stacked up all the meats and vegetables and put it on our plates one by one. The show was over. We sat and ate for a bit - our rice actually came pretty late - timing was a little off. So while we gorged on meats and rice the table next to us started getting a little rowdy. Lots and I mean LOTS of alcohol was flowing and there were about 14 folks at the other table. It was somebody's 30-something birthday and somebody even came over with a gong and banged it loud and often enough for me to want to start throwing the teppanyaki items my dining companions couldn't finish at him. I thought their behavior was kinda obnoxious but it's a Saturday night and people party so what the hey? However, the couple that was sitting at our same table couldn't handle it and the man left to pay and leave. This was when the second \"show\" began. The woman stayed behind and started shouting back to all the yelling from the other table. I was half expecting a full-on bar fight with ZZ Top soundtrack and all but this was at a Teppanyaki place with mature adults that although inebriated seemed more or less cultured. About this point I realized that our tablemate was thoroughly and completely toasted. She continued to engage the other table with insults and mockery - this went on for a while. A while later her man came back and sat down frustrated that his drunken gal pal did not leave with him when he paid. Then the other party started to leave and as they did, each female member of the party stopped to face drunken woman and made some comment about kicking drunken woman's arse. One of them looked like she was ready to go right then and there. Drunken woman started raging about how she had 2 assault charges against her and how she wasn't afraid of going to jail again and how it was gonna be just her against 7 bitches and she would kick all their collective asses using some ancient art of bitch fu she learned in Apache Junction. LOL. I figured the women might wait for her outside the restaurant and settle it old school style. Or at least high school style. But there were no sirens going or cop cars waiting in the parking lot as we left the restaurant about ten minutes later. Just as well. That was way more entertainment than I expected. I shoulda known, though. After all, the place is called Ninja Restaurant! Coincidence? Methinks no. Service was more or less decent for how crowded it was. Clientele? A bit rowdy on the Teppanyaki side but a lot more mellow on the sushi side. Your mileage may vary of course. Place is in the same mall as Szechwan Garden and the new Ploy Thai Bistro which took over where T-Spot Ramen used to be. On Alma School halfway between Warner and Elliot on the west side. It's a mall. Lots of parking.", "business_id": "5vgmIwBB48fwo_WC8vGiXA", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-02-04", "type": "review"}

I have not been disappointed yet and I have tried a majority of their raw offerings.\n\nSit at the bar, grab a beer, some cold sake and prepare to have a food-gasm.\n\nTheir happy hour (7-days a week) prices are awesome.  Lots of nigiri, rolls, beer/sake and appetizers to choose from on that menu.  For the best eats, the list to focus on is the board behind the bar.  It has all their weekly specials.  The freshest items they get will be listed up there.  Do not hesitate to try new things.\n\nBonus points about this place is that the owner is Japanese!  Even back east that is a rarity.  Koreans (and even Chinese) own a large percentage of sushi joints.  \n\nThe chefs here are great at just making something unique for you that isn't on the menu.

There are plenty of cheap sushi joints with all you can eat and less than stellar grades of fish.

We shared an order of the shrimp tempura, and I had a California roll and spicy tuna roll and my friend had a Vegas roll and rainbow roll.

They weren't overly busy, but it looked like food was coming out to different tables at different times which seemed strange. My rolls were okay - nothing mind blowing.

Shimogamo was on my list for quite some time and I was happy to stop by late last year!  I really wish that I had gone long before.  This is now my favorite place for sushi in the valley and I keep going back and forth between 4 and 5 stars.  Let's see by the end of the review where I'll leave it.\n\nShimogamo sits in a strip mall at the corner of Warner and Dobson Road, just barely inside of the Chandler city limits.  It share a wall and a door in that wall with a popular DimSum restaurant.  I have assumed that the 2 are sister companies because of the door.  Shimogamo is definitely a modern day sushi/Asian establishment with a modern feel to it.  It can appear kind of cold, but I guess when you're dealing with sushi, you need things to be cold.\n\nNeedless to say, I think that this place is fantastic.  One of the things that I like about Shimogamo is the fact that the quality of the sushi is stellar.  The fish that they use is incredibly fresh.  The sushi that I've tried is unique and creative.  My favorite roll is the Big and Spicy Roll.  It lives up to its name too!  While just spicy enough for me, the smokey oil marinated jalapeno's may be a bit much for others. Since size does matter, this big role is a perfect fit for my appetite!  \n\nI love to eat Black Cod cooked in Japanese restaurants....Amazing delicate and flaky.  Seasoned well and simply delicious!  Shimogamo did not disappoint. \n\nThe service is attentive and professional.  They have a large room in the back from a semi-private dining experience for large groups.\n\nThe best part about Shimogamo is I spend less money here than I do in other sushi establishments in the valley, but I have had a far better experience with respect to flavor, creativity and freshness!\n\nI've decided given the quality of their sushi and the price... this is the best sushi in Phoenix.

Whenever we travel, my husband and I usually make it a point to try and find a good sushi restaurant. The truth is, I no longer want to do that because I am so satisfied with Shimogamo! As funny as that sounds, I know, strange to find sushi of that quality in the desert, but, it's there! \n\nFirst off, this place is ALWAYS busy, if you go on the weekend, you will want to make a reservation for sure. In fact, you usually find a group of Japanese dining in the restaurant (a good sign of authenticity in my book) We've become such regulars, we have developed a nice relationship with the sushi chef and owner. They totally make us things off menu when we ask them too, (we have some favorite Japanese dishes we can find other places, far away, but not here) and they always do, and they make it well! For instance, one time they got in some fresh Sea Robin, we ordered the sashimi and then afterward they went ahead and fried the whole body for us to munch on, so good!!! (something we had seen at a restaurant in Vegas) \n\nSo, what to try? Uni. if uni is your thing, you'll want to get it here. It's always fresh, and AMAZING....if it's not up to par, they won't serve it. (you don't want to eat runny uni, fyi, but you won't find that here) \n\nI never fail to order the Escolar (on the HH menu as well) it comes with a smoked pickled jalape\u00f1o on top, which at times can be really spicy, but sooooooo gooood....that's always a must for sure. \n\nAll of their sashimi is fresh and of the highest quality, and Zach, their head Sushi chef, often brings in fun, fancy ingredients to play with every now and then. (we got baluga caviar on top our uni last time! ) Every now and then he'll get some special fish, such as the sea robbin mentioned above, Spanish mackerel (aji)....etc. In fact, it's good to follow their instagram as they often post what specials they have, and what special ingredients came in for the week (@shimogamoaz)\n\nSome of our favorite plates from the kitchen: absolutely have to get the truffle amberjack.....it's to die for. And we ALWAYS order the beef tongue, it's so good....be sure to dip it in the lemon juice they bring out with it! \n\nAs for service, they are a great bunch of people, but be forewarned, sometimes at their busiest times (think weekend evenings) service can lag a little. But, I think they may have recently hired more help, because the last time we went, there was a new waiter and service was spot on the whole night.\n\nBottom Line: You just can't go wrong with Shimo....", "business_id": "un3KC2gyMrSG6yqjVRctXg", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-02-15", "type": "review"}

Except for the Shimagamo comment which I don't agree...\n\nI DON\"T NEED TO WRITE A REVIEW because he said everything to a T. I could of not gone to a dirtier looking place that I thought I would actually get sick off the cracked wood blocks. Jeremy P. said everything I would of said: EXACTLY. I will cut and past for those who can't find his review, here goes:\n\n\"In how many different ways can you arrange the same ten ingredients?  If this were a contest, Temari would win, hands down.\n\nThis looked like one of the most promising places in a very generic East Valley sushi scene, so we decided to give it a shot.  When I sat down, our eager waiter asked me what I'd like to drink.  I asked him if they only have fountain sodas, and he looked at me like I was speaking Greek.  I said, \"What do you have, bottles?\"  He said they don't have cans or anything; it just comes out of a gun.  So... Fountain sodas then.  Got it.\n\nMy friend said his Mr. Pibb tasted off, and asked to switch to Coke.  He said sure, but he'll have to pay for the Coke.\n\nNow, on to the food.... I looked at the menu.  I saw about three pages of rolls.  I looked at the specials board.  More rolls.  Looked at the regular menu.... Standard Japanese fare.  They have teriyaki.  TERIYAKI!  Who eats teriyaki?  This isn't Samurai Sam's, is it?\n\nThey have some sashimi.  All very standard cuts of fish.  Tuna, white tuna, salmon, yellowtail, sea bass, and mackerel is probably all they had.  Maybe the weakest selection I've seen, well, anywhere.  The nigiri sushi (which I'm pretty sure I heard our waiter pronounce as \"NIGH gi ri\" sushi to the diners at the next table) was pretty standard as well.  Ra has better selection.  Yes, that's right, Ra, one of the most notoriously generic sushi restaurants in the world, has a better selection of fish than Temari!\n\nAnyways, at about six different points while I was looking through the tome they call a \"specials menu\" (which consists of about 99.5% rolls, plus tuna poke), our eager waiter asked us if we know what we would like yet.  Sorry, bro, can't you see I'm reading here!  I'm like half way through!  My eyes are getting tired from reading the words \"spicy tuna,\" \"eel sauce,\" and \"chili sauce\" so much!  Because 75% of the rolls have one of more of those ingredients!\n\nIt was amazing how many different rolls they had, yet how few of them actually sounded appealing.  Most of them seemed to be more focused on sauces and spice than actual fish flavor.  It's like people who eat sushi in Gilbert don't want to taste the awful flavor of fish!  Gross, right!  Fish, ugh!  I pointed out to my friend that one particular roll \"has like three sauces: chili sauce, eel sauce, garlic citrus sauce, and kiwi sauce. Four sauces!\" (imagine the Spanish Inquisition.)\n\nAnyways, about our actual order: we went with the \"chef's choice\" sashimi platter, a romantic roll (cucumber with a bunch of stuff inside), a sunkist roll (some fish completely drowned in citrus flavor), and amaebi and quail egg sushi.  I think \"chef's choice\" means \"cheapest,\" because no real sushi chef would put both tuna and salmon on his own plate if he were picking what he wanted to eat.  The sashimi itself was OK I guess.  The rolls were very boring, as we expected.  The sweet shrimp was good, but you can tell what type of clientele they have when they placed the heads on our table, and the diners at the next table over seemed awestruck by the fact that someone would actually eat a shrimp head, what with those cute little eyeballs staring at them.\n\nThis brings me to the conclusion of this review: this place utterly destroyed our hope of finding a good sushi bar in the East Valley.  Shimogamo was respectable, but even there, the owner was unable to keep the best cuts of fish in stock because he had no confidence his clientele would buy enough of it to keep it fresh.  This is the East Valley.  People think sushi is a bunch of rolls.  You ask an East Valley denizen about their favorite sushi place, and they say, \"I like this place, they have great rolls!\"  Only here can a sushi bar stock just seven cuts of fish, and just offer 500 rolls with the same ten ingredients, and maybe serve some teriyaki chicken for those who REALLY hate sushi, and be successful.\n\nI think we're going to look for the East Valley sushi bar with the lowest yelp rating, because that one is probably the best.  At least they didn't end up charging us for that extra Coke.\n\nAddendum: I was just reminded about the fortune cookie they served with dessert.  A fortune cookie!  At a Japanese Restaurant!  On the back of the fortune it said \"Learn Chinese.\"  Not making this up. \u00ab show less \"\n\nSorry for coping your review BUT I couldn't of said it better!!!!!", "business_id": "Er20nsiOS6TFHmAE717iTA", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-12-12", "type": "review"}
