Then, lo, and behold, Monica, I'm assuming one of the restaurant owners, walked up to us on the sidewalk menu in hand convincing us to come try her restaurant just a few strides away. And convincing she was.  \"Why not?\" we both thought.  She did such a good job giving us a sales pitch, we thought her restaurant deserved a chance tonight.  \n\nWe were ushered inside the small venue to a table very near another couple just finishing dessert and asked about their experience.  The fact that they were happy being there and the fact that there were other patrons was a positive start.  I was so afraid we were going to be ushered into an empty place begging for business but, not so.  There was a steady stream of clientele, most due to Monica's steady persuasion, I'm sure.  \n\nWe started with hummus and pita and a glass each of Greek white and red wine.  Then we ordered lamb and chicken kabob combo and some other greek dishes which came with a decent salad and a side.  Finally, we had to order dessert, knowing full well it would be home made.  The guests nearest us had ordered the Jackie O (as in Onasis) cake and another pastry, which is what Monica recommended to us so that's what we ordered.  It was all pretty good, not stellar, but pretty darned good.  I've definitely had more flavorful kabobs but I did appreciate the family home cooking aspect.   The wine was ok but would rather have ordered off a wine list.  The salad was a nice size and was good.  The Jackie O cake was light and moist -- a hit.  \n\nOne point to know that has been mentioned in other reviews:  the main meal looks to be inexpensive but it will add up quickly.  Everytime Monica looks at you with smiling eyes and asks if you'd like some wine, then ask if you want another glass, or do you want some hummus, and finally if you'd like dessert, you really want to say \"yes\" as if you're at your favorite aunt's house.  But, of course, each of these items comes with a price which you're glad to pay at the end of the meal because of your gracious host's manners and offerings.\n\nI swear that Monica has the best work ethic I've seen in a long time.  From the moment she saw us on the sidewalk, she was in motion from ushering us in, to seating us, to taking our order, to presenting our order, to refilling our water, to cleaning tables next to us, to flagging down more clientele, to making sure we and other clients were satisfied with their meals, to taking our payment.  \n\nOne small humorous note as other reviewers have pointed out:  Ask for directions to the restroom and you'll be ushered through the kitchen, saying hello to the dishwasher and the cook, down the stairs.  I've never experienced that before (probably for good reasons).  But, it was humorous.", "business_id": "PxP19Rb88OQKiSMl2oWNsg", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-04-03", "type": "review"}

Chose this place on purpose as it is basically the first restaurant my husband and I dined in when being put up in a hotel downtown by my company on an apartment hunting weekend.  Now that we know our way around a bit more, decided to revisit.\n\nThis time, no one greeted us upon entering.  There was one other table of diners.  There was a gentleman in the back at the cash register along with a girl and a boy who barely looked old enough to work here.  They might have been family members but I don't know.  No one seemed interested in greeting us at the front of the restaurant so my husband walks back to ask if they are open.  They are.  Finally, the young male leads us to our table with menus.  \n\nWe decide on the baklava sundaes.  They were reasonably priced -- 3.00 each -- and decently flavored.\n\nI just want to say the experience was quite a bit different than the first visit.  The first visit had us excited to try the restaurant, as the woman who worked there (I'm assuming one of the owners) was eager to pull us in from the sidewalk and entice us with her menu offerings.  This time no one was excited to have us as diners and they seemed to wish we weren't there.  Quite a difference in personalities and style.  They need the enthusiasm of the woman we had met before because there certainly were other Greek restaurants nearby with more patrons partaking of their fare.", "business_id": "PxP19Rb88OQKiSMl2oWNsg", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-04-27", "type": "review"}

I asked the concierge for a recommendation for something casual that I could walk alone to at dusk safely and that wasn't a sandwich.  He recommended Christos.  I asked if they had falafel as this is one of my favorites since visiting Israel last year. He assured me they had great falafel. So I set off on a walk. When I arrived I noticed there was no falafel on the menu. But another of my favorites was - pastitsio. I took it to go along with the Jackie Onassis cake. The pastitsio isn't the best one I have had but it was good. It came with salad, rice, and Greek style green beans.  The Jackie Onassis cake was very light and not sweet at all. The cinnamon sprinkled on top was great.", "business_id": "PxP19Rb88OQKiSMl2oWNsg", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-04-27", "type": "review"}

Seeing that he was anxious for business I obliged and took a seat outside. I had the Taramasalata, which I believe was the mashed caviar, which was pretty good but didn't seem much different from Hummus. For my entree I ordered the Roasted Leg of Lamb, which came with a salad, rice pilaf and veggies. The lamb was okay nothing great and the rice I felt was a tad mushy and seemed like either too much water was added or it didn't all evaporate or absorb. The  salad, which I had with anchovies was very good as were the mixed veggies, which seemed to have an authentic flare to it. I also ordered dessert, which was a slice of cake with whipped cream and drizzlings of cinnamon, which was good but nothing special. The service was good as the owner was attentive to my needs. While I ate outside, I did go inside to pay and noted the Greek decor which was appealing.\n\nAll in all, I can tell the owner cares and made a reasonable effort to accommodate me. That said I think this is a nice establishment in an excellent location, but the food needs a step up. It wasn't bad, but there is room for improvement. Here is what I recommend: rice needs to be better prepared and perhaps have some nuts, raisins or garnish added to it, the lamb could be thicker, have the fat and/or tough parts removed and also have a stronger marinade or come with a gravy or sauce for more flavor, and maybe the mashed caviar could be mixed in with some unmashed caviar, which would give it much more flare and appeal.", "business_id": "PxP19Rb88OQKiSMl2oWNsg", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-05-25", "type": "review"}

This tiny little place at the edge of Brookline doesn't look like much, but it has a real family character, cheap eats and tasty food.\n\nI have dined in twice and got carry out twice as well.  The first time I got a platter/dinner, but I found the deal is really to be had with the gyros.  Getting two gyros and a huge amount of fries for only $10 is a steal.  The gyro bread is toasted, but still soft and it is loaded with meat like your grandma would try to feed you.  The veggies have always tasted fresh and it is served hot.  If I could change on thing, I would prefer fresh herbs on the gyro instead of dried.  This gyro is definitely more spiced up than your chain restaurant gyro.  The fries are fresh cut and nothing is cooked until you order it.\n\nIf you choose to dine in, you will be greeted by the proprietor and casually asked to take a seat any where you like.  This isn't the type of place for formalities.  She will offer you some delicious Greek Tea (you have to try it) and take your order, cook it and then serve it to you.  Sometimes you can hear bickering in the kitchen between her and her old man- but that only adds to the family atmosphere.  The store does take credit card, so that's a great modern convenience.  At the end of the meal, we've always gotten a stick of gum :)\n\nIf you choose to carry out, it's a simple call and your food is ready by the time you drive down there.

I haven't had showmars in a couple years and decided to rejuvenate my taste buds since I was craving mediterranean food. My review will be based on my experience at this location:\n\nCons:\n1. Don't expect to find a parking spot at this location, especially during busy lunch hours. \n2. Drive through line is so long it wraps around the entire store, so you may as well just park your car across the street at the CVS and walk over to dine inside.\n3. There will not be enough indoor seating, so expect to have to sit on the outside patio. This may be less tempting in the hot Charlotte summers. \n4. I ordered the gyro platter, it was a mistake! I've never been to a mediterranean place that served my gyro in separate pieces, meaning the pita was separate from my meat. Did I mention there was no veggie for my pita, the picture on there menu looks nothing like the food I got. All I got was a piece of pita by itself and a cup of beef strips. \n\nNeutral:\n1. Wait time, I waited about 10-15 minute for my order...which could be a tad faster seeing it's a fast food chain\n\nPros:\n1. Great dining booths and interior decoration for a fast food joint. seriously, the inside looked like a sit down restaurant, great that they also have patio seating option. \n2. Sanitation score is not bad, 96.5\n3. Their daily specials\n4. Milkshakes are only $2.75 (Did not taste test to see if any good so I cannot comment on quality)\n\nTip:\n-Check the board for their daily specials!! I cannot emphasize this enough. I wish I had just gotten the chicken gyro with fries which was a special going on for the day for just $5.69...The chicken gyro itself is worth $.5.29 already on the regular menu so this is a great deal. They have more than just gyros on special, they also have soup, salad etc.\n-If you want yummy authentic greek food, try greco fresh grille on Rea Rd, 10x better!

The prices are lower than what would be considered 'reasonable' and the service is quick and attentive but not overbearing.\n\nHowever, the REAL reason to visit The Paisley Violin is for the incredible ambiance, whether you sit inside in its darkened labyrinth of art, books, and counter snacks, or outside on its expansive, heavily shaded patio, complete with an artistic fountain and 6 tiny and freshly brightened bungalow houses in a pseudo shopping district right there in their back yard.  According to our server one house will contain a flower shop; one, a bookstore; and the another, a tobacco shop.  The other three are TBD.  It is a brilliant concept, which makes their back patio seem infused with organic commerce and street life, but without being invasive or 'busy'.  I absolutely cannot wait for these places to open, sipping a chai latte with a shot of espresso (my gf's signature drink called a 'dirty chai latte') and gazing at these magnificent store fronts, each painted in a wide palate.  \n\nOne other note: The Paisley Violin is no longer BYOB, as they are awaiting the lead-legs of the city to approve, get this, their LIQUOR LICENSE!  Fans of The Paisley Violin will appreciate that spirits will now be available -- although bringing your own vino to the back patio seemed like one hell of a bargain to rent their space for the evening.  \n\nI am eagerly awaiting when alcohol will be allowed back on the premises because this place will be the gem of downtown.", "business_id": "IceZ4BtTz76eppjNWm-c6A", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-05-04", "type": "review"}

Their vegetable stew was very good with huge chunks of vegetables and a hearty sauce, the peppered raspberry turkey is magic in your mouth, the royal is a wonderful sandwich with roast beef, mozzarella and garlic pepper and the venice violin, with soppressata, pepperoncini, balsamic vinegar and dijon mustard on a baguette is practically inspired. The desserts are good too, but not all house made, we destroyed the baklava, it's highly recommended.\nNow the bad, aside from the place being divey, which isn't bad to me but I know it is to some, is that the parking is kind of a nightmare.

Sometimes the cheese doesnt melt right and its lumpy but the flavor is divine. No boring grill cheese there. The rye adds a lovely added dimension of grilled-cheesiness.\n\nNow for the new, sexier menu, there are a few more veg options. \n\nI had the hummus and salad plate and I was so surprised at the awesome flavor. The hummus was as good as my homemade hummus and the salad is very well done with real lettuce (no nutritionless iceburg here) and fresh veggies and of course, the requisite Zoe's feta cheese. The cucumber Raita was just the right touch. \n\nSoooooo tasty!\n\nNow I'm not a fan of any of their sides, till now. The Braised white beans are a dream. I dont know what spices they used (ginger maybe?) but I couldnt believe my tastebuds. So proud of Zoe's.\n\nTwo notable changes:\n\n1)There is now a separate charge to grill the Pimento cheese sandwich (10 cents - really????) in addition to the 22 cent price hike.\n\n2) Chips no longer come with the sandwiches but are an extra 65 cents.

Help-yourself complimentary coffee and tea counter, with shakers of Splenda available to those inclined to use them- nice touches!  Their breakfast menu sounded very tempting, but the man behind the counter told me that the delivery guy with the eggs wouldn't be in for another 10 minutes or so (Feta omelette, anyone?).  I decided we'd try the Friday fish special of grilled tilapia over salad and a gyro pita with a side salad, extra feta.  I did not enjoy eating the tilapia as it would magically crumble into tiny pieces the moment I cut it with a fork or a knife.  Very annoying!  Besides this, the whole dish tasted very bland since I opted to forgo the housemade vinaigrette (contained allergens); Thankfully, the extra feta (LOVE feta!) salvaged the dish and I was able to down the fish even without the use of a spoon, of which I was constantly wishing would be on hand.  The gyro pita was a much tastier experience, although Mom did not like the meat.  Truth be told, this could not compare with the meat in the gyro dinner I just had a few nights before at MBFGR, but for the price (around $6), it made for a quick and satisfying lunch (and the extra feta in the pita didn't hurt, either)!  While the gyro is not made in-house, AE does have it shipped in three times a week from Chicago, so I was told by the man behind the counter.\n\nBaklava looked awesome, but I couldn't try it since it contained an allergen, but no worries since any item offered here would be fulfiiling enough!", "business_id": "odhXwWaYZvD_icIN6f_DbA", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-04-07", "type": "review"}

Let's try the dark and secluded Mediterranean House!\n\nSurprise! This Greek restaurant is owned by a Korean lady named Suki! What a combo! I asked her why she didn't open a Korean restaurant because you can charge up to $16 for BulGogi or Galbi. I guess she just wanted to try something different.\n\nFor starters we tried the Combination Platter which consisted of Hummus, Babaghanoush, and Falafel Balls with Pita Bread. \n\nI warned my friend, and any person reading this review, that Greek cooking combines herbs unlike no other country in Europe. You have to like the flavor of oregano, mint, garlic, onion, dill and bay leaves, basil, thyme, and grape leaves. Feta (Goat) Cheese is used often in their salads. And their desserts are characterized by the use of nuts and honey.\n\nSuki could tell by my friend's facial expressions that Greek spices were not to his liking; she recommended the Cairo Special as an entree - Egyptian Chicken and Mediterranean Beef combination. The Egyptian Chicken was slightly overcooked, but had a sweet aftertaste which was interesting. The Mediterranean Beef was excellent.\n\nI ordered the Lamb Shish Kabob - which consisted of two big skewers filled with gigantic pieces of Lamb, Onions, Green Peppers and Tomatoes! The Lamb was the tenderest I had in years - EXCELLENT! Of course, you have to like Lamb...\n\nFor dessert my friend had the Cheesecake - unfortunately store bought. I had the Baklava, which was delicate and light, with two small cups of Turkish Coffee! The coffee was not as strong as coffee I had in Europe, but is probably the best in Phoenix. (When you drink Turkish Coffee... Stir the coffee OFTEN! Grounds from the coffee will settle to the bottom if you don't... then you'll be drinking Turkish Mud! And stir in about 2-3 teaspoons of sugar, which makes it taste GOOD! I know you're going to say \"that much sugar!\" when you see such a small cup... trust me! When I was in Europe, my friends would often take me to breakfast establishments that would serve Turkish Coffee.

Hadn't even opened the door yet.  When we entered we were greeted by the owner with a hand shake and were seated near the dance floor.  We noticed there were large parties of ten or more at the tables.  It was kind of like a banquet hall from the 70's-80's.  Our waiter was a young guy who sold us on a Greek beer.  It was called Marathon and it was decent.  I ordered the meat balls to start, a Greek salad, and the moussaka.  While waiting for our food we were entertained by the band and a belly dancer.  She was a lot of fun and got the crowd to shake shake shake.  There was a birthday party happening and everyone in the party was given a plate to break.  The plates were smashed in the middle of the dance floor and a circle dance  was started around the mess.  The food was okay.  The party atmosphere at Bacchanal can not be beat though.

If you plan on pacing your meal out longer than 30 min or so, you might end up with a soar rump at the end of your visit.\n\nThey are not located in a great part of town and you could easily miss them if you weren't looking for them. On the south side of thomas just east of 30th street by a few feet. \n\nThe food was neither good nor bad. The greek salads were good and the pita bread they bring was great. I ordered a gyro platter and the gyro meat was not shaved off the spit like one might expect, but it seemed to be more like thin pieces of meat fried in a pan on their stove top. My guess is because they don't do a high enough volume that an entire cone of gyro would be too wasteful - although I could be wrong. Either way, ive had much better gyro from other establishments.\n\nIf you're looking for better mediterranean food I would recommend cypres grill over on camelback, just next to the trader joes. I can't attest to the atmosphere much, because when we were there on a friday (maybe it was saturday) around 6pm, we were litterally the-only-people-there.

My parents had nothing nice to say, but for me it was the greatest. I was 12 years old and not paying for it, which might be the difference. It has apparently not changed in that many years.\nI went on a Tuesday evening with a fiend of mine for what was to be a three hour long ordeal, not because we were having a laid back, relaxing dinner, but because the restaurant could not handle being \"slammed\" on a weeknight. The truth is that there was a group (who had made a reservation) and one other table when we walked in. Even when the group had gone and we were left there all on our own, the service was horrendous.\nThe hummus was alright, but we were charged for the accompanying pita. I thought, given the price of the entrees, the pita could have been included.\nI ordered the swordfish and a friend ordered lamb, I think. They were out of both. I ended up with the salmon and she had the steak. While she enjoyed her steak, I feel like I could have had better salmon in my own kitchen. It was overly spiced, and drowned in sauce. There was no taste of salmon to be found.\nThe desert was not as great as I remembered, but they sure are pretty. We had the galatabouriko, my favorite. We also chose a fig desert, which was a little grainy.\nThe whole ordeal came to about $90 plus tip. Usually a good tipper, I left an appallingly low tip to make a point.\nOccupying the only table in the restaurant, we should have had better service. Toward the end it seemed like a joke. We stared at the owner and waiter waiting for the check, and then had to wait another twenty minutes for them to pick it up before we finally went up to the front to pay ourselves.\nI won't be back. I won't tell other people to go.\nThe atmosphere was nice, but they seriously need to improve the quality of the food and the service before they can charge the amount they do.\nThe two stars I left were for my friend's meal, the physical ambiance, and nostalgia, along with my hopes that the owner will read this review and improve the restaurant.", "business_id": "KLaxBc83JnxyGf7GP7enYA", "stars": 2, "date": "2008-05-08", "type": "review"}

The restaurant is located in the Town & Country plaza, next to Trader Joe's. It's a pleasant enough atmosphere, with a small dining room and plenty of outdoor seating. The waitstaff can be hit and miss, but I've never had anything less than acceptable service. \n\nYou have to try the greek fries!!! They are amazing-- with this zesty lemon sauce and feta cheese. Pure heaven! I can dream of nothing else now. The rest of the food is always good. I wouldn't say \"amazing,\" but definately healthy, light and filling. The veggies in the greek salad are always fresh, and the meat tastes slow grilled-- nice and tender. This is a great place to go when you are looking for a laid back meal any time of the day.\n\nUPDATE: I've upped to to 5 stars. Today I tried their white peach sangria. Yes, folks-- they have sangria. Two kinds, I might add. It's heavenly. Go there! Now!

They are French fries smothered in feta cheese and seasonings. If you like feta cheese and fries separately you are going to fall in love with the combination!!

Service was a little slow at first but was acknowledged and apologized for immediately. (To apologize our server brought us a piece of this cake at the end of our meal. It's not on the menu, I'm not sure what it was. It was topped with Phyllo dough and honey and the cake part was kinda like a cheesecake but not, it was a different texture, lemony with lemon rind in it and not very sweet but it was VERY good. I quite enjoyed it. Perfect way to end the meal.\nNow to rewind and go back to the start, we had a couple appetizers. We started with the Bruschetta - $3.95 and the Veggie Combo - $10.95 The bruschetta was incredible! I could have made that my meal.\nThe veggie combo was also just as good, BUT I have to say this: For those who don't know, Spanakopita is Phyllo dough filled with spinach, onion and feta cheese. \"Spanaki\" in greek means spinach. There was NO spinach or onion on this. Just Phyllo and cheese. It was still so, SO good, I mean you can't go wrong with cheese and dough right? But I wanted spinach and onion! The falafel looked like a hush puppy from Long John Silvers, but was a hundred times better.\nFor my entree I had the Lamb Souvlaki Dinner - $12.95. So tasty, perfectly cooked and seasoned.  mmmmmmmmmmmmmm.\nOh note to the staff. When it's night and people are sitting on the patio, light a candle and turn on your decorative outdoor lights.

So there we were Sunday night in great need of sustenance. We had a choice between the new Grassroots place & this one. I saw the sign out front for their special that night, a feta burger. The lady said fine with me, I've had their chicken souvlaki & it was good. Alas we have found refuge on this long day of errands & chores.\n\nTo take the edge off I ordered a sangria. It was fine. The prices were very affordable so I didn't expect anything heavenly. Just honest food for an honest price.\n\nThe food came & looked fine. I took a bite of the burger & it was very dry. I had a few fries which were good. After seeing the Misses dissect her chicken souvlaki & placing a piece of undercooked chicken on the spare plate between us I noticed something was just not right here. I opened the bun on my burger. What I saw was fresh lettuce, tomato & a mediocre bun...but it was the burger took me back in time to when I was in 3rd grade in the cafeteria sitting next to my buddy Jimmy. It was about half a centimeter thin & could potentially have many uses as a coaster, a mini Frisbee, an eye patch, heat shield tiles on the next shuttle to Mars, skeet shooting - altho I recommend a 12 gauge to take this thing down. \n\nThe misses noticed the dazed look on my face and says, \"Honey?\"\n\n\"Yeah Jimmy, what's up?\" I reply..\n\nShe gave me that look & I snapped back into reality but was still in disbelief at this burger patty. I ate 2 bites & left it dismantled. I finished my fries & her charred chicken. The raw portion of her chicken ruined it for her. She ate her rice & salad, which were good.\n\nThe server was very nice & I told her what I thought of the food. I think this was the first place I've ever complained about the food at a restaurant, I just never go back. This meal was.....just very insulting. I am not an 8 year old kid anymore!\n\nIn hindsight I thought, maybe I was partially to blame ordering a burger at a Mediterranean joint but c'mon, it was the special that night!\n\nThe server seemed surprised when I showed her the brown disc. She informed me they ran out of fresh ground beef so I got a frozen one. Shame. I truly hope the next time this happens they just 86 their special & not serve garbage. I've had a better burger at a hospital at 3am. \n\nWe will not be back.\n\nPs. Jimmy, I miss you bro :(", "business_id": "Rg3INE2p4zQYvfMvJduEOQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-03-16", "type": "review"}
