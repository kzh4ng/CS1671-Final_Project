The orange sign that looked like it belonged to a construction company that said, \"Ice Cream in 500 ft.\"  Points for originality and tenacity.  \n\nFor my first visit, I ordered the following:\n\nApple Dumpling Sundae\nVanilla Ice Cream with chocolate sauce\n\nThe associates were nice and quick and I enjoyed my apply dumpling sundae.  It wasn't too sweet and had really good apple and cinnamon flavor.  I really liked the dichotomy and juxtaposition of the hot of the apples against the cold of the ice cream.  \n\nA true testament to their popularity is the fact that they still have patrons awaiting their fare when it is 50 degrees outside.

Entering was kind of a wonderment initially, scoping out a somewhat back-in-time feel and appearance, with shelves of old style candies and gums for sale, a menu board with a handful of varieties of ice creams, sundaes and other concoctions available for somewhat reasonable prices. And the Terrazzo floors are pristine and gorgeous. \n\nThe decor is mostly original old soda fountain, with original shelves and display cases, beautiful marble tables and wooden booths, and original snack counter, vintage blenders, etc.\n\nI ordered a double espresso and my friend ordered a coffee, and I do have to say kudos for knowing how to properly fill a double shot demitasse. The espresso was a little on the sour side, but good enough for what I expected at an ice cream store.\n\nI think that what could make this place fantastic would be eliminating the 'youth' from the employee team, or at least replacing them with folks who had a clue what that era represents, and how to recreate it, or, at the very, VERY least, educating the youth on what it was like, and how to recreate it.\n\nWhen I'm sitting at a vintage marble table, sipping espresso from a demitasse, I'm a bit thrown off by hipster music coming from a Pandora box, and a service staff that looks like they just came to work directly from the Urban charter school, dressed like silly high school kids.\n\nI sampled the ice cream, the death by chocolate...and although it tasted 'ok', hearing the story that this old fashioned ice cream parlor bought their ice creams from Penn State Creamery, and did not make their own, well, that was about as 'authentic' as the Necco company candy reproductions being sold to 'look' vintage, but all of which were really just watered down versions of the originals.\n\nThis place could be so much more than it is, a true destination, if the 'theming' was carried through in a more careful and thoughtful manner. Turn off the hipster tunes, and put on some big band or old fashioned malt shop tunes. Try a nice crisp uniform instead of saggy (or skinny) jeans with a sloppy looking over shirt or T-shirt. \n\nWhat should be a very cool and warm, inviting atmosphere plays off as a little cold and sadly weathered.\n\nCreate a few more aspects of the true old fashioned malt shop, ice cream parlour and lunch counter, instead of a 'trendy' collection of outside sourced lunch options, and the run of the mill sundae collection, simply renamed to be 'cool'. Throw in a kitchen sink challenge, maybe some home made baked good...\n\nIt's a very cool little building and spot...with SO much potential. \n\nIn South Florida is a place called Jaxson's...this place ALWAYS had a line so far out the door that they'd hire a keyboardist to play in the parking lot to keep people entertained while waiting, and they'd pass popcorn out to the waiting line.  They also had the vintage candy shelves, and you could truly find ANYTHING still made. Their ice creams were all made in house, and they would have bells and whistles going off if you ate the whole 'Kitchen Sink', or similar creation. They had a nice simple kitschy line of 'real' meals, to accompany the ice cream\n\nTHIS was a 'destination', not just an after thought.  And this is what Klavon's SHOULD strive to be.", "business_id": "kj3qws3WSMgOotUeACSdFA", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-11-08", "type": "review"}

It was melted within 10 minutes and the cone was from the previous night as they pulled it off the holder. I used to work at Brusters and we would make cones ahead of time so they would be fresh.

I didn't add anything to my tea, but condiments and napkins can be found across from the barista's stand where you order.  I also wanted a snack, so I decided to get a potato chip cookie, since (1) it looked the most appealing and (2) it sounded interesting!  It was saltier and crispier than a regular cookie, but was still also sweet, and had a drizzle of chocolate icing on the top.  While I liked the sweet-salty combination, I would have preferred for it to have been a bit sweeter to offset the extra salt--if there had been more icing, it would have been perfect.  It was definitely different and interesting, and worth a try, though!\n\nBefore I ordered, I overheard the barista saying to other customers that she didn't know where the baked goods that they sell come from, which didn't sit well with me.

Enjoy our Arizona Diversity\n\nHave you ever eaten a Frozfruit bar?  That is a Paleta Michoacana.  Those bars were made in Michoacan Mexico long before they met the Blue Bunny.  Some paletas beat the bunny easily.  Does your neighborhood have a Mexican (legal of course) vendor pushing a freezer chest on wheels?  They are making their $50.00 or less a day selling paletas and other frozen delights.  Coconut, one of the most delicious flavors, will keep your brain from unraveling like mine is.  Eat them early in life and often.  \n\nWhen I was 15, I had one of the most anxious nights of my life. Maria Fraga invited me to her Quinceanera.  A six syllable word I'd never heard or seen before I got the invitation.  The only question I asked was should I dress up?  My best at the time were some black chino pants I'd grown through, three inches above the shoes on my white-socked feet.  I also had a white shirt, also recently miniaturized.  I did have a tie, a one-inch wide bright green iridescent one I really liked because the color reminded me of a green tree snake.  \n\nEquivalent words in English to Quinceanera is Debutante Ball.  Parents save from the day a girl is born, there's a formal coming of age mass, everybody's in a gown or tux, and there's a giant ball at a rented hall.  Being some some flavor of Protestant, I didn't attend the mass.  I was dropped off at the rocking hard ball with the live band.  I was the only white guy.  I did not know how to dance.  My clothes were too small, my tie glowed in the dark and 100 people were dressed To The 9's.  Plus, cool Santos Ortiz was out in the crowd, dancing sua-ve with all the girls.  I did find Gilbert, dressed a little better than me.  We hung out making small talk in a dark corner.  I left within an hour.  \n\nThe night I met Cesar Chavez felt the same.  I was one of four white kids and one adult in a sea of migrant workers, nobody apparently speaking English,  The green chile, frijoles and home made tortillas nothing like the tacos my Queens New York Mom and Kansas City Dad whipped up for all the hungry kids.  \n\nIf cross-cultural situations like the above or even the potential to step into another culture freak you out, I'm here to tell you it's totally survivable.        \n\nLa Michoacana is a great place to dip your toes in the water.  I've seen it walking up and down 16th Street, but never went in.  The outside has a sleek traditional Mexican exterior, the inside is Mexico.  My stop was for water and an investigation.  I found an inviting, artful interior I was not allowed to take pictures in.  Mural copyright or something I suppose.  \n\nFood is served, shave ice is served, plus a variety of raspados, which you should try.  Fresas con Crema, fresh strawberries in cream will shoot your socks to the other end of the room.  The water was excellent, saving me from a dehydrated afternoon on the mean streets of Tempe.  I'm definitely going back.  I'll report more.", "business_id": "9pYBiLe3k5Gi-AJqRklXcQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-11-04", "type": "review"}

I have been to this DQ several times with minimal complaint. It is small and seating is limited but that never really bothered me. Today I brought my daughter and we purchased ice cream and food and the cashier told me the bill total was $8.00 even. I gave him my credit card and he ran it. At first I didn't think he was going to give me a receipt. I guess they just have a slow credit card machine.  He finally handed me the credit card receipt, not the actual receipt the cash register produces and I noticed that the card had been swiped for $10.00. At first I thought maybe there was a fee for using a credit/debit card and next I thought, wow, that's ridiculous. When he delivered the food, I asked him why the bill was $8 and the receipt showed my card had been charged $10 and he said, \"oh\" and walked back the register and instantly popped the drawer open, took out $2 and ripped the receipt off and walked over to me. He showed me the total and said, \"you were right\" and handed me the $2. Umm....ok. So basically, my advice is to watch your receipts very closely, ask for both copies, the credit card and the register one, and maybe even pay with cash cuz last time I checked the 8 and the 10 weren't \"next to each other\" on a keyboard and I am not sure there's a plausible excuse for this accidentally happening. I am thinking that that employee thinks he's running some kind of scam where he skims a couple bucks off every credit card transaction and pockets the extra money at the end of the day and that's some bullsh*t. I will be contacting the store directly tomorrow to voice my concerns with their manager although maybe he or she's in on it too.

I must admit I check weekly because I can't miss out on those three flavors ( I have a half-gallon of Cheesecake in my freezer right now). If you are looking to depart from the usual ice cream destination....Luv-It is your place!!\nAnd if you are bored/or feel guilty for being gluttonous and feel the need to work off that calorie-filled adventure, walk right next door to Olympic Garden. The arm exercises that you can do by pulling out all those dollar bills at the strip club I'm sure could work off at least a small serving of this frozen goodness!!", "business_id": "uYVdp5LfCbX8S8ytnhdk-g", "stars": 5, "date": "2007-09-08", "type": "review"}

Unfortunately, the newscast was about the minor character actress from \"The Office\" who had complained that the business was in a ghetto area, but my now intense longing for the custard I had let slip away overwhelmed my common sense and I just had to go!\n\nLet's just say that arriving here just after dusk was a huge mistake.  There were no people outside, except for a few guys that were suspiciously loitering halfway between this place and the neighboring liquor store.. so I drove off and came back about 20 minutes later to find several people enjoying custard and finally feeling secure enough to leave my car.  Being a seasonal-flavor junkie, I was pleasantly surprised to find Pumpkin as one of my choices, and adding the Western sundae toppings (hot caramel, hot fudge, pecans) was a nice compliment to the extremely smooth, tasty custard below!\n\nI think the food was well worth the drive to North Vegas, and I would also recommend this place highly because the owner was very nice.

I am sure not much of a secret to some who shares my love for \"Luv-It Frozen Custard\"!! \n\n\"Luv-It Frozen Custard\" has been around long before the nearby hotels were built. Matter of a fact: 37 years! This is a popular go-to place for locals but tourists are not so much aware of it, although surely some knows about it but keep it to themselves.\n\nLast night I ventured out there for it. I had the \"Luv-It Special\". I have been ordering \"The Western Special\" before. I love chocolate and that's what it is but last night I tried the \"Luv-It Special\" and it's a new favorite! It has the frozen custard which is made of eggs and milk, pecans, marshmallow, strawberries and cherry. I had hot chocolate fudge and bananas added to it for my very own \"luv-it mine\"...lol. Funny, Greg Tiedemann, the owner who served me (and i would guess everyone else at the window) had to stop and think before he made my order, but he said he like my combination. (Check out my photos). Know what, I can't have my frozeeee custeee without chocolateeee. The moment I had my hands on my special order and savored it, I was in heaaaavennn....so coool ,so goood, I was on highhhh LOL\n\nFor more info, \"Luv-It Frozen Custard\" is located in the not-so-good downtown area of Las Vegas on the northern \"Strip\". There is this small rather cute retro-looking building structure situated in a parking lot with a sign that screaaaams \"Love\" because it's in red with a heart on a white background. Now if that's not making my heart beat fast, what else? Look up toward the business' sign and looming behind it is the Stratosphere tower. If you are lucky, you won't have to wait in line. Just walk up to the window to order from a board list posting of a variety of frozen custard choices with various ingredients from nuts to berries, to fruits, to fudge, to chocolate, sundaes, malts, shakes, frozen bananas, whips, luv sticks. \"The Banana Split Special\" is on the menu list which is another of my favorite to order. The moment  you get your order, you wouldn't think of anything else while you savor the frozen custard of your choice... seat not needed. Mmmmm...Just coooool up and live it up!

The prices are a little higher, the custard has a little less flavor, the neighborhood is a lot less family-friendly--last time I was there a guy came up to my car asking for money to buy his suicidal friend a beer--but examined in its own right, Luv-It is still pretty great. The custard is creamy and good, and the experience itself is worth it.

I've been there a few times after 9 pm and the shop ran out of most of its flavors, leaving me with chocolate and vanilla to choose from.  That's a little annoying.

The location is a wee bit off the strip and the appearance of the establishment might be a little inconspicuous, but the deliciousness that is frozen custard makes it worth it to make the trip. This was one of the many highlights on my recent trip to Vegas.\n\nThere were four flavors to pick from and we got to taste a sample of the Almond Chip. This flavor had a good taste without having too much almond flavor and there were real chocolate chips mixed in. My friend who recommended the place suggested Vanilla over Almond Chip. So I took her word for it and got a single scoop of Vanilla. After that first bite I was glad I listened to my friend. You can't tell that it's custard and it tastes like ice cream. The texture is a little creamier and it doesn't melt that fast. It's the perfect consistency between yogurt, gelato, and ice cream. The single scoop was enough to hit the spot, but not make me feel like it was too much.\n\nI think the man who served us was the owner... he may come off as a little serious at first, but he provided nice service. Next time I'm in Vegas I would probably venture out to make a stop here again.", "business_id": "uYVdp5LfCbX8S8ytnhdk-g", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-11-21", "type": "review"}
