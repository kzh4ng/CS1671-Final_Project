I was surprised to see that there were only two other tables. The restaurant was dark and provided little in the way of ambiance. For $10, the sushi lunch special included salad, miso soup, 5 pieces of sushi along with a salmon roll and green tea. As far as how much you got for the money, it was a good deal.  On the negative side, the sushi was quite average, both in terms of taste and freshness.  Little Tokyo, which is located on Washington Rd. in Mt Lebanon (about 5 minutes away) has higher quality sushi, although it's a little bit pricier.

Avocado is like banana. They get brown very easily and we cut that yesterday.\" WHAT?!? They did bring me another batch (that was part brown, part green) but it was too late. This was my first sushi restaurant EVER that we left half the rolls on the plate uneaten. Since we were all still hungry, my daughter picked up the table tent listing all the desserts. Yuck! Filthy.

Sooo... if you're a fan of Teppanyaki, this review may ring familiar. If you've not done Teppan style before... consider this a sort of \"what to look for\" primer.\n\nThere were five of us, sharing our table with a very nice young, near-newlywed couple; May 2010. Our table wait time, without a reservation, was about 35 minutes or so. (maybe they were waiting for a newlywed couple to join us?). And what lengthened the wait was the understaffed bar. We waited nearly 10 minutes to see a bar-server, and another 15 minutes to get our drink order. While everyone was friendly and apologetic, even apologies get old when they're used to salve away exceedingly slow service. Maybe the reason they appear to be busy, even on a Wednesday night.......? They had an abundance of tables celebrating \"Birthdays.\" I'd guess I listened to at least twelve renditions of \"Happy Birthday\", sung by the \"Greentree-Benihana-Bday Choir!\" (Oi vay...... next time I'm bringing earplugs!)   :-))\n\nMy impression? This is Pittsburgh; not my destination for \"great Japanese cuisine.\" So while this fine city certainly has some excellent eateries, when it comes to chain or franchised restaurants, you have to compare each location to the balance of their nation-wide organization. And having eaten at Teppan style restaurants for many years, and many Benihanas, I'd have to grade this particular location in the \"C\" range; very average.\n\nBefore we were seated, and while we were waiting in the bar, I spied the dining room. It appeared all the chefs were slow, seemingly ackward with their knives. And almost comically so. One Anglo chef, (no offense to Scandinavians that dream of becoming a Teppan-Guru), well, this guy looked like it was his first night, cutting off the shrimp tails...... almost one at a time, and still having a problem!? I think you get the idea. I've seen some Teppan-knife wielders, line up the shrimp and with one long swipe... de-tail-a-fy 30 with one stroke! Not here... some of the chefs may be on \"beginner knife-speed restriction?\"\n\nAs one reviewer mentioned; \"...it depends on which chef you get at your table.\" And with Teppanyaki style restaurants, and especially Benihanas, it's very true. It shouldn't be like that, but here in Greentree, and the evening we went, (Wednesday night around 630p), it was like going to a \"Barber College\" to get a free haircut, and trying to figure out how to judge the best out of a group of \"beginners.\" Our chef was possibly the best of the crowd, (sounds like... \"You have to go to my doctor, he's the best!\"), but if compared to all the Benihanas I've visited, he too would be a C to C- level; maybe a \"brown belt\" in marshall arts vernacular? He did the \"flip shrimp tail into the hat and pocket trick\"..... finally making it on the third try. But he did smile throughout the demo. (A good attitude is worth allot in my book.)\n\nThe food? Pretty good. Essentially, we ordered \"everything on the right side of the menu\"... mainly because I was treating my customer service staff... the greatest asset I have for my sales region. And because one of them had never Teppanyak-eed, I made sure we tried everything! Sushi, lobster, filet steak, scallops, shrimp, calamari, chicken..... well, you get the idea. What with the added rice and vegetables, it was a \"belly-busting-feast.\" And again, because of the great company, we had a wonderful time.\n\nSo overall, I gave this restaurant 3-stars. It was the total experience. The food was good, and more important, the company was great. But as you can see from my comments, I felt like this particular Benihanas location was struggling to meet the corporate concept; trying to do it with Pittsburgh locals who, from the hosts to the bartending staff, to the chef and server staff, just seemed like misfits. Had this been a \"Lone Star Steakhouse\", or a \"Fridays\", I'd have felt everything fitted just right.", "business_id": "1vQLTKwmcmZXtNzfKEvMmA", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-10-09", "type": "review"}

He had been some years back before, and this was my first time. Getting to the actual restaurant was a bit weird because of how you have to navigate the mountain (I don't know, is that considered a mountain, or is it a hill? Being from the south everything that makes me lift my legs/feet higher is a mountain). It was rather empty as it was only like 11.30AM, but that was ok with us as we're not a big fan of people (joke ... maybe). The interior is ridiculously awesome, especially the raised bar.\n\nOur chef walks up and it's a white man, which was a definite first for me at a Japanese steakhouse. And he seemed out of it. During the course of the meal, he did inform us that he was hungover ... it's Labor Day, what're gonna do? It didn't bother me too much, but I think he did annoy the hell out of my boyfriend lol. He told some good albeit corny jokes, did the usual tricks plus a few new ones - he was overall entertaining.\n\nThe food: oh man, was it yummy. I got the soba noodles and beef julienne. The noodles were cooked in some type of sauce that I couldn't describe, but they were the best soba noodles I have ever had. The beef julienne was also super delicious. The sauce on it was described as a teriyaki sauce, but it didn't taste like it at all to me, which was fine with me because I'm not a big teriyaki fan. \n\nAfter eating we hit the bar and had drink apiece. The bartender was really cool and the bar area had a great vibe and atmosphere.

He didn't bother to have the guy heat it more, b/c it would have just been a hassle.  The chef forgot one friends meal completely and got rude with the server.  Then after everything was cooked, he looked at me and asked did you eat all your shrimp. I replied \"no, you never served me any.\" (I had ordered the chicken and shrimp.)  He then sends the server back into the kitchen to get more. By the time they were cooked, everyone was finished eating.  Come on.

The miso cod makes me weep with its awesomeness, but does take some extra time to make, so warn them if you are in a hurry.\n\nA good deal (for them) is to get rolls made into handrolls. So handrolls are about $5-7/roll, but pretty filling. Eat them as soon as you get them, because they toast the seaweed. So good! My husband gets spicy tuna handrolls and I get salmon/avocado handrolls.\n\nThe downside is that it is VERY pricey and the portions are small. If I could give this place a 4.5 stars for the portion size, I would.\n\nThe waitstaff are funny and attentive. At least, we seem to keep getting the same guy, and he recognizes us and laughs at us when we order a ton of handrolls.\n\nI'm not keen on the tatami area--it's neither that comfortable nor a true tatami area, and it seems like a huge pain for the waitstaff to have to bend like that--but the setting itself is tranquil and lovely.\n\nReservations highly recommended. They do not do take-out because it ruins the quality of the food.\n\nYou can get desserts off the Soba menu downstairs. They are pretty uniformly tasty, ranging from super-sweet to barely sweet.

I thoroughly enjoyed Umi and really want to give it five stars, but I had to deduct one because of the \"would I go back\" factor. \n\nHere's what you need to know: \n- The food is amazing.   I had the rock shrimp and the sushi dinner.   Every bite was amazing.   The sushi was super fresh and the inventive little touches of sauce, herb, etc. were bright and flavorful.  The rock shrimp were perfectly done with just a touch of spice.   The ginger dressing was awesome and even the soup seemed a little superior.   \n- The service is amazing.  Darryl was delightful.  Attentive, friendly, professional, and informative.  He took his time explaining the menu and making recommendations.  At the end of the meal, he refilled water glasses without a word while we lingered just a bit (it wasn't busy).   \n- The atmosphere is amazing.  It has an authentic feel and with nice accents and dim lighting to set the mood.  \n- The prices are INSANE.  Picture a \"normal\" sushi restaurant, then cut the portions in half and double the prices - that's basically what you have here.  The food was fantastic, don't get me wrong, but I disagree with the reviews that say it's worth the money.   It's just not.   Nigiri is $5-$8 per piece (very small pieces - easily one bite).  Maki goes all the way up to $27 for a rainbow roll or dragon roll, which are both pretty small for that price tag.  Entrees are also small portions and only a handful of them come with the soup and salad to round out the meal.  The omakase tasting menus range from $90-$130 per person.  Overall, expect to spend 3-4 times the amount that you'd normally spend on a good sushi dinner that won't leave you wanting a snack on the way home.  I just can't justify it.     \n- They offer valet parking in the lot, but then it's a trek up two long flights of stairs - not for the elderly or injured, for sure.   \n\nAll in all, I had an amazing meal and loved the atmosphere, but this place is crazy overpriced to the point that I wouldn't return.", "business_id": "Cy9XgM3ZG2jZ1ganvolb6Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-09-18", "type": "review"}

If you are new to sushi or the Japanese culture, this will not be the restaurant for you. \n\nJapanese style means that when you need a drink refill or want to order something extra, you must wave down the waiters as is the culture in Japan. Americans and we southerner's especially, are not used to this type of service. This is why most of the people that eat in this restaurant are Japanese. If you eat lunch between 1-2PM you will have better service.\n\nThe food is also VERY Japanese. The emphasis is on the fresh fish and the rice. If you are not accustomed to Japanese food, then you may want a non-Japanese sushi bar like Sushi-101 (Mexican made) or Rusan's (Indonesian made) or several others in Charlotte which are Chinese. You will find many varieties of fried sushi with sugary mayo in these locations if that's your idea of sushi.\n\nI have eaten here every week for years. It is a small restaurant with basic rolls. They are very consistent and the food is always excellent. I have never gotten \"brown wasabe\" or fish that I didn't know what it was. The Bento boxes at lunch are excellent with 2 pieces of big roll, a maki roll, soup, salad and usually a bit of seafood salad for about $8.\n\nI have eaten at many Japanese style restaurants and must admit it has taken me a while to understand their culture. Now that I have explained it to you, maybe you will be able to enjoy Musashi's great food. If great service is most important to you, find a culture that is known for that like the Thai people at Thai House.", "business_id": "Y_OeiGhTm6ZEfZ1UQgM_wA", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-11-26", "type": "review"}

Curry katsu! There is hope for the Charlotte Asian dining scene! \n\nYes, the previous reviews are spot on-- authentic Japanese (minus the obligatory California roll and special sushi rolls) in a super charming space (Don't be thrown off by it's location next to the Little Caesars.) with friendly family-run service.)\n\nThis place is packed with fellow Asians (not the speed-racing kind like Ru San's) which is always a good sign.  \n\nTIP: Get the lunch special A or B.  You'll see examples of A and B at the front of the restaurant.  The special is $8 and is plenty of food.  (Last time, it was a curry katsu bowl and a bowl of miso ramen. The other was a mini version of the dinner bento box.) \n\nTo the reviewers who had poor sushi experiences, claiming the rolls are similar to the pre-packaged ones at the supermarket, and un-fresh: I urge you to try Musashi again. I always find the rice perfect and room-temperature and seasoned well. Also: to those who complain the sushi menu is small, yes, it's less than a page.  However, who wants a phone-book-sized-menu if the food isn't good? \n\n(If you want to talk supermarket sushi, DYK restaurants like Soul Gastrolounge actually serve the supermarket brand as their own...and nobody knows!  In fact, it's pretty good, considering.) \n\nI also don't think the service is unfriendly at all!  Maybe being busy and task-oriented (not taking time to chit-chat) is mistaken for unfriendliness...I duno, I just call it efficient! \n\nTIP #2: You can't get their udon or ramen to-go.\n\nBottom Line:  If you're accustomed to some noodle houses in New York or LA, or in cities with large Asian communities, no, this place isn't going to be on the same level-- but sometimes you don't need all the frills.

The place was packed and had a constant stream of people, busy busy.  We had 6:30 reservations for a party of 6 and once everyone arrived we were promptly seated.  They will not seat you until everyone is there.\n\nWe were seated around a hibachi station - each station has seating for 8, so we had two strangers at the end of our station (no big, they were nice).  I was a little concerned at the cost of the meal when I was looking at it online, but the amount of food is well worth the cost.\n\nI ordered the teryaki chicken.  You start with an onion broth while the chef is warming up.  Next is the small chilled garden salad served with a pink creamy dressing.  While you are finishing your soup and working on your salad, the chef starts with hibachi veggies (thin sliced carrots, onions, zucchini, mushrooms and broccoli).  Next are hibachi noodles (spaghetti with an oil and garlic ? coating).  Next, if you order fried rice with your meal ($1.75 extra) instead of white rice, the chef does the fried rice and portions it out.  Then the meat is started.  Our table had a variety of steak and shrimp items, which were served first since they cook more quickly than chicken (no one wants rare chicken).  I thought everything was quite good (though my white rice was cold, but that is what I get for not ordering fried rice like everyone else at the table).  All of the preparation is done in front of you by the chef, who puts on a show while cooking.  Very interesting, though I was concerned that I was going to lose my eyebrows when the onion volcano was done.\n\nWith 6 people, it was hard to hold a conversation, though not impossible.  If you are catching up with friends, I would suggest getting there early for drinks, or planning drinks and dessert after - once the chef's show starts going, along with all of the tables around you, it is rather noisy.  \n\nOur server kept drinks filled.  The chef was quite personable.  I had water to drink, so my dinner before tip was just under $15.  Contrary to what my dinner date told me, you don't necessarily have to take off your shoes, though they do have traditional tables there as an option.  \n\nBe warned that your hair and clothes will reek of the hibachi smell, so I wouldn't take a post-meal walk through the woods unless you like bears and wildcats.", "business_id": "xLZilmaLXY0r-dBFaiLxww", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-11-09", "type": "review"}

Hubs and I still had enough quiet time to chat or just watch our chef flip and twist the shrimp & rice in peace. \n\nSo, where does Nakato really shine? Through the boatload of food that they dole out. It's almost ridiculous.

ZOMG. All of the food was truly tasty, especially when you added a bit of the \"yummy\" sauce that the chef provided. It.Was.So.Much.Food. I think my favorite was the shrimp, veggies and noodles.

They do not seat you until your entire party is here, but sink into one of their leather couches in front. You will not want to get up.\n\nOur party of 16 or so sat at 2 grill tables, circled around. I knew off the bat I didn't want teppanyaki, so I asked for a sushi menu. I started with the hawaiian poke salad (mix of salmon and tuna) and then two rolls. The 49'er roll (ode to the SF Niners) which was a CA roll with smoked salmon, spicy aoili (fancy word of spicy mayo) and scallions. I also went with another typical favorite roll of mine, the Rock N Roll, a crunchy roll with spicy tuna and smelt roe on top. \n\nEveryone was served salads and soup, and I also had a nice bottle of hot sake. Although I prefer cold sake, this one hit the spot. Service was great, but when the show began, we were definitley at the dull table. The other cook put on a fun and exciting show, doing tricks and everything you would normally see. Ours was...the quite opposite. When I asked him where our fun show was, he did a volcano thing with the onion, and THE END. \n\nThe hawaiian poke salad was okay, too much sauce that was overwhelming. The rolls on the other hand were delicious! I was surprised at the freshness of the fish, and I liked how they didnt clump so much rice on the rolls. And surprisingly I was still hungry! Usually I can barely eat two rolls, but I was still wanting more! I decided to order another, the Spicy Snow, salmon, cucumber, and jalapeno. My coworker and I also shared an order of 4 pieces of fatty tuna. That was amazing, but for $32, the slices were awfully thin. Everyone seemed to enjoy their teppanyaki, and the noodles were good too. They do seem to cook their steak very well, so tell them your liking if you prefer it more raw.\n\nMy roll took forever, and people were wrapping up so I asked for it to go. It was delicious but the jalapenos were HOT! After one burning my lip, I had to take them all off.\n\nWe had two birthdays and I asked them for their options. Ice cream is free, but a birthday cake, song, and photo was $10. We opted for the latter, and the birthday gals enjoyed their treat. The cake looks almost home made, but maybe store bought. Its a good size for about 6-8 people, and it was really light and delicious! \n\nOverall, a great experience! Would come back again for the sushi! Service was great in the beginning but as more and more diners came in, it seemed harder to get a hold of the waitresses. I do appreciate them turning on the channel for the A's/Tigers game for my avid A's fan coworker.", "business_id": "1PSnPPFVfp03iPfJRPWWQw", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-10-16", "type": "review"}

Heh heh \n\nI haven't been compelled to write a review in a VERY long time....so either this is good or bad....unless you spaced and didn't notice the actual reading, I won't spoil it for ya. Also, I don't feel it is really needed to caveat this, but just to put this review in perspective - I am half Japanese, born and raised in Japan....so I kinda know a little bit of what to expect...just a little.  ;)\n\nI popped in on a Tuesday night, around 7:00 pm, nice decor, seemed to be busy for a mid week night with friendly service folks. I elected to sit at the sushi bar and found myself to be the only customer at the bar. As I walked up to he bar, I looked at the fish in the cooler and immediately wanted to leave. The color of the various fish was off(as in obviously NOT fresh) but alas, blame the wife...I was determined to find some decent home country fare. I immediately noticed how unfriendly the sushi \"chef\" was. No real greeting and I sat in silence until a waitress arrived several minutes later. Ordered a Sapporo draft beer and started looking at my \"wish list\" of sashimi and sushi. I checked off the seven piece sushi dinner that also comes with a California roll($18) and also added a four piece sashimi of yellowtail(for $10) and a four piece sashimi of white tuna/escolar(for $8) and handed my sheet to the \"chef\". \n\nAs I contemplated what hashtags to use when I undoubtedly take a pic of my dinner for Instagram and sipped my beer, my dinner was presented forth to me several minutes later (which I initially appreciated the quick turnaround) and I was again IMMEDIATELY disappointed and realized there would be no Instagramming after all. :( \n\nThe dinner came on two plates, sushi on one and sashimi on the other. What struck me so quickly was how THIN the sashimi was cut! When I mean thin, I mean thin enough to see THROUGH the slice! Seriously, wtf??? I was OFFENDED. This \"chef\" is blatantly trying to rip people off. The whole point of sashimi is to enjoy the flavor of the fish without rice...how in the hell can I taste any fish when it is like 3mm thick??? Not to mention, the slices were sitting in little pools of water, which means these \"cuts\" of fish had been frozen for too long. Seriously. What. The. Frick. smh\n\nThe sushi platter was no better. Sloppy California roll(I freaking hate it when they include the ends of the roll!!) in some weird, rounded triangle shape that barely held together.  The sushi themselves had thicker cuts of fish and was presented better, but again, I was struck by the color of the fish. It came with a tuna, shrimp, salmon, eel, squid(I think...it was weirdly soft and not \"crisp\" as fresh squid would be and I couldn't tell by the taste either), seabass and one more I can't even remember. The tuna had a dull, magenta color(indicates it is old) and had no taste. Neither did the salmon or any of the other pieces have any taste, for that matter.  The shrimp was very dry and the other pieces lacked any.....texture. If you have enough experience with sushi and sashimi, you will know what I mean by \"texture\". Horrible, irresponsible old cuts of fish. None of the fish had any taste and these cuts, when fresh, have a VERY distinct differentiating flavor between them, but not tonight. Not here. The four cucumber pieces had the most flavor out of the entire meal....at least they were \"fresh\". \n\nSome of you may find this review overly harsh, but I write this specifically to share what to look for for those that do not know any better. It PISSES me off to NO END when individuals run a \"Japanese\" restaurant that is wholly not representative of my culture or the quality expected. I am a proud half-Japanese man and I take offense to those that misappropriate my country's culinary culture to just rip people off who are unsuspecting or those that do not have the experience to know any better. As for any other food offered at this establishment, I cannot comment on. However, if you are contemplating sushi and/or sashimi, take your hard earned money to an establishment that strives to do better for you and offer you a genuine Japanese culinary experience.....neither of which this restaurant is succeeding at.", "business_id": "1PSnPPFVfp03iPfJRPWWQw", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-11-24", "type": "review"}

I first came in 2004 (right before  I left Madison) and liked it very much every time I visited.\n\nWhen I moved back to Madison after a decade in the bad-sushi Mecca of Phoenix, AZ, I was eager to go back. I did, and the sushi is still quite good.\n\nBut the woman who runs the restaurant with her husband blew my mind. I noticed she was re-using sushi order sheets with the old orders scratched out. \"Hmm...cheap. And a little weird,\" I thought. \n\nThe weirdness was only beginning. The proprietress ran my credit card for ~$21, and it came back as declined. This is enormously weird, as I pay down my balance religiously. Since the restaurant was nearly empty and no one was behind me in line, I called my bank to straighten things out. It turns out that they had no record of the attempted transaction and suggested a communication error with Sushi Box's credit card processor (Heartland Payment Systems).\n\nAt this point I shrugged and took out some cash. The proprietress was visibly irritated and said that the credit card point-of-sale unit was brand new and the problem couldn't possibly be hers. \"Uh, OK,\" I thought to myself as I handed her the cash.\n\nThen she said \"They charge me every time I swipe a card, and I swiped your card three times.\" Then she just stared at me. I realized she wanted me to give her money for having my card declined. I explained that whatever her arrangement with her credit card processor, things like that were just part of the cost of doing business and I wasn't going to pay her for swiping my card.\n\nAt this point, it was like a smashup on the side of the road: I just couldn't look away. So I asked: how much do they charge you to swipe a card?\n\nI wanted to know how much money she was halfheartedly trying to extort from me. But she couldn't tell me, because she didn't know. At least, that's what she said. Evidently, she wanted me to slip her an indeterminate sum for her trouble.\n\nReally: the sushi is good. I will go back, and so should you. But I recommend paying with a credit card for maximum entertainment.\n\nIn all seriousness, if the proprietress is so hung up on credit card fees, she should try Square or something along those lines. The fees are reasonable and customers generally like using it. This sort of penny-wise, pound-foolish management approach inspires longtime loyal customers to join Yelp specifically to complain about your restaurant, just as I've done. I wish Sushi Box well, and I hope someone helps the proprietress get over her unhealthy obsession with the cost of doing business: credit card fees and even non-reused sushi order forms are simply part of what happens in the American economy these days.", "business_id": "wN5WijlhJjW_3keXENR1cw", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-09-14", "type": "review"}

So they sat us down and another girl came up and told us that the sushi bar already close for the night and they suppose to close in 2 minutes.  She hurried us to order from the menu and told us that the kitchen might not take anymore order if our friend did not get there in 2 minutes. (And I am not exaggerating, that was what she told us.)  I was really hungry and decided to order yakitori with yakisoba and it came with a salad and fried rice.  The food was horrible.  There was 3 sticks of skewered chicken which they tried to pass as yakitori  and cost almost $8 and the fried rice looked so horrible that I did not even touch it.  My yakisoba tasted worse than a 100 yen instant soba that I could have bought at any convenient store in Japan.  And the service was the worst thing at this place.  I am not that picky when it comes to food and especially if I am hungry, I will chow down anything.  My advice to those who are considering Kamakura, save your money, instant noodle or noodle cup taste better than the food they serve there.", "business_id": "K5PfWwW61Ajommy9xvXdAw", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-09-30", "type": "review"}

I'm not too sure what to make of this, especially from the unflattering and nondescript building it is located in. Upon stepping inside, however, it's like you've walked into an isolated world, and nothing in the room suggests that you're in Champaign anymore. The structure of the room, though, feels more like 1950's diner than Japanese restaurant, with a huge pit in the center of the main dining room, and booths to the side. I only caught a quick glimpse of the other side of the restaurant, but it looked a lot cozier than where we were sitting.\n\nI came on a fairly quiet Friday night, with maybe only two dozen people in the restaurant, yet the service was definitely below par. After the maitre d' seated us, nobody even came to our table until she wandered back 5 minutes later asking if anyone has showed up to serve us. The waitress was pretty inattentive also; after the appetizer, my glass of water stood empty for the rest of the meal. \n\nAs for the food, I ordered a beef teriyaki bento box, which came with tempura, rice, miso soup, salad, and three pieces of nigiri sushi. The beef was cooked to perfection, and coated in a teriyaki sauce as delicious as I have ever tasted. Though we are a long way from the closest ocean, the sushi also tasted very fresh. The rest of the bento box was great, as I would expect from an established Japanese restaurant.

Blue Fin serves very good, healthful Japanese food and is run by some of the sweetest people you'll ever meet (thanks Howard and Betsy!)\n\nI've tried many things on the menu and it's all very tasty. However there's one dish that I always go back for and find myself craving - the white meat teriyaki chicken. Yes, I know, teriyaki is the most common Japanese dish in America, but Blue Fin's is simply awesome. \n\nMost restaurants serve teriyaki as chicken with commercially-made sauce squeezed on top. But Blue Fin marinates their chicken in a homemade teriyaki that's just incredible. It's a big serving and I rarely leave any on the plate. Order it with the salad and it's even better - the best asian salad dressing beside's flo's asian kitchen. And sprinkle on some of the spicy seasoning that's on the table, too. hard to beat it.\n\nOnly drawback lately is all the construction around the area, but hey that's downtown these days.

The chicken wasn't drenched in an overly sweet sauce like a lot of Japanese places. It had this smoky flavor like it had been on the grill, not something I'm used to with teriyaki. I certainly didn't mind it. Also, the cabbage, carrots, etc. had some flavor to them and they didn't taste like they had been overcooked or terribly greasy like at a Panda Express. I felt full afterward, but not in a gross \"I ate too many onion rings\" kind of way. The bowl cost about $6.50 which I consider reasonable. The place also has a watercooler where you are free to fill 'er up. When the cashier wasn't busy, she came around and grabbed my cup to refill it for me. Nice touch. \n\nNow, I gave it four stars not because I'd call it a four-star restaurant but for what it offers considering it's \"fast food\" and for the good manners. I'll definitely come again.

Yogi's and Yoshi's and wherever else we tried never really cut it. A Yelp search brought up Blue Fin, and although it's a little further than normal to fetch lunch, I mentioned it to him and he agreed to try it. And glad we were! \n\nWe had the daily special ($7.29), which consisted of teriyaki chicken, rice, salad, 2 spring rolls and drink, and an order of sunomono ($1.29). Opt for all white meat (+$0.75) and brown rice (+$0.30). It was a lot of food. The salad was meh, and in the same box as the teriyaki, so it was kinda warm by the time I got back to the office (at least the dressing was in a separate container). Probably won't order the special again, just to avoid the salad. The rice was perfect, the sauce was delicious and the chicken was fantastic. Thinly sliced (not in chunks like all the other joints) and no yucky gristle or fat hanging off. If anything, maybe a little too heavy on the soy sauce. The spring rolls were just a tad under cooked, but still good. The sweet & sour sauce looked kinda grainy, but tasted just fine. Sunomono was great. Overall, the best teriyaki bowl in the area!\n\nI picked up our food in the middle of lunch time and was expecting parking to be terrible, based on other reviews. But there were only a couple other cars in their small lot. There were 25-30 people scattered around the inside & outside tables, so I'm guessing they either foot it, or take the light rail, which stops just out front. Also, they have a drive up window. I'm not sure if you can order it there or if it's just for pickup, but it'd be convenient with a phone-in order next time! The staff was SUPER friendly, to boot! \n\nP.S.

Since the BF had already eaten a bunch of appetizers at the event we were at, he said he'd just share whatever I ordered.  So, I chose the miso eggplant appetizer and the Yaki Udon Noodle entree with tofu.  The eggplant dish was really tasty but they served it straight from the stove and we both burned our mouths taking the first bite.  We had to let it sit another few minutes to cool down enough to eat it.  (Note - I'm not complaining; I'd rather have my food served too hot than not hot enough... )  \n\nWe finished the eggplant dish up right as the noodle dish arrived.  The noodles themselves were cooked just right but the dish had a weird flavor to it.  It just didn't taste right, or maybe it was just nothing special.

I have been three times, and this last time was on a Sunday night around 5:30pm. Evidently, the service issues here are related to the owner's inability to hang on to good talent. That's not surprising. Most small independent restaurants have this problem. Expect it, and be ok with it so that you can enjoy a delicious meal with no stress. \n\nMy boyfriend always orders the same thing. He prefers to have his soup scalding hot and full of seafood. He is never, ever disappointed in the dish called Champon. It's huge, super hot, chock full of seafood and perfect noodles. He loves it. I think it's tasty, but I'm not so hooked on soup. I order something different every time and we share our dishes. \n\nThe bread basket is always good here. I love their banana bread. It was the perfect forerunner to the chicken salad I ordered on Sunday. I had a beautiful plate brimming full of fresh, delicious spring greens and topped with two grilled chicken breasts that were sliced up and artistically placed upon the heap of greens, then topped with a super tasty light but creamy sesame dressing. I also ordered the sushi combo plate which came with a small salad (for the bf) and a cup of terrific miso soup for $11.00 (it's an appetizer and it totally satisfies)! \n\nMind you, the service lacked. I think there were two servers for the whole restaurant, so ask for a big glass of water when you arrive, or order two drinks in advance. Know the restaurant's limitations and you'll be glad you went, anyway! The ambiance is lovely; the open kitchen makes it so homey and yet romantic with the brick work and artistic lighting. \n\nPS. The chicken Parmesan is just ok. Steer clear of the traditional Italian dishes - save that for Maggiano's or Carraba's. I've always been too full to order a dessert here, but they look delightful.", "business_id": "AkOruz5CrCxUmXe1p_WoRg", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-11-18", "type": "review"}

That isn't what is wrong with Cherry Blossom.\n\nThe problem with Cherry Blossom is the service which seems to be getting worse. I have taken my family there at least a dozen times and it appears as if the service which was so-so to begin with has deteriorated to just plain incompetent. Today was the final straw. My wife and I arrived there at 11:35 am for an early lunch and while the place was not empty, it was not packed either. We were seated immediately in the back room which was empty when we arrived. The server promptly took our drink order and brought it to us. She said she'd give us a few minutes to look over the menu. A few minutes went by, then another few minutes, then another and by 11:57, our order had still not been taken. At that point, my wife flagged down the host who took our order. I should point out that both my wife and I had ordered two simple lunch items from the menu without any substitutions or special requests. Two minutes later (around 11:59) our server appeared and asked if we had decided what we wanted. After informing her that we just gave our order to the host, she vanished. Both our orders were supposed to come with soup and salad and still by 12:14, neither had arrived. At that point, more people had arrived and the several tables in the back room where we were had become occupied. We also noticed that these customers, who arrived well after we had, had been served their salads, soups and even their meals while we sat there waiting. At that point I went to speak with the host about where our missing salads and soups were and she smiled politely but did not respond. My wife and I decided we were not going to pay for such incompetent service and just walked out. The last time I was there, the service was slow and they did not bring one of the salads for one of the meals we ordered. Other times we have gone there and waited 10 minutes to even be asked for our drink order when the place was not even half full. It just seems to get worse and worse at Cherry Blossom.\n\nSo in conclusion. If you enjoy sitting and waiting while watching other customers who walked in 10 or 15 minutes or more after you did get their orders taken and served their food, this is the place for you. It is my belief that management is to blame for Cherry Blossom's poor service. Fortunately, I can take my money and spend it elsewhere and that's just what we did after we left. Cherry Blossom will not be getting any more visits from us.", "business_id": "AkOruz5CrCxUmXe1p_WoRg", "stars": 1, "date": "2009-10-20", "type": "review"}

A weird location, but once you walk through the door of Cherry Blossom you are transported to a little rustic restaurant setting.  It was a nice surprise.\n\nThe place was busy.  We had to wait for a little bit because we didn't have a reservation.  Our table finally opened up and the three of us took our seats.  I was pleasantly surprised with the prices on the menu.

It's pretty cozy inside, like someone said, Asian European.  The menu is huge.  I'm typically a picky person and will only find one or two things on any given menu that I want to eat, but this menu...I would try half of it.\n\nHowever, I had a hankerin' for sushi, so that's what I ordered.  I was a little disappointed that they didn't have an individual selection of nigiri to choose from, but they did have a combo option for nigiri, which is usually what I like to see anyway.  I decided to try the Philly roll and the Alaskan roll.  I was also concerned this might not fill me up, so I also ordered a bowl of miso ($2).\n\nFirst of all, the miso was delicious.  It had raw cabbage in it, which I didn't really like (nor have I seen it before), but other than that, it was one of the best miso soups I've ever had.  Secondly, the Philly roll was awesome!  It was made with smoked salmon, which made it a million times more delicious than usual. The Alaskan roll had cooked salmon, and it was good, but couldn't compare to the Philly roll with smoked salmon.\n\nAlso, I didn't realize they served bread at the table (wasn't really expecting that at an Asian restaurant).  We had two rolls and two cinnamon and sugar crostinis in our basket.  They were both good.  Nothing special about the rolls, though.  Just your typical dinner roll.  Because of the bread, I ended up being super full at the end of my meal, which I wasn't expecting at all.\n\nMy fiance ordered the shrimp pad thai.  He asked for super-extra hot, but it came not spicy at all.  They gave him chili sauce, though, which helped him out.  He absolutely loved it.  Normally, he doesn't really like Thai or Japanese food that much, but he couldn't stop talking about how good his food was.  That's a giant thumbs up for this place, just for impressing him with Thai food.\n\nOverall it was excellent.  We went at 8pm on a Sunday night and the place was packed.  I see that as a great sign.

It had been a grueling day and I wanted to get away, so I hopped in the car and started driving until I saw a storefront with a line out the door. After waiting for about 15 minutes I pointed to the picture on the wall. Having no idea what it was, I had ordered Tempura Udon.\n\nI dunked one of the thick shaggy pieces of shrimp into the savory broth and watched as the tempura quickly soaked up the broth. The flavors were ethereal.\n\nMy initial slurp of thick slippery udon is among the great food experiences I've ever had. Unfortunately, I've never had udon that has compared to that first steaming bowl.\n\nAfter driving by Cherry Blossom Noodle Cafe in Phoenix many times, I finally stopped in. They excel at their namesake with tasty noodles and more offerings than you can shake a wet noodle at.\n\nIt's a calming space with a quick, friendly wait staff and a menu that's mostly Asian inspired. There's a section dedicated to Italy, though I'm not sure how much curry and ginger Italians use in their pasta.\n\nCherry Blossom also offers many salads, including Tokyo Chicken Coleslaw ($7.60). It's essentially a Chinese chicken salad with grilled chicken, cabbage, lettuce and daikon sprouts in a tangy vinaigrette dressing. It's deliciously light and refreshing.\n\nA friend once told me that the spiciness of a spicy sushi roll was invented to help disguise the flavor of fish that might not be so fresh. While I'm not saying that the Spicy Salmon Roll ($5.60) wasn't freshly made, it was so fishy that it was inedible. Spicy as it was, it couldn't disguise the flavor that remained with me after the first try.\n\nThe California Roll ($4.40) fared better, but then again it was just a California Roll, imitation crab, cucumber and avocado wrapped in rice.\n\nMoving right into noodles, the egg version used in the Korean Spicy Beef ($10.50) were so chewy and fun to eat, I only wished the bowl was larger. Spiked with green peppers and tender sliced of beef, this wasn't as spicy as I has hoped, but this was quickly remedied with a side of chile paste.\n\nMy eyes widened as my Ebi-Ten Udon Noodle ($8) arrived. It was a large bowl filled with huge udon noodles paired with soup and steamed spinach. Along side were several pieces of shrimp tempura that were golden and inviting. Could this be what I've been searching for all of these years? After one sip my hopes plunged; just not quite the same. The flavor of the dashi, the basic soup stock used for udon, was a little too strong. Don't get me wrong, it was a very good bowl but, not quite the sensation I experienced so many years ago. Perhaps it's never as good as the first time.", "business_id": "AkOruz5CrCxUmXe1p_WoRg", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-09-30", "type": "review"}

From their katsu curry or tempura to their soba, ramen, udon, I have enjoyed each meal and what they've had to offer.  I will suggest though that if you do order the katsu curry, that you ask for the katsu to be served on the side so it doesn't lose the crispy quality of the panko that is otherwise buried in the curry sauce.  \n\nI don't know anyone who has tried their Italian fare, but my friends and I have found their Asian food selections to be delicious.  Their prices are pretty reasonable and I find their portions to be decent as well.  I have yet to personally try their sushi, but I have heard that it's also quite good.  \n\nI haven't had any issues with the service, but I also wouldn't say that they go above and beyond either - it is adequate.  The atmosphere is a little odd since it was, from what I heard, converted from a bakery to a restaurant, but it is clean and comfortable.  I do think it would be nice if they honed in on the Asian cuisine though, being named Cherry Blossom Cafe otherwise seems slightly misleading.

I've had sushi, salads, Italian pasta, udon soup, desserts, all of it. I've never had something that was less than good and most of it is delicious. I've brought many friends and family and they agree the food is good.\n\nThe Prices. The prices are very reasonable and despite many visits we are often surprised with how low our bill is considering the quantity and quality of food.\n\nCons:\n\nThe Service. The service isn't exactly bad but it is frequently very slow. The servers are polite but it can be hard to flag them down and difficult to get refills especially during busy times. Also, beware because ordering sushi here is an extremely slow process. I've had friends get full meals from appetizer through dessert before I even get my sushi.\n\nThe Bathrooms. The bathrooms are shared with another restaurant and are usually quite filthy. They are also single stall bathrooms which I hate in a restaurant.\n\n\nI do recommend you eat here though. The food is most definitely worth it. The cons really aren't enough to stop me.

I would definitely order it again.", "business_id": "AkOruz5CrCxUmXe1p_WoRg", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-09-20", "type": "review"}

It's a regular stop any time I'm in Phoenix. I've never experienced any problems parking or with service. It's got great atmosphere and is usually busy with happy talkative diners, busy wait staff and a very hard working kitchen. As a matter of fact, get a good seat looking across the kitchen delivery spot and watch some real professionals cook great food that is served so hot that it begs waiting for a moment to avoid a burned tongue. I really love the Udon dishes they have...the little side salad that accompanies is a nice cold, tart beginning...grab a bottle of unfiltered Sake to go with your meal and watch the action as you enjoy great food. The prices are astonishingly reasonable given the service and food quality.\n\nI have recommended this place to many friends and will be going back as long as they're open for business.", "business_id": "AkOruz5CrCxUmXe1p_WoRg", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-10-05", "type": "review"}

My go-to order is TanTan-Men which is actually kind of a problem considering I love it so much I rarely venture out from it and I'm sure there are other noodle dishes that are just as delicious that I am missing out on (feel bad for me). But, if you like spice, the TanTan-Men is the way to go. It will fill your stomach and clear your sinuses, and the order is HUGE. Definitely a two, or maybe even three, sitting meal. Which reminds me, once after dining in and barely denting my ginormous soup order, I proceeded to have a minor panic attack about how I was going to get this ramen equivalent of hoover dam into a to-go container without spilling it all over myself and causing a major scene. This panic attack proved to be completely unwarranted, since as soon as I said I wanted to take the rest home they took it and neatly packaged it FOR ME which was very nice and appreciated (I'm seriously not sure what I would have done if they brought me a container...cried, possibly). \n\nThis is the kind of service I'm writing this review about. Let me explain:\n\nEvery year since I've known him, my boyfriend hibernates from approximately January to June to study for an extremely difficult exam called the \"CFA\".  It's like the Bar except it's harder, it's about finance, and you have to take (and pass) a newer and harder level every year for three years to finally become a \"CFA\". This year the test was in June and of course, as soon as he was done with it we wanted to do something we hadn't been able to do for quite a while: a good old fashioned bar crawl.  This bar crawl went pretty long and at one point I remember playing the always appropriate song \"Stay Fly\" by Academy Award winning rap group Three Six Mafia on a jukebox at some dive bar whose name I can't even recall right now. Fast forward 24 hours later, and I can't find my wallet. I just KNEW I lost it on the bar crawl, and highly suspected it was during aforementioned jukebox session. I called every bar we visited to no avail and finally just came to terms with the fact that my cherry red Kate Spade wallet that I loved was gone forever. I bought a new wallet, got a new ID, new credit cards, all that fun stuff, and went on with my life.\n\nFast forward a couple months later. There's a package at my door. It's from Cherry Blossom Noodle Caf\u00e9. \"Hmm...I don't remember ordering takeout from Cherry Blossom Noodle Caf\u00e9,\" I think, \"and if I did, sending it UPS is a very odd method of delivery\".  Then it dawned on me...what's my hangover food of choice after a good old fashioned bar crawl that ends with me playing inappropriate songs by Academy Award winning rap groups at bars whose name I can't recall? OMG NOODLES!!!!  Oh yes, I went to Cherry Blossom the next day for a hangover lunch, left my wallet there, and proceeded to completely block out the entire trip while trying to remember what bar I could have possibly left my wallet at the night before.  They got my address from my ID, packaged it up, paid the shipping, and MAILED IT TO ME. It was seriously one of the happiest days of my life. Any place that will go that much out of their way (Mind you, I never even CALLED them about the wallet. They had nothing to go on here.) to help a customer will never get less than 5 stars in my book though it doesn't hurt that their food is delicious, cures hangover, and packs itself up to go without you making a scene.

Since then I've tried another place besides Cherryblossom in the Valley and have been told that Phoenix just doesn't have a good \"ramen scene.\" I'm glad I didn't give up my search before I remembered this place! \n\nOther reviewers are right, this place is definitely buzzing with activity, and with only one cook and what appeared to be one server on a Sunday evening they were doing remarkably well. It did, however, take a little while for the waiter to see us once we were seated, and the table next to us complained about not being given menus. Part of that may have been due to the layout of the restaurant- we were in a side room that seemed cut off from the rest of the place. \n\nOnce our orders were placed the food arrived fairly quickly, and our drinks were delivered about the same time. To start we had gyoza, which arrived piping hot. \n\nHe had the Tan-Tan Men (spicy ramen,) and I had the Cha-shu (a more traditional-style ramen.) As usually happens when I dine out with my boyfriend, he chose the better dish. The broth was very flavorful and spicy enough to set his nose running, which according to him was one of the more important criteria... I can't really argue with that logic since I treat horshradish similarly. \n\nMy ramen dish was excellent, jealousy of my boyfriend's meal aside. The amount of pork in it was plentiful, and the noodles were soft and not too overcooked.\n\nThe atmosphere of this place is very friendly and inviting, it would be a great place to grab lunch on a not-so-busy day, but it was still enjoyable even with the wait. It lent itself well to casual conversation. \n\nIf you are a little impatient (or your date is) then it might be best to try somewhere a little less hectic. However if you don't mind sitting around a bit and chatting, I highly recommend checking out this local noodle house.", "business_id": "AkOruz5CrCxUmXe1p_WoRg", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-11-24", "type": "review"}

Not exactly what I was looking for.\nKorean Spicy Beef Asian Noodles, the beef was okay...no spice to it...the noodles where okay. The meal just looked thrown together and not appealing to the eye.\n\nI don't think I'll be back...maybe for the dessert counter.

It wasn't fish, which is a good thing, I think it was probably cleaning product.

My standard sushi order is typically edamame, salmon nigiri, and a Philly roll.  Yes, I know, Philly isn't \"real\" sushi.  Tough, I like it.  But I can't say that I liked what I got at Moto.  It seemed to me that perhaps the rice was a little dry.  It was after 8pm, maybe they didn't want to cook another batch when they'd be closing in an hour.  Regardless, for me the sushi was a disappointment.  Even the edamame was disappointing, it could have been hotter.  Maybe it was sitting for a bit while waiting for our server, I don't know.  My wife ordered a roll which didn't impress either of us.\n\nBased just on that, I'd probably rate their sushi as average, not terribly impressive, and rate them a 2.  But I'm giving them three stars because of my wife's entree: Vietnamese pork tacos.  I don't know what the seasoning on the meat is, but it was GOOD.

If anyone has any information regarding the owners (if they reopened somewhere else) or otherwise, feel free to email me through the Yelp system. They knew me by first name and I considered them friends with the level of service they had given me. I would love to know where they are now. I'm also sorry that I wasn't still living in phoenix to still patronize their business and keep them going (if it came down to paying the rent). I cant think of many restaurants I feel this way about. Good luck to the Mishima family wherever you are now.\n\nbelow is my original review from 2006:\n\n\nThis is my favorite DL (downlow) Sushi restaurant when I visit the Phoenix area. I have very special reasons for this... The restaurant is owned by a Japanese couple that run the whole restaurant themselves. The husband prepares the food, while the wife waits on the tables. It is a real labor of love! I always enjoy restaurants where they remember me personally and treat me like family. This is one of those places!  The menu is almost limitless, Mishima San (Mr. Mishima) is trained in all culinary areas and make you almost anything you want (food stock providing). The Ox tail is particularly good, as is the Unagi Don (grilled eel over rice). Don't forget to try the Sashimi, if travelling in a group- get an excellent deal on the Sushi  boat. Most Japanese beers are in stock, so I usually choose Orion from Okinawa(light full bodied flavor). It is usually the hardest beer to find at Japanese restaurants. This is a small Izakiya style restaurant that has a family atmosphere, and the bathroom is clean!. Anything it lacks is well made up for with flavor and old world style Japanese hospitality. Oishkata!!! (delicious)... Enjoy:)", "business_id": "H8QFth3DVsYbkJ2M7bTvmg", "stars": 4, "date": "2006-09-02", "type": "review"}

It felt great just walking around Kierland Commons in the warm, late afternoon sunshine. \n\nMy friend chose her favorite sushi restaurant in Phoenix, Shogun, for dinner.  We got there fairly early and sat at the sushi bar.  Looking around, I noticed that I was the only Buddhahead in the restaurant (and I'm only half-Asian).  \"This can't be a good sign\", I thought.  Don't' get me wrong:  I don't believe that a restaurant operator's ethnicity must match the culinary heritage of the food he serves.  This can't be right.  Food, like human compassion and friendship, transcends race and ethnicity.  \n\nMy friend ordered most of the items off the menu.  We started with a Sunshine Roll, which was heaping mounds of spicy tuna loaded onto a modified California Roll.  The sauce for the spicy tuna was heavily mayonnaise based, which was a bit odd.  It was different, but tasty and original.\n\nThe Wahoo Sashimi in ponzu sauce with sliced cucumbers was light and delicate.  Wahoo is ono in Hawaii and is a white fish that is mild and slightly sweet.  It went well with the citrus ponzu.  \n\nThe Veggie Roll was odd in that the ingredients didn't blend together at all.  It consisted of cooked asparagus, some kind of weird takuan (pickled daikon radish) that was a bit bitter, kimpira gobou (burdock root), and shisou (mint leaf).  All the wasabi and gari in the world couldn't fix this roll. \n\nWe also had Shake Sushi (Salmon Sushi), Octopus Salad, and some edamame.\n\nThe sushi here was so far off the beaten path that the tastes were a bit off, they were almost uncomfortable to my palate.

They have a sushi roll for half off and a combo (usually a roll and teriyaki chicken) for $7.  The rolls in the combo change from day to day and the half off roll is always different from the combo roll.  I usually bring a coworker and we share the an order of the half price roll, the special combo and order an extra bowl of rice.

It is the ultimate in party cuisine and a great experience, plus the food seems that much better cooked in front of you.  Somehow though Phoenix remains without a great Teppan restaurant.\n\nMy nephew is an Asian food junkie and loves Teppan, so for his birthday we really wanted to give him a great experience and Sakana remained one of two places in town we have not tried so onward...\n\nWe were sat immediately about 15 minutes prior to our reservation and quickly ordered drinks and sushi.  After reading other reviews I walked over to the sushi bar and looked at the day's specials.  We ordered two types of Nigiri off the special board and then Uni and Spicy Scallops.  For my nephew we got a spicy tuna roll.  There was nothing wrong with any of it.  The sushi had a clean taste and was very good.  It was a pleasant surprise.\n\nThe teppan started with a decent soup and salad.  The show itself was good, not great.  The portions of the meats were astonishing, absolutely huge.  Same with the veggies.  The rice was good and came in the standard cup.  A little odd was that the rice and veggies were an add on for an additional $3.  Not a big deal but just different.  Overall all the meats and the shrimp were okay.  I took a piece of my husband's steak as Teppan steak I always feel has the best flavor for steak from my perspective as a non steak eater, and it tasted like typical steak.\n\nSo basically the whole food experience was a standard.  Nothing really standing out, nothing bad.  On the other side was the service.  Lackadaisical is the word that comes to mind.    My sister said she felt she bussed our table.  Since our party of 4 was alone at the teppan table we kept passing her our dishes to put on the other end as not one thing was removed from the table.  Think about the number of items I mentioned having and how many dishes that means!  I had to ask to get water and tea refills and my glasses were removed and returned in the most bizarre way.  A pitcher could have been so much simpler.  It took a good 15 minutes for my sister's beverage to come from the bar.  It was almost an hour before the teppan chef came over.  \n\nThe server though was personable enough that the non-service service was less irritating than it might have been in other circumstances.  I doubt I will be back, but it wasn't a bad experience and for someone in the Ahwatukee area i would say if they have time and don't have a ton of money to spend on Teppan or sushi it is not  a bad choice.", "business_id": "0vzZ_Bcb02rJljeMU9XkBw", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-10-30", "type": "review"}

I suppose I should have known something was up when the yellowtail didn't have that signature taste I love so much and the salmon seemed to have a filmy texture but as I said, Ramon made me want to like this place.

I've now gone twice because my friend stands by it being the best in the area.  Every time I've gone, the servers completely ignore us.  During the first time, it took about 10 minutes to get a menu.  Maybe another 15 to get a simple gin & tonic.  When the server finally decided to come back around to see if we wanted to eat (we'd been looking for her for a while) we ordered a small amount of food.  20 minutes later a new server delivers the food (which was warm and awful).  We sat around for about 15 more minutes waiting for our checks (which were delivered by yet another new person).  They finally take our money and also take their sweet time bringing back the change.  I will openly admit that I did not tip.   I forgot to mention that this was at night.  It was a little busy, but eventually completely died.  After the crowd disappeared, we still got completely ignored.\n\nThe second time I decided to give it a chance, we went for lunch.  The service was a bit better.  I could only assume that the other person helping our server was the manager.  He flat-out lied to my face, which upset me very much.  I asked for a gin & tonic again.  The server goes to put that drink order in and the manager comes up to me saying their out of both gin and tonic.  I ordered a vodka cranberry instead.  It was awful.  Probably no vodka in it.  My friend pointed to the shelves of liquor where there stood in plain sight a bottle of Tanqueray and a bottle of Bombay.  Thanks manager for being such an asshole.  Once again the food came out at a warm temperature.  It was very hard to keep down.  \n\nAfter the 2nd trip, I've decided not to come back.  It's awful service, management, and mediocre food.  I highly advise that the owner or GM takes a good look at his staff and the way things are being ran.

I'm not sure how long the happy hour lasts, but we came at 7 pm and got to take advantage of it.  They have about 10 rolls on their HH menu for only $4-5 each.  We thought the rolls would be really small bc the waitress told us they would only come with 5 pieces (instead of the 8 pieces from the regular menu) but they were just as big as rolls that I'm used to eating.  I ordered an appetizer and two rolls and I actually had to take one entire roll home because I was soooo full.\n\nFor appetizer I got agedashi tofu.  It was different than I'm used to, because the tofu pieces were pretty small, but there were a LOT of them. I'm used to larger, but fewer, pieces of tofu.  The sauce they had it in was delicious and spot on.  But I think that they do not dip the tofu in potato starch like other places do bc the outside wasn't that slippery chewy texture, it was straight up just fried tofu.  I probably would not order this dish again.\n\nFor my rolls I got spicy tuna and scallop dynamite.  The spicy tuna was what you'd except, but VERY large pieces in the roll!  I couldn't even fit a whole piece in my mouth at one time.\n\nThe scallop roll was a california roll topped with a LARGE mound of krab and scallops (cooked).  It was a warm roll.  I enjoyed it, although I was expecting the scallops to be raw!  I think I would've liked it better if they had been raw, but it was still good.\n\np.s. - if you check in on yelp you can score a free edamame appetizer!", "business_id": "0vzZ_Bcb02rJljeMU9XkBw", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-10-06", "type": "review"}

This place always has the freshest seafood. I am an Uni lover and get this every time if they have it.  Sometime based on CA weather they may not get it in but most times they do.  It is the best an most consistent. Their yellowtail is melt in your mouth delicious. I love their specials too whether it's bluefin toro, Spanish mackerel, oysters, it is very consistent and very good. Friendly staff, great sushi chefs, fantastic executive chef. I can't say enough about them.  It is usually busy so sometimes service can be slow but the flavor and freshness of the sushi makes up for it.

They decided on this place, so I went with it! Next time I'll speak up and share my yelp knowledge...\n\nDon't come here if you want good sushi. This place is mediocre at best. Maybe they don't have great sushi in AZ given the lack of ports?? I am always weary of eating sushi far from the coast. Anyway, I got a rainbow roll and spicy tuna roll. My husband also got some nigiri and dumplings. The nigiri and rainbow roll was just ok. Nothing really amazing in terms of presentation. My rainbow roll wasn't rolled very tightly and was kind of falling apart. The fish wasn't the most flavorful. The spicy tuna roll was just bad. It wasn't real spicy tuna!! They just took regular tuna and mixed it with sriracha/mayo...wtf?! I can't comment on the dumplings as I have to eat gluten free (Celiac). My husband said they weren't bad. Everything else I mentioned was safe for me to eat. \n\nWe also went here during happy hour. I felt like the happy hour was just ok...they had a big selection to choose from (drinks and food), but the discount wasn't that much. I feel like they could have offered more discount or deals. The service was fine, and they have giant booths to accommodate large parties. However, I won't be back.

I have been coming here almost weekly (sometimes more than once a week) for the past year during lunch time. Every time our bill is usually $70 or more, mainly due to our drinks! \n\nHowever, the past few times we have gone here, have been really bad. We walk in, sit at the bar area where we normally sit, and then we wait....and wait..and wait. One time we waited 15 mins before the bartender even appeared. I would have walked out and gone else where if I wasn't such a fan of this location. \n\nJust last week our bartender (she had Blonde hair) was probably the worst I have ever experienced. I ordered a Coconut Sakerita and it didn't taste like coconut at all! It tasted like the lime sour mix they put in it. I have had this drink before an know what its suppose to taste like..and it is not suppose to taste like that. The worst part about it is that it didn't even tasted like coconut one bit. Then she disappeared again for 20 mins. Thank goodness for this other waitress that walked by who seen how annoyed I looked. She came over and offered her assistance with getting us another drink, in which she had no problem making the coconut drink correctly. Our group ended up being over 30 mins late back to work because of how slow our bartender was and her annoyingly long disappearances. \n\nMost recently, yesterday, we came here again for lunch. We sat down and waited about 5 mins before we seen the bartender. Again the Coconut drink was made wrong. Our food was extremely slow to come out and there was hardly anyone there. \n\nI have always loved this location. Their food is usually always really good, never really had an issue with it, Aside from the garlic edamame (I believe they changed their recipe casing them to be more greasy than before...which isn't a good thing). The staff has always been really nice, fast, and attentive. However, these past few weeks have really gone down hill. The staff really needs to be trained better on service and how to make their drinks. And there should never be a time where a customer is waiting wondering where the heck the bartender is.

There were excellent ones in Washington DC, so I know they exist.  Should I temper my review with the knowledge that most Chinese buffets are far inferior to this one?  Does that make this place any better?  Sigh, I don't even know where to begin.\n\nThe place is not disgusting inside - if you want to call that neat or well-decorated, I don't know if you can.  I don't think I'd go that far.  Servers are fast and attentive with drinks and clearing plates - you have to appreciate their hustle.\n\nThe majority of the items on the buffet are absolutely, unequivocally ordinary.  If your mission is to eat as much food as possible for as cheaply as possible, this would be an excellent place to do it.  Seafood is especially fishy and most items seem as if they've had a long-life under the heat lamp.  Mongolian BBQ (which I'm a fan of) is a low-frequented item here, and the veggie selection illustrates this clearly.  There are maybe 5 roughly chopped vegetable choices, a confusing selection of sauces and a couple trays of meat melting in front of you.  Not terribly appetizing and the final product is as lackluster as you'd expect.\n\nThe only true deal is the sushi, of which you can eat copious amounts of and have prepared for you fresh and on demand.  It's not exceptionally good quality, but at a place as low ticket as this, it's a welcome addition to see something being made fresh for you.\n\nWould not go back, and the result of reading many of the reviews here leads me to believe that if this is supposed to be the best of the bunch, I might as well give up hope on the concept of the exceptional Chinese buffet in Phoenix altogether.", "business_id": "-Ogv7rpcgUHkFaSy3vD8Sw", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-11-05", "type": "review"}

My favorite is the dragon roll. As for the bbq ribs they are generally very meaty and tender with chinese bbq sauce. For my favorite dish hands down is the salt and pepper shrimp. You may think this is strange but I eat the shrimp with the legs and shell but not the tail. The reason is the shell has all the flavoring on it so if you take off the shell you may as eat it like a shrimp cocktail.  Try it with the shell you will like it. \n\nThe lunch and dinner menu are very different with dinner having prime rib, bbq ribs and a few additional items.\n\nStill a good buffet especially when there are a lot if people so the food turns over so they are constantly bringing out fresh food.", "business_id": "-Ogv7rpcgUHkFaSy3vD8Sw", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-11-19", "type": "review"}

There are some items that are catered to the american crowd but the execution on the dishes I ordered is strictly Japanese.\nMiso Soup was piping hot- love it!\nThe Japanese curry with chicken katsu was probably the best I have tasted here in AZ.\nI also had the Cold Somen noodles and perfection it was.  The  tsuyu, dipping sauce was flavorful..umami style!\nThis is homestyle japanse cooking at its best!  I will make time for this place everytime I am in the area from now on....I can not believe I almost missed out on this place:)", "business_id": "BBPkwpj9kSeDuy0uOwWHJA", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-10-14", "type": "review"}

Big mistake.\n\nNot sure what restaurant the other Yelpers ate in but it sounds like a different place.\n\nOur experience: bad neighborhood, creepy clientele, unfriendly owner, AC that was either malfunctioning or turned off, absolutely no atmosphere of any kind and really, really sub-par food.  We had a bowl of curry ramen that the owner couldn't even bother to mix the curry into.  No meat or vegetables at all.  Just ramen and a lump of curry paste.  And then a curry katsu don that was quite possibly the worst I've ever had\n\nThere was no greeting, no smile and no attempt to communicate. My wife's awful ramen came out a good 5 minutes before my katsu.  When my food finally did come out, the owner simply dumped the tray on the table (they don't bother taking it off the cafeteria tray), spilling miso soup all over my napkin.  No \"Sorry\" or offer to replace the napkin (no napkins on the table despite the fast food type setting).\n\nJust really surly, unfriendly service. (Perhaps he'd have a better attitude if he turned the air on - it was 108 when we were there.) One of the other customers asked for wasabi and the owner said - I'm not kidding - \"It's not free you know!\" \n\nReally just a very sad attempt at food that isn't really that complicated in the first place and the owner's extremely bad attitude made the whole experience kind of insulting.  The owner appears openly contemptuous of both the food and the customers and who needs that?  Even it if were good, which it emphatically was not.\n\nI'd rather eat anything than this crap.

An elder Japanese couple runs this restaurant (apparently since 1983!!), with no help. Just the two of them bussing and cooking and taking orders. \n\nFor all the previous reviews who complain about the lack of fawning service....REALLY? The elder man handles all the tables by himself. The wife stays in the back. This couple works side by side, all day every day. They make straightforward good food. No frills. Don't nitpick--try to do what they do all year round and see where your priorities are. \n\nAnyways, on to the food:\n\nGyoza: Very good! Perfectly pan-fried, flavorful, and not too oily.\n\nCurry Katsu over Rice: Delicious! I wish they put the pork katsu on top of the curry so that it doesn't lose some of the crisp sitting in the sauce. But it was delicious! The curry was thick and the proportion to the rice was perfect. \n\nTonkotsu Ramen: Definitely did not come with the typical ramen toppings like wakame, charsiu and bamboo. It came topped with Chinese cabbage and chicken. It was almost more like Chinese noodle soup haha. If I were to judge it as a ramen, it wouldn't be good. But as a noodle/soup dish, it was good.\n\nSoft Shell Crab roll: Okay, sushi is definitely not their strength. I would not order another roll from here. There was too much mayo (the presence of mayo was already odd), the sushi rice was not the right consistency, and the nori was soggy.  The inari that came with my tonkotsu ramen tasted a little odd as well. It's ok, they have plenty of other things I need to try on the menu!\n\nIf this review was based purely on food, I'd give it 3.5 stars. But I really appreciated how hard-working the couple works!

So, believe me when I say this, there really isn't anything good to eat in Arizona.\n\nThat said, Yoko is one of the very few places that I frequent when I'm in the area. It is definitely on par with, if not better than, most of the Asian/Japanese fast food joints in LA. Allow me to explain why this is the case.\n\n1. The food is freshly prepared from scratch. (In this day and age, few businesses can lay claim to this kind of practice because it is, dare I say it, honest) The orange chicken is my favorite item because, as names should suggest, the sauce is actually made with real oranges and the meat undeniably comes from chickens. I have asked the friendly, elderly Asian man (presumably the owner) on a number of occasions for the recipe for the awesome teriyaki sauce. No surprise, it is a closely guarded family secret - and with good reason.\n\n2. Some have commented about the decor of this establishment. I believe that this is a ridiculous criticism leveled at the restaurant owners. Take your pathetic sensitivity elsewhere. This is a casual, family-operated, fast food restaurant, not PF Chang's. (And if you're eating at PF Changs, I question your tastes) If anything, I am fond of the modest decor of Yoko because it isn't distracting. The owners have focused on bringing the customer an affordable, delicious meal. This is commendable. You should focus on your meal as well.\n\n3. The business is family-operated. The employees are genuine people and I always appreciate interacting with them at a level beyond my order. One reviewer commented that he/she was offended because an associate shared his/her gun control views. This is laughable. I guess freedom of speech stops short of restaurant and small business owners.\n\nTrust me on this one. Yoko provides excellent food and service at a reasonable price. It is definitely worth your time and money.", "business_id": "Js7xxK2D4Dc0W8XkAzc4cg", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-10-08", "type": "review"}

I like Temari,  but sometimes want a change without having to drive to Scottsdale, or, heaven forbid, suffer the indignity of eating a \"krab\" roll at one of the many \"bigbox\" china buffets in the area.  :-)  \n\nI just found out Sekai Sushi existed the other day...tucked away next to JoAnn Fabrics adjacent to Target.  So, I stopped in for a couple of maki rolls for lunch a few days ago.  The price was right and the taste was there too, so I went back last night to see how their sashimi and more adventurous rolls are. \n\nFirst off, if you Google Sekai Sushi you can find some reviews that bash this place on a couple of different fronts. Most point to poor (and unfriendly) service and decor.  I did not find that to be the case at all. We were greeted with a friendly hello and big smiles from the host and the sushi chef (dude? guy?).  The decor is also just fine. No it's not Stingray or Ra, but it is tastefully decorated and clean. It also isn't cramped like Sekana or Temari, which is nice.\n\nStarted off with salmon sashimi. It was excellent.  Very fresh, clean, buttery taste, and it melted in my mouth. Some of the best quality I have found in the Phoenix area.  Next stop was a Las Vegas roll, along with shrimp tempura roll.  The flavors were there, but the construction was a little lacking as they weren't as tight as they should have been.  Next time I will order more traditional rolls as I saw some go out that looked very well constructed.  I finally tried some nagiri because I felt I must....ha.   I had the hamachi (yellowtail) and I have to say, that it was the best I have ever had.  Supremely fresh, with a velvety (sp?) texture that made my eyes roll back in my head. Good stuff.   I then ended the meal with some green tea ice cream that was better than average.\n\nSoooo....my final thoughts.  I will be going back to Sekai Sushi.  The quality of the food along with the price make this a very attractive sushi option in Mesa.  Regarding the price....the dinner I described above along with two large Asahi's....under $40.

It was a huge disappointment. When I sat at the sushi bar  there was no sushi chef and the waitress immediately came up to me and asked me what I wanted to drink before even handing me a menu. When I requested one she  finally understood what I meant and came back a few minutes later with one. . I made a decision right away and put my menu down but she did not come back for 5 minutes and kept talking to a  coworker.  Considering I was the only person other than one other table of 4, I was getting a little upset at how ignored I was being treated. When she did arrive I finally got to place an order for Ice tea. The chef eventually came out from behind the curtain and after I was able to place an order for my sushi he was very quick to serve me. When I sat down I was very skeptical of this sushi since the fish under the glass looked old quit old. The only sushi i had that night that was good were the salmon and tuna Nigiri. I I also ordered a tempura roll and soft shell crab roll. The soft shell crab was very good however the rice was justto sticky and would not hold the roll together well. I could not pick it up with my chop sticks with out the pieces breaking up so I had to use my hands and the rice just stuck to them and I had to deal with sticky fingers all night. I then ordered their house specially roll with was truly the worst thing I have ever had for $10  It was some imitation crab with a spicy tuna topping and a little salmon roe. Not cold and more  luke warm which never makes me feel good when I have sushi. After finishing my meal my waitress who never came up to see if I was doing OK once during my dinner was in the corner of the restaurant (about 15 feel away) helping some two people saw a piece of wood. I had to request my check from the chef who finally got her attention. When my bill came I was shocked. $35 for Ice tea. 2 Nigiri sushi orders (2 pieces each) 3 rolls. \n\nThe reviews on this site are so old and I hate to say maybe biased  because this place was not in good shape.

A nameless coworker of mine suggested Ichi Ban, located on Alma School and Baseline Rd. Apparently he told us that he had drove by it and thought it would be worth a try. He must have drove by it drunk. The appearance of the building is simply a monstrosity in and of itself. The architects must have been on acid when they designed it because it is such an eye sore. I keep hearing in my head, \"..don't judge a book by its cover\", yet my judgments usally end up being correct. \n\nWhen we walked into the establishment that is Ichi Ban there was nobody in there. I mean it was totally dead. At that moment I felt that if we continued to sit down and eat we might just die. Ichi Ban had Kitchen Nightmare written all over it. I mean, if when you walk into a restaurant and nobody is there take that as a sign from God not to eat. So we sat down and ordered some food. \n\nEverybody got soup. I guess it came with your meal. I didn't try the soup myself, but I looked around and watched as others did. And the reaction on their faces told me that it probably tasted of dishwater. A while after we got our soup our main courses arrived. I had the Teriyaki Chicken. Let me say that the rice was mushy and the chicken was cold. I could hardly eat any of it. The chicken was served on top of a nasty piece of lettuce that just made me want to barf. Forgive me if I am being a little sensational here, I am trying to make up for the lack of sensation I had when eating the food. Two of my other coworkers had some noodle dish of which they complained that there wasn't enough chicken in it. \n\nAs we were eating what we could I saw the cook at the sushi bar premaking some food. There was nobody in the restaurant and I wondered who he was making all of it for. Clearly the food isn't prepared fresh and I could taste it in my own dish. I thought to myself, \"..how long ago was this chicken cooked, because it is cold now.\" I must say that Ichi Ban had one thing going for it, great tasting Coke. \n\nAfter we finished, we got the bill and it ended up costing me $12! I normally don't complain about prices. I'm not poor. But for what we got, it just wasn't worth it. I was pissed. Perhaps I had been a bad boy and maybe that is why I got such horrible food. As we left we all decided not to come back, thank God. I wonder how long Ichi Ban will last before it goes under.

My sister originally wanted to go to Naples Ristorante ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/naples-ristorante-chandler#hrid:aBzZ0Y_OGjtgh9P2AAEMpQ ), her favorite Italian restaurant. But, she noticed Ninja Japanese Restaurant on the way to Naples. Looks like Japanese tonite!\n\nMiso Soup (***) Small oriental-style bowl of over-Salted Miso Soup. Just too much Soy Sauce!\n\nDinner Salad (***) Iceberg Lettuce with a unique Ginger-based Salad Dressing that was reminiscent of Thousand Islands.\n\nBenihana tonight...\nTeriyaki Steak (****) Not up to the quality of the Seafood, but tender nevertheless. Asked for medium-rare... got medium.\n\nShrimp &amp; Scallops (*****) The tenderest Scallops I've had in Phoenix! And the de-shelled Shrimp wasn't half bad either!\n\nSide of Vegetables (*****) Also grilled by the Benihana Cook... noticed the cook uses Butter in almost before grilling anything. Very, very good.\n\nFried Rice (*****) Also a part of the Benihana experience.\n\nThe Hispanic Benihana Cook had worked at Ninja for over five years; he said he started off as a Food Prep person and gradually acquired skills in Benihana Cooking and eventually became a Sushi Chef also. The Cook says it will take three months to acquire the knife-handling skills demonstrated at the beginning of the meal.... knife blades flashing all over, tap-tap-tapping of knives against the grill... pretty impressive, as I'm not a knifing expert!\n\nLemonade (****) Never saw the bottom of the glass... cold and refreshing!\n\nSake (****) My sister didn't want to try straigh Sake. I convinced our waitress to mix a Sake-White Wine Cooler! Worked out pretty well... not as strong as pure Sake, chilled rather than heated.... you can appreciate both types of liquor... chilled!\n\nService (*****) Very friendly and outgoing waitress... who happened to be the sister of the owner. She was very accommodating to the least flexible and least experimental of the family... my sister. Ninja Japanese Restaurant has been at this location for close to thirty years... starting off as a straight Japanese dinner restaurant... adding Benihana Grills and Fans as that type of Japanese cooking became in vogue... then converting some space and adding Cooks for the Sushi craze in the last decade.\n\nTotal tab: $53.\n\nThe decor of the restaurant reflects the changing face of Japanese cooking the last three decades. In the main dining area... 70s style hanging round globe lamps... A more modern Sushi style bar area at the rear of the restaurant where it looks a lot more \"fun\" talking to the Sushi Chef and all that... To the right as you enter, a strictly dated and dark Benihana-style dining area with Grills that could accommodate up to thirteen people and as few as six. Why is it dark? When your Benihana Cook arrives with all the food... he / she gets highlighted by the built-in lamps embedded in the vents above him. Techno Japanese rap was played pretty loud throughout our meal!

I figured there was little to lose.  I was pleasantly surprised with the experience.\n\nTo start off, it was a little hard to find.

The atmosphere inside was nice, it wasn't very busy so it was pretty relaxed.  Very Japanese decor.  We were seated immediately, and water came pretty quickly.\n\nMy one complaint of the evening was the long wait between getting the water and getting the menu.  When the waitress (who was very polite) brought them over, she explained that we could not get all-you-can-eat with our Groupon (sensible) but explained what it entailed for next time.  We ordered 6 or 7 rolls, 6 of which were very tasty.  The 7th...the Volcano Roll... was pretty weird.  It was spicy (not necessarily bad), sea-foody, and seemed to have been fired.  The flavor just wasn't what one expects with sushi.  The Arizona and Vegas rolls were great and the others were pretty good.\n\nThe total bill was very reasonable for 4 people for Sushi.

A real authentic Japanese restaurant TwT!!! It's a rather small and unnoticeable restaurant sitting beside C-Fu, but the moment we got closer to the restaurant, we were already amazed by the beautiful interior of the restaurant! The owner (I guess) came to welcome us as we entered, and seated us at the sushi bar. The whole atmosphere was great, with the jazz and/or bossa nova music in the background, every staff smiling, I felt like going back to Japan again (we were surrounded by lots of Japanese diners in the restaurant too)!!\n\nI ordered sushi pieces and my hubby ordered a grilled beef with herb sauce entree. From our experience that we had from other Japanese restaurants in the valley, entrees like grilled beef are usually very teriyaki like, the way I guess many non-asians are used to and prefer, but we were actually amazed and impressed by the beautiful and delicious grilled beef Shimogamo served!! The arrangement of the plate was a surprise:  some carefully sliced mushrooms put underneath, with grilled beef and some veggies on the top, served on a beautiful modern plate (see picture). It just looked so nice! And we were amazed again when we tasted it; the beef was so tender and the aroma of the herb sauce lingered around your mouth...*w*\n\nThe sushi I ordered were fresh and tender; the fish would just melt in your mouth (including uni and toro)!! I miss this feeling so much since I moved to Arizona last year and haven't been touched by eating any other Japanese food here.

And we decided to check out one of the more promising places in the East Valley.  So we rolled into Shimogamo, a small place next to C-Fu Gourmet and across the street from Lee Lee Market.  With neighbors this Asian, they have to be legit, right?\n\nThe first thing I noticed was a nice list of fish and roll options, but a limited set of specials.  That's fine, maybe we can see if there's anything they're not telling us about... Or ask the chef to make us something interesting.\n\nWe started with the beef carpaccio.  Carpaccio is typically thinly sliced meat, served raw with some marinade, scallions, and other garnishes.  This one was supposed to be seared, but it came out medium.  It was pretty good, but could have been much better if it were actually served rare.\n\nNext, we had something we asked the chef to surprise us with.  Disappointingly, the chef didn't come over and tell us what he made, and the waitress didn't seem to know.  But it involved a tempura-fried whitefish on a bed of Japanese veggies and a tough of tobiko.  It was good, but we were definitely hoping for something a little more interesting.  Probably the least memorable surprise we've had from a sushi chef yet.\n\nNext, we had albacore and escolar sushi.  They were both good, and came garnished, so I didn't add any soy sauce to those... And they were conveniently on the happy hour menu.  Bonus!\n\nWe had a spider roll afterwards, and while I'm not usually a fan of rolls, I always like a good soft-shelled crab.  This one was better than some of the others I've had, on account of the fact that it also had avocado. \n\nThe waitress then brought us our shrimp sashimi (with the fried shrimp heads - make sure you ask for that if you order the fresh shrimp!).  These shrimp were huge, and fresh.  Plus, as an added bonus, the heads came stuffed to the brim with \"goodies.\"  I'm not exactly sure what the goodies are, but they have a distinct flavor, and I suspect it is a mix of central nervous system and the free-form liver/pancreatic capabilities that most crustaceans are endowed with.\n\nWe had the tuna poke, which seems to be Shimogamo's signature dish.  It tastes great, but it is quite basic.  Basically just tuna and avocado topped with a lightly fried quail egg.  This is one of those times when \"less is more\" is true.\n\nAfter this, we had another item on the specials board, the orange yellowtail.  This is yellowtail sashimi marinaded with citrus flavor, served with sliced avocado and a touch of sriracha.  This was actually pretty delicious.\n\nFinally, we finished with salmon roe and scallop nigiri, and quail eggs.  The salmon roe was some of the best I've had in awhile (they didn't have that fishy flavor that you sometimes get at a place with limited quality control).\n\nUnfortunately, a few of the things we wanted to order were not available.  They didn't have any uni, baby yellowtail, or toro, which was really quite a bummer.  The owner explained to us that the market price is simply too high right now for him to be able to avoid throwing a bunch out, so I appreciate his willingness to only serve what he can guarantee to be fresh.  Some of this is the fault of their clientele, who from what I could tell, is very caucasian, and might not be interested in paying top dollar for a great cut of fish.  \n\nMy final verdict on Shimogamo is that it's good, but a clear step below the best sushi places I've been to.  Everything was fresh, and the dishes were well-executed.  Furthermore, the prices were reasonable.  All of these make it a very respectable location, and potentially the best in the East Valley (we'll have to try the competition, of course).  \n\nWhere they fall short is in two areas: first, the menu (and it seems the chefs) lack creativity.  They do a limited set of dishes well, but they don't seem to be food artists.  It's a little too generic.  Second, the waitress didn't seem very knowledgeable about some of the menu items, and had to ask the chef about a few things.  If she is relatively new, I could give her a pass.\n\nShimogamo may compete for the \"best in East Valley\" subcategory, but it can't quite hang in the top tier.", "business_id": "un3KC2gyMrSG6yqjVRctXg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-11-08", "type": "review"}

I've been to them all and Shimogamo, Yasu's, and Toyama are high above the rest of them.  Warm and inviting, this place is a classy well decorated and lit restaurant tucked into a strip mall.  Head sushi chef Zach has an appetite for bringing in interesting fish and items and is never allowing his customers to get board.  His efforts to bring in new and fresh fish are a reward for those of us who have eaten sushi all of our lives.  It is also a great place to go to early and get some great prices on beer and food.  $4 large Sapporo when many places try and get $8-$10.  \n\nA few things are a must if you come here.  The salmon skin rolls here is done 10X better than any place I have ever eaten at.  They make sure the skin is warm and crispy and loaded up.  The sweet shrimp are also a winner.  I spent most of my life not liking raw shrimp but Shimogamo has changed my mind.  I also love all of the crispy parts of the body that are cooked.\n\nOysters are always wonderful here as are the fresh scallops when they have them.  An absolute must is the Escolar with the Jalapeno.   I never ate Escolar prior and I would normally think that a Jalapeno would overpower such a mild fish but just GET IT.  They torch the fish to draw out some fats and the Jalapeno has wicked smoky flavor.  If you don't like it I can truly say you are strange!  :)\n\nThe toro the last few times is better than anything I have tasted in a decade.    The king salmon, fresh mackerel, and Uni are always fresh and perfect.   \n\nEverything we have had from the \"cooked\" kitchen is also very good so even if your friends do not eat sushi I would not hesitate to bring them along.  \n\nBe careful for lunch because they are only open on Friday I believe.  Reservations are a good idea unless you are there very early or late.  Music is always right on with nice ambient grooves from Thievery Corp and similar bands.  \n\nLastly if you have a large private party for a special occasion they have a back room that can feel very private and classy.

We tried this place for the first time on a Friday night. We sat down at a 2 person table by the sushi bar to look at the menu, and we couldn't even think because the sushi chef was so loud. One of the first things I heard him shout was his experience with \"hookers and blow\". He made several more loud references to crack and cocaine throughout our dining experience, which, in my opinion, is tasteless. Keep that between you and your buddies after hours.  The sushi chef was loud the entire time, and he was talking to the couple at the bar who were right in front of him (no need to shout). We placed our order and proceeded to wait..and wait..and wait. 30 minutes later the sushi chef shouted out our order to the kitchen (for the cooked items). He had the order in front of him the whole time. Meanwhile several more patrons show up and sit at nearby tables and the sushi bar. Within minutes the people at the sushi bar had rolls and appetizers. About 40 minutes after placing our order we finally got part of our order. \n\nLong story short: great place if you are the party that's getting preferential treatment. If not, be prepared to wait (and bring earplugs).", "business_id": "un3KC2gyMrSG6yqjVRctXg", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-11-06", "type": "review"}

SSSSsoooooo glad we did!\n\nNice atmosphere, kind of reminded us of a NY restaurant, long & not very wide, full of good food and conversation.  Our waitress was very nice and  helpful.  Average prices for the most part, although we gorged ourselves silly and the bill was testament to that!\n\nI was a little leery about the huge amount of rolls they had on the menu, but we sampled 6 or 7 different ones and enjoyed them all.

Both were nice and spicy and fresh, well made and so damn tasty. \n\nTheir chili sauce and garlic sauce rock, and contrasted nicely with another roll we got that had a lemony sauce.  They have a large variety of rolls from savory to spicy and a few on the sweeter side.  If they do them all as well as the ones we tried, kudos to them.  The sashimi tasted fresh to us and was nicely done as well, we had some different tunas and unagi, they were all good.\n\nNow I just have to find more sushi buddies so I can go often!!

If this were a contest, Temari would win, hands down.\n\nThis looked like one of the most promising places in a very generic East Valley sushi scene, so we decided to give it a shot.  When I sat down, our eager waiter asked me what I'd like to drink.  I asked him if they only have fountain sodas, and he looked at me like I was speaking Greek.  I said, \"What do you have, bottles?\"  He said they don't have cans or anything; it just comes out of a gun.  So... Fountain sodas then.  Got it.\n\nMy friend said his Mr. Pibb tasted off, and asked to switch to Coke.  He said sure, but he'll have to pay for the Coke.\n\nNow, on to the food.... I looked at the menu.  I saw about three pages of rolls.  I looked at the specials board.  More rolls.  Looked at the regular menu.... Standard Japanese fare.  They have teriyaki.  TERIYAKI!  Who eats teriyaki?  This isn't Samurai Sam's, is it?\n\nThey have some sashimi.  All very standard cuts of fish.  Tuna, white tuna, salmon, yellowtail, sea bass, and mackerel is probably all they had.  Maybe the weakest selection I've seen, well, anywhere.  The nigiri sushi (which I'm pretty sure I heard our waiter pronounce as \"NIGH gi ri\" sushi to the diners at the next table) was pretty standard as well.  Ra has better selection.  Yes, that's right, Ra, one of the most notoriously generic sushi restaurants in the world, has a better selection of fish than Temari!\n\nAnyways, at about six different points while I was looking through the tome they call a \"specials menu\" (which consists of about 99.5% rolls, plus tuna poke), our eager waiter asked us if we know what we would like yet.  Sorry, bro, can't you see I'm reading here!  I'm like half way through!  My eyes are getting tired from reading the words \"spicy tuna,\" \"eel sauce,\" and \"chili sauce\" so much!  Because 75% of the rolls have one of more of those ingredients!\n\nIt was amazing how many different rolls they had, yet how few of them actually sounded appealing.  Most of them seemed to be more focused on sauces and spice than actual fish flavor.  It's like people who eat sushi in Gilbert don't want to taste the awful flavor of fish!  Gross, right!  Fish, ugh!  I pointed out to my friend that one particular roll \"has like three sauces: chili sauce, eel sauce, garlic citrus sauce, and kiwi sauce. Four sauces!\" (imagine the Spanish Inquisition.)\n\nAnyways, about our actual order: we went with the \"chef's choice\" sashimi platter, a romantic roll (cucumber with a bunch of stuff inside), a sunkist roll (some fish completely drowned in citrus flavor), and amaebi and quail egg sushi.  I think \"chef's choice\" means \"cheapest,\" because no real sushi chef would put both tuna and salmon on his own plate if he were picking what he wanted to eat.  The sashimi itself was OK I guess.  The rolls were very boring, as we expected.  The sweet shrimp was good, but you can tell what type of clientele they have when they placed the heads on our table, and the diners at the next table over seemed awestruck by the fact that someone would actually eat a shrimp head, what with those cute little eyeballs staring at them.\n\nThis brings me to the conclusion of this review: this place utterly destroyed our hope of finding a good sushi bar in the East Valley.  Shimogamo was respectable, but even there, the owner was unable to keep the best cuts of fish in stock because he had no confidence his clientele would buy enough of it to keep it fresh.  This is the East Valley.  People think sushi is a bunch of rolls.  You ask an East Valley denizen about their favorite sushi place, and they say, \"I like this place, they have great rolls!\"  Only here can a sushi bar stock just seven cuts of fish, and just offer 500 rolls with the same ten ingredients, and maybe serve some teriyaki chicken for those who REALLY hate sushi, and be successful.\n\nI think we're going to look for the East Valley sushi bar with the lowest yelp rating, because that one is probably the best.  At least they didn't end up charging us for that extra Coke.\n\nAddendum: I was just reminded about the fortune cookie they served with dessert.  A fortune cookie!  At a Japanese Restaurant!  On the back of the fortune it said \"Learn Chinese.\"  Not making this up.", "business_id": "Er20nsiOS6TFHmAE717iTA", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-11-29", "type": "review"}

There was ONE sliced tomato and no mushrooms . The gingery dressing that I once loved has now been converted into the salty, orange mess.  I tried to eat it but after I felt the taste buds in my mouth disintegrating from sodium overload, I stopped. \n\nNext came the sushi.  We ordered 3 different rolls; soft shell crab, Tootsie, and a spicy tuna.  They were all wrapped so loose that it made it next to impossible to eat with chopsticks.  I hate when I see people eating sushi with their hands, but last night I was one of those people.  I tasted one of the spicy tuna rolls and decided it was best not eat another one.  It tasted....fishy.....and anyone sushi eater knows that when fish tastes fishy, its bad news.\n\nOn a good note, the server was very nice. She took spicy tuna off the bill since we had only consumed one. She also offered free dessert but we declined and left.

True sushi chefs pay incredible attention to mouthfeel, the ratio of ingredients, the cuts that they make, the temperature of the ingredients that they serve, the incredibly sharp edge on their very delicate obscenely expensive knives, etc...  Even the sushi rice is very hard to make properly and is a skill unto itself. When done right, sushi can be truly amazing.\nThis place doesn't care about those details.  If you want to scarf down large quantities of thick cut rolls and nigiri for cheap, this is your place.  Some people are into that.

That way you can order a good variety and not have to eat entire rolls by yourself.", "business_id": "ishjLG3Sc94ZOelXZZhaIw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-09-20", "type": "review"}

While the food was okay, a little bland for my taste.  I've been to Benihana's before and this was probably a little below expectations.  However, our chef is what inspired me to give this one five stars.  It was the two kids first experience to a teppan restaurant and our chef definitely played to them.  It was an awesome experience for the kids which made all the adults happy.\n\nMy favorite part was when our chef asked the little boy in our group to cook the chicken gave him a spatula and kept asking if he remembered to flip the chicken.

Rather than offer any kind of apology or a free round of drinks or complimentary appetizer, the staff actually seemed irritated that we wanted them to correct the mistake. Saying \"actually we normally seat 11 people at one table,\" (not possible, you couldn't have 11 oompah loompas at one table; these chairs wouldn't fit, people would have to eat with plates in their laps). \n\nWe were re-seated 10 minutes later at two tables, but I wish the situation had been handled differently because I would love to give five stars.

The chicken fried rice is amazing as are the shrimp and filet mignon. In fact, I've liked pretty much everything I've had...but definitely choose the filet over the hibachi steak. I like how they take your picture and give it to you right away because it makes for some fun memories. The green tea ice cream isn't very good...so next time I'll just stick with vanilla or chocolate.

We had Japanese beer that was very light and tasted pretty good. I think I will stick to Bud Light if I want a light beer though. We opted to do the chef's special which was filet mignon and chicken for two people. We received soup and salad before the hibachi chef got to our table. I really enjoyed the soup and ate just a bit of my salad. I usually like the ginger dressing to be more creamy rather than chunky ( I am from the south).  Our hibachi chef -Michael was very talented and gave us more than plenty to eat. He of course made a volcano - but oddly no fire was lit (maybe safety regulations) all in all he was very entertaining.  We got fried rice, a shrimp appetizer, veggies, and of course chicken and meat. It came with two sauces- one spicy/chili like and the other was a mustard based sauce. I asked the server if I could have some Shrimp sauce (yummy yummy sauce). He said they did not have any- it isn't out in this region. He told me it was more Midwestern and southern. I don't think Arizonians know what they are missing. The sauce MAKES fried rice taste even better than it already is. I don't get why any hibachi restaurant doesn't have it out here.  Anyways, our meal was delicious. I had a wonderful time and leftovers to eat. I plan on going back for special occasions  or with my 30 dollar gift certificate you get for your birthday.", "business_id": "ishjLG3Sc94ZOelXZZhaIw", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-09-19", "type": "review"}

So not only did I have to pay for my meal (which I didnt expect), but i left my entire entree at the restaurant because I had to get to work. They offered to hold it for me, but i didnt have time to get back there. So basically I paid $35 for an entree I did not receive. So frustrating.
