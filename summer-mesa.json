The administration staff is confused, unorganized and incompetent! I don't understand how they run a business. They might have a better chance of running a three-legged race against Siamese twins.\n  I am trying to get an MRI in which my physical therapist referred me and sent a fax to AZ-tech for treatment. \n  Az-tech was supposed to call me back the same day to set up an appointment. Didn't get a call that day. Fine. Called them the next day and asked them about the fax from my doctor and setting an appointment. The receptionist was confused and kept trying to look up my information. I told her I was a new patient and there was a fax and she kept asking for my name and date of birth. She was obviously confused because asked at least 4 times in a row. For Christ's sake and all that is Holy!! Write it down if you cant remember! She then told me she couldn't find the fax and would call me back. She said \"The best number to reach you at is 602..what is your number?\" Why did she start telling ME what the best number to reach me at?\n  Nevertheless, I didn't get a call back that day. \n  I called the next morning and told them I need to set an appointment and I was supposed to get a call back the last 2 days. I was given their standard 4 repeated questions about my name and date of birth and then put on hold. She said they never received a fax. I asked why didn't get a call the past 2 days. The woman told me in a defensive tone that they called me yesterday and left a message. I had never received a call, let alone a message!!!! So my call history in my phone and voice-mails must be deleting themselves? \n  I got off the phone with them and called my physical therapist. I told them AZ-tech never received a fax to which they replied they sent the fax twice. I was livid at this point because I had to schedule an appointment with the therapists but appointment to do the MRI and kept pushing it back. \n  I then called AZ-tech back and told them that a fax was sent twice. They were confused about receiving a fax (no surprise) and they put me on hold. They finally found it and set up an appointment. I tried to let them know that they \"need to get it together over there\". And the receptionist was bewildered and asked, \"We need to get what?\"\n  I called my therapist back to then set an appointment following the MRI. I expressed my displeasure toward the Gilbert office, so she set me up with the Tempe office at a different time. \n Today due to traffic and crazy construction I was running late to the appointment. I called the Tempe AZ-tech location to notify my tardiness. They told me that their MRI machine was down and they tried to call me the day before. They said they would set up an appointment at 10:00 at the Gilbert location a little later in the day. I was dreading it with my recent interaction. With their reputation I decided it would be a good idea to call that office beforehand. \n  When I called I told them my name and that the Tempe office had set up an appointment for me at that location today because their MRI machine was down. Literally the lady then asked, \"So you want to set up an appointment for tomorrow?\" I had no patience left and replied, \"Did you hear what I just said?\" \n So I repeated my name and everything very slowly.\n Of course she asked me my name again and then told me the appointment was set for 9:30. I told her that the other office told me 10:00. DONE. Needless to say, I didn't show up to the appointment. This company is all out of whack. \n\n If you feel like being frustrated have them take care of you.

I had Ann and she was good, I liked my mani and pedi. It was a little strange because she did the mani while I was still sitting in the pedicure chair... but whatever. I didn't like that we were constantly being sold things, even though this isn't that weird, they tried to sell us designs, waxing, gels, and shellac. We didn't want any of it.... so it was a little weird. My friend's mani and pedi was not as good as mine. The woman who did her nails was a little rough and left some parts of her nails less painted than others, like near her cuticles. So, I think it is kind of like, you get what you pay for.... I don't know if I'd go back, but I have had much better mani and pedis elsewhere. So if you want a cheap, but fine manicure, this is a good place. Otherwise... maybe try somewhere else, like nails 8000 down the street, which is much nicer.\n\nUpdate... the manicure chipped the next day.... can see grow out and the nail polish seems cheap.

Lazy, useless employees and extortionate prices combine to make this place as bad as one of Dante's circles of hell. I don't think I've ever dealt with this place without wanting to strangle someone afterwards. With apologies to ole Bill Shakespeare, how does MCC's bookstore suck? Let me count the ways. Here are a few encounters I've had over the years:\n\nOne time, a few years ago, I called for some information and got a hold of some barely coherent girl who sounded like she was stoned. I finally hung up on her and called back later, hoping to get a hold of someone else a little bit easier to deal with.\n\nOne time, I needed to re-take college algebra as a refresher because I had waited too long since I last time I took it to be able to use it as a prerequisite. I was hoping I could use my old CA book that the bookstore wouldn't buy back from me earlier, but no such luck. Those butt pirates at Pearson had produced another edition since I had taken it last and that edition was the one specified to be used in the course information. I was hoping could buy the newer edition, take it home, compare it with the book I already had, and if the two were similar enough, return the book I had just bought for a refund and then use the old one. Again no such luck. The bookstore only had new copies of the latest College Algebra book and told me that once I had taken it out of the shrink wrap, I couldn't return it. So I bought it (for $133), took it home, took it out of the shrink wrap and then compared it to my old book just to find out how badly I had just gotten screwed over. Except for the cover and illustrations, the two books were completely identical, RIGHT DOWN TO THE WRONG ANSWERS IN THE BACK OF THE FUCKING BOOK!!! *cue Sam Kinison scream*\n\nOne time, I called the bookstore asking if they had any used copies of a certain book. The person on the other end of the line, a rather stupid sounding reject, told me he couldn't tell me. \"Really, you lazy, worthless fuck?\" I thought, \"you can't walk ten shitting feet over to where the books are, look at them, and walk back and tell me what you see?\" He told me I'd have to check online at bkstr.com and see for myself. Bkstr said there were no copies in stock, but since I had never known anything associated with this bookstore to be anything other than incompetent and shambolic (except for when they were making time fucking students in the ass) I suspected that bkstr.com might not be giving me accurate information. I went down to the bookstore to check in person and, yep, you guessed it: there were about 30 used copies of that book sitting right there on the shelf. \n\nI just recently went to this bookstore to sell back a textbook, a ridiculously overpriced and expensive textbook that I hoped to get a good chunk of change back for. There was some very minor water damage to a few pages where I had been flipping through it with sweaty hands (I sweat a lot) but all the content was still legible (none of it was even smudged) and all the pages were all still intact. The book was completely serviceable, but they refused to buy it back from me. And I wasn't the only one being screwed out of the deal: there was another student somewhere that was going to have to spend an extra $50 for a new copy of the book because my used copy wouldn't be sitting there on the shelf for him to buy. I was so pissed off that I went back and complained the manager. She said the book was in acceptable condition and that they's buy it back from me, but also insulted me by implying that I was lying about not having spilled anything on it. \n\nThis last incident infuriated me so much that I vowed to never have anything to do with these brigands ever again if I could possibly avoid it. I started googling around and found that you can usually get used textbooks way cheaper on Amazon than what they cost here; just make sure you search by ISBN and not title so you get the right book. Indeed, I found my latest textbook on Amazon for about 1/3 what they're asking at the campus bookstore: $244 at the campus bookstore vs. $84 on Amazon. And it's the same edition, too. \n\nIn closing, I see no reason for anyone to shop here, unless he's a masochist who enjoys throwing money away. If you're an MCC student remember: friends don't let friends shop at the the campus bookstore.", "business_id": "XKrEnL9yCtlhhIa6efbtGQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-07-13", "type": "review"}

There are about 5-7 Vietnamese places within a 10 mile radius of this place and I find it strange that their prices are higher than all the rest. Their soup in pho wasnt especially good, though it was passable. Their rice dishes seemed to be on par with others but for the price you would expect more. The only redeeming thing about this place would be the more contemporary decor that you don't see in most other Vietnamese places.

That's diep ca!  It's very good for you.  Some people don't like it... Next time we'll leave it out.\"\n\nand that was that.\n\nIck.\n\nWho likes the taste of rotten fish?

My wife went to Dr. Zenner to update her medications as we had moved from Colorado to the Valley.  When she walked in, the waiting room was full of people.  She signed in and waited for more than 45 minutes past her appointment time before she went looking for someone to find out when she would be seen.  There was no staff at the desk and she had to go looking through the office to find someone to help her.  After getting to an employee, she told them that she had to get back to work and needed to know when she would be seen.  The employee responded \"Patients are normally seen an hour after their appointment time\".  Understandably, this upset my wife and she asked to reschedule.\n     When the office called her back she was told that the doctor did not want her as a patient and that her office co-pay would be refunded.  She was told they did not want patients that would walk out on appointments.  It wouldn't be so bad, but it was clear from her experience that they were trying to push through as many people as they could in as short a time as possible.  They had no care in how they approached their patients or their mental health needs.  The office was run down and the overall vibe was like being at the DMV.  Not good for someone who is supposed to be helping patients.\n\n     If you are looking for a good psychiatrist, we suggest you take Dr. Zenner's approach to his patients and fire him before you see him.", "business_id": "CcBOox3znUKO0zV464Jv3Q", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-07-26", "type": "review"}

My original birth plan was to be a a fancier hospital in North Scottsdale because of their reputation.  I had been to Banner Desert a couple of times to visit friends who had given birth and I was never impressed.\n\nI was admitted to the hospital by a high risk OBGYN due to high blood pressure and possible pre-eclampsia.  I went in with the thought that I would be in for 48 hours of observation and then on my way out to enjoy bed rest in the comfort of my own home.  Well, I ended up staying for 5 weeks.  During this time, I was taken care of in their Antepartum unit.  The nurses and aides were amazing.  They were kind, compassionate and treated me like family rather than just another patient.  They were not only accomodating to me but my husband who stayed the night several times per week.  \n\nAfter 5 weeks it was time to have my baby delivered.  I couldn't deliver naturally so the doctors took me in for an emergency c-section.  I was so terrified and as the surgery began, I was alone in the operating room with only surgery techs and the anesthesiologist.  I told one of the techs how scared I was and she held my hand while I received my spinal and talked to me the whole time which kept me calmed down.  As terrifying as the experience could have been, everyone in the OR was wonderful.\n\nMy baby has been in the NICU for 4 weeks now and has not been all smooth sailing.  My baby got NEC, a very serious intestinal disease, but was caught early and resolved because of fast acting nurses and doctors.  And while I'd much rather have my daughter home with me, I feel very comfortable knowing she is in the wonderful hands of the NICU team.\n\nAfter this experience, I would never want to be at any other hospital.", "business_id": "Rm8jCL-8fbBAPtPpBJGu7Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-07-10", "type": "review"}

I was told that his condition is not life threatening and he can wait and the reason that it is taking so long is because of the family members like myself who are distracting them from work. Really? I can't ask questions but I sure should be responsible for the thousands of dollars you're going to bill me later???

They serve Kool-Aid and Tang at the fountain which is one of the greatest ideas ever. They also serve iced yerba mate alongside their regular iced tea, which I had a taste of (pretty good) but couldn't drink a full cup of since I wasn't allowed caffeine at the time.\n\nThe place markers they give you to recognize who you are and give you the correct sandwich are so different than other places - pictures of Nirvana, Wayne's World, etc... Despite the sign joking your sandwich would take a while, I actually received my sandwich like a minute or two after sitting down, even though the place was really busy. And it was amazing! Amazing enough for me to come back the next day too.\n\nYou can have hemp cream cheese (not sure what that entails), hemp brownies, goo balls (rice krispie treats made with honey, cocoa, and peanut butter), and you can even get your sandwich on garlic bread. That's a super stoner idea if I've ever seen one. I haven't tried any of these so now Cheba Hut needs to come to the bay area so I can do so, ok? ;)\n\nVerdict: The decor is hilarious, the ambiance is great, there's various flavors of Kool-Aid, the service is quick, and the food is good.

Growing up in a Chinese family, I've learned to take my Chinese food very seriously and can safely say that the food here is pretty decent - not spectacular, but not bad. \n\nAs for the service...let's be honest. The majority of Asian restaurants in general have this type of service.

I thought maybe it was a language barrier...but my buddy said he was his least favorite waiter and a horrible one at that.  We both work in the service industry and are very sensitive to bad service.  He took our order competently and brought us back cokes and waters (always order water!!).  He brought the food out and was not very agile in placing our plates (my buddy ordered for both of us and always listens to his stomach!).  Twice I thought he was going to put a plate on top of a plate...I hate when I have to move stuff around for them to place it.  After that...we didn't hear from him until he brought the check...even the sound of a straw being sucked with little beverage failed to get his attention.  Finally a girl who was hanging out by the kitchen spotted us and brought refills.  The service was the worst part...\n\nThe food was incredible.  My buddy ordered a 1/2 duck, 1/2 chicken, pepper pork chops, beef chow fun and Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce.  \n\nI've never had duck this good.  This duck was actually meaty (still bony, but what can you do right).  Very, very good.  Blew the chicken away.  The chicken was good too...but it was a very familiar taste.  Beef chow fun isn't my favorite noodle, i prefer chow mien, but I went with it and it was good.  The pepper pork chop was very good.  I think i ate more of that then anything else.  The Chinese broccoli was delicious and I ate many stalks of it (and I'm pretty much anti-vegetable unless prepared perfectly).  \n\nI hear they have other servers that are better and I'd recommend going in on their days of work.

Decent food muddled by horrible service, becoming a bit overpriced as well.\n\nWell what can I say about best hong kong?  Rather than going on a tirade of negativity, I'll list the good things about it.  The food is decent, half the time...... well that's it, I guess.  Now the tirade: When you go sit there, it doesn't inspire you to eat.  Looks dirty everywhere, it may not be actually dirty but you just feels creeped out.  The staff is rude from owner/hostess up front, any one of the non english speaking waiters, and the bussers.  To get something extra like rice or water is like taking a kidney from them.  Food is sometimes good on not so oily but it's hit or miss really.  Only reason I go there is for the duck, it's probably one of the better dishes anywhere.  I don't bother dining in anymore, just get my duck and vamoose. It used to be pretty affordable, but over time the prices have gone up a lot.  When I started coming here the whole duck was 12$ now half a duck is 10$. \n\nAlthough I have never been chased by the staff, two of my friends were chased out to the parking lot demanding 15% or more on the tips.  There service is probably deserves a -15%, it's that bad.  I'm really surprised by the general disregard for customers.

It looked old and...not renovated!

When our drinks arrived, there were bits of mysterious black stuff on his ice and my barley tea seemed to have some weird taste. \n\nRegardless, we were still happily expecting our lunch combos and patiently waited...not long afterwards our lunch came and our meals looked nice. I couldn't wait to try the maguro on my rice but...nothing special? The maguro was cut in pieces of various lengths and shapes and they're salty without the soy sauce. I understand that Japanese chefs would add wasabi and soy sauce in the fish first so that you don't normally need to add soy sauce yourself but I think they added too much or marinated for too long. It's a big no-no to treat fish in my opinion, because you won't be able to taste the real taste or covered the freshness of the fish (and I think the fish was not fresh).\n\nI tried the miso soup and it was really salty too (I couldn't sense the taste of miso). \"It couldn't be!\" I thought, after seeing all the raves on Yelp, so I tried my hubby's beef curry and...still no surprise. It's quite tasteless even to my standard and I actually enjoy light flavored meals most of the time. The fried chicken on the side was unexpectedly the only thing I found OK. \n\nWell we thought we should never have such high expectations for a family restaurant but we were really extremely disappointed and regretted about our visit, and we both thought our lunch was over-priced (ended up paying almost $30 including tax and tips) for such standard of food. We thought perhaps we should give Toh Zan one more chance to see if their other foods are great, but hesitated and concluded that we probably won't want to try again. :(", "business_id": "BBPkwpj9kSeDuy0uOwWHJA", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-07-16", "type": "review"}

Bori cha is only served in the summer, and it's an non sweetened ice tea. I haven't had bori cha in about 15 yrs. Most Korean restaurants don't brew it (to serve to patrons). \n\nI was really impressed by that. \n\nThey also serve Raw Crab Marinade(Kye JJang), which I'd been craving for a very long time. This is  also a dish you're unlikely to get at other Korean restaurants. It was legit. For someone who was raised on Korean food, but doesn't get it often enough, I was so happy I could have cried. It was well balanced, spicy, and just out of this world. \n\nMy bibim naengmyung was sooo good. I was already sold by the other stuff, but the naengmyung was the cherry on top. It was just like homemade. Their side dishes were generous. We got tofu with soy sauce/chives on top, steamed broccoli, soy bean sprouts, kimchee (which was really delectable), pickled cucumbers, and braised potato. \n\nWe also got the fried gyoza. Normally, these are pre-made from the Korean store. Not at this restaurant; you could tell someone's grandma made these. Instead of the standard 6, we got about 10 of them. The dipping sauce was light.\n\nI live 30 min away, but this place was definitely worth the drive.

WTF!!! they should have told me that at the door. The band that was playing was more interested in fornicating with one groupie that was there. We had to hear a whole monologue from each of the band memebers about how they deserved a dollar stuffed in their whiteys which was fine as long as they actually played a song but nooooo... we will not play until we get a dollar stuffed down our small weenies. \"Then I will give a lap dance to the groupie and still not play\". \n\nGreat!! and I had to be there to waste my time and money to observe this. Then I hear the last group ain't here. So I basically paid a cover charge to see drunk band members hit on groupies.\n\n And lets not talk about the turd they served me as bar food. The grilled chicken burger turned out to be raw and the soup was well... bleech....\n\nWhy oh why do I subject myself to this mishandling... oh right I like dive bars, food joints etc.... because I believe mom and pop type establishments try their best to serve people well.....\n\nParadigm shift with this establishment... service was apathetic.. food well.... grungy... and music..... blase....\n\nTruly a disappointment to my core beliefs", "business_id": "Cp5_NSJFNgylD5SUdmT8nQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-07-31", "type": "review"}

If your kid gets bored of playing in the waiting room, they can also watch a movie on TV.   Defying there namesake, SwimKids also offers dance and gymnastics.  As gymnastics was full, we're doing dance, which probably fits in well with other dance classes we do. Hey, we don't have the tag along kid (i.e., a sibling), we can over schedule and indulge in too many classes.", "business_id": "WOgYQltFy-NhgYQzsMEfKw", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-08-20", "type": "review"}

Our old instructor Mr Brian was awesome.  Then he left Saturday's (the only day we could go) and he was replaced by someone who didn't really know how to teach or talk to children for that matter.  They also made my sons class the \"misc\" class.  What was a class full of kids who were in the same level as him turned into a class mainly of kids who were afraid of water.  So my son got no attention or guidance of things he used to be working on.  He was back to learning how to blow \"bubbles\"  He eventually just stopped caring and really stopped paying attention.  The new teacher had no idea how to control him and just ignored him.  \n\nWe went here for 1 1/2 years and I just feel like management doesn't care about the paying customer.  I had legitimate complaints and no one seemed to care.  No one called and asked if we wanted a new class.  Not to mention, I was only told that all classes in his level were full on Saturday's but I could call daily and see if that changed.   If these courses cost a couple bucks a class, I wouldn't care either but I was paying about $20 for a 30 minute class.  Towards the end when Mr. Brian was transitioning his replacement to take over, my son was not taught anything.  I really felt like I was throwing away money and no one bothered to have an answer.  Mr. Brian was really the only person who cared but just told me his hands were tied and there was nothing he could do except enroll my son in one of his classes during the week.\n\nThe reason why this place get's two stars is Mr. Brian.  He really is amazing with kids.  If you do decide to go here, only go to Mr. Brian.  He's wonderful at getting kids to listen and explaining what he's doing with the kids.\n\nI now take my son to Chandler Public Swim classes and he loves it.  They are actually teaching him to swim and the cost for classes is 2/3 the price.   For the last 1 1/2 years, my son has learned what to do if he falls into a pool.  While I think it's a incredibly important lesson for a kid to learn, Swimkids focuses on it waaaaaay too long.  If my son still went to swimkids, it would be another year before they actually taught him how to swim.  \n\nBottom line, if you have a two year old and you don't want him to be afraid of water, call and see if Mr Brian has availability.  If not hang up and try later.  Take classes until your kids is comfortable with water and can float on his back for 10 seconds.  After that, quit.  Trust me, that's all they're going to teach your kid until he's 5.", "business_id": "WOgYQltFy-NhgYQzsMEfKw", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-07-29", "type": "review"}

I said \"you didn't tell us that & its on your menu\". He said \"I can credit you a pizza AND wings\". I said \"and how will you remember this or assure me ?\" He said \"I'll put it in the system\".

All I have are parakeets.\"\n\nFor the bird impaired: Budgerigars, or Budgies, are commonly known as parakeets.\n\nI opened my mouth to say something, then thought maybe she meant they were boarding the whole flock of mixed American, English, and English cross budgies in the corner cage and she meant Ringneck Parakeets or something, so I asked her how much they were. Thirty bucks, right on target for an overpriced budgie. I smiled, said thankyou, and tried to leave without dying of laughter. \n\nI really, really hope this isn't known as THE place to go for birds and bird related stuff. They had a good selection of your run of the mill toys and boings etc. (don't laugh at me, bird folk will know what I'm talking about) and I was happy to see that they carry Roudybush and Harrisons. Their cages are outrageously priced.\n\nOn to the birds. I couldn't tell which birds were permanent fixtures of the shop, which were for sale, and which were boarding. It was a clusterf*ck of feathers and crap. Birds are everywhere, some of them thankfully out of cages but then there are Grays and Amazons in cages sized for Budgies (er I mean parakeets, my bad). My first impression upon entering was \"ugh\" as it looked like the place hadn't had a proper cleaning in ages. Yes, birds are messy... very messy... but you do not need more birds than you can handle. I figured the employees must be crazy busy, and its the end of the day, and they will clean up later.\nAgain, I couldn't tell who was boarding and who was for sale and who lived there, but I wasn't too happy to hear a ton of \"Hello!\" and wolf whistles and even one who sounded like it was yelling \"Help help!\" and then crying. My first thought was \"I wonder if these people are getting rehomed birds off of craigslist and then selling them.\"\n\nWhich brings us to the employees. Aside from the obvious lack of knowledge from the owner (I'm assuming!) of all people, the service was more than lacking. My husband tried to get the attention of one of several employees to ask them what time they closed (as it was about 6 and the last place we tried to make it to closed at 5). He said they were all in their employee area, on Craigslist. Hmmm. That's very odd to me. The owner didn't even come out until a herd of children came shrieking in. We'd been there about 15 minutes. They didn't need to be typing away. They needed to be cleaning.\n\nWe used to do parrot rescue and when I got pregnant we decided not to bring in any more birds. We found good homes for the guys we had saved and tore down our cages. We moved to Mesa after the baby was born, and now that he's older I was hoping to find the same quality bird store out here as there was in Glendale to network with. I was sourly disappointed. I will be making the ONE HOUR DRIVE instead to my old store, which I can't remember the name of LOL but I will post it next time I go. \n\nThese kooks will not be getting a penny of mine unless they wise up, magically become nice, and scrub every inch of this place with a toothbrush.", "business_id": "_PFouVh3JXbrZpUj0KANwA", "stars": 1, "date": "2009-08-04", "type": "review"}

Some where in aquariums, I saw six macaws crammed into a cage that I use at home for my one macaw, and there was feces everywhere.  I don't think I saw even one bird that I wanted to put my hand near.  I do not understand why they would have so many birds and so few people to adequately clean up after them and give them enough attention.

I cannot in good consciousness support a business that has such deplorable conditions.

See, I'd read reviews of a couple other places I liked and some were dead wrong, so I thought Cage World might have received a few bogus reviews.  My son and I went in trying to find the positive and to form our own opinions.\n\nWhen we arrived there were lots of cages outside the shop for sale.  We thought, \"Hey this is great!  Look at all the options!\".  Then we went inside.  It was kind of dark and dank in there, but we were told (much later) that they were about to move the shop to a different locale so we figured they were trying to upgrade.  We weren't really concerned with the lighting anyway, but with the birds.  \n\nWhen we walked in, no one greeted us.  Even though there were employees in the back that could see us, no one bothered to get up to come say hi.  Finally a young boy who was cleaning came out and said hi.  He was very polite and answered questions we had about the birds  in their \"Babies\" section.  I'd never seen a baby Macaw before and was asking how old it was, etc.  Other \"Babies\" in that area didn't look all that young, but I don't really know what they are supposed to look like so I put it down to my ignorance.\n\nWe wandered around and went in the back area where all the cages were.  Then we saw the back area where they have the boarded birds, etc.  Ugh.  There were literally small plastic bins with baby cockatiels inside with just a bit of metal cage parts covering the top to keep them in. Overly crowded is putting it mildly.  Birds in a plastic bin.  Even my ignorance couldn't be blamed on this sad state of affairs.  No animal should be crowded like that.  EVER.   One baby had hopped up on top and later flew down to the floor.  We figured maybe we just didn't realize how shops worked so we returned to the front where their birds were.\n\nYes, they DO have birds in giant aquariums in the front of the store.  They didn't seem to be overly crowded, but there were lots in there.  I thought why would BIRDS be in an aquarium at a store that calls itself CAGE WORLD? And there were signs on the aquariums advertising the birds inside as \"Hanfed (their spelling) cockatiel\" and some of the prices were up to $150.00. ( Later we had a young man try to get us one to hold and the birds in their freaked when a hand came in.  Those birds didn't appear to be handled all that often, which he semi admitted.)\n\nFinally a nice young man came up to us (apparently just back from lunch as he was carrying McDonalds french fries around with him) and started chatting and answering questions.  While he walked around with us he was feeding french fries to the birds.  Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think french fries are part of an exotic birds diet - especially ones you are trying to sell to the public.  I get it, if its your personal pet, but these were birds for sale.  A little later one of the big birds was doing something and another employee grabbed it by the tail as it was trying to get away from him and he swung it around by the tail.  My son is still upset by that one.\n\nThe young man told us he'd been working at CW for 5 years so he can't plead ignorance about feeding the birds french fries, or trying to sell us small cage for cockatiels that shouldn't even be used for a parakeet, let alone a bird that can grow 12-14 inches high.  Telling me he kept his pet cockatiel in one of those didn't make me want to get it.  By the way, none of the cages they made, that he showed me, had any horizontal bars for the birds to climb on.  I thought bird cages needed at least two of the walls to be horizontal.  Anyway, the boy tried to tell me that we could just put the perches lower in the cage (they'd have to be on the bottom of the cage) to accommodate medium sized bird like a cockatiel.\n\nI was a little shell shocked by this point and wanted professional opinions about these cages, so I pretended to ask my husband (via text) if we could buy a cage (as we were told \"TODAY ONLY you can get a 20% DISCOUNT), and took pics of the cage so I could ask my friends at another pet store and at the bird rescue I associate with.  Finally, after walking around a bit longer (they did have two very sweet birds that I kept walking over to see while trying to check out an extremely over crowded cage of older parakeets/cockatiels) and letting my son look at the food they sell and toys for birds, we left.\n\nI feel so sorry for the birds in that store. Over crowding, being treated the way we saw (french fries and swinging around by the tail) and yes quite a few of the birds had plucked out their feathers (and I'm not just talking about the birds in the back, I mean the ones out front), and just a general sense of gloom and doom in there.

I tried telling the lady with a heavy Asian accent I had an HRA to pay for such things, she didn't know what that was. I ended up having to get that straightened out at check-in. It gets worse....

Since then I have received bills everywhere, including my place of work. Our mail room staff opens them because there is no name on them and inside is all my personal information. I have called 4 times trying to get them to bill the HRA, still no success. The automated billing system is horrible, the prompts do not make sense and it takes 6 minutes of voice prompts before they even put you on hold. Today the lady got disconnected or hung up on me and she has yet to even try calling back. Do yourself a favor, if you need medial care for your child, avoid this place unless you have an endless trust fund. The state of AZ has a website were you can view common procedure costs at various hospitals, the second most expensive was still 80% cheaper than this \"Urgent Care/Specialty Center\"", "business_id": "2bD-KHkntojDT1vqUlRSmQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-08-28", "type": "review"}

She suggested a couple meds for sleeping, which I had to remind her about five minutes later and blew me off when I told her I had tried the dose she suggested and couldn't function on it. She also suggested that I exercise. I kept telling her I was seeing her because I was too exhausted to even get out of bed and that I wanted to exercise (I was extremely active before I got sick last year). Yet somehow exercise is going to help the fact that I am too sick to exercise? \nThe phlebotomist wasn't terrible, but definitely not good. When I first got there another woman was saying how the woman wasn't able to draw blood on her that day. Instead of quickly inserting the needle she did it extremely slow and got a poor stick as it took forever to draw the blood. I have fantastic veins and have had enough blood draws to know this wasn't my issue.\nThe last issue I have is the fact that they never even bothered to call in my scripts. It's now a holiday weekend and I'll have to wait until Tuesday to be able to get the only potential help from this horrible clinic.\nThere are plenty of other rheumatologists in the Valley, go to any other one, this place is terrible!", "business_id": "GA6-xbZ-uemHe4fbN2GQXQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-08-30", "type": "review"}

The first time we were there we enjoyed it and thought the food was great, but this time around was just a bad experience with a horrible waitress.  My boyfriend order a coke and I had an ice tea with a lemon in it, and the slice wedge lemon was old and smelled like it was sitting in a fridge for awhile uncovered and the coke was warm and flat and the ice was melting away already, but she did take the coke back and brought out a new one.  Than I ordered the chicken fried steak with broccoli and mashed potatoes and it is suppose to come with a biscuit too, but instead I received Texas toast, which disappointed but ok with, however the waitress never even said anything why I received Texas Toast rather than a biscuit.  And my broccoli was cold and by the looks of it old too, did not taste very well either.  With my meal it was either a soup or salad and was not offered either and didn't even have the chance to tell her which one I wanted too.  So did not get my soup or salad. My boyfriend just had a turkey sandwich with a Cesar salad and the sandwich, which he said was ok. The waitress dropped our food off with the ticket and we thought that was rude and didn't say a word after. She never came back to refill his coke or my ice tea or even to check on us if the food was ok or if we needed anything and after we finished our meal we sat there for seven minutes until she finally came by and asked if we were going to order pies... umm yeah we wanted two slice of pies and with a new ticket she came back and seeing our cups were empty we hoped she would come back to refill our drinks but no. We ate our pies with no drink. We both sat there thirsty waiting for her to come by at least so we can tell her we would like a refill or water but she never did. My boyfriend did not finish his pie because he needed something to drink because the peanut butter pie was overly sweet and sticky in the mouth.  Hard to finish without liquid.  We were  disappointed, plus the other waitress for the table behind us was amazing she was great too bad she was not our waitress.  top it all off they were not busy and we kept seeing our waitress doing nothing and walking back and forth in the back doing nothing too and tended to another table more than us. And the other table was just one guy that was a regular there. We waited to see if she would at least stop by our table to check up on us but never did once so we just got up and paid for our meal and left!! Just horrible service and not so great food at this Village Inn.  It is not a very hard job to be a waitress and serve your customers and make sure they are satisfy and have what they need and drinks filled, but apparently its hard for her.

Finally made the decision to have my girl spayed. First time I've ever had a pet go through this surgery and had to deal with post-surgical care.

Immediately was given menus and asked if ready to order. Waitress was attentive. Chicken shawarma sandwich was around $4 and the kabob combo (kabobs of chicken, beef, and lamb) with rice, salad, hummus and warm pita was about $12. When asking the waitress what kinds if meat was in the combo she said she doesn't know- and just works there. That was odd because I would have thought that if she wasn't knowledgable about what was on the plate that she could have at least asked the other staff. A skilled worker should at least be knowledgable about those basic popular dishes. Maybe in time. Minus that part everything was exceptional. Baklava was super sweet and delicious.

Partial treatment.  One of the young waitresses caters to regulars.  For example, the other day she went out of her way to hand plastic cups to her group of friends and offered to individually pour them water.  Why not treat  all of your customers that way?  I felt like I was in high school again: extremely cliquey. \n\nI've also observed that one of the male workers gave free desserts to a family and a big block of feta cheese to a couple next to us.  Perhaps they were good friends.  But that's irrelevant.  Again, why not hand out free desserts & blocks of feta cheese to all of your customers?\n\nInconsistent quality of food.  One day my falafel sandwich was amazing - a mind-blowing experience.  But then a month later my falafel sandwich was a dismal disappointment.  There was no plump, well-cooked warm falafel inside of my pita sandwich.  Instead there were tiny bits of cold leftover crumbles of falafel thrown inside a soggy, almost inedible rubbery pita.  I complained to the waitress expecting a brand new falafel wrap to be made.  Instead she came back and handed me a plate of four disproportionately sized falafel; not a single one was in the nice shape of a medium-sized ball - one looked like an elongated, stretched out elephant turd, the other was in the form of a tiny black dot.  Plus it was overly cooked (crispy & burnt).  I'm guessing this was left over scraps from a burnt stove.  She told me to just \"throw it in\" my wrap as she quickly walked away.  \n\nWhat's the point in eating \"good tasting\" food if you're preoccupied with horrible customer service?  You cannot enjoy the food much less digest it properly.\n\nAlso, the establishment seems to exude a certain element of Arabic/Lebanese elitism.  Which probably explains the partial treatment of their \"favorite\" customers.\n\nFYI: I strongly encourage you to go to Haji Baba.

It was not edible.  I am Asian, I have consumed all sorts of things, so it was not the smell of the seafood, or anything like that.  I have eaten Chinese in Hawaii, Japan and California.  I do not consider myself a chinese food snob, as I have been known to eat at Panda Express on occasion.  I really wanted to like this place, but I couldn't.

I wonder how it could muster a 4-star average on yelp.  I went there with my neighbor on a whim and a prayer.  The place was clean and the service was good.  The table top had a stack of about 4 sheets of commercial paper for easy clean up.  The seats were covered in a plastic sheathe.   The food was thoroughly unremarkable.  We started with the crab puffs and teriyaki chicken skewers.  The crab puffs appeared to have a decent amount of crab, but the wanton casing appeared old and stale.  It wasn't served with any type of dipping sauce.  The teriyaki chicken skewer appeared to be deep-fried chicken tenders with absolutely no teriyaki sauce or flavor besides a soy sauce marinade.  They were left unfinished.  The entrees looked like 100% frozen meats and sauces.  They were absolutely artificial and flavorless.  Simply heated to a warm temperature and served on \"Golden Gate\" etched faux-china.

While it isn't life-changing, I really haven't found better Mexican food in another restaurant around town. When I lived in Vegas, I would crave food from this place and couldn't find anything that was even a close comparison. \n\nIt is definitely unassuming, located in a little strip mall at Dobson and Guadalupe. There's predominantly banquette-seating with just a few tables that are half banquette, half chairs. There is a bar and a dining room - they often offer the option of seating in either area and I recommend the dining room over the bar. It is brighter, more comfortable, and I feel that the service is more attentive. \n\nThey serve delicious salsa and chips to start, and also have a hot sauce that has a good kick. If you're interested in an appetizer, our standby is the Cheese Crispi - either plain or with Green Chiles. Adding some of the aforementioned hot sauce is a good plan for nice flavors :) \n\nMy \"go to\" is their Green Machaca Beef Burro, deep fried, with Cheese inside. I have had Machaca at a few other restaurants and theirs is definitely at the top - it is a stewed shredded beef and is nice and moist with LOTS of flavor. I order it as the Burro deep fried, which is basically a chimichanga but without the sour cream and guacamole. \n\nAnother fun item is the Rosita Chiquita Sampler - you choose 4 mini items from a list - I usually get a Chicken Taco, Beef Flauta, Green Chile Beef (served in a little tortilla bowl), and a Green Corn Tamale. This comes with rice and beans and is nice when you aren't sure exactly what you want and you can instead try a little of everything. \n\nI don't order dessert here very often, but have had their sopapillas (fried dough with honey, cinnamon, and sugar) which are a bit iffy (sometimes good, sometimes not) \n\nThe service at Rositas is typically pretty good, although not always the most upbeat. They tend to be quick and efficient. They serve their sodas in HUGE glasses so that you don't have to wait for refills (because you typically don't need one) \n\nThe pricing is a bit high for what you get, in my opinion - their prices have gone up $3-$4 an entree over the past 7 or 8 years, and the quality has stayed exactly the same. \n\nThat said, it is delicious and a great standby - check it out!", "business_id": "CuyNmwDOLeMTrbv2c6rNxA", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-06-25", "type": "review"}

So that was kind of a bummer and the only reason I am subtracting a star.\n\nCheck out their website for prices on ordering balloon bouquets to be delivered to your special someone. That's right, you can order a dozen balloons and they will take it to someone's home or office with a card attached. I think that is such an awesome idea!

Everyone. And how many people ACTUALLY paid that (plus tax)? Nobody. That's what I thought. \n\nLike I said, I'm not complaining because I knew I wanted one of my frames to be made into sunglasses which costs more, but this place does find other ways to nickel & dime you as well. They will talk you in to paying an extra $15 with your eye exam to get tested for glaucoma. I hadn't had an eye exam in 4 years so I went ahead and did this. I have to say, the optometrist who did my exam (as well as the assistant) were very nice. I actually realized when I pulled up to the building I had an eye exam here like 7-8 years ago. They still had my information on file & funny enough, the same optometrist from back then examined me this time (I recognized him & he mentioned it was definitely his hand writing in my file).  \n\nThe woman who helped me with my frames was nice as well. I mean, yeah, she tried to talk to me into an upgrade here & one there, but I immediately told her I wanted one of my frames to be sunglasses so I think she was a little less aggressive on that front knowing I was gonna spend more than the \"standard\" deal right off the bat. I STILL thought I had paid too much for everything, but when I got home I called around to compare (yeah, I'm THAT person) & realized that getting RX sunglasses really does cost a lot of $$$ and I probably didn't pay anymore here than I would have at other places (including Walmart & Costco) for all that I got. \n\nI went to pick up my frames today and was VERY happy. I actually called them to see if they were possibly ready a little earlier than expected (I really wanted/needed my new sunglasses), and sure enough they were!\n\nAt the end of the day I'm not sure if the savings here is as great as it might first appear, but I certainly don't think you get ripped off.

I brought my mom in because I knew she needed an exam. When we came in the girls at the front desk, Shelby and Tiffany, were very nice and helpful. They got me all of the answers I needed and were happy to do so. I filled out my moms medical history form and helped her look for frames while the girls finished her paperwork.\n\nMom found 3 frames that she loved, but one was a \"green tag\" frame, we later found out it would only cost $10 more for that pair! So she chose a blue and green tag.\n\nBefore we knew it Tiffany called her to go back and run tests. I asked if it would be ok if I came with and she told me of course and had a very pleasant attitude. She explained the importance of coming in yearly for exams, but I didn't feel she was pushy, just that she was concerned that she hadn't had an exam before. We opted to do the extra $15 test to check for any damage.\n\nWe then went to see the doctor, Dr. Cheney, he was very nice and explained everything so clearly. We felt comfortable and informed about my mother's vision. She has some sun damage and needed bifocals.\n\nWe went out to wait and be seen by the next girl to order the glasses. We knew it wouldn't be the $69.95 deal that was advertised due to needing bifocals.\n\nMonica helped us in the end. This was our first time getting glasses, so we had no idea what to do. She was happy we had already picked frames out and told my mom they looked great on her. She explained the different packages and told us if we wanted to do the $69.95 deal she would have to switch between driving glasses and reading glasses and she recommended getting the bifocals. In the end we agreed. Mom wanted the no line because she hates the idea of growing old haha. So Monica again went over the different no line bifocal options. \nIt was nearing the end of the day now and they were closing soon. Another woman interrupted to tell us they were closing and we needed to finish soon. I found it very rude, especially since we had already chosen our frames and were simply trying to make sure we were informed on our options. She seemed annoyed that we were taking longer than she wanted. We still made sure we ordered what we wanted and even got to make one pair a sunglass.\n\nWe picked up her glasses and she is very happy with them. It is taking some getting used to, but she can see comfortably now.\n\nOverall a great experience and I will recomend to anyone.

UGH! Turns out after sitting down to finalize everything that the contact lens exam was BY ITSELF $79.99 and there were no glasses or anything included! The staff apologized for the miscommunication, but at that point I had both called to get the correct information and ended up spending a good hour and a half in the store picking out frames.

I recently found my receipt and realized it didn't expire until 2016, so I made an appointment online.  Very easy and quick to set-up an appointment on their website, it even sends you a google calender reminder to confirm.  Went to the appointment and everyone upfront was extremely friendly.  It was busy so I expected to wait, but to my surprise it did not exceed ten minutes and I was able to update my information and fill out other paperwork.  When I was called in to do the preliminary eye check, I was also attended a very courteous manner. The doctor was also extremely helpful, during the eye exam he explained the process he was performing to determine my prescription.  He showed me my current prescription and my new prescription, there was a significant difference, I was excited to get new pair of glasses and contacts. This is where the the attentive and polite attention stopped.\n\nI was called over to a sales person, I was quickly asked if I was interested in buying glasses or contacts.  I responded that I was interested in buying both and that I saw some frames online.  I gave her the model numbers and sku numbers, but she seemed annoyed when I didn't have pictures of what the glasses looked like.  I tried to hunt for them on the racks, but I assumed they could pull up the models on their computers with sku number or brand name/model number.  We finally found the two that I was most interested in and asked if I could get a quote on the price without insurance and insurance (since they are considered out of network and the coverage is considerably less than in-network). It sounded like I had asked her to do the most gruesome and tedious task and she only gave me the quote with insurance.  It sounded like there was not much of a discount, so I decided to pass on the glasses and asked for a box of contacts.  I had not worn their brand of contacts since 2013 and with a new prescription, I wasn't sure how they would fit.  I asked her if I purchased a box and they were not comfortable, if I could return them or exchange them.  She answered annoyed that once they were open I couldn't do either.  So I asked her for some options, because I didn't want to get stuck with contacts that I would not wear if they didn't fit properly.  I had not worn their brand since 2013 and I don't remember the reason I didn't purchase from them.  She became really agitated and replied, \"We can't just give you free stuff.  You can't just come in here and not buy stuff and ask for free things.\"  At this point I had not asked for anything free, nor had I mentioned sample contacts.  I just wanted to know that if I purchased contacts and I was not satisfied, I would be able to exchange them or return them.  I told her I didn't want the contacts either and that I just wanted my prescription.  She threw them on the table and replied that the 2013 prescription was also there.  I mentioned that I didn't need the 2013 and she replied by saying, \"I don't care what you do with it.\"  I felt extremely disrespected and left, I thanked her for the prescription and she smugly replied, \"Have a grrreat day.\"\n\nI was not asking for a free hand out or free sample, I just wanted to know that if I was buying and not satisfied I could exchange it.  The doctor even told me during my eye exam to let him know if that brand of contacts would work, and if it didn't to come back in so they could find one that did.  He even asked that I come back in for a follow up appointment with my new prescription to make sure my depth perception was accurate, as it looked a little off from the other tests.

I transferred the water to a pitcher and took the jug back on the same day and they said no refunds or exchanges! What a ripoff. I was even more upset when I went home and drank the water and it tasted like it came straight from the faucet. I will never return and encourage people to do the same.", "business_id": "-cy5wpSxGtSIw2biS-U_Pw", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-07-06", "type": "review"}

A root canal will need to be done but they couldn't do any major work today because my son was so swollen and in pain they had to give him some antibiotics first and we will have to come back in a week. I got worried, I didn't want him in pain for a week! They reassure me the antibiotics will bring the swollen face down and help ease the pain with my continued doses of Ibprofens given to him. \n\nNeedless to say by Friday we had to come back to get his infection drained. Dr. Richardson was the available doctor to do the procedure. He knew my son was very upset by this point and in pain. He was very patient and gentle. He talked to my son throughout the procedure which was assuring for him and for me. He was also concern with how swollen my sons face was. He drained the infected area but gave me his cell phone number so I can text him with pictures and updates the next day, Saturday. \n\nSaturday, after I sent updated text and pictures to Dr. Richardson he immediately advise us to head to the emergency room, we ended up being transported by ambulance from the emergency room to Phoenix Children's Hospital.
