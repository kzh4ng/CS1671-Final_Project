My early enthusiasm was borne out with its various New Times awards, and it has been my pleasure since then to turn many satisfied people on to what is without a doubt the best Italian restaurant in Arizona, and in my opinion one of the best overall. \n\nThe place's new location does it justice, although those of us prone to nostalgia miss the old one. I spent most of the last three years overseas, and when I was back visiting home, Marcellinos was always my top priority, and never disappointed me. \n\nEverything that they make is excellent, though I'm particularly attached and addicted to their thick, short, toothsome Pacatelli pasta with ragu di salsiccia , which is generously available at a discount for lunch. \n\n I don't know whether or not anyone can say that it is \"perfect\" pasta, but I would wager a lot that there is no pasta that is better. It is flawless. As close to the platonic ideal as we can get. \n\nThe same could probably be said of their tiramisu. \n\nUnfortunately it's not possible anymore to spend an afternoon drinking wine and espresso and smoking cigars on their patio, but that was only ever just icing on the cake.", "business_id": "MLVKDbuI2xaOJQ4-NZj2MQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-05-17", "type": "review"}

I was impressed how nice the restaurant looked, it was very pretty.  We were greeted by a pleasant hostess and seated at a nice table.  Our waitress, Vita, was perfect example of what all wait staff should model themselves after.  She was very knowledgeable about every item on the menu and was very energetic and enthusiastic.  If the owners of Marcellino read this, all I can say is, \"NEVER LET HER GO!\"  OK with that being said, we ordered the mussels appetizer and the pesto scallop appetizer.  They were good.  The mussels were on the large size and a little tough, but all and all they were good.  The scallops were luke warm in the middle, but still not too cold to eat.  I expected more out of the pesto, it was a little flat on flavor.  They also served us some nice bread with a little red dipping sauce.  It was a nice departure for balsamic and olive oil.  It went well with our wine.\nMoving on to the entr\u00e9e, we ordered one of the specials to share, the Fettuccine Santa Lucia.  Fresh made pasta Infused with the ink from the cuttle fish.  It came in a spicy red sauce saut\u00e9ed with mussels, clams, and calamari.  They state that it is served with  1/2 of a 1  1/2 lb. fresh Maine lobster in shell, but the waitress said they would remove it from the shell for us.  So I was on board with that!  The entr\u00e9e was very good, again the mussels were on the tough side but the clams were perfect.  The lobster was sadly overcooked.  The pasta was nice.  We did enjoy that part, but I wish we would have ordered the Tortelloni that was stuffed with Filet mignon and saut\u00e9ed vegetables.  I think maybe it is not a good time for mussels right now and possibly a vendor/supplier issue?  I had a bad experience with them at a different establishment last week, but that is a different review.  We were so full, we couldn't even think about dessert!  I am sure they were awesome.  We finished out our meal by sipping on limoncello.  Very nice.  This was an enjoyable experience and we will go back.

Us desert rats don't do well with humidity. After a short 10mins in there, we chugged more crisp fresh water, hopped out of our robes, and jumped into the pool. I must admit that it was smaller than what we imagined.  It fulfilled its purpose of cooling us off though so it was perfect. \n\nIt was a pleasurable experience overall and retail therapy at Scottsdale Fashion Square afterward made for a wonderful day!

I brought the robe in for this reason. I understood that the rings may or may not be removed, what I was not told is that color loss could occur nor was I contacted if color loss was spotted after I brought it in. The owner states the color loss was entered in the system upon my arrival..this is false. Both the sales associates (will leave out names)  and I looked over the robe to mark where the water spots were and saw nothing of the sort. The ticket I was given showed no indication of \"color loss\" in the notes nor was it discussed. \n\nI never saw color loss on the robe and it did not have a snag on it before it was brought in. An associate there stated that she saw color loss when she received the robe however; I was never contacted in regards to this. If there was indeed color loss as this company is stating, I should have been contacted and notified that the robe should not be worked on. I was not contacted before an attempt to clean the garment was made, this alone seems suspicious. \nIf I would have been contacted before the cleaning took place for the color loss issue (they are stating was beforehand) then I could have witnessed the color loss they are stating I did. Instead I received the robe back and saw 3 white spots and a snag on it that both the (sales associate) and I did not see when I brought it in. If the color loss was there before it was cleaned then it shouldn't have been treated and I should have been contacted. \n\nA sales associate at the company apologized for not contacting me before the robe was treated. She stated they \"assumed\" that I knew there was color loss and that I couldn't see it from all angles. Again, there was not color loss when I brought the robe in. Also, the snag created when they cleaned it was never addressed by any employees or the manager at Z cleaners. When I confronted the two associates about it they said \"oh I don't know.\" \n\nI am not in agreement with this company, I still believe they ruined my garment. I have not responded because I am sick of the condescending emails I kept receiving from the owner G.P. I asked her 2x to stop emailing me and still she continued. I also received 4 phone calls from her employee _ all on the same day. Regardless, I contacted the company the same day I received the calls and spoke with two employees there and let both of them know that since they are stating it was something I did, that I did not want the owner to contact me any further. I told the owner I was not going to continue to go back in forth on this situation if that was her stance.  \n\nTo address the $10 discounted charge: when my husband went to pick up the items for me he asked if they offered a military discount. The associate he was dealing with was not sure so she went to ask the manager and the manager came back. He also asked the associate if they got the water rings out and she stated \"I don't know, I just know there is a white spot on it now.\" The associate then left and got the owner. She (owner) then asked my husband if there was a problem and he was surprised as he was just asking if they offered a discount. He then proceeded to tell them that I told him the item was supposed to be $10-$15 and that it jumped up to $26 so this is why he asked about the discount. The owner then stated that the price I told him was incorrect and he said that that is what I had told him they quoted me. This is why the owner decided to discount the garment by $10. I was originally quoted a price of $10-$15 by the sales associate on the robe, both on the phone and when I dropped it off. The associate stated that the only type of robe that would cost $20-$30 was a LaPerla robe. My robe is not LaPerla so I am not sure why what they were attempting to charge me the cost for that brand.\n\nAt this point I do not expect anything from this company for ruining my garment as they keep pointing the finger at me. I do not appreciate being contacted numerous times especially after I told G.P. (owner) to cease communication since they are not taking responsibility for the damage. I am responding to the message from the business because I feel it is inaccurate. I spoke with several dry cleaners here in the valley and they stated that when colored silk is treated by a dry cleaner for water rings/stains it can create color loss. This is what happened to my garment while it was at Z cleaners. A snag in the silk was also created by Z cleaners.\nI do not accept the response made by the business as it is inaccurate. Also, I no longer want to receive emails or calls from them as they just continue to say I caused the damage.\n  \nThis message serves as a response to the owners message showing it's inaccuracy.", "business_id": "K0ZTFp0Lbn-hRiQa5IzmQw", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-04-30", "type": "review"}

I envisioned getting a nice room when we checked in and then going down to the pool where we would have a couple of lounge chairs by the pool and frosty drinks brought to us by an attentive wait staff.  Maybe a few trips around the lazy river and a nice lunch by the pool.  After a few hours head back in to the room to get changed and go down for a nice glass of wine in the courtyard and then have a great dinner.  Maybe the next morning after breakfast go back to enjoy a few hours by the pool again and then head home totally re-charged from a nice relaxing weekend.  That's what I had envisioned for my stay at this property.  \n\nHere is how the reality turned out:\n\nWe arrived at 1:00 and were able to get checked in, the front desk person was very helpful.  Our room was nice, located on the first floor.  So far so good.  I was a bit concerned when I noticed there seemed to be a lot of kids running around the facility though.  \n\nWe went to the pool and it was a zoo.  Kids running around all over the place, screaming, and no seating whatsoever to be had.  Eventually we locate a table by the bar that is baking under the sun.  We take it and wait for the waiter to come by.  After 20 minutes of sitting there it is very apparent we need to go to the bar to order.  I go to the bar and after waiting in line for 15 minutes get an order in of a bucket of beer and a quesadilla.  The bucket comes with 4 beers, but they are larger than the standard 12 ounce bottles.  I think they were about $6 each or so, not that bad for pool pricing.  The bar guy tells me since I ordered from the bar I have to come back to the bar to get my food, even though I am sitting 10 feet away at a table.  Finally after a few trips to the bar to see if my food arrived, 20 minutes later I suspect it does.  I see it sitting back on the bar but no one will help me to simply hand me my food.  I have to actually wait in the bar line for 10 more minutes to have someone hand me my food.  When I take the food back to the table for us to eat, I notice the quesadilla is ridiculously small.  It looks like something off a kids menu, not a $12 plus tax and tip ($16 all in) appetizer.  There were 4 pieces and they were very thin, one small piece of chicken in each one.  I took it back to the bar to confirm that it was my order and not something meant for another table for their kids.  After 10 minutes waiting in line to get someone at the bar, they informed me that I had indeed received my order.  I have a picture of it here so you can see it.  Overall it tasted awful and was a complete waste.  \n\nThe Lazy River.  Remember my visions of floating down a nice lazy river with a frosty drink?  There is one at this resort, however it is treated more like a ride at a theme park.  You have to go stand in line with 50 screaming kids until you get the tube to float.  You get one trip around and then off the tube and back in line.  The line takes 20 minutes or so.  \n\nOverall the pool scene was complete chaos.  No seating, terrible service, and their food is an absolute overpriced joke.  There is nothing relaxing about being there.  In fact the only relief comes when you leave this resort.  After seeing what they served us at the pool for \"food\" we decided against having dinner and room service at the resort.  We live in the area and know Kierland has great restaurants just a short walk away.  \n\nThe next morning we went to the breakfast buffet.  It was about 7:30 and we were hopeful we would beat the crowd.  We were seated outside.  To our right this kid started screaming \"bird, bird, bird\" over and over at the top of his lungs.  Then he started waiving his knife around.  The parents were trying though and did suggest their child try to communicate with the bird using ESP rather than yelling.  To my left was a little girl who was running around then went to face the wall and scratch at it for about 15 minutes.  Inside the restaurant it was mobbed with kids running around.  I thought I was at Chucky Cheese for a moment.  We finished breakfast, which actually was pretty good and the buffet priced not that bad ($24 per adult).  \n\nWe decided to see if we could get a second try at the pool.  It was about 9:30 and maybe the pool would not be crowded and we could get a few hours relaxing there.  Um, no.  There were huge lines of parents and their kids, each line was probably 75 to 100 deep.  Waiting for the pool to open.  It was going to be an absolute zoo again shortly.\n\nThe greatest relief was leaving the resort.  If you have kids, this is the place for you.  If you are looking for a relaxing adult weekend, this is not the place.", "business_id": "SYqTY48DJa1cYhglvmgvsQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-04-21", "type": "review"}

For a sports bar, I give Arena 4 stars; as a restaurant it would be 3 stars. So I went there as a group of 6 to watch NHL playoffs. For some reason I thought this was a newer place, but turns out it's a rather old local neighborhood hangout, and features an OTB. The bar/otb section was pretty dark and very loud (it was Thursday night), so we opted for the dining room. Our server was VERY friendly and accommodating - she got us a big table, and switched the TV to the Blues-Wild game for us - which is why we were there. As far as a place to watch the game, the dining room was just ok - decent view of tv, but no sound at all. The atmosphere in that room was more for dinner than watching a sports game, but since its a sports bar we didn't feel awkward cheering for our team out loud. The OTB half of the place is much better suited to games etc, but on that night we wanted a little peace to be able to focus on the game.\nWe ended up ordering a few beers, potato skins, a hamburger, 1lb of wings in secret sauce, and 2 large pepperoni pizzas. My friend had the burger and said it was good; I was able to try everything else. Gotta say, the potato skins may be the best I have EVER had. They were nice and crispy all around, and covered in lots of bacon - most places barely put a few bacon bits and serve the skins rather mushy, but not Arena. Their skins were AMAZING. I would definitely order them again. The wings were decent - typical sportsbar chicken wings; about 10 pieces made up a 1lb order. They were nice and crispy and the \"secret sauce\" was actually really good - not too spicy or sweet, just perfectly balanced. The pizza was good too, but my main gripe was the use of cornmeal on the bottom. I HATE it when pizzerias use cornmeal - that is pizza blasphemy! most places do it just so the pizza comes out of the oven easier - that is just lazy pizza skills. I've never thought that cornmeal adds a good taste to pizza, and it makes it messy. Without the cornmeal, I'd say the pizza was a good thin crust foldable NY style.... but as is, the pizza is average and just a hair above mediocre, because of the cornmeal. uggh. \nSo, for a sports bar where one would go to watch games like NHL playoffs, or bet on horses, or play bar trivia with the DJ - Arena is a good local hangout, nothing special, but effectively fulfills expectations (which should never be too high with sports bars). With lots of TVs, and games like billiards and darts etc... Arena is a fun place where you can go with friends or even just go alone if you're bored at home. It's pretty divey, but has a local neighborhood vibe that keeps it friendly. The food is not the best, but a cut-above-average for a bar - the potato skins are HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, and the wings and pizza are recommended, but with reservations. The service was excellent, and the prices were quite reasonable for the location and type of venue. You need a place to go and watch the game and devour some food? Arena is probably a very good bet - not fancy or gourmet, but local and friendly.", "business_id": "_TWT58PWunYIyPgpz1fuog", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-04-21", "type": "review"}

The Scallops were good, and the Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e was decent. I've had much better Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e though; this one was a little chunky and as far as presentation, they just threw it in the togo container making it look like a blob of mess. The Lobster Cocktail was not edible. It tasted and smelled like fish that had been sitting out for 10 days. They have better lobster at Red Lobster. Lastly, the filet... First of all, I ordered a medium rare steak and they gave me a medium well steak...didn't bother driving back to the restaurant to return in so I dealt with it. Setting that aside, the flavor of the steak and meat quality was subpar. If you put a Mastro's filet next to a Morton's filet, it would be like comparing a Ferrari to a Chrysler Minivan. \n\nDon't waste your money here, go to Mastro's, Ruth's Chris, Flemings, Eddie V's, Bourbon Steak, The Capital Grille instead.

And I hadn't had a good bialy since we left Cleveland in the 90s.\n\nWhen we went in we saw this gargantuan menu. They make tons of flavors in bagels and bialys. Plus they make sticks. I haven't had a bagel stick in forever, either. It took about two minutes to pick out a dozen. I could barely contain my excitement. They sliced them up for us, gave us some sleeves so we could freeze what we wouldn't eat right away and sent us on our way, $9 lighter but infinitely happier.\n\nAnd I am not disappointed. It has been so long since I had a real, east coast bagel that I forgot how good they are. They doughy faux Jew food they have here just dulls the senses and makes a person forget the amazing deliciousness that we enjoy back in the real \"Jew food world\" of the east.\n\nThat said, I do have to add one caution. When I saw they also serve sandwiches I asked to taste their corned beef. I do this everywhere I see they serve it and restaurants are always kind enough to oblige. After my anticipated success with the bagels, and the whitefish and lox I saw in the case I was optimistic. Made getting my hopes dashed even worse.
