If you have a craving for a cheap gyro downtown at night in Pittsburgh, this is the place to go. Unfortunately, Mike & Tony's closes by 6pm. You won't get good service, you will get frozen french fries tossed in the deep fryer served in disappointingly small portions. You will have to scrounge around for a bottle of ketchup and hot sauce. However, the gyro meat is freshly cut off the spit, and the over-stuffed sandwich is a good deal at $4.30. \n\nOverall, there aren't that many cheap places open at night downtown, so go here if you're stranded and can't stand the thought of another Sammy's corned beef sandwich.

Sure, it's not a 5-star restaurant, but you can't beat the price or the food!!!\nWhy would you order french fries at a Greek restaurant? I want everyone to disregard the previous bad rating about this place. \nI live about a block away from Salonika's, and I absolutely love it. The first time I went in, I noticed that it was rockin while every restaurant nearby was empty. Very good sign, trust me!!\nSure, there are no waiters. You order at the front counter and linger around until your food is ready, but I've never had to wait more than a few minutes. \nThe food is absolutely amazing!!! And cheap!!! My boyfriend loves the chicken with pasta, which is exactly what it says it is: pasta with chunks of chicken. It is lightly seasoned, but no heavy sauces. And it's amazingly filling. \nI always get the Greek salad or the pastitsio. The greek salad comes loaded with onions, feta, olives, and jalapeno peppers that are marinated in some kind of garlic marinade. And there is always enough dressing!!! Homemade dressing at that. \nThe pastitsio is definitely an acquired taste. It's like a greek lasagne, but without cheese. It consists of a large layer of very spiced beef, then layers of noodles and a cream sauce. \nI bring a lot of friends to Salonika's when they trek downtown to hang-out with me, and EVERY SINGLE PERSON I have introduced to this place absolutely LOVES IT!!! I usually make them get a gyro, and I can't tell you how many of my friends will go back up for another one because they are so good. The gyro meat is fresh, in fact they carve it right there. \nThere is also a bar in the back of the restaurant. I kind of wish it wasn't there because it attracts some \"unsavories\" and takes away from the atmosphere in the restaurant. But you can't win them all.\nKeep in mind that this is a cash-only establishment, so hit the ATM on the way. \nYou will not be disappointed with this place.

When stepping into the restaurant the first thing I noticed were glass cases storing food. It had the feel of a cafeteria or at best a deli at a gas station convenient store. Not feeling adventurous I got the gyro meal, which is a good deal. The fries were cooked to perfection, but lacked flavor. I had to dump salt on them, which is never a good thing unless you as for unsalted fries. The gyro itself was mediocre. The ingredients inside were fresh and made to order, but I did have to use a knife and fork to eat it as the pita was just a bit too small of the large mass of the contents. The slice of chocolate cake, while a descent size, was rather tasteless. The icing was pretty good, but the cake itself had almost no flavor, perhaps freezer burn. It did seem as if the cake had been frozen. I also felt like the harried girl taking orders behind the counter was overworked. She apparently had no time to take a wet cloth the the tables. I kind of felt bad for her. \n\nOverall, I'd go here if I worked a block away and only had a half hour lunch break.

Very recently renovated inside, the light and color scheme is much brighter across the range of booths and tables that fill the space.  While there is a menu on the wall and a take-out counter, breakfast is table service and the truly Southern ladies who wait the tables will welcome you in and invite you to pick your own table.  I've never had to wait and I kinda like being able to pick out my own digs- is it a window kinda day, or do I want to bury into the back corner?\n\nMenus are on the table and they have all the regular breakfast staples.  Omelets, waffles. eggs your style, hasbrowns, and all the usual breakfast meats. While I usually skip the meat, I do appreciate the fact that turkey sausage is always an option.  Service is speedy and the ladies who constantly walk around will make sure your drink never goes empty or that your coffee always stays refreshed- no matter if they took your order or someone else did.  Now that's some customer service.  \n\nAnother thing I really like is that they recycle newspapers from earlier guests.  I can usually find several whole local papers stacked up in a central location to be read and returned as \"community paper.\"  I can get caught up on the affairs of the day and pass it on.\n\nWhat you'll really love here is that the prices are so easy on the wallet.  When both my wife and I can have a full breakfast for under $12, with tip, then I am amazed.  Try to find breakfast for one for under $12 at some of the \"other breakfast places\" around town- their biscuits may fly, but they will weigh your pocketbook down!\n\nNow this place, like all other Showmars, serves a lunch and dinner with plenty of Greek staples, including a pita burger.  I'll save that review for another time.

Both their chicken and original (I believe it is a mix between beef and lamb) gyros are mouth-watering. I was afraid that the lamb would have that weird gamey taste, but it only made for a more complex flavor, which I totally didn't expect. \n\nThey have a great selection of sauces that I am guilty of drowning my gyros in. Their fries are made to order and come out piping hot and are even more delectable with a dipping sauce concoction of my own (made by combining their honey mustard and cucumber sauces - must try). What I found surprising is that no one knew about their unlimited and FREE toppings list. You can get a whole assortment of other toppings on your gyro all at no charge!\n\nTwo years ago, they started catering to the drunk, after-bars crowd on Fridays and Saturdays. However, those gyros are a fraction of the size and a fraction of the goodness of their regular ones. So I'd stick to One World to fulfill that drunken craving if I were you...\n\n*Also, I don't know if anyone else has noticed this, but I always come out of the restaurant smelling like I've dipped myself in frying oil.

Inside is pretty cool, open style kitchen and lots of indoor seating. The menu is on the counter where you order, which could be problematic if you are like me and take 5 minutes to look at a menu and there are people behind you!\n\nI decided on a 4oz gyro and mac and cheese bites. My name was taken and I was called when it was ready. Interestingly enough, you also pay right when your food is ready, which was different, but I liked it!\n\nI dashed home and unwrapped everything, anxious to try it. My gyro was actually pretty small and almost resembled a taco in size and shape. I did think that this gyro was really on point though. The meat was thicker, flavorful, not too greasy and of a good consistency. The tzatziki was really good, too! Kind of creamy but not too yogurt-y or watered down like some places. The mac and cheese bites were also surprisingly good. Usually these are just dry pieces of mush but on the inside they were warm, gooey and tasty! \n\nOverall I would definitely say the Zorba's has the best gyro in the CU area, but I still need to try more places.\n\nThe only thing I did not like was the portion/price. My gyro was not very big, I probably could have ate 2-3 of them.

This location is right in the middle of campus and is super busy during lunch hours. We arrived before the rush and easily found a table, but if you come late, good luck. There is no large menu on the wall, but rather a menu at the table where you order which is sort of annoying as you can hold up the line if you are waiting to order or the menu along the wall. There are daily specials which is posted on the sign outside. Today Tuesday was dollar off classic gyro or 1/2 price fries. Other than that the combos are about 7-8 dollars a pop. This is where it falls short. The fries that come with the combo is a very small portion. I can't imagine that it is just a small helping of fries on a little serving basket. Usually that is a highlight when you go to gyro restaurants because it adds to the grease appeal. Additionally, they are quite stingy with the meat, i.e. they actually weigh and measure how much gyro meat you are getting. I have never been to one where you can get 4 different sizes of gyro meat. Overall a little disappointing. I can't say the large was very filling for me.. but who knows. One plus is that they have a dispenser for yogurt sauce so you can douse your gyro to your heart desire. \n\nPro: fast service, self service no need to tip\n\nCons: limited seating, very small fries portion, personally the gyro sizes that are measured seems a little stingy come on...\n\nHidden gem:\n1. You can use the belly card to earn points toward free items\n2. Daily specials\nMonday- Medium gyro, sm greek salad, pepsi 8.25, large greek salad and pepsi 6.25\nTuesday- 1 dollar of gyro and 1/2 price fries, 1 dollar off veggie sandwiches\nWednesday- 1/4 lb beef hot dog, fries, and pepsi 6 dollars\nThursday- BBQ pulled pork, fries, pepsi 7 dollars\nFriday- Fish sandwich, fries, pepsi 7.50", "business_id": "UrxAu3jjRM_u6iQXDPzkSQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-11-25", "type": "review"}

This is a festival organized by the businesses on Grand Avenue.  The paisley Violin is one of those businesses.\n\nThat said, we came in and struggled to find a seat for the six of us.  Several 2 or 3 people groups at 6 people tables.  So we all squeeze onto one round table meant for 4 at the most.  Strike one - wait staff should shepherd small groups to small tables.\n\nOur waitress finds us after a 5 minute wait and takes our beer order.  Many of us order the same beer.  One person orders a very common mixed drink comprised of Cola and Whiskey. The waitress has no clue what it is - replying with \"What's that?\".   Funny, but a bit of a clue about how our epic 2.5 hour dinner will go.  \n\nA larger table freed up, so we took it.  I guess wait staff hate cleaning tables that have people on them, cause she left a big pile of crumbs laying for us to snack on.\n\nThe next round of drinks, they were out of our new favorite beer because they must have a small fridge, so some of us walk outside to look at the beer list, since the waitress doesn't know them.  Those who walked outside got their drinks ordered.  10-15min later, a new waitress asks us if she can get us something.  Yes!\n\nThe music was nice, and the musicians were very courteous and concerned with the volume - our band could take notes on that.\n\nI ordered the gyro.  I've had about 20 different Gyro's in my life.  This was more like a salad burying a couple very thin slices of meat.  I'm not a meat maniac, but they sure did skimp for some reason.  This new concept of saladwich was good, but not really what I ordered.  Also got the seafood chipotle soup which was interesting and tasty.\n\nThey must have been out of beer, because they didn't come by for any more drink orders.  \n\nHopefully the owners of this place will learn to stock up on wait staff and beer for special events.  \n\nAnother review said that the waitress had been on for 12 hours.

It was when First Fridays were going on, so it was busy when we arrived (but not too crowded).  The ambiance makes the place feel like a local dive bar, which we didn't mind.  It seems like the kind of place that you can drop into for a cocktail on a nice Saturday afternoon.  But...\n\nThe menu looks like it was written by a kid in the first grade.  Some people would find that charming, but we found it a bit trying.  Also, it was written on one piece of white paper.  There were NO descriptions of any of the food.  So we had to ask the wait staff about the items we were interested in, which would have been fine, but...\n\nThe wait staff.  Hmph. A bit slow.  And totally unknowledgable.  They didn't know what was in the items.  We asked, and then items showed up with things on it that we were not expecting (and didn't like).\n\nThe food was NOT GOOD.  I ordered the shawarma.  It was TERRIBLE.  No flavor at all.  The chicken was boiled and had no seasoning.  The tahini sauce had no flavor at all.  I asked for some taztiki sauce to see if it would help.  It did not.  It was the WORST shawarma I have ever had.  However, the potato salad was tasty.\n\nThe BF had the lamb gyro which he said was nothing special (very average).  And my friend ordered the italian sandwich, which he liked.  For the price of the food, everything should have tasted better.\n\nDrinks were expensive.  A rum and coke in a place that looks and feels like a dive bar was $7.  SERIOUSLY?  Wow.  Unless you go during happy hour, the prices don't seem worth it.  They did have a good beer selection, and all of those (besides the super cheap ones) were $5 each.  That seemed reasonable.\n\nFinally, the music.  Ugh.  They had this guy with a guitar get up and sing/play.  He was terrible.  And it was SO LOUD we could barely hear each other.  Plus the table behind of us of older hippies were doing shots and whistling at the end of each song.  Getting rowdier and rowdier.  Great for them that they were having a good time.  Sadly, it just wore us out.\n\nI doubt I will return to this place.

None of these adjectives turned out to be an accurate descriptor. In fact, the food at Zoe's kitchen took 30 minutes to come out and was disgustingly bland and in a few cases, quite gross. \n\nWe stopped in for lunch last week. The place was packed, but the line to order moved quickly, so we incorrectly assumed that we would also get our food quickly. More on that in a second. In terms of the menu, we were shocked at how uninteresting the menu options seemed. Even though the menu was decently sized and we are open to lots of different types of food and flavors, we found ourselves completely unable to choose and not drawn to any individual option. \n\nEven though I'm not a vegetarian, I prefer lunch sandwiches with no meat, so I was also quite irritated that the only vegetarian sandwiches were the grilled cheese and grilled feta. This is 2008, and the non-meat options at a lunch spot should be more imaginative than cheese slapped on some bread. In the end, I still ended up ordering the grilled cheese (nothing else sounded good!) and my husband selected the Greek Chicken Marinara. \n\nWe sat down at the table, displayed our number card, and just waited. And waited. And waited. After literally waiting for 25 minutes, I checked in with the assistant manager who was manning the pick-up counter. She went into the kitchen, checked on our order, and said it would be just a \"few more minutes.\" She even had a server bring us two slices of chocolate cake as some sort of  token of their sympathy, but it was super-dry and totally gross. Thanks, but no thanks. I'm just glad we didn't pay $2 for each slice!\n\nIt wasn't until 10 minutes later when I lost my patience and told the same server that we wanted our food immediately that we finally received it. We have a higher-than-average awareness of the difficulties of working in food service, but we found it un-acceptable that a non-full-service restaurant would take 35+ minutes to bring us two sandwiches. If they can't handle the catering, to-go, and eat-in order volume, they should hire more staff members. \n\nAs if the slow service wasn't painful enough, my grilled cheese was completed charred (literally burned and black). After one bit of the accompanying slaw, which was soaked in mayonnaise and soggy, I  immediately walked back to the assistant manager, handed her the plate, and asked her to refund me for my plate. To her credit, she complied, but the wait had already been so egregious that I wasn't about to just write the long wait and gross food off and decide to return. \n\nMy husband's Greek Marinara was not as terrible but was still bland and completely un-memorable. The bread was a plain roll, the chicken breast strips were formed and tasted totally processed, and the \"Greek\" marinara tasted like Prego. The only tasty part of his meal was the side of bagged chips!\n\nI guarantee you that we won't be back to Zoe's Kitchen.

I used to go here quite often, but I am thinking twice before returning.

First off, there has been water covering the floor of the left side of the restaurant the past 3 times I have been there. I think they have a leaky roof, but it has been weeks, maybe even months, and there is still water. This is hazardous and just plain disgusting. Also, the restaurant is just dirty. I had to ask to have 2 different tables wiped down, and the crumbs from the table were wiped onto the chairs. There were 5 of us in for lunch last week, and every chair was covered in crumbs from the previous diners. So gross!

I couldn't figure out if this was a chain or locally owned because it looked borderline corportate inside but had a lot of \"we support local\" types about. \n\nAs a first-timer I asked the counter girl her suggestion and she (and the woman behind her) were kind enough to offer up good suggestions.

A generous portion of feta cheese and tomatoes was delightful, my only complant was there wasn't enough. I wanted more!\n\nMy sandwhich on the other hand was a different story. The pita pocket had huge hole in it making it tear and really difficult to handle. The meat wasn't positioned all the way into the pocket and most of it was falling out the top. It was like three slices of ham had been wrapped around huge slices of grilled chicken and shoved into the pita. I was pretty sad to see this. I ate the whole thing and although it was tasty, it wasn't easy to keep altogether.\n\nI really appreciated the counter girl's kindness in giving me a drink but the status of the sandwhich was enough to probably deter me from returning.

Inside, the place looks quaintly divey.  I asked if anything was so much better than the gyro that I should get it instead, and was told that the gyro is the way to go.  Feta or no feta?  I wondered if it was an avalanche of feta or just a sprinkling.  He puts a lot on there.  Fine, no feta.  I get the potato salad with it, and an order of spanakopita--which I ordinarily love.\n\nWe sit outside.  The spanakopita arrives.  It has little cheese and is not flaky.  Tastes kinda like shit.  Served with crappy tzatziki, which I don't think is the appropriate side for spanakopita but whatevs.\n\nhttp://twitter.com/spirit_fingers/status/5209643122\n\nNext, my gyro arrives.

Look, I like onions and all, but when you leave fresh onions out in the air for too long they become veeeerrrry rowdy.  Like so rowdy that eating one would be enough to burn your mouth and render you a pariah.  So all that's left of my gyro is three slices of \"gyro meat\" and tomatoes.  And the little side cup of tzatziki that is only filled a third of the way.  The gyro meat tastes like... nothing.  I am underwhelmed.\n\nI move on to my side of potato salad.\n\nhttp://twitter.com/spirit_fingers/status/5209805283\n\nNormally mustard potato salad has a pastelish yellow hue, but this one looked like it could be seen from space.  Whatever it was, it was odorless and flavorless, so I can only assume it's some undetectable poison like polonium-123.  If I die, I leave my rapier-like wit and boundless charisma to my son, Samir.

Unless the food speaks for itself, I would opt for a remodel.\n\nThe food does not speak for itself.\n\nI ordered the vegetarian moussaka:\nVEGETARIAN MOUSSAKA  15.00\nSlices of eggplant and potato layered with zucchini, spinach and feta cheese, topped with b\u00e9chamel cream and parmesan cheese\n\nI have to say, the actual moussaka was delicious, but it came with vegetables that I swear were straight from a can.

Appropriate? Anyway, the whole entertainment side was catered to that party and my guests and I had the distinct feeling that we were crashing My Big Fat Greek Enagagement Party.\n\nNext time, I would suggest reservations and some social lubricant in the parking lot before entering, preferably from an ouzo bottle in a paper bag.", "business_id": "t54zAs7IftAVb9SKcCRotw", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-10-07", "type": "review"}

One can go out to a place sit, order, eat, pay and leave at just about anywhere, but where is the fun in that? Bacchanal is a one of a kind dining event that I predict will be on my frequent dining list in days to come. \n\nGeorge, the owner, greeted us as soon as we walked in the door. We noticed it was especially busy, come to find out it is a woman's 90th birthday. 90! She was awesome too....side note - at 90 years old she put the whole party together - e-vites and all and roused a crowed of 75 close friends and family to party with her. She is my idol! \n\nWe got a great table over looking the festivities, great view of the band and dance floor. We then met Taso, George's son, who took great care of us the entire night and quickly brought our first of two bottles of wine. Yadda yadda yadda.... everything was great there on out. \n\nI had the Souvlaki Eilian (sp) - lamb skewer with rice potato and veggies. The rest of my party had the Greek style lasagna, veal and a different lamb dish. Oh and we also started with the flaming cheese, and lemme tell you, cheese on fire is awesome! Perfectly greasy and yummy! All were awesome. Then of course came the Ouzo shots and plates for breaking... OPA! \n\nThe band was perfectly Greek, we were graced with two different belly dancers, one of which is in the Ginus Book for flipping quarters of on her belly one by one. Don't ask, you just have to go check her out. Pretty impressive! Then we all danced. \n\nAll and all we had a more than great time.

For those who don't know, one of my favorite places in THE WORLD is Sammy's Roumanian Steakhouse in Manhattan.  This place actually reminds me a LOT of that place, which is great to have right in my neighborhood (not to mention right next to my favorite strip club, but that's another review).\n\nCame here with a group of ladies on Saturday night, and we had so much fun. I mean, how many items need to be delivered to your table ON FIRE before you start having a good time?  Hint: It doesn't take many. However, our mid-twenties asses were put to shame by the biggest party animal of the night, 90 Year old Mildred. This chick was celebrating her birthday with 75 of her closest friends and was scooting around that place with a vengeance. It was incredible. According to the wonderful owners we chatted with, she E-VITED her guests.  Yes, a 90 year old woman learned how to E-VITE specifically to invite 75 friends to Bacchanal.  That may not be entirely accurate, but I wouldn't doubt it.\n\nI had the Veal Bacchanal, Aimee H. had the lamb skewer, and our two friends had the Greek Lasagna and the Lamb Shank.  My veal was very good, but the Lamb Shank that I tried was incredible! Like fall off the bone tender. But it was huge, and I was filling up on wine and ouzo, so I was satisfied with my bites.\n\nReally though, the experience itself is worth five stars. Yes, the food isn't inexpensive (around $15-$20 for an entree...but they have a gyro plate for $10 as well), but they could have charged $5 at the door for the entertainment alone. Belly dancers, a live band, freaking throwing plates on the ground! Obviously, the way to any girl's heart is condoned destruction of property, so they did a great job recognizing that.\n\nOkay this is a long review, but go when they have the belly dancers and band, get the lamb and some ouzo shots, and throw some plates on the ground.

Perhaps I was having a moment of Hellenic pride.  Maybe I wanted to feel like I was on the island of Chios smelling the marina and humming along with all the traditional anthems.  Perhaps I was hoping to break a few plates after toasting a wonderful plate of desperately sought out seafood in the desert.  I am not sure what it was that night I simply had to have Greek food. I had a dream is more than an ABBA greek tribute.  But here is my reality...\n\nHaving recieved awesome directions not thanks to my Garmin which placed the restuarant to the right versus the left off 19th and Camelback, but from the owner's wife, I pulled into an empty Tuesday night parking lot about an hour and a half before closing.  Perhaps this was my very first mistake but with this economy, I realized that the place might have been hurting more than my yearning for horiatiki and tzatziki.  Still, the women's voice was alluring and authentic and promising.\n\nEnter stage left, a host.  Truly, I thought  that I was part of an elaborate prop set for what would be a Greek tragedy.  The place is certainly capable visually of transporting you to Ellada.  The place was also as barren as an off season tourist trap near Plakka.  The two other people there seemed to be regulars.\n\nI admit that I was VERY impressed with the menu.  Again promising.  I went ahead and ordered Ktopodi traditional and kalamarakia.  Homemade bread that was made the last time the restaurant was full appeared at the table with sweet butter that was also frozen at that same time.  A wine list featuring more Greek wines than anyplace else was also promising, but I knew I would have a long drive back and well, you know me and that speeding thing on Interstate 17...I digress...\n\nAfter waiting for almost 25 minutes, I got one tentacle of  what must have been the world's smallest octopus and that octopus was suffering from anorexia.  It was camoflauged in a sea of fava bean paste to give it a fuller appearance.  It was dry and not tasty.  To be more clear... imagine a child's finger being grilled and placed in front of you after being dehydrated.  Yea.  That is what it was like.\n\nThe salad was fair.Meek, but fair.  Nothing to really yelp about.  The kalamarakia were horrid.  I think they were anything but fresh as they were laden in overly fried onions and sopping in oil with the breading stripping away.  I must have been desperate for the fruit of Poseiden to be enticed in any way to put a forkfull of this stuff in my mouth.  It was the absolute worse that I have ever experienced.  Hands down.  \n\nI am certain from the many posted accolades all over the walls of the place, that the GreekFest was indeed great.  But its day has come and gone and its legendary service and cuisine is all but a page of mythology.  I was extremely disappointed.

Our waiter rattled off several specials, all of which sounded scrumptious! Decisions, decisions. I don't think you could go wrong with anything (unless you don't like eggplant like me).  We started with the Trypoites (Greek cheeses & herbs in phyllo). Off to a great start as they were yummy. Entrees included the lamb shank special which was melt-in-your-mouth delicious - perfectly prepared. Ditto for the lamb souvlaki!

The pita is ok but not worthy of my mouth or money. Now the fries, come on guys these fries are greasy and no flavor Steve turn the temp on the fryer to 350 and they will fry properly.  Stop giving us greasy fries they suck buddy.  Gyros needs to be flavorful and juicy you know that, but many places here have no idea how to make that happen.

Elie's gets high marks for being a family-run establishment and for having super-friendly and likeable service, but  it falls a little short in the food department. \n\nI can walk to this place from my work, so I decided to do just that one day last week. Alicia B was definitely right when she said that this place is \"dinky\" - the flooring is old, the tables are dingy, the bathroom is passable, and the \"decor\" consists of a few potted plants and some framed stock pictures of Greece. I might forgive the extreme lack of atmosphere if I felt that the prices were reasonable, since that would mean that the owners were skimping on style in order to provide a high-quality product. \n\nUnfortunately, the food doesn't quite deliver, especially given the high prices. I really wanted to order one of the vegetarian combo plates, but the cheapest one with falafel (plus hummus) was $7.85! That is really steep, in my opinion. If I had wanted to add baba and tabouli, it would have run me $9.10. Because this felt high, I ended up getting the falafel sandwich for $5.59. It only came with lettuce, tomatoes, and tahini sauce, so I ended up adding green peppers for $.45 (a bargain compared to the $.99 they charge to add tomatoes). \n\nI waited 10-15 minutes for my food, which I understand given that there was a steady flow of eat-in and take-out customers. When the sandwich did arrive (with a smile from the again very friendly owner), I enjoyed it because I was starving, but again, wasn't all too impressed. The pita was very large but very dry, and it definitely could have stood to be more moist. Similarly, I found the falafel overly dry and crumbly. The tahini sauce was decent but not as subtle as some I've had in the past. \n\nFor $8 or so, I got a filling falafel sandwich and a large Diet Coke. I definitely prefer the $2.99 falafel sandwich at Al-Hana, although the uber-convenient location of Elie's may mean that I return a few more times. I will definitely update if I go back and try something more on-point.", "business_id": "ejfy33R1avFm7oygL34uQg", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-11-17", "type": "review"}

Their tzatziki is just perfect - cooling, yet hot at the same time from generous amounts of garlic.\n\nThey do commercial catering too, so if you're looking for a office lunch that's different, definitely give them a try.\n\nAnd don't forget CASH ONLY means no debit cards!

I am eternally grateful that I did. This little unassuming small shop might serve the best gyro I've ever had.... And believe me, I've had a ton of gyros. It's one of my favorite sandwiches. \n\nSince it was my first time here, I went with the beef gyro lunch combo. They also serve chicken. Nedda (sister to Elie) was sweet and included a side of her delicious made-from-scratch-daily hummus and pita quarters. All of the food was quickly prepared by Elie in the kitchen and it was served so fast I hadn't even had time to take two bites of the tasty salad Nedda have me as the side to my combo. It's incredible how such simple food can be elevated by super fresh ingredients and the deft hand of a cooking master. Both of these things are found at Elie's Deli and it shines in their food. \n\nYou also know a restaurant is special when the owners know most customers (who walked in during the duration of my visit) and call them by name, inquire about families and work, tell jokes and laugh together. Elie came out from the kitchen and chatted with everyone in the dining room for a few minutes and brought people's lunches out from the back himself. That kind of personalization transforms a simple lunch into a community experience. \n\nAnd to be clear, the menu is much more extensive than Mediterranean food . You can dine-in or take-out. They have American style deli sandwiches and burgers too...some things I'll have to try the next time I come to Phoenix. Maybe.

When we went inside the place was empty and the hostess said that they were only taking to go orders at that time. It was disappointing for only a split second because we decided that it would be even better to veg out on our couch...thus satisfying both the hunger and exhaustion aspect.\n\nWe were pleased with the menu choices which took us a bit of time to decide. We both went with combo plates so we were able to taste a variety of gyros, shawarma, falafel, babaganoosh, hummus, rice and pita bread. Once we arrived home and plopped ourselves onto the couch with our very full and heavy to go boxes we dived in and proceeded to enjoy some damn good food.
