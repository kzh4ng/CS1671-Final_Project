It wasn't very crowded and we were immediately greeted and seated. Service was okay not the greatest but not the worst either. Waitress came off as kind of nonchalant, but she checked on us throughout our meal and according to other reviews doesn't look like they even got that. Kitchen staff was slow in execution especially for not having a big crowd. \n\nI wasn't in the mood for seafood so I opted to try other things on their menu \n\nLOBSTER BISQUE -- \nHuge portion. I didn't expect to get as much in the bowl as I actually got. Although shallow, the bowl is large and you get a pretty decent serving in it. Despite the size, the flavor was lacking as well as texture. I've had some pretty delicious basques before and think it could be improved with a pinch of salt and corn for texture. It's missing something. \n\nGARLIC PARM WINGS -- \nGot an order of wings and they were good. Not an over powering flavor of garlic and not super duper oily. They used real garlic and it was served with it - minced. The wings were deep fried to a nice crispness so it added a little crunch which I liked. Served with common celery and your choice of rand and blue cheese. Not bad. \n\nMARGHERITA PIZZA --\nLooks better than it tastes. This can be easily split between two people - not a single server. The pizza is cooked in a wood fired oven and made very thin so it gets a nice crispy crunch. The crust was actually very good. It has a good texture to it and the lightly char taste you get from wood burning ovens was nice. I typically don't like that taste. Though I enjoyed the crust and what not - there was like no cheese on the pizza so it was way too saucy and lack-lustrous. Not what I would have expected so I was quite disappointed", "business_id": "wHi8ODv7TGmeUB02XoX-mA", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-04-19", "type": "review"}

He had never been to Redfin Blues, so we decided to go there. It was Memorial Day, so we expected it to be busy, but when we got there they said there was only a 30 min wait. That was definitely not the case though.\n\nWe sat on some rocks nearby and waited for our buzzer to go off. We waited, and waited, and waited. There were many tables open, which I think was also confusing people that were coming in after us. We waited about 40 minutes and then overheard the hostess telling someone else the buzzers weren't working. So we turned in those. Even though there were a ton of tables open, we weren't allowed to even sit at them to get some drinks or eat chips, etc. We were told that they were pacing the flow of people because the kitchen was backed up, and that was the reason for the empty tables. ??? We were both amazed that we were not even allowed to sit down to get some drinks, it's their money that they lost I guess though.\n\nAfter waiting about 45 - 50 min, we overhear a tablet nearby asking about their food. The waitress tells them the kitchen is really backed up, so their food isn't going to come for about 40 more minutes but she could get them some chips, etc. (They had already been seated and placed their order about 20 min prior) After hearing that, we bailed. I sadly can't even review the food because the wait was so unacceptable, especially since we couldn't even sit down and get water or drinks. When we told the hostess we were just leaving, she didn't seem very apologetic either, all she said was a quick sorry. \n\nI really liked to stop at this place and get some lunch when I was riding my bike on the trail, but my boyfriend said he'd never go back.", "business_id": "41CXLCeB8z2oNdIOvnrzIA", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-05-25", "type": "review"}

She fawned over our daughter and made us feel comfortable. \n\nAdditionally, the owner and chef both came to our table to talk to us. My husband and I felt like we were eating at a friend's house, and that warmth is a hell of a lot sexier than any atmosphere we've gotten in a swanky Shadyside lounge. \n\nWe ordered simple pasta dishes: linguine and meat sauce, and spaghetti and meatballs.

I have only eaten here twice and will base my review on the bar service/dining experience alone. I sat at the bar on a Sunday night with Shannon the best bartender. She is so personable and just great at her job.  If you go before 7 any day of the week the bar food is discounted to a very reasonable rate. I tried the lobster roll and the steak sliders. Both pretty delicious. We also tried the beer carpaccio off the regular menu because I love beef carpaccio. A lot. A whole lot. The regular diner menu is a bit pricey but that's to be expected with these types of establishments. The carpaccio was amazing and the arugala salad on top of it was delicious. With the carpaccio I wish they didn't put grated parm on it (I felt it cheapened it-just go with the shaved fresh parm and call it done!) and there were no capers. I am used to having capers on carpaccio but to each his own. \n\nFor dessert (which I usually skip) I went with Shannon's glowing recommendation of the doughnuts. Oh. My. God. They are hot and fresh and delicious. Rolled in cinnamon sugar they come with two dipping sauces and some whipped cream. These are made for splitting I would assume because there were a lot of holes.

If you're staying at the resort,  and do not want to leave the beautiful property, this restaurant is a must for dinner! The next closest dining option off the property is Ocean Prime at City North just outside of the Marriott grounds. \n  The food here was very presentable. I really enjoyed my Arizona night out on the patio by the fire. The hotel had live music going out on the patio lounge area of the resort that could be heard at our table.  The attentiveness at the bar was very welcoming and our dining service was spectacular.  I enjoyed the kale salad and calamari as appatizers and the sampler fish trio for dinner. Everything turned out Very nice, but would remove the calamari if I could for another option. I thought it could have been lighter In the breading. \n\nIf you come to dine here for during your stay or just diner, It's a great choice.", "business_id": "corPOxxIBRJ7DSpryYvorw", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-03-31", "type": "review"}

Looks like a wedding hall because they use it for one at least twice a month. They have the access to some of the freshest seafood / produce/ ect. available, with there location so close to lee's market place which flies in fish and other Asian inspired staples daily. Plus lee's has special selections for near by restaurants. \n\nThey have the whole gamete of edible creatures available. From jelly fish to duck. And there recipes bring them to their best. Everything is family style, so bring friends/family for great food and conversation. There is a bar, but not really a place where your looking to drink. I think it's there just for the wedding/events they put on. \n\nIt is a culture shock. So don't get all weird if there is a language barrier or if you not use to a rotating Asian condiment tray iin the middle of a family style table. That is what makes it so special. If you have issues with that buy Rosetta Stone and get over it.", "business_id": "z4KFTJQsAdxqMZA7Fx0A9A", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-03-23", "type": "review"}
