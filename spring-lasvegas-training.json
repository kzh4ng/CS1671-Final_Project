I had chosen this doctor because I was told I have skin lupus some years back by another doctor who moved.  When the scar starts flaring up and getting itchy and annoying I decide it's time to seek another option at handling this.  Enter Dr. Landow.  The first appointment was interesting as I filled out the necessary paperwork to begin my patient file and he tells me that I do not have skin lupus.  I told him my symptoms include severe itchiness and he told me to put a cold can of soda on the area to relieve the itching.  Umm I don't drink soda and don't have soda in my home.  Anything else?  So I am told to order my medical records and biopsy that proved skin lupus and I did immediately.  The former doctor faxed over the report.  I couldn't wait until my follow up to find out just what this is and see if there will be some relief.  I arrive at my appointment and into the room I go.  The nurse who takes me to the exam room comes in with folded sheets of papers as if she had removed them from her purse.  Umm where is my huge file that I have to arrive early to fill out papers for?  She then tells me she has not received my medical records from the former clinic.  I am livid at this point.  She then asks me what's my problem.  That's it, I'm out of there!  If there is that much incompetence in the office itself, what will the treatment be like?  Just for kicks I called and asked again if they had located the file that was faxed from the previous doctor and I was told that they \"may have but if it was a lot of pages ... they only needed a certain report.\"  What does that mean?  That if there were too many pages they would throw out my file?  No thanks.  I found someone else.", "business_id": "J8XafvvbGCNwWesfHTqc1Q", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-05-27", "type": "review"}

I had only been to one other Korean restaurant prior to this, and it wasn't good.  But now that I am vegetarian, I am always afraid to go to a different place in fear that little fishies might be lurking in what I eat.  Well, after getting a coupon for Tofu Hut I decided to finally make a go of it and try some Korean food again.\n\nWe went in on a Friday night and the place was dead with only a couple of white 20-somethings sitting at the tables.  I guess that wasn't a good sign.\n\nUnlike most reviewers, I actually had a really great server.  He pointed out everything that was vegetarian or could be made vegetarian (2 tofu soups and 2 entrees) and even brought out the bottle of sauce they use on some of the dishes so I could look at the label (bonito- not vegetarian).  He was very friendly and was never annoyed with our questions.  He was also attentive and kept our water glasses full.\n\nThey started us out with a salad.  Not much to it- just some iceberg lettuce and dressing- but it was actually pretty tasty.  We ordered the bibimbap and buckwheat noodles, both without meat (of course).  The bibimbap came with an order of tofu soup which was a nice little surprise.\n\nThe tofu soup was really flavorful and my favorite part of the meal.  They were even nice enough to ask if they could crack the egg in it before they did so, knowing I was a vegetarian.  I was expecting good things from everything else, but sadly it just got progressively worse.  \n\nThe banchan were boring.  The kimchi and bean sprouts were iffy on their fish content, the pickled seaweed was ok but had little flavor, and the potato pancakes tasted like absolutely nothing.  The bibimbap was ok but lacking flavor and depth.  This could, of course, be my fault for my dietary restrictions but I don't think it should be that hard to season some rice and veggies.  The buckwheat noodles were just some cold noodles drowning in a salty liquid and covered with some iceberg lettuce.  Meh.\n\nIt makes me sad since I had such a helpful server, but he really couldn't save this meal.  Perhaps it's just me and my under-developed Korean food palate?  I really hope not. \n\nIt appears as though everyone comes here for the barbeque, so maybe you're better off ordering that.", "business_id": "UKKz4HdQC0aH9j5lLi4u8Q", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-04-13", "type": "review"}

Tonight, there was no way that I would pass up this opportunity to rave about the first true Izakaya tavern that I have found here in Las Vegas.\n\nI have never even heard of Izakaya taverns until a good friend of ours introduced us to Musha in Torrance, CA and it's been a whirlwind love affair since then.  I love the casual, Authentic Japanese atmosphere of these places.  From the entire restaurant staff greeting you with a hearty \"Irashaimashite!\" as you walk in to the almost-guaranteed \"we'll see you next time!\"  It's never a goodbye, as they know that you will be back..... oh yes, you WILL be back.   There is just that special feeling that you get when you go to an Izakaya tavern.\nAnd it was no different for me this time around.  At first we were leery of this place, seeing as how we have never heard of it until I did a Google search for \"Izakaya Vegas\".  But the fact that the first hit was a review on Yelp with multiple 5-star recommendations, there was no way I was going to be swayed by my belief that there is no such thing as \"Genuine\" in Las Vegas.   Am I ever glad that we did.  This place brought back such fond memories of the fun that we had with our friends at Musha.  From the Buta Kakuni to the broiled beef tongue and the Garlic butter clams, this place had everything that I liked Including more reasonable pricing!  Dishes ranged from $1.75 for assorted single skewered meats (Beef tongue, chicken wings, chicken balls) to around $8.95+  for the sashimi plates, with most items ranging in the $4-$5 range.\nFor our first visit, we tried out the:\n-Shisyamo Age - which are crisp deep fried smelt(3 pieces) stuffed with roe - Boneless and absolutely delicious with either the provided salt or some asked-for ponzu.\n\n-Beef Tataki - Tender seared beef slices dipped in Ponzu\n\n-Yamakake - Tuna sashimi with Yam Potato and some slimy stuff that I just could not identify (I liked it, but people who judge food by texture may be turned off by it. - Not for everybody)\n\n-Vegetable Croquettes - Mashed potatoes, veggies, wrapped in panko and fried until the outside is crisp and crunchy while the inside if hot and well.... mashed potatoe'y?  kind of like a breaded and deep fried Sheperd's Pie, I suppose.\n\n- Broiled Black Cod - The Hands-Down star of tonight's dinner.  Yummy buttery black cod with a sweet tangy marinade and the skin broiled to a crisp ... absolutely delightful.\n\n- Kushi-Tan - Broiled beef tongue on a skewer - The staple of every Izakaya tavern I've ever been to.  A Squeeze of lemon and you're good to go.\n\n- Kaku-ni - Pork Belly, simmered for hours in mirin, shoyu, sugar etc. until it's chopstick-tender and practically melts in your mouth.  Can sometimes be really fatty because of the cut of the meat, but lucikly ours was fairly lean, maybe we got lucky, or maybe they select leaner cuts?  Guess I'll have to order it again next time to find out!  a small bowl of rice is a must.\n\n- And the clencher - Bacon wrapped Mochi on a stick. Broiled to a crisp, yet chewy .... and bacon'y .....  and mochi'y ... it's freaking mocchi and bacon, how else would you describe it? ... you need to try this for yourself if you're adventurous enough, or just hate your heart.\n\nIchiza is definitely an instant favorite and a must-visit for all of my out-of-town buds.", "business_id": "4UVhuOLaMm2-34SrW8y-ag", "stars": 5, "date": "2007-03-11", "type": "review"}

There are plenty of other Glass Companies on the West Side of Las Vegas who do great work.  Here's my experience:  I've used them for years.  I've brought windows in for repair, and had them come out and install.  However, in the last few years their quality of work and customer service has deteriorated.  I had a Sliding Glass Door installed.  The frame pulled away from the wall, so I had to repair that.  Shortly after that, I had them come out for an estimate on a retro-fit from single to double pane.  They did not offer my wife any selection of frame color (she was naiive and didn't ask) so they picked what they wanted.  I could live with it, but the installers damaged the frame on install day.  I watched them hit it with a rubber mallet to try and bend my new window frame back in to shape.  They didn't know I was watching and got very quiet when I caught them.  I declined install that day.  They stalled for more than a month to \"make good\" on their failure.  On their word they were going to make a new frame, but instead replaced the bent section.  I cut them a break and approved the install due to my tenant's need for the window.  However, the installers were flippant when I refused the original install, and were patronizing when they came out with the repaired window.  I put that experience aside and tried again with something simple:  screens.  I brought two screens to have re-produced.  With the screens in hand, the measurements should have been exact. But, both sets of screens were made too large to fit the windows.  I compared the new screens in the shop with the old screens I had brought in, something that the shop should have done before calling me to pick them up.  But they didn't!  In addition,  I was told the screens would be ready by a Monday, but they were not ready until the Friday of that week.  Punctuality problem for the second time!   I declined the purchase of the wrongly made screens, grabbed my old screens (which I believe were never used by the sub for comparative measure) and went out to my truck.  The woman from the office came out to offer to \"re-cut\" the screens, but I declined and let her know that Dan Bradley Glass had lost my business.  I currently own many rental properties in Las Vegas and have a complete retrofit planned for one of the houses.  Dan Bradley has lost that job, in addition to any of the future repairs that property managers inevitably face as part of the cost of renting houses, condos, and townhouses.

It's located in the same shopping center as Ichiza and Tea Station. We came in and were seated right away. The dining area is pretty big and we really enjoyed the ambiance. \n\nThere were three different AYCE options: Nevada, Vegas, and Spring Mountain. We went with Nevada. First, we ordered brisket, pork belly, and steamed egg. It came with the house salad and your typical KBBQ starters (kimchi, broccoli, tofu, etc.). I thought the salad was okay. The waitress quickly brought out the brisket and pork belly. The brisket was delicious, which was enough to seal the deal for us. Pork belly and steamed egg were good, but not amazing. We also ordered the marinated chicken halfway through. The chicken wasn't my favorite, there wasn't much flavor to it. \n\nTo sum it up, the AYCE kbbq was a good experience. My friends and I will definitely come back again, mostly for the delicious brisket. The service was great. Everyone was very friendly and attentive. We even watched as the owner played 'happy birthday' on the clarinet for another table, which we thought was cute. One downside would have to be that they close at 11, so late night kbbq here is not an option.", "business_id": "v8TQwyxEj4or2Yng6y0S7A", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-04-26", "type": "review"}

The. Pumpkin. Bread.\n\nI'm ashamed to say that I can't even remember what I'd had here.  (The pictures tell me chicken fried steak and eggs.  Not bad, now that I remember.  Pretty good, actually.)  The fries stood out because they were sort of almost like potato chips (not necessarily a bad thing) - but otherwise, it was decent, good breakfast food with nothing else that was truly a standout.\n\nExcept for that pumpkin bread.  Oh...em... effing.... GEE.  That pumpkin bread was hot, steaming, with butter slathered on the top... I can't even use any word in the English language to describe the utter deliciousness.  If I'd had my choice, I could have simply eaten that alone for breakfast and I would have been just fine with that.  Completely fine with that.  \n\nMy husband had the banana nut bread and he said that it was just as good as the pumpkin - maybe even better.  When we come back here, I'll make sure to find out and report back, heh.\n\nIf you get Julie as your server, you'll be completely and totally happy.  She was the sweetest lady with a heart of gold.  Totally deserved that extra tip we laid down.  \n\nThe decor was very countrified, paneled walls, dark and \"homey\".  No complaints here - I thought it was charming and suited the place very well.\n\nNo wait, but we came sort of late in the day (after 11:00am).\n\nOne star off, though, for the coffee.  The coffee was... in a word... abominable.  But that pumpkin bread completely makes up for it.  \n\nI think that we could have been served warm cat excrement and had a server straight out of Dick's Last Resort on the Strip and it wouldn't have mattered, as long as I could have that pumpkin bread.\n\nDid I mention the pumpkin bread was AWESOME?  Oh, I did, then.  \n\nNot a bad spot to stop in for breakfast.  It's not the absolute #1 choice (you want Mr. Mama's or Kailyn's Kitchen for that)... but it's worthy.

Having been to other camera shops and disappointed in what they (don't) carry, Vegas is lucky to have a store like B&C carry such a large stock of both Canon and Nikon equipment, from consumer to professional grade gear.  They also seem to be expanding their Fujifilm selection, and they carry Leica equipment as well.\n\nThe staff is always friendly, and helpful depending on what information you need.  Some of them shoot film, others portraits, and others landscapes.  Some know a lot about off camera lighting, while others don't typically use it.  Talk to everybody and you'll get matched with someone that shoots what you want to shoot, and they can help give you advice on what gear would be most helpful.  I've come in dozens of times without purchasing a thing, and I've never felt pressured to, either.  A good time to come in and socialize is Saturdays, where they have coffee and bagels, and encourage getting to know each other.\n\nNowadays, my visits to B&C are mostly to pick up rentals from borrowlenses.com.  Using B&C as a pickup location for rentals is free of charge, and each time I've done this has been easy and fast.  Although I don't make big photography purchases that often anymore, B&C is still a good place to shop.

I don't think we would've found it on our own- good thing we got some help by the owner- she walked us through one alley and then we went to another- I know, it sounds bad. It was empty though, the alleys. \n\nThis one is much smaller, much more organized, and not dusty at all. Items are usable, not junky. Very nice setup. I like that most things were grouped together- so much easier to navigate. I also did not get the feeling that I would break things if I bumped into something, either. \n\nBTW The owner told us that prices are negotiable. We saw lots of neat things- red goblets at $2 a piece, what a deal (I don't need anything for my kitchen though). My friend wanted a closer look at some things (glass covered case)- the owner was nice about showing her things. Jewelry was a little higher but since the owner said \"prices are negotiable\" I urged my friend to ask \"What's the best price you can give me for this peridot necklace?\" It was marked $70. First, she said, \"$50.\" And my friend replied, \"Will you take $45?\" So, great deal for a pretty piece- has two chains (I don't usually see that- I'm a bit of a jewelry enthusiast). I was happy for my friend, because she's always searching for jewelry, but nothing really caught her eye at the other places. The owner said that she gets many pieces from the auction house and that it is open to the public. \n\nWe told the owner we would come there first next time for First Friday, since she closes early (she told us that she doesn't get much traffic compared to the other store on Main)- she was nice enough to walk us there and reopen for us, specifically (the other store owners called her- they are family).

I decided to walk in to alert someone of the long line. There were tons of employees with empty tables. I was told that someone will be out. Continued to wait another 5 minutes before the hostess came out to seat people. By the time the hostess got to our party she was very rude with an attitude. The supervisor or manager came to our table to tell us dessert would be on the house. As he walked away I stated to my friends the hostess was rude, the supervisor/manager turned around and shouted \"how was I rude\" and we went to advise him abt the waiter.

A friend had passing the qualifying tests to become a PhD student. What a perfect opportunity for a celebratory lunch. \n\nAttached to the Howard Johnson on Las Vegas Boulevard, you can easily miss the parking lot if you don't read the sign quick enough. The turn into the motel leads to the parking for both establishments. The decorum is dark and most of the tables are set up for family style eating. It does not matter if you are a party of 1 or 10, you probably will be sat at the same size table. If it is busy, do not be surprise if you end up with a random stranger sitting next to you. This can be nice if you are a social person and don't mind small chat. \n\nThere were two people serving in the entire restaurant. It was not that busy, but one guys was running around doing everything. Although service was lacking, and the food was slow, he was friendly. It took a little more than half an hour for our order to come. We thought it was just us, but everyone around us were complaining to themselves as well.\n\nThe food is nothing impressive. I know I ripped into Mi Peru, but Florida Cafe makes the former seem perfect. Still confused about the difference between most of Latin cuisine, I ordered the arroz con pollo. I am out on a quest to at least find the best version of this dish in Vegas. The rice was fluffy, but greasy and overly salty. The mixed in pieces of peas and potatoes were a nice addition. The bell peppers tasted like they were pickled, but oily at the same time. I have never came across this combination before. At this point, I missed the pickled onions that I got at Mi Peru. The dish came with a side of beans, three pieces of plantains, and two chicken drumsticks. The overall temperature of the meal was cooler than room temperature. It was not cold, but was getting there. My favorite side dish to any Cuban meal, the plantains were old and chewy instead of hot, crispy on the outside, and soft on the inside. My friend ordered a Cuban. It was also really salty and the pulled pork was dry. \n\nI was told that they open the buffet on the weekends and it is a better deal.

I love Komol. It's clean and the food here has never let me down. I have been a fan for twenty years now. It is in my top 5 of favorite Thai restaurants in Vegas without a doubt. \n\nI've tried most of their chicken and veggie dishes, but the Panang Chicken is my shining star here. The consistency of the curry sauce is excellent. Generally smooth and not watery. The heat level of the sauce is also to my liking along with the balance of the meat to veggie ratio.  My only gripe is the dark meat. Ugh. Although it's more flavorful I try to eat healthier and Komol will not let me order all white meat. What's up with that? \n\nThe food here is 5 stars without a doubt, but the service is about a 2 star for me. The young boys working seem to be more into internet porn than making sure I get my Thai Tea I ordered fifteen minutes ago. They are friendly when they do decide to shuffle on over to the table, but don't expect them to remove your dirty plates when you are done or get your check in a timely manner. Remember, internet porn comes first, customers second. As far as takeout goes they handle that shit! \n\nI highly recommend Komol if you are looking for authentic Thai on the east side of town.", "business_id": "KwLfgeylp9d8zY3KacREiw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-04-14", "type": "review"}

The Commercial Center has all the characteristics of a shady place. Its old, a little dirty, and you'll likely pass a few hobos. But hey, there's a few good places to grab a bite. \n\nFOOD: What strays me away is the wild inconsistencies between visits. Sometimes its good, sometimes its great, and sometimes I'm left disappointed. The stir-fry's usually come out quite good here. The usual Pad Prik King and Chili Mint Beef have never led me astray. But I must suggest to steer clear of the Yellow Curry. I believe the cooks are confused whether or not its a sweet curry or a savory curry. Its different every time. On occasion, I'll order a Pad Thai. Despite being a generic Thai dish, there are quite a lot of components involved in preparing the seasoning. A heavy hand on the tamarind or fish sauce WILL be noticed. The flavor varies visit to visit so I can't say I love it 100% of the time.\n\nSERVICE: The servers have always been really nice. The young man who usually waits on us is seriously one of the nicest most genuine servers I've ever met. But I'm not sure if they're understaffed or just relaxed.  When it comes to food, patience isn't my strong suit. Whether the restaurant is full or nearly empty, it takes forever to get our first plate. Entrees never arrive together and at times its hard to distinguish whether they forgot our order or its just coming out slow. Also, they're a little stingy on the napkins; request a couple extra before your food arrives. \n\nKomol has one of the largest, heaviest menus I've ever seen. Real talk, it is really heavy! A few pages of food are sandwiched between big chunks of wood.

They were okay, but not great. They made obvious mistakes (my boutonniere was completely dead) and then didn't fix them until I pointed them out, as if they were hoping I wouldn't notice. \n\nLater that year, we ordered a corsage and boutonniere for my brother-in-law's senior prom from the same flower shop that did our wedding. When I went to pick them up, the flowers were kind of a mess -- broken petals, obvious wilting, et cetera. Yuck. In a panic, I called Tiger Lily and explained the situation. I told them I had maybe three hours before they had to go, and I needed new flowers, and could they help? Sure, they told me. No problem.\n\nTwo hours later, I was leaving Tiger Lily on East Sahara with big, beautiful floral pieces. On short notice. For less money than the other shop.\n\nSince then, I've ordered flowers from Tiger Lily probably five or six times. Each time, the flowers have been gorgeous, super fresh, lush, and fragrant. The staff have always been friendly and accommodating, and they've been more than willing to bend over backwards to help me -- even when I'm the one who made the mistake.\n\nHere's an example of what I mean. I ordered a New Baby arrangement for some friends of ours last Friday, hoping to pick up the flowers myself and bring them during a visit. Well, that didn't happen, and I couldn't pick up the flowers, so I asked to convert the order to a delivery. I'd missed the delivery cut-off for the day, and Tiger Lily is closed on Sunday, so this morning they re-made the entire arrangement (for no additional charge) and delivered it to our friends' home. I haven't heard back from our friends yet, but I don't think I'll be disappointed. I never have been before.\n\nEdit: since I started writing this review, I used Tiger Lily to send my wife some flowers at work for her birthday. TLF hit it out of the park yet again.

We arrived early on Friday at about noon and Justin was working the front desk.  We did not request to check-in early, but we did request a top-floor room as we did when we made our reservation.   Foot traffic noise in this hotel is exceptionally bad.  Every person's footstep sounds like a loud bass drum, so if you're a light sleeper, you need to be on the top floor or you're going to have a long, miserable night.  So when we politely asked Jason about a room on the top floor, he said, \"Sure, I can get you one of those\"  He wrote down our names on a scrap sheet of paper and told us he'd call us when the room was ready.  By 3:30pm we had not received a call so we decided to head back to the hotel.  When we tried to check-in with Justin, he said, \"Okay, I've got you in a room on the 2nd floor.\"   We asked why he put us there when we specifically requested the top floor 3.5 hours ago.   He said, \"Sorry, I'll put you back on the list\".   So we had to continue to wait.  When we came back about 6pm, a different person was working the front desk.  She said, \"Sorry we won't have any rooms on the top floor tonight.  I don't know what Justin told you, but they're simply not available now\".  So they basically gave those rooms to someone else.  Here's where it gets really bad.  This woman apologized for the situation and said, \"Here, I'm going to block off a top-floor room for you tomorrow night so you'll be guaranteed a top-floor room tomorrow.\"  We said \"thank you\" and managed to sleep on and off despite the fact that she placed in a room that bordered the stairwell and we got to hear people running up and down the stairs all night, and we got to stand in 5 inches of water in the shower since it didn't drain.   Now, the next day, we try to check-in early and Justin says, \"Your room should be available in a few minutes\".   So we waited there at the hotel for 90 minutes just to watch Justin walk out the door for the day and the new woman promptly tell us that there won't be any rooms available for another 2 hours.  I verified with her that she still had that room blocked off for us and she said \"yes\".   So we headed out and when we later returned that evening to our \"guaranteed\" top-floor room, and the new guy at the front desk says, \"Sorry, I see that she blocked off a top-floor room for you, but for some 'unknown' reason, I don't have one for you\".  Someone at the front desk that afternoon/evening basically unblocked it and gave it to someone else.   So the front desk staff there basically lies to your face, kicks the ball down the road or points their finger at the previous shift, and steals rooms from each other,   Also, despite leaving a tip for housekeeping on our first night's stay, they decided to keep my iPhone charger instead of turning it in to the front desk.  So they're a pack of thieves who steal even when you are nice enough to leave a tip.  Overall, a horrible stay at this Holiday Express which is unfortunate because we've had 2 nice stays in the past which led us to stay again on our recent trip.

Avoid the emergency room at all costs. After just having moved to Vegas from NYC I was feeling very sick. Since I did not have a physician in las Vegas I went to the emergency room. I had been feeling poorly for about 16 weeks at the time and I was just getting worse and worse. I explained my condition to the triage nurse as I was unsure if an emergency room was the appropriate place to seek treatment. I explained to the nurse the length of my illness and that I  had off and on running fevers heart palpitations and migrating but consistent pain in my back neck legs and head. She assured me that their doctor could help me. I took her at her word, filled out some forms and was admitted to the examination area. A doctor came by and I had the exact same discussion with him that I had with the triage nurse. He said to me \" listen pal I'm an ER doctor I treat heart attacks and gun shot victims\" in short he refused to even attempt a diagnosis on my condition. No tests were run, no medicine administered, and no referral was given to a doctor who could help me. Then he just simply left. After 2 hours no one came back to even check up on me. So I simply left. What would you have done? Wait there all day for him to change his mind? Long story short they are now billing me. A bill which I will not pay. If a doctor refused to treat you would you pay? I took the time to prequalify the nurse to determine whether the doctor would help me based on my symptoms. She said of course he would. But then he haver attitude and refused to help me flat out. I disputed the bill and complained to their patient advocate/ risk manager for the hospital. He says I owe them for a level one emergency room visit and that I was assessed by an rn and an md. But yet. If I was assessed what was their conclusion? What was their diagnosis? They never even attempted to make one, do they can't possibly have one. This hospital is just a money making scam. If you do go there give a false address and do not give your SSN number. They don't care about your health. They just care about billing you even if they refuse you care. Beware. This place is a for profit scam. Medicine is not supposed to work like this. It took 3 more weeks before I was. Able to secure an appointment with a private practitioner. It turns out I had a severe case of mononucleosis as an adult at age 48. A simple blood test would have revealed this. Do not go this emergency room unless your very life depends on it. These people are horrible. And for the record I will not pay this bill.

I actually found him to be friendly and caring on both visits.  \n\nUnfortunately, the rest was horrible.   Upon arrival for my first visit I asked the gentleman upfront to please make sure that my insurance would cover everything being done on this visit.  I said, \"I'd rather pay cash if it was not clear.\"  He assured me we were all good and that he would make sure just in case.\n\nWell, I had two moles removed and the Dr. was very concerned that they were cancerous.  Right, like UH OH.  He said he'd send the moles in for screening and they would get back to me.  This was at the end of the week and they would call me around Wednesday.  OK so I've had tests like these that made me nervous waiting a couple of days (thank God they all came back good)  Anyway, I'm a little nervous over the weekend.  Wondering what I do if I had cancer, etc.  Google searches and such made me feel alright if it was in fact cancer.  Long story short, Wednesday came and NO CALL.  Uh, hello, am I dying???  So I let it go til Thursday, no call.  Friday, no call.  Somehow I had some activity that weekend and it allowed me to sleep OK.  Well finally on Monday I called and said, \"can you let me know what my results were?????\"  Thinking it was bad news cause they took extra time I was shaking.  The nice lady on the phone said, \"they never called you?\"  Uh, whaaaat?  \"You're fine no cancer.\"  WHEW...You can't let people worry like that.  Forgetting to call a guy who is waiting on cancer test is NO BUENO.\n\nBut wait, it gets worse!  Low and behold I get a bill in the mail.  I only check my mail once or twice a week as all my bills are on auto-pay.  Everything else is junk mail.  Thankfully I got this one.  Anyway, I called and just paid it.  I figured the extra procedures made it more money.  \n\nSo six months later I go in for a regular check-up.  I specificall ask the SAME gentleman at the front desk to make sure this was covered by my insurance as I DO NOT want any bills sent and me miss them.  I'd rather pay cash.  Everyone has been in a situation where you get some bill you thought insuranced covered and it the doctor sends it to collections.  He understood my concerns, apologized for last time and AGAIN assured me that just the office visit would be covered with my copay.  No problem.  They ask me to see their PA instead of the Doctor.  I was like,\"NO, I want to see the Doctor.  He saw me before and I'd like to stay under his care.\" Ok, no problem.  \n\nEverything is good, no concerns I schedule to see him in 6 months.  \n\nToday, I get a BILL for $12.26!!!!!!!!  I immediately call and ask to speak to someone.  I get transferred to a billing voicemail.  I hit zero.  A nice lady answers and then transfers me to the worst customer service person I've ever encountered.\n\nHis name is FRANK.  He said he doesn't give out his last name.  I told him exactly what happened and that I was ASSURED by the gentleman up front that this would not happen.  To be clear, the 12.26 is not the issue.  It is the principle of it all.  I could have had my credit marked up over such a small amount of money.\n\nThis guy could have cared less.  He told me there are signs all over the place and offered to read me the sign over the phone.  Really Frank?  Good attempt at trying to belittle a good customer.  I told him his representative EXPLICITLY ASSURED me DESPITE the signs posted at their reception.  Frank, maybe that's why I made sure to ask him this!!!!  He said his person should have never done this.  I said he did it twice.  And Frank asked me for my credit card number!!!  I said that is awesome customer service.  He said I am on the phone taking this call from an angry customer, that is customer service.  \"what else would you like me to do,\" Frank says.  I said he should honor the words and representations of his employee.  He said he's not authorized to do that and again asked for my credit card.  \"and then I'll transfer you to a manager.\"  Whaaaaaaaaaat?  Frank isn't the manager?  Why I am talking to him?  What's his position?\n\nI paid the $12.26 and Dr. Aspacio will lose me as a patient.  Additionally, I own two medical clinics that refers him patients all the time.  This will NEVER happen again.  It is a shame that a decent Doctor surrounds himself with people that cause him to lose patients.  The new world of medicine is coming Dr. Aspacio and with people like Frank working for you those with the ability to choose who they see will NO LONGER be seeing you.\n\nBottom line, I believe he is a good doctor who surrounds himself with HORRIBLE service staff.  I will no longer be coming back and will let everyone I know how RUDE Frank was and that there is a high probability your co-pay would NOT cover the visit.", "business_id": "xWmfGEZ4msvVsASzIkW2Zw", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-05-20", "type": "review"}

Our 4 year old son, who has been attending candil hall since he was 18 months old, went outside the school unnoticed while he was under their watch and was abducted by a stranger while he was in school.... I received a call from Candil Hall's Director of Operations on February 10th at about 2PM that they had lost our son right after lunch, she informed me that someone had found him in the street and had drove him to their house.  Candil Hall's Director of Operations then said that the police have recovered our son and they want my wife and I to come to the school so they can finish their investigation. \n\nAs you can imagine my heart dropped, I called my wife at her job and headed to the school at what seemed to be the longest 15 minutes in my life.\n\nWhen I finally arrived at the school there were a police officer & the School staff waiting for me. I asked them what had happened and the school director explained casually that there was a mishap where our son had left the school unnoticed right after the lunch break. Our son was then spotted by a lady that was driving on Rainbow Blvd who placed our child in her car and drove him to her residence and then called the police. The policeman picked him up from the ladies house and returned him to the school!\n\nWhat was really shocking was when I asked them how he exited the school, they replied through the front door! I asked them how can he leave the school through the front door unnoticed? They carelessly replied that the person that is supposed to be upfront had stepped out for a minute! I was really disturbed by their behavior towards this incident; they all seemed MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THEMSELVES THAN OUR CHILD. Instead of apologizing or taking responsibility, they blamed our 4 year old's desire to run & hide as the reason for this disaster. As a matter of fact since the incident no one from the school has called to check on our son or us!\n\nNow we feel obligated to make all parents aware of what we went through due to the fact that even though  this incident was reported to the DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, CHILD CARE LICENSING and Candil hall now has a lack of supervision complaint on their record, it only remains there for one year. We did not know this but all parents have the option of contacting the DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, DIVISION OF PUBLIC & BEHAVIORAL HEALTH, CHILD CARE LICENSING and get a history of all facilities in Nevada. \n\nWe ask all parents to contact Child Care licensing if they have concerns or are unclear about a child care facility's history before they make their final decision.\n\nIn this case our son was found but we can't help to think about what COULD have happened. A simple search on the LVMPD will tell you that there are 9 sex offenders that live within a one mile radius of this school. What if one of them would have got to our 4 year old before this lady did? If something happened to another child, we would be devastated that we did not do everything we could to protect all the children in this school. We certainly do not want any other parent to endure the horror that we experienced.", "business_id": "AIYHRIzUxqtS0aAiOU5xyA", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-05-26", "type": "review"}

It's always been a problem, with people partying in the next room and some rooms stink. But my recent stay (of one night) will hopefully be my last. \nMy mom drove me here around 6p.m. on a Wednesday night, so it wasn't busy at all. So I don't know why the reception clerk put me in a room on the third floor directly across from the parking garage level that takes people from their cars to the casino. I mean RIGHT ACROSS from the parking garage, like someone could be sitting in their car and I could look them in the eye from my window. Throughout the night I listened to car stereos, people laughing and yelling and a few car alarms.\n\nAfter a couple of hours in the casino, I went to my room. I was tired from flying in that morning and spending the day with family, so I didn't go back down to get another room once I saw my situation. I could hear people talking in the room next to the t.v. but didn't hear anything from the room next to my bed, so I stuck my earplugs in and fell asleep thinking that room was empty. Wrong. And this is how I learned just how unbelievably thin the walls are here: at midnight I was jolted awake by a thumping sound that didn't stop. I took my earplugs out and realized it was the metal headboard in the next room being slammed against the wall (great furniture) in the room that was NOT empty. The walls were so thin that EVERYTHING was audible. I got up,moved my luggage from the other bed and right when I laid down, a car alarm went off. At 4 a.m., the guy in that room began throwing up in the bathroom, which was next to the bed I was in now. He was busy with that for half an hour, then walked into the wall, then got himself tangled in the wire hangers of the coat rack, also next to my bed. I've stayed in hotels all over the world, some not so great, but this is the only time I've been able to tell everything that was going on in another room like I was watching it. I gave up and called my mom to come get me, as I was more exhausted than when I arrive.\n\nAnd here's where the Santa Fe \"resort\" gives you the final middle finger- when we went to the desk to check out and tell them how I had been kept awake from their thin walls and parking garage noise, they demanded an additional $15 bucks for an \"amenities fee\" for the 10 hours I spent in their craphole. We were told \"sorry, everybody charges a resort fee\" by a woman who clearly just wanted us to shut up and go away.

When I dropped them off most recently, I was very specific about the charges I expected to see when I picked them up. They assured me those were the charges.  Surprise, surprise when I came to pick the dogs up, they charged me almost $300 for four nights of boarding and included a bunch of incorrect and additional charges that were not shared with me in advance!  In fact, the opposite had been assured to me.  They know you're powerless in that situation.  If you want your dogs, you have to pay them what they demanding from you.

My family and I have been regular patrons here whenever we need our \"pho phix,\" but it just doesn't seem the same anymore.  Sadly, the quality of your food has gone away.  I don't know if you are cutting costs with a sub-par ingredients list now, but your food doesn't quite taste the same anymore.  Add to that that some of your menu items have gone up in price which seems more difficult to swallow.\n\nTwice in the past 2 weeks we've dined here, and twice we've gone home feeling some kind of indigestion - both of us, and both our kids.  It's weird to explain this, but we have to attribute it to what we had eaten there.  It is all too coincidental.\n\nAny pho you select here is delicious, but something just isn't right anymore.  It has got to be the freshness or quality of the ingredients.  I had even tried their Bun Rieu, vermicelli noodle and crab soup, for the first time and left here feeling less than satisfied.  The crab meat just didn't taste fresh.\n\nLastly, according to the server, they've changed the way that they make their Da Chanh and Soda Chanh, fresh lemon drink and fresh lemon soda.  It tasted different this time around; even my son thought so, and you know kids' palates...you change a simple ingredient and they can taste the difference immediately.  They either put some weird syrup in it now or they use different lemons or limes...hard to say, but it had a strange, almost close to a lychee-flavored taste, to it.  Unfortunately, they forgot the key ingredient - \"freshness.\"  They should have stuck to their original way of making it.

I don't know a whoel lot about Argentinian food, but I do know they do empanadas and beef!\n\nWe started with two empanadas, 1 beef, and 1 spinach.  Flaky, flavorful and tasty.  Beef was the winner.  They serve crusty bread with a nice dish of chimmichurri.  Excellent. The bread is crunchy so you can really soak up at that oily garlicky herby goodness.  We all chose a hot sandwich served with french fries.  I had a delectable sandwich (can't remember the name) but denoted with a star as a favorite.  It was steak, ham, provolone, fried egg, lettuce and tomatoes on a baguette.  It was awesome.  Dad had the choripan.  It was an argentinian sausage sliced on a baguette with chimmichurri.  Very good, and a bargain at only $6.50 for a 9' sandwich with a pile of fries.  My husband had the sweetbread sandwich.  He was in heaven.  Swears they were the best sweetbreads he has ever had.  He raved....5 stars!!!  He also tried the local brew - Quilmes - he wasn;t a fan but understood how they must go down easy on a hot day.  We took home some sandwich halves and extra fries.

Spirits we were looking at were good selection, but did not find anything rare we wanted to buy. \n\nWe did go home with a nice surprise of Bushmills etched glasses for 99cents each. Score! We collect glasses and need a few good ones for Whiskeys.\n\nJust a FYI for out of towners, this will be one of the closer Lee's to tourist area.", "business_id": "p9SrA4o_Fp0AgBXbsGUe5Q", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-05-16", "type": "review"}

It's the closest to NY pizza on the West coast there is.  Take it from a New Yorker and a self proclaimed Pizza Snob.  It is crunchy with just the right amount of sauce/cheese ratio.  You know that it's a great pie when you do NOT have to add anything on the pizza.  Just a cheese pizza and if it's good, you know it's good.  This place makes one of the best Pizza's in town!  The garlic knots are also amazing and with marinara, magnifico!", "business_id": "7Mgly28cnzY-2py2ClEjiA", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-03-10", "type": "review"}

Every time I try to cut corners by trying to save money with auto shops like Jiffy Lube, they always come up with other stuff that they say needs replacements and I end up coughing up more than what I thought would just be an oil change.\n\nToyota has always been straight forward with me and most of the time gives no bad news about my car.  So far the only things they've recommended was my change of cabin filter and brakes which I knew I needed at the time.\n\nTypical wait though is an 1 1/2hr without an appointment.  It's a very clean and well maintained dealership with a decent waiting room. The staff is very friendly, except for that old lady at the cashier, but I'll give her a pass and a 4 star since I'm such a nice guy!\n\nDon't try to kill time by walking around the lot because these car sales people will stalk you like a lion ready to pounce on a zebra.", "business_id": "gwCWL6Vc9imaTNNpO7sfFg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-05-22", "type": "review"}

The employees are nice, but everything is computerized and it makes me think that they work on commission.  They tried to sell me things I had previously purchased and they kept lowering the price by a dollar and saying \"so now do you want it?\"  I just came for an oil change.  I expected to be told about what else needs to be done, but other places which actually care about the user experience will print you a list of needs and their prices.  That would have been respectable instead of trying to intimidate you with a computer.  Hahaha, don't even try it buddy:/\nI ended up waiting about an hour and a half to even be seen, but when I called the girl told me I could get an oil change right away:/. When I called I asked to make an appointment.  This place is like a snake.  I. Wouldn't necessarily blame it in the employees, I'd blame it on jiffy lube.
