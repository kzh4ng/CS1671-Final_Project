We found her a great mattress at a great price. While waking around the store my wife found a Serta iComfort series mattress for us that felt like heaven to lay on. \n\nLee had told us about their free 18 month no interest financing through Wells Fargo Bank, free bed frame, free delivery and set up of your new bed and free removal of your old mattress and box spring which made it a no brainer! I went in to only buy our daughter a new mattress but I bought us a new one as well. No one can beat their prices! I compared the price of our new mattress to Levin, Macy's and Mattress Discounters. No one came close to the price we got at American Buyers. Everywhere else was double the price for just our mattress not including our daughters so it was like getting hers for free.\n \nTake it from me, when it comes to your sleep, DO NOT BUY A CHEAP MATTRESS!!! We bought a cheap, supposed Serta mattress in 2008 from Mattress Discounters. The boxed spring had to be replaced about 2 years after owning the bed. I don't think I will have that problem again as our new Serta has a full 25 year warranty. \n\nA couple days later our daughters mattress was delivered first and about a week later our new mattress was delivered.

I would normally not review a chain retail store, but the service I received today just really got my blood boiling.\n\nI will state, as I always do in these types of situations, that I have worked many years in retail. I know what you're supposed to do. I know the ways I've displayed exemplary service and I know the ways I've slacked off. I get it, I really do.\n\nSo I'm in the store early. Hardly any people in there. Weird for the Semi-Annual Sale time of year. Usually it doesn't matter what time you're there during the sale, it's always busy. \n\nI went through my usual bins and picked up a mess of undies and bras. Since no one was at the check out counter and I needed a spot to go through things, I set them down and started to try and chat with the sales chick. I actually always like to do this, just to shoot the breeze, but also to get their opinions on items I'm buying. \n\nThe girl behind the counter was having non of this though.I asked her about a bra and she said she didn't know about that one, but said it should work. I understand, you can't try them all. But the thing that really irked me was that she was definitely not hiding her annoyance at me setting down my things on the counter. I even looked back to make sure there were no people checking out behind me. Ghost town. Tumbleweed rolled by. No one.\n\nSo I'm going through my stuff and separating what I want and don't want and she's sighing and grabbing things saying \"Soooo, you DON'T want these???\" Um, I'm not asking you to help me sort things. I'm not holding up a line. I'm just trying to not spend $$$ on an accidental XS pair of undies that got mixed in! \n\nAfter that, it's not exactly what she said, but how she acted. I have never felt more uncomfortable in a retail store before. I ended up grabbing my discards and putting them back myself (which I really don't mind doing, but after she huffed and puffed, I didn't even want to deal with her). \n\nThe thing is, I was nice the entire time. I don't expect you to sit there and be sugary sweet either. Just do what you were hired to do. Be nice and sell some bras.

Their primary focus is on racing bikes, but (as I'm not a racer) the service stays top notch in much lower price ranges.\n\nGot greeted by the staff, and my girlfriend and I got the luxury of absolutely no pressure as we walked around and looked at bikes.  She explained what she was looking for, and the staff explained what they had and what price range she was looking at.  I wound up talking to another person working there, and let them try to find a bike that fit.  (I'm 6'8\", and as I found out, fit pretty well on an XXL Scott 65cm frame.)\n\nAnyways, back to my girlfriend's experience.  What impressed me was after they had a bike they thought was a winner, they let her go on a test ride around the neighborhood there.  And then when she came back in two minutes, told her that wasn't ideal, and sent her back out, with instructions to take the second left and try it on a hill.  After she figured out yes, that was the bike, the guy spent at least half an hour fitting the bike to her; he wound up switching out the stem, adding a seat with a little more travel, and getting everything just so.  There was no hurry.  There was no pressure.\n\nThe amount of interest that the staff showed in getting each person the just-so fit gets five stars; if you want a bike that fits, it's worth it to browse here.\n\nAnd, update: I went out the other day, and asked for a price on a bike costing about 25% of the bike I tooled around on there two weeks ago.  Without batting an eye, and without a hint of bike snobbery, the owner ran off to figure out what it'd cost me.  I talked to him about the differences between a double and triple, and he spent twenty minutes explaining the pros and cons, and gave a strong suggestion on the double.  \n\nThat said, the price he quoted me was also 10% under the price quoted by another shop on the same exact bike.  I asked for the price of an upgrade to a single part on the new bike, and he quoted me about half the price I expected from doing research on the internet.  \n\nCustomer-friendly, well priced, super-high-quality bicycles.  A+++.\n\n\nEdit, 4 years later: \n\nGlen, Beth, and the rest of the crew here are still there, and still awesome.  My girlfriend is now my wife.

Are you kidding me?!?! I had pre-ordered a presentation bouquet a few days prior for my 12 year old who was performing the lead role in the Nutcracker that Sunday... one dozen esperanza roses at $4 each. I went to Blooming Dahlia because I wanted something extra special for the bouquet that would be presented to her onstage during the bows.  Though the bouquet was not ready when my older daughter and I stopped by the store in between Saturday performances, I did not complain. When I noticed the florist wrapping the roses in light brown tissue paper (that actually looked like a brown paper bag), I asked if they had any pink or white tissue paper that they could use instead. The florist was visibly annoyed by my request but did look to see if she had any other colors (which they did not). Okay, I thought, I can simply rewrap the roses with pretty tissue paper when I get home. But, when she started ringing up my order at $5 per rose (versus her original quote of $4 each), I decided not to purchase the bouquet. Why would I pay such a high price for roses that were nice but certainly not extra special and that I would have to go home unwrap and rewrap in my own tissue paper?! I actually apologized to her and said thank you, but I have decided not to purchase the bouquet (which, by the way, was still not completely arranged and wrapped). She looked at me and asked, \"so you are not taking the bouquet?\" and I replied, \"no, I'm sorry. It's not what I was looking for, but thank you\".

After approximately seventy-five minutes, we began cleaning up to go home.  It should be noted that the 75 minute class time included a 10-15 minute sales pitch of Crate's products. For $60 per person, I was beyond disappointed.  It seems unethical and deliberately misleading to advertise the length of the class and barely run 50% of the scheduled time.\n\nThe bottom line:  good instruction, but you'll feel extremely cheated at the end.", "business_id": "EiKoZpEcjG1B_r8G9laAxg", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-02-09", "type": "review"}

The trip downstairs to the bathroom is somewhat disturbing. The toilet, appropriately, also lies at the end of a long hallway, behind a door which may or may not be able to close completely. Cleanliness of this one was an afterthought. \n\nHowever, while you hesitantly make your way towards the bathroom, be sure to check out the posters lining the wall of the stairs. Some of the past line-ups may astound you(And the prices you could have seen them for). Make no mistake, there is a fairly solid quality to the music here(especially from touring bands) and over the years many of them go on to be influential in one way or another. So if it's your thing, but sure to stop out and catch a show - the music will probably be solid, and the tickets are cheap!\n\nThey're the only place on the street that requests donations for entry during Unblurred, but honestly I can't imagine the place is a gold mine regularly and the music they host is important to Pittsburgh(in my opinion), so I never mind tossing in a few bucks. Also, IMO, promotion isn't the best here, so check the website to find out the latest shows, or stop in during Unblurred.", "business_id": "3G8_qVxaTkkO5b70_H8YDA", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-01-17", "type": "review"}

My 14-year-old daughter introduced me to this place. She kept telling me about the clothing she could get there for less than $1, and I didn't believe her. So, I went with her. The store is on a stretch of Penn where you can still find a metered parking place right out front. For those not from the city or who aren't used to shopping in hoods in transition, don't let the look of nearby buildings scare you off. If the nice old ladies who volunteer at the shop find the area safe enough to work in, then you don't have anything to be afraid of. Buck up! You'll be glad you did.\n\nAbout the merchandise, it's worth searching through. The last time I was there, I got an authentic, mint-condition Burberry men's trench (with lining!) for $4.00. Yes, you read that right. $4.00. It fits my son perfectly!\n\nMy daughter is into 80s fashion right now (which is strange bc I was too in the 80s). She comes home with sweaters for .$25. 25 cents! for a sweater! Wacky.\n\nI bought a pair of mint condition (could have been brand new) jeans there once, too.

The first time that we ate here my wife and I were both unsure of where to go.  We hesistantly headed up the stairs next to the shop into the apartment above which thankfully ended up being the correct place!  The apartment consists of a couple of rooms off to the right where you can mingle and eat your appetizers and then the kitchen a bit farther down where we have always had the rest of our meal.\n\nOn both of our visits we have started off the evening with 6 different appetizers.  This last time around we had meatballs, a tuscan loaf of bread covered in spices, a cucumber salad, stuffed mushrooms, roasted vegetables and a stuffed tomato.  My favorite of the bunch both times was the tuscan loaf covered in spices.  After you finish up the appetizers you are invited into the kitchen where the rest of the meal is served family style.  First up at the table was our soup which was a minostrone genovese.  Maria, the main cook, suggested that we add some red pepper flakes and some parmesan to it which gave it some extra flavor and the little bit of kick which I loved.  Whenever we were finished with our soups, ricotta gnocchi was served to our table with a red sauce made with pork and beef simmered in red wine and tomatoes.  What is nice about this place is that Maria is very accomodating to food allergies.  Since I am not able to have red wine, they made a special bowl of the gnocchi for me with a san marzano sauce.  It was really good and I loved how light and fluffy the gnocchi ended up being.  Once that course was finished we were presented with a crown roast of pork on one platter and winter vegetables on another.  The crown roast of pork was quite impressive and the 8 of us had a hard time finishing even half of.  The vegetables were also good here and I was sad that I had filled up as much as I did as I was not able to eat as many as I would have liked.  There was also some green beans with tomatoes and olives floating around which is pretty much the only item of the night that I didn't really care for.  While I normally love green beans, they tasted of the olives that they were cooked with and so it wasn't for me.  Of course with all of the other food on the table I didn't even really care and I know its something that I normally would not have ordered at a restaurant.  The salad was served next after the main course.  It consisted of apples, pecans and cranberries over Romaine and was topped with their balsamic glaze dressing.  It was really good and I especially loved the large granules of sea salt (Maldon perhaps?) that were on it which helped to make it taste extra good.  Last but not least was our dessert which was Chocolate LOOOOOOVE Cake.  It consisted of chocolate custard, chocolate cake and chocolate Mousse.  Since chocalate is the other food besides red wine which I am not able to enjoy, Maria was nice enough to make me a cinnamon cannoli for dessert.  While everyone was enjoying their chocolate cake, my dessert was brought to the table and was greeted with an audible sigh from some other members of our party that they were not getting the cannoli also.  As we were finishing our desserts Maria produced a decaf espresso for anyone that wanted it.  It had a nice orange flavor to it and was very good.  When all was said and done, all of the substantial amount of food that our group did not eat was packed up by Maria and set aside for us to take home.  Everyone ended up leaving with a fair amount of it.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that we will be back here again in the future.  As a matter of a fact we already have our reservation made with the same group for July.  Beyond that my wife and I are trying to get some family together for another time.  If you are looking at trying to eat here I recommend that you book early because as of early Februrary all of the weekend days through November were already booked.

Overall, I liked my experience with the store.  \n\nI went to two bridal stores in Pittsburgh looking for my gown and was planning to visit two more in DC (my former residence) if I couldn't find anything locally.  My first visit was to Bridal Beginnings, which did a good job of finding dresses in the style I was seeking and in my budget, but which had pretty small sample sizes so it was incredibly difficult to picture how the back of the dress would look.   For reference, I am a street size 8-10.\n\nAnne Gregory's sample sizes seemed to be a size up from the ones at Bridal Beginnings, which was enormously helpful.  They also did a good job of picking things that were clearly within the style I was looking for, as well as some a little out of the box, but not too far, which they wanted me to take a shot at.  I ended up with a dress that I loved for almost half of my total budget.   I didn't want to go over $2,500 for a dress alone, and ultimately my dress, alterations and a very basic veil were under that amount.  \n\nSome points were lost as I didn't love their collection of veils and accessories (it would have been nice to have a one stop shop) and their alterations schedule was difficult, forcing me to schedule fittings, including the last fitting, a little sooner than I would have liked.  Also, I should note that the stores in Pittsburgh lack some atmosphere.  While Anne Gregory's was better than BB, there were still no drinks, champagne, snacks, etc. for my attendants, which is standard in larger cities and which smaller cities like Buffalo are even catching on to.  \n\nIn the end, I would have liked them to go that little extra step to streamline the experience, especially given the price of alterations and accessories, but I was still pleased with my experience.", "business_id": "i5bPwhPg6GqXvWMdl8a_SA", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-01-02", "type": "review"}

I would try on a dress, look at what wasn't flattering on different areas of my body, and he would come right back upstairs with a gown that fixed the problem!!!  It was quite impressive. He knows what he is doing. His taste is impeccable, and really knows what flatters different shapes and figures. He is honest, but sweet, yet direct. Which I loved!!!   We had fun laughing and talking.  His assistant was sweet too. I felt totally comfortable. I cannot wait to go back for my fitting.

How much more expensive? Enough that the Galleria is typically window shopping only for me...\n\nOn the plus side, the Galleria is a bit more upscale and beautiful than the South Hills Village by design, so at least while I'm window shopping I'm able to enjoy a lovely building and atmosphere! Although I really don't like driving in its parking lot; I often have to park in the underground segment of the lot and doing so kind of creeps out the claustrophobic in me.\n\nAnd in fairness there ARE some things in here I can afford and do enjoy going to. The Hibachi place here is pretty good, and it's hard to go wrong with a Panera or Starbucks stop. Other highlights for me include the delicious chocolate shop, happy hour at Houlihans, and (to break my food and drink theme) the Coldwater Creek store. I also love just sitting around the fountain they have in here...it brings back memories from when I was little and ran along the ledge of that very fountain. (Surprise surprise, I fell in once or twice...little me wasn't a well-behaved child sometimes.)\n\nStill, the good things here aren't enough to make me love the Galleria more than the South Hills Village mall space. There's no bookstore in the Galleria area, its movie theater is overpriced (especially considering the run-down state of the theater itself as of my last visit), and honestly I've had a bad experience with sales reps in a number of the stores here; many have been overly pushy in an obvious effort to boost their commission payments, to the point that they've tried to sell me items that don't even fit me properly.\n\nIf you're going to visit the Galleria, I say do it for the food. There are definitely some decent eateries here (I only mentioned a couple of them).

When you enter, you'll immediately see an array of gag gifts, pop culture t-shirts and the like in the main area of the store. If you turn left after entering, you'll be able to start browsing through the book collection. Most of the books here are fantasy, sci-fi, comics, YA books - things of that nature - although there's also often some classic literature pieces and other genres available as well. (But in my experience most of the books are more modern or at least relate to modern culture trends, i.e. certain superhero comics appear more often when a certain superhero movie hits theaters.) Keep going past the bookshelves, and you'll start to find stuffed animals, Harry Potter house scarves, and similar doo dads that will satisfy a little kid you're shopping for (or even just your own inner kid). Keep going further, and you'll start to find the calendars, note books, journals and even ornaments. \n\nAnd finally at the back of the store, you'll find the enormous collection of gift cards that the store name presumably refers to. As others have mentioned, the cards vary in nature from traditional to wild in nature - so you'll most likely find something here for any friend or family member, if you give yourself the time to browse. Personally I think the stock in the rest of the store is just as much fun to browse through and explore, because the variety of stuff they collect and sell is just fascinating - there's everything from ordinary stuffed animals to \"Wizard Of Oz\" figurines to \"Star Trek\" toys...and so so so much more.\n\nThat's the basic tour and overview of Kards Unlimited, and I honestly don't think it does a good job explaining just how much different stuff you can find in here. I know that sometimes stores that try to cram too much onto their shelves can seem chaotic and disorganized, but the set-up this store has really works for them, somehow. There's something here to appeal to traditional, wacky and geeky personalities alike, and because of that they're definitely worth visiting again and again when possible, just to see what other items they've added to their stock. I admittedly don't buy a ton here because of the prices, but I do still love them as a window shopping store and will absolutely jump at the chance to splurge on anything unique I find here.

We had some general idea of what we wanted and let him know our budget and the quality of the stone we wanted. He was able to see our vision and made it into a beautiful ring with very modern and simple design that I will love and wear everyday. Ron is truely an artist and you will get the best value, quality, design and service here. After your initial meeting to go over design concepts, he will make a wax mold for you to see what the product will look like. We did not have to wait too long to get the final product (a week or two) after the mold was made and stone was selected. They can also make matching bands that are similar but a little different in style and it'll fit perfectly to your engagement ring. They have since then moved to this near by location now (above and to the right of the the French crepes store), which is closer to the parking lot off Walnut street:\n\nThe Collection\n732 Filbert St.\nPittsburgh PA 15232 \n\nThere are multiple artists that work there and you can see some of their work here on their new website below. There are also some unique and simple styles of rings that you can try on in the store if you need some inspirations. \n\nhttp://www.thecollectionpittsburgh.com\n\nI highly recommend you check this place out if you are considering custom made engagement rings or jewelry that's unique and one of a kind. If you have been looking for a perfect ring but haven't found it yet, make an appointment and you'll be very happy that you look into it (it's more effort but definitely worth it!). Ron is extremely experienced and the ring he made us was very comfortable, extremely well made and sturdy. I have got so many compliments on it. It also has a square shaped bottom so it doesn't slide around my finger like regular rings(which is a bonus). Ron's also very friendly and honest with his pricing, no hidden charges. There are no design fee, they charge a percentage of the actual jewelry value. You can also ask them to get an outside appraisal for your insurance as well as go back for checkup and cleaning after you've worn your ring for a few months.", "business_id": "pmikYgE5m0MblL6vl49GQA", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-12-28", "type": "review"}

He was, however, VERY nervous about finding a ring I loved, while also not having to blow the budget (we were both grad students at the time). It was important to me that HE go and buy it, even I gave him an idea ahead of time of what I wanted.  But then thinking about it...I honestly realized that I HAD no idea what I wanted.  \n\nI decided, then, to take an afternoon I had off from work to scope things out, as I kind of got the idea that maybe with a vintage/antique ring, it would just be about a ring I fell in love with, and not a ring that was 'perfect' in all it's 'C's. Plus, I figured it would be fun. I first went to MH, because I'd heard good things about her, excepting a few negative reviews on here that are now 'filtered.'  At this visit, though her brusqueness/pushiness was notable, it didn't veer over into nastiness.  I told her what I figured my fiancee's budget was, but she kept showing me rings above it, saying things like  'if he really loved [me], he'd pay more for a ring [I] like\"(!).  She also showed me a ring I fell in love with, only to realize that she'd 'accidentally' told me that the '2700' written on it was the PRICE- when it turned out to be the STYLE number - the cost was $4000. Another reason for showing me rings outside of his budget was, as she kept putting it, '[I'm] a 'big girl,' so [I] need a big ring.'  To be clear, I'm 5'10 & nothing close to overweight.  This visit wasn't HORRIBLE, but definitely kinda unpleasant.  I ended up going straight to Antiques of Shadyside, and my experience was 100x better: they wouldn't even show me any rings above his budget and were just generally SO pleasant and nice.  Ironically, I ended up getting a beautiful (not to mention big) ring that looks a great deal like the one I loved at Marlene's - with an appraisal value only a few hundred less than what Marlene charged for hers, but for $1600 less in price.\n\nSo now, months later, my fiance and I have agreed that I choose my wedding ring, he chooses his.  Easy peasy.  I go to AofS, only to be heartbroken at the sign up that they are permanently closed..I hope not cause of the deal on my ring!! ;(  So I think I'm prepared this time for Marlene. Knowing that, no matter what SHE's like, she's got what I reluctantly admit is pretty much the biggest stock of estate/antique rings around, I look at her site, and find 4 or 5 rings I like in my price range. I go with my Mom.  I tell her ahead of time, I'm not letting Marlene push me around and tell me what kind/price of ring I should get this time... let's just look at these few rings, hopefully I'll like one of them, and we can go.\n\nWhen I get there, there's a young couple there already that Marlene's working with. I get the sense that their budget for each of their rings is about 1/3 over mine for one. But still, their budget was not a HUGE amount compared to what some people spend.  I hear them talking to her and saying they drove up from MD.  She's fawning all over them, and I notice she said something in reference to the cost of a ring, that 'the economy is so bad so it's tough for you young kids.'  I think, great!!  Maybe she's had a personality transplant and isn't so rude now.  It's our turn, and she pulls out the ones I asked to try, and as I'm quietly trying them on and talking to my mom about them, again, it's the 'you're a big girl, you need a big ring.'  (Seriously, I feel sorry for someone TRULY fat going in there).  She just kept shrugging her shoulders at my budget like she felt sorry for me and really couldn't do anything for me, even though I knew from her website that there were a number in my price range that were perfectly normal sized wedding bands.  I also pointed out the ROCK to her on my hand - noting that that was kinda enough bling for me.  I asked her, then, if there were any rings in my budget that she'd recommend I try.  She laughs haughtily and goes, 'oh, I'd have NO idea what they cost without looking.'  Um, what?!  YOU'RE A JEWELER!  Sure, you don't know the EXACT price, but not even a BALLPARK?  \n\nThen, for God only knows what reason, I asked if she had any earrings with green stones for my wedding day. Instead, she took me to a pair of phallic-looking drop-pearl earrings, telling me that 'the richest family in Pgh just bought these for their daughter... this is what we put ALL our brides in.'  Um, not me, thanks.\n\nUltimately, I found a ring there that I considered buying, even though it was $100 over my budget, only to realize it would remind me of her every time I looked at it.  I really think that Marlene would be SOL if it weren't for her internet business, because if she only had to get by on her personality, she'd be run out of town.  New Yorkers might not expect niceness from their jewelers, but Pittsburghers do.  She was the rare person in all my wedding planning that was just awful to deal with.

They established what he could afford and she made up two trays of rings in his price range that suited his description of his fiancee and her tastes.  When the fiancee arrived, Marlene showed her the rings that were agreed upon.  Everybody was on the same page and the chosen ring was perfect on the woman's hand.  \n\nMarlene is honest to the point of being blunt.

Majors Bridal Boutique at 2400 Park Road.  As soon as the Sales clerk learned that we were not a bride or part of a bridal party, we were immediately left alone.  We then headed to NYBride at 4618 South Blvd and pretty much received the same treatment.  Both were rated highly by bride and bridal party so I believe that their Sales Associates were instructed to focus only on those customers as a revenue potential is much higher with that group than someone buying a special occasion dress.\n\nSince our experience with customer service have been pretty atrocious with both stores, I decided that why not go to David's Bridal.  We were pleasantly surprised while we were browsing the very well stocked store when 3 different Sale Associates approached us to offer their help.  Once we found dresses that my daughter wanted to try on, a Sales Associate named Shakira promptly escorted us to the dressing room.  Eventhough she was also helping 2 other customers, I was able to get her attention 4 different times to ask questions and get help from Alteration staff.  I felt that the service that I received was attentive and I would definitely go back here if I ever need a special occasion dress again.\n\nThank you Shakira for your outstanding service while we were there!", "business_id": "SmxYzoYDxMRMahF-PO7gHg", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-02-20", "type": "review"}

She allowed me the freedom of my own thoughts which, for me, goes a long way for me making a purchase. \n\nI brought my husband with me a couple days later to show him what I'd found, and she was there, helpful as ever. As we were trying to decide which way to go, she shared with us the pros and cons of each, and if there was a question she couldn't answer, she went to find out the correct answer. \n\nWe purchased a couple of items and expected the wait to be quite long since they were backordered.

And keep the jokes about my mom dressing me to a minimum, please.  I was taking them back, thankyouverymuch.\n\nThere are three problems that I have with JCP - one is not really specific to this store, so I'll cover it first.\n\nThis is the only one anywhere near our house.  It's the only one in Charlotte (and it's actually in Pineville).  There was one in Eastland, but it closed some time back, after a brief experiment as an outlet.  It's just odd, but you can't really count that as a strike against this store - I just thought I'd mention it.\n\nSecond is the size of the place, and again, that's not really a fault here, as it is a department store.  What is a problem is the organization.  There isn't any.  Say you want to find something in the men's section - it's all over the place.  Finding anything is nearly impossible.\n\nLastly is the staff.  They are just about useless.  I took my return to a desk to see how much I had to work with (having only a gift receipt).  He told me $24.99.  So I found something for $24.99.  After returning to the same guy, he told me I owed nearly $9.  How is that possible?  He scanned the item's barcode, not the gift receipt - so I promptly made him figure it out - which should have involved changing the price of my item to the discounted price.  But it took him a while to figure that out.\n\nI did get the discounted price, which is why I enjoyed the experience overall, and I probably shouldn't have - wouldn't have even expected it if he had scanned the right thing in the first place.  But it shouldn't have taken nearly that long.\n\nThe real reason I think it's worthwhile is that the prices (at least right now) are awfully good.

This office depot is the closest one to my work, but if it was closer to my home it would be the location I frequent most often.  In the 3 times I have come in, someone has stopped to help me as soon as I enter the doors.  They are also excited when customers enter the doors.  It's not like the normal humdrum of \"do you need help\", but a genuine interest in what you need with phrases like, \"What can I help you with today?\"  They greet me, walk over, then ask me if I need assistance.  If they are in the middle of helping someone else, they will have to point to what I need, but if not they will walk me to it or to the associate that can better help me.  When I've gotten to my particular dept each time, the associate working in the dept always assists me.  I am a somewhat picky person when it comes to work ledgers, calendars, files, etc, and on the 3 occasions I have been to this location every associate has been helpful in finding the perfect thing. They are knowledgable about the products they carry, the location of them, shipping of certain items,  and the stocking of them. The cashier assisting me on 2 occasions was the same.  I don't remember her name, but she was short, older,grayish hair, and a smile on her face.  She has always been super friendly and all about the new promotions etc that they have. She is a true gem in customer service just like the rest.\n \nBEAUTIFUL STORE:\nThere has not been a single time I've come into this store and seen a mess from stocking, a customer, etc.  It is always very clean and organized. It is always well-stocked with few product holes. \n\nSTAFFING:\nThere is always someone there to assist you, so this store is staffed very well.  When you get to the register, you rarely have to wait in any line and there are always people up front ready to assist you.  And of course, amazing customer service.  I feel as if every employee has been hand-picked to complement the store, so kudos to mgmt even though I've never met you!\n\nATMOSPHERE:\nThe store is well-lit with a good layout.  Products are easily found and accessible.  The staff creates an air of excitement every time I come in. \n\nLOCATION:  \nThe biggest downfall.  It's hard to navigate in and out of here due to the location on 51, and I have to drive out and take a u-turn to get where I need to be. \n\nAs an office supply nut, this store fuels my addiction!! I do wish this store was closer to my home in a neighboring town as seemingly everything is better, but especially the customer service. It's so nice to walk into a business and feel welcome and appreciated no matter what I look like, no matter how little or how much I'm buying, and no matter how busy the store is upon my arrival.", "business_id": "VsoLWxAIwAsz08Mc2bkyWA", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-01-16", "type": "review"}

Despite an onslaught of $1 kiosks and the advent of internet media streaming, I'm happy to say that the store has recently been acquired by a new owner who is also local and committed to keeping the business going.  But it needs support.  Here are the reasons why Visart is worth an actual drive and stop in:\n\n1.  This is the local hub to find out about arts happenings in the community.  Local bands, small theater productions, neighborhood festivals- they all advertise on the community board posted up front.  Take some time and read about what's going on around you!\n\n2.  Flipping thru movie titles on a computer screen still pales in comparison to scanning movie box titles across a tightly-packed shelf.  Visart is packed to the gills with movies from just about any genre you can imagine.  There's something about discovering that flick that will be \"the one\" for the night that you otherwise would never have seen coming.  This is hard to do when a computer program effectively censors what movies it shows you based on your past browsing history.  Down with the artificial intelligence !\n\n3.  Not everything is digital.  If there are some movies you can't stream online, it's likely Visart has them.  Foreign flicks, exploitation films and others I can't even name have a section here.  If you are a film student or movie buff, this is your Shangri la.  \n\nMaybe this is the start of me becoming an old-fogie?  If so, I'll play the part- when I was a kid, we went to the real movie store and found our flicks the honest way- scanning the shelves and reading the actual jacket cover- and we liked it.", "business_id": "STcLx0y_X89TsC0m2gVgHw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-01-12", "type": "review"}

Case in point: I renewed my membership a few months ago after letting it lapse for a while, to contribute some $ the cause. The girl at the counter barely broke her conversation w/a girlfriend to say 2 words to me--no thank for coming back, idle chit-chat, nothing. And that's the norm at VisArt-absolutely no attempt at any sort of customer service beyond \"hey, we got great movies, we don't have to be nice!\" (wasn't that the gist of an old SNL sketch w/Lily Tomlin about AT&T?) Its all that stops me from a 5 star review, and its the same \"cooler than thou\" hipster/elitest vibe that made me quit going to Boris & Natasha's and feel like I was unwanted and trying to shoplift something. In fact the employee attitudes at both places are almost identical\n\nI won't take the extreme stand of passing up all these great titles because of crappy attitudes but it seems that some folks do, and as this arena of video gets more competitive, I think that Mickey Alberman ought to address this w/his folks. In this market u need every single person you can get to be a happy customer. You don't have to be overly gushy and super/duper perky and unctious like at a Southpark store, but you do have to have people at least acknowledge you and thank you for renting something.

There have also been a few changes in staff in the past couple months, so anyone that has had a negative experience at VisArt because of rude, or unfriendly staff members, this should no longer be a problem because all of the current staff members are super-friendly and incredibly helpful.

But I won't go extreme and I won't go easy on this place either. Definitely not a 5 star experience but certainly worthy of 4.\n\nI really liked this shop. Now that I finally made it in to see what they're all about I was impressed with their selection. Being closed on Sundays is a bit of a downside for me because it's one of the only days I can usually make it down this way. The selection was awesome and they had everything you could expect as a professional or hobbyist photographer and then some. They're the only place I've seen in the area with Ilford film for example.\n\nThere were at least 4 guys working here when I went in. Of them only ONE came and asked me if I needed help and was even nice about it. He was an older gentleman named George. He was extremely helpful and even insistent on helping me find what I was looking for to accessorize my old 35mm Pentax K1000. But when I went to check out and pick out some film on the other side it seemed like the only thing the other guys could even muster up was some kind of stupid inside joke amongst themselves. It's unfortunate that a place with such great potential has a majority inconsiderate staff.\n\nIn my interactions as a photographer and assistant working with other photographers I have found that many of them really are inconsiderate, pretentious and down-right pompous. It's one of the things that has really turned me off to being a photographer. I'll stick to being a hobbyist.", "business_id": "EQDq4hZ45hDEHaWn6yuZyg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-02-26", "type": "review"}

Though I lament the fact that I can't sustain a hobby of shooting 35mm or medium format film and developing anymore, it's nice that Biggs is in town with plenty of supplies. I've been a customer for a few years now and have always been pleased with the selection of gear, resources and used/rental equipment. \n\nThey've got all of the necessaries for Canon, Nikon, Pentax, Sony, and other brand loyalists. I'm a Canon guy and have always been able to find what I'm in the market for. I most recently found a lens hood for my 50mm 1.4 that was pretty hard to track down even on the internet. Also, recently sold an old Pentax K1000 and some old darkroom gear here. For the shape that some of it was in, I got a pretty good deal. \n\nWhere I think Biggs has some serious shortcomings is their customer service. Here's the deal, if you're not a professional photographer, (I personally am not. Just a hobby I've had for years) then you don't need to be condescending. I've had a few instances where a few of the staff members seemed to act a little more than inconvenienced to work with me. Not that it's a huge deal, but when I'm interested in checking out a lens from behind the counter, I don't need to hear a diatribe on WHY I shouldn't purchase that particular lens. It's what I'm in the market for. I do Just a bit of a flaw for the hobbyists on the customer service side of the coin. \n\nIn a pinch, these guys have always come through. Glad to have em in town.

I may or may not shop here again for my next firearm(s).  Leaning more towards not...  See below:\n1.) Firearms here are not generally less expensive than anywhere else.\n2.)

But if I were looking at changing cable/internet/phone providers I would want to know this. \n\nI have had Time Warner Cable, Charter, and AT&T UVerse. Easily, I was the least satisfied with TWC. I recently left Charter once UVerse came into our area since it has the best to offer as far as DVR, channels provided for price (including promotions such as HBO, Showtime, Big Ten Network, NFL, MLB networks, etc), and the $150 gift card for signing up. Charter is better for high def TV (AT&T you pay extra), faster Internet, and unlimited phone and fax line is free if needed. Although faster Internet that Charter advertises may be overkill, as Consumer Reports recently noted that 15mbps is the most that the average consumer needs, and I get 18mbps with UVerse, which is slower than Charter. \n\nAT&T UVerse has the worst customer service by far. Recently I have had about a month of contacting the company (via telephone and on-line chat) for problems with transferring my phone number from Charter to UVerse. Something as simple as this still has not happened. The telephone customer service agents cannot give me anything in writing (no email, letter, anything), and cannot contact Charter directly, or if they do, they ask that I call Charter (already have 3 times). AT&T Uverse customer service agents have horrible documentation of the previous communications with their customers. They also call and leave messages that are so mumbled I cannot understand them. They also promise to call back at certain times then never call back. \n\nI was also promised my first bill would be $128 + tax, and the first time activation fee of $49 would be waived. My first bill is about $168, and no one appears to be able to address this fee or find documentation of this quote (and as above, AT&T does not provide anything in writing).\n\nSo if AT&T UVerse offers you a deal that sounds too good to be true, likely it is.

Normally I am not the type of guy who returns things, but this was a $20 item that did nothing for my blocked-up nose.\n\nThe man behind the counter was friendly and tried to help but he needed a manager's approval first. At that time, two managers happened to be walking by. The clerk asked the older female manager about the return and she told him : \"He needs to call the company that makes the nasal spray. We don't take returns.\" She doesn't even look at me, let alone speak to me. I try to point out the receipt in my hand that clearly says \"returns within 30 days\" but the woman is already walking away even as the clerk and I call out to her! She goes into an office and vanishes. \n\nThe clerk calls out to the younger manager with the mohawk and asks her for help. She is too busy texting or checking Facebook or something on her precious cellphone. She ignores him completely even as he calls out her name. I try calling out to her too, saying \"Ms.? MS.?\" but she is a phone zombie and just wanders away.\n\nA line has formed and neither of these horrible managers even bother to jump on a register.

Perhaps not great, but really not all that bad.  In fact, a friend and I would plan our regular holiday shopping extravaganza for one Saturday each year, as it was never terribly busy, the store selection was solid, parking was ample, and we could get in and out quickly with presents for everyone.  If we wanted, we could even go ice skating or see a movie.\n\nOver the years, we watched as one store after another (both anchors and those in the middle of the mall) were shuttered.  Some reopened.  Others did not.  In a bold move, one anchor - the former JCPenney - first turned into an outlet, then split into separate stores, with a Burlington on top and several other stores on the bottom.  The ice skating rink turned into an indoor soccer field.  Nothing helped.\n\nCharlotte City Council said they were trying to help too, first by purchasing options to buy anchor stores, and later building a transit center on the mall property (which still stands).  They promised to remake the mall into a community center.  As things declined, this seemed like more and more of a possibility.  But as the price fell, so to did the likelihood of anything ever happening.  Eventually, the mall sold to an out-of-state bidder in foreclosure court for $2 million.\n\nThe bad news is that the anchor stores are still owned by others.  Yes, someone can actually own the mall itself - those hallways between the anchor stores - while other companies own the large anchor stores (other entities actually own chunks of the parking lot and surrounding parcels).  This makes rebuilding the property that much harder.\n\nAt least there are always those warm memories of gunshots on warm summer nights.", "business_id": "Qrux6-NnrcbLmAiIOT9APg", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-02-23", "type": "review"}

Then forget the fact that it's not a showroom showing you how they think you should set up your furniture and spend some time hunting for quality items. I bought 2 pieces right before Christmas and they were just delivered today (A little over 3 weeks time - I opted for them to hold one piece in their warehouse while the new piece I ordered was shipped since there is a charge for delivery. When it arrived a week ago I delayed delivery to accommodate my schedule).\n\nThe piece I purchased in their shop and had slight damage, which is not noticeable and which they touched up. It retails for approximately 5 times what I paid for it based on my web searches. The other piece, which I ordered new, I also got an exceptional price on over retail. I easily saved more than a few thousand dollars on these pieces combined.\n\nWhen the delivery truck arrived, the men made it very clear to me up-front that my new footboard was damaged slightly in shipping and that they would set the bed up immediately but have already ordered the replacement piece, which they'd bring back and swap out when the replacement arrived. They also showed me exactly the damage (a smallish gash) during set-up so I knew what they had noticed and were addressing. \n\nThe deliverymen spent a long time here, much of it carefully hauling in a huge desk in a way that wouldn't touch my floors and walls. The pieces I purchased were both big, heavy and solidly built so they take more effort to bring in carefully than lighter, cheaply made and/or assembly-required furniture. It is raining and muddy out so they (without my asking) brought in furniture pads and lined the entire trail to bring in the furniture so they wouldn't track anything over my floors. They also made sure my furniture never touched the ground outside. Unfortunately my bed doesn't exactly fit my already existing mattress/base without some tweaking, though they believed it would. They did not have the tools to tweak it, but one of the deliverymen made it very clear that while they were late for their next delivery he'd be back here after that with what he needed to make sure my bed was completely set up by tonight, and to bring a piece of my desk that had gone missing. All of it proactively, without me bringing any of it up. \n\nThe long and the short of it is this - If you don't need to see things in a shiny showroom setting, you have an open mind about what you may find in stock or may have to order, and you're willing to spend time searching their store and imagining the pieces they do have properly set up in your home then this is an excellent place to get a phenomenal deal. They have, from the moment I first saw the piece I wanted, to the email barrage back and forth with my questions on ordering the piece they didn't have, to delivering all of it - been not only accommodating and polite, but have gone out of their way to make sure any 'issues' were addressed up-front by them rather than me having to ask. When you add all that to the thousands of dollars saved on very high quality furniture this is an excellent place to shop. Think high-end showroom furniture at almost IKEA-like prices with excellent service from beginning to end. I still need to hunt down a few smaller items and accent pieces but based on this experience I know exactly where I will buy them.\n\nKeep in mind all sales are final and there are no refunds so make very sure of what you are getting before you buy it, and make sure you know what the 'damage' is if it is in the store. Also remember delivery is extra, or you can pick up. All of this is displayed visibly at their front desk so nothing is 'hidden' in their policies. Frankly the cost of delivery was FAR outweighed by the phenomenal service of their deliverymen (ask for Joe - his customer service on deliveries is AMAZING), who proactively handled everything that happened (from soggy weather to uncooperative pieces to a small missing part)\n\nI did finally post some pics (of my purchases and a couple other finds), but because of the nature of the place nothing is guaranteed to be there.", "business_id": "jGxoZbHB9-gIThxQFEv73Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-01-18", "type": "review"}

Luckily before I began my long and tedious I found some help. \n     A very friendly man, who by his attire and name tag appeared to be the manager, walked right in front of me.

At least for me it was great. 2/4$ and it was organic or what not. there a decent amount of choices.\n     However the 3 stars is only because when I asked where the Hanukkah stuff was he said they do not carry anything. He did point me to kosher foods, and when I was in the isle he gave further assistance. This is what I saw. A few boxes of matzoh on bottom shelf one two boxes of some other stuff, and some....HANUKKAH Candles  and also Shabot candles. One thing I can not stand is not knowing what you carry. Nobody try to say it is not his fault, or he may have not known.I just got upset that when I asked he said NO with a very sure voice. I can appreciate an I do not know let us fund out. \n     Anywho I got my things, paid at the self ring register, and was let down one more time.

From the beginning my mother told me not to expect a lot of money from these stores. That I'd be lucky if I made 20 dollars even with a bag full of nice clothes. So on my first trip to KidtoKid on Park Road I didn't expect much. I was aiming for maybe $15 dollars. I brought a shopping bag worth of stuff that I had washed, dried and even ironed the night before. But on my first trip to KidtoKid I made $22 dollars! I was so excited I decided to keep doing this every couple of months when my sister would grow out of her clothes. My next trip to KidtoKid I made $20 dollars. And on my third trip I made $15. A couple of months later I decided to give Once Upon A Child a try. I had read on other websites that they are horrible and have rude employees and don't give you crap for your clothes. But like I said before I don't have very high expectations when I try to sell my used baby clothes or baby equipment. So I decided to make a trip to Once Upon A Child one afternoon with huge bag worth of baby clothes. \n\nI arrived at Once Upon A Child at around 12:00PM. I immediately noticed that the store is dark and dated. When I finally got the attention of one of the ladies in the front they told me how it works and everything and said my clothes would be reviewed and done by 1:30PM. I've never had to wait longer than 45 minutes at KidtoKid, but I decided to waste time at Carolina Place Mall. I got back to Once Upon A Child around 1:45PM to figure out that my clothes still hadn't even been reviewed yet. They weren't even in the process of reviewing my clothes. So I ended up walking around the store for another 45 minutes! That didn't even bother me to much until I got to the front and the lady told me they only took one of my items. That the clothes were adorable but they were a tad bit wrinkled so to throw them in the dryer again and then bring them back. She literally had the nerve of taking one of my clothing items and gave me $2.15!  Like I said before I never have high expectations when I try to sell these clothes but two dollars and fifteen cents is INSULTING. There should be a minimum amount that they give you of at least $5.00. So I could of at least walked out of that freakin' store with enough to buy a  frappuccino. It was an awful experience. The ladies weren't rude but they weren't that friendly either. And that I had to wait that long amount of time weren't friendly either. And to literally take one of my clothing items and give me two dollars was terrible. I wasted my gas and my time.\n\nI'm going to keep giving my business to KidtoKid on Park Road. The girls that work there are usually friendly. The store is pretty and has WAY WAY better clothes then Once Upon A Child. And I've never had to wait longer than 45 minutes. Don't sell your clothes at Once Upon A Child, go to KidtoKid!", "business_id": "UgNGJhmwIDDQWfO2Fdo83w", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-01-09", "type": "review"}

Ladies you all  are privy to browse the racks of Vera Wang and Lauren Conrad clothing lines ( two of my favorites), while the fellas peruse noted men's wear ensembles by Marc Anthony, Van Heusen and Chaps. \n\nThe price for these great finds are usually pretty fair, compared to the price you'd pay at a local mall or other department store. \n\nThe store layout is logical and flows well thru the space. Hanging directional signs are located above each section of the store to help guide customers to their desired destinations. Helpful Hint: Please note that if you need to make a return that customer service is located in the back of the store at this location, not at the front :)\n\nKohl's Department stores also offer a wide variety of appearal for children and juniors. Kohl's customers are also able to make selections in the jewelry, shoes and home goods departments. So if you're looking for a new and fresh look without spending alot of cash I'd definitely recommend swinging by Kohl's and taking a look around.", "business_id": "o7PnVUZ-QqRLclVtN6qBYg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-02-20", "type": "review"}

She paid $19.20 for the top and $19.20 for the pants which = $38.40 total.  Unfortunately, they were too big, so I had to return them for store credit. Upon doing so, I was told that the items were now on sale, and that they would only refund me the sale price, which was $14.39 per piece, plus they were deducting the $10.00 Kohl's bucks that she received for the purchase. So, my Mom paid $38.40 for the PJ's and because they did not fit and I had to return them, I was given $20.05.  \nThe Kohl's cash I almost get, but not refunding the original price paid for the items is bull! But the taking the Kohl's cash promo away from the gift receiver is crap as well. It's a promotion the store is doing and as it turns out, it's just a big money maker.

I too was a big Kohl's shopper and fan, until yesterday when I tried to return 2 pairs of pants that were purchased for $34.99 each. Same pants-different colors. I had no receipt, so when they told me they could give me $2 for one and $19.00 for the other, I was in shock. They claimed the color makes a difference even though they are the exact same pants. That and the fact that all the discounts and Kohl bucks were deducted to get down to these ridiculous prices. I called in the manager, John who confirmed the insane prices offered. He said to me, \"It's all about consistency.\" What?!! $2 and $19 is not consistent!  He went to get me the home office phone number and another associate asks me if he had tried to search the sale of the pants to my credit card. He hadn't. So she scans my card and refunds my $75.05! He reappears and I told him thanks for nothing. Here is an upper manager who doesn't know his own return policy. He was just trying to rip me off again.\n\nMy advise: beware of this location. The front end staff is pleasant and well trained, but the management in the back service area is nasty. They all love to take our money, but they hate to give it back. So is this the Kohl's way?

Because of that failure, I had to carry them around while birding, and my bins took a bit of abuse not being on a shoulder strap.  My friend Greg who works for the ABA, mentioned this to Eagle Optics Sales Manager Ben Lizdas while they were both at the Rio Grande Birding Festival, and shortly Ben and I were in touch over Facebook.  He told me they were covered by warranty and I should either ship them or bring them in for a replacement pair.  \n\nREALLY?  \n\nI will admit my bins had seen better days, and I was more than willing to bear some of the responsibility...  \n\nOver the New Year weekend my family drove up to Minneapolis from Chicago and on the way we stopped at the Eagle Optics Madison, WI, retail location.  I met Tom Kuenzli and before I could really say anything, I had a replacement pair of Vortex Vipers, no questions asked.\n\nIs there really a company in this day and age that stands so completely behind it's products?  YES THERE IS!  \n\nWhile we were at the location, Tom took the time to show me a scope I was not going to purchase that trip, and maybe not ever, but he set it up for me anyway so I could be VERY IMPRESSED.  Great, now I want a scope I can't currently afford.  Well played Tom, well played.  \n\nI had heard for many years that Eagle Optics was THE place to purchase optics in North America.  And I found them easy enough to buy from.  They make it easy to do with their online store.  But after this last experience, I can't imagine ever buying future optics from any other seller ever.  The sales team at Eagle Optics really DO make buying from them easy and FUN, and I couldn't recommend them more highly if you are considering buying optics of any kind.  They are completely customer service focused, they KNOW optics, they are birders like their customers, and they stand behind their sales unlike any company I have ever had the pleasure of buying from.  Buying optics?  Buy from Eagle!", "business_id": "yqL6p-D4VMTEtrPO-1fscw", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-01-10", "type": "review"}

I couldn't keep the scope steady or keep it tightly attached to the tripod. I consulted with Ben at Eagle Optics, and he advocated on my behalf with Leica, even though this wasn't a repair typically covered by warranty.\nThe end result was a free repair of my scope. Thank you, Ben! \nBecause Ben is a birder, he also realized how important it was to have my scope for an upcoming Christmas Bird Count. So he EXPEDITED my free repair and I got the fixed scope returned to me in record time.\nI recommend Eagle Optics to everyone who asks me about binoculars.\nThe customer service is the best around. \nJill A", "business_id": "yqL6p-D4VMTEtrPO-1fscw", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-01-10", "type": "review"}

Got several men's fragrancees (Polo red, Aqua Di Gio, John Paul Gultier, CK Euphoria, Dolce and Gabana Sport) and complimentary body wash, duffle bags, and trial bottles too. The Boston Store charge card is also nice because you can save on luxury items that never go on sale like cosmetics and fragrance.

If they do, they will gladly put it on hold for you at the front desk for up to a week at NO CHARGE! Staff is very friendly, and store is always neat and clean. Definately a winner. Always call and check here before paying full price for any book!!! They also buy/sell used records, cd's, movies, and computer software and games.", "business_id": "qTzXFsBjMmOQHeRrWnJYLg", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-12-26", "type": "review"}

I stayed in the car with our two sleeping children. I was there for less than 2 minutes when I was startled by an angry knock at the window. I cracked the door to some bitter, 20 something security guard who obviously hated his life. He greeted me with a very rude, \"WHY ARE YOU PARKED HERE?\" I explained the circumstance while the below negative temperatures creeped to the backseat where my sick children were sleeping but now stirring. \"WELL YOU CAN'T PARK HERE EVER AGAIN!!!\" He replied in a beyond unprofessional tone. He then walked away to harass the car behind me in the same manner. My 3 year old, now completely awake, asked me, \"Was that a bad stranger Mommy?\" \nAs soon as my husband got back (literally 30 seconds later) he knew exactly who I was talking about.

I am new to Madison and everyone can't stop talking about what an experience it is to shop here. It's the fine-dining of grocery shopping. Well, I have only been shopping like a grown up for about a year now - but I learned how to do it in Denver. So the bar was set pretty high through Whole Foods and Safeway. But I can safely say that my experience at Metcalfe's topped it.\n\nIt was very clean and well stocked. I believe I went on a Friday night too. The main goal was to get some fresh meat and milk; let's face it - those are two items you don't want to get from an Aldi's or a Woodman's. I was told by a friend that I was lucky to live so close to it, but to be careful because it was expensive. WRONG, not expensive (or maybe Denver was expensive, so that word has become relative).\n\nSafeway had a discount meat section because it was within a few days of expiring (cook it that night and you're fine). Now, I wasn't looking for that at Metcalfe's (I don't know if they'd have that even), but I found $2 Pork Butt Steak (which, the mere name of the steak made me question it - but for $2 I'll try anything once). Delicious, and I won't go as far as to say I'm a great cook.\n\nOf course I also got some stuffed pork chops and fresh produce. But the experience I had was very pleasant and the prices were fair for the quality of food I was buying (dare I say, I thought prices should be higher).\n\nAs for the atmosphere, I don't think I've gone to a store in a long time that played classical music. I almost feel like if I came in sweatpants and a t-shirt that I would be under-dressed to get groceries.\n\nWhole Foods ain't got nothing on Metcalfe's (leave my double negative alone).", "business_id": "OxR3b_qcMJlzwzGPU5fmdA", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-12-15", "type": "review"}

My dad sells higher end furniture back in Ohio so I can be a little picky and snooty when it comes to furniture and it's quality. Just like how I am with wine. Ok that was totally uneccessary. No wine in the review. We didn't need wine after a trip to Don's because the powner was extremely helpful. He showed us a few options that he had on the floor then took almost a half hour to sketch out a customized credenza that his Amish builders can make for us. The process was not overwhelming at all. J searched through a digital portfolio of samples while I searched through a binder of selcted styles. The owner actually helped guide us through the process as well. So you basically are working with a designer should you choose to have Don's build your furniture for you. Ok, so J and I got some sketches and have been talking about the credneza we would like built. The only reason we haven't purchased one yet is because the room is getting remodeled. Will take a pic when finalized.

Here's a hint to the owners - you can't taste wine when you're smoking a cigar.  cognac, sure... bourbon For Sure... scotch, hell yeah!  Wine or beer?  No way.  Much like how a heavy smoker can't taste the subtle notes of fine cuisine, your palate will be a burned out blah, able only to recognize the meh of mediocre sweet washing away a quickly become stale, acrid ash.  I say this strongly to the owners, who are obviously ordering wine they cannot taste, because the offering here is terrible.  \n\nNow, for the record, I enjoy a good cigar (and they do have good cigars, (as well as really shitty ones - you have been warned)), but you've got to be very careful when you mix the two.  or, you'll end up with a place like this.  \n\nHere's the deal:\n\nAmbience: smoke filled; couches to the far wall, filled with people I don't know, who obviously do know one another; everyone watching badgers basketball game; shitty pop-ish music, feels like I'm crashing a college party.\n\nService: terrible - overly helpful, yet completely unhelpful.  Owner assumes that you don't know anything about wine, while he himself knows nothing about wine, making him look both condescending and foolish.  Owner confuses percentages of grape varietals for flavor, erroneously assuming that those factors alone, in isolation, make the wine.  Owner doesn't know enough about own stock to be able to recommend me a wine to match what I'm looking for.  Not, being able to find what I want, the owner then upsells me garbage, like a used car salesman, promising me it's the best such-and-such wine he's ever seen for this price.  Meanwhile, he's never once described what any of the wines actually taste like.  \n\nAt any rate, I took a risk and bought the recommendation - guess it must be the gambler in me.  Well, sometimes you win, and sometimes you loose... and this time, I lost.  The two wines that were supposed to be vastly different were suspiciously similar.  Both just a middle note of blah, one too sweet, one too thin.  Neither worthy of the price, the effort, the carbon footprint.  I've MADE better wine.  In the end, they were shitty wines, and it a shitty experience.  Which is too bad, because I was really looking for something nice.  \n\nIn all honesty, Copps, just down the street, actually has better wines, if you know what you're looking for.  Even if you don't, they have a larger selection, so you might as well roll the dice.  \n\nSo, my question to the owners is, did you get this wine because you thought it was good, because you couldn't taste it, or because it was cheap and you thought no one would care?  \n\nPS dry clean my cigar smoke soaked coat", "business_id": "6Y_Y3Nzzf9FsjyXtjIll7w", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-02-24", "type": "review"}

And my first winter here was mild. Last year, however, was rough stuff. I remember being told to stay indoors and was warned not to go outside without my face covered by several reputable weather peeps. It was brisk... rull brisk. \n\nSo this year I decided I was going to do winter right! And for me that meant paying a premium for a base layer (top and bottom) that I plan to live in until May. There are several websites that offer an insane amount of information comparing and contrasting fiber counts and materials and weight and oder retention, and then there's Rutabaga. Where owner Darren has his equipped team of outdoorsmen and outdoors-women are prepared to answer pretty much any question about any product they carry. And what's more, they've all been there... in the great outdoors. \n\nThe gent going back and forth with me today talked up the IceBreaker Merino Wool tight and crew, explaining that to him, nothing feels better. (And he wears the stuff on the daily.) He also led me to another option, super.natural, which comes in at a lower price-point but doesn't have the fab feel of the more expensive option. He also mentioned that super.natural tends to fit a bit closer to the body. At this point it was time to try things on. And even though they have a generous return policy, I wanted to leave with something I knew I'd love. \n\nSo I'm in the fitting room with both brands' top and bottom and just as described, the IceBreaker felt great but the super.natural fit great. And at the end of the day, knowing I wanted to take home two sets, I went with the super.natural for fit and price, and picked up a pair of socks to complete my ensemble. They carry Smart Wool in every solid, pattern, stripe and polka dot, and an interesting brand made in the US called FITS, which has a cool heel lock that's supposed to keep the sock in place. I thought I was going to walk out of there with some Smart Wool as friends talk it up like it's gold for your feet, but after hearing about the quality going downhill since inception, FITS is what I was feeling.\n\nI can't remember the last time I spent so much on underwear. I'm going to say never. But it'll be worth the money when later this month everyone else feels like a popsicle and I'm warm but not toast, breathable and not damp. \n\nRutabaga also has a stellar selection of snow shoes, and I'm eying a pair from a company based in Denver that uses 95% recycled material to make a Cadillac-like kick.

Jon's is a pipe shop first and foremost, they just happen to carry cigars too.\n\nThey have a huge selection of pipes, and most are priced fairly.  They have a nice selection of bulk/house blend pipe tobaccos and a respectable offering of tinned pipe tobaccos.  Plenty of accessories to round out your shopping experience.  The store is a little small/cramped, but that's a given considering their proximity to campus.  I never felt uncomfortable in the store -- it just adds to the charm.\n\nIf you're a college kid looking for RYO tobacco and supplies, yes, Jon's stocks those items as well.  This is no head shop, so don't waste your time looking for pipes made from materials other than briar or meerschaum.\n\nI dropped a good amount of dough here considering it was my first visit.  I found a pipe I just had to have, a couple bulk blends that caught my attention, and some tins that appeared to have some age on them (a good thing).  After I left the store, I met up with the owner and other regulars at a local bar that has a covered/heated patio area and bought two more cigars at that event (it's a weekly or monthly thing they do).\n\nOverall, it's a great shop with an outstanding pipe selection, a very good pipe tobacco selection, and a good cigar selection.

I give this place one star because the doctor who performed the exam (a young female) was very knowledgeable and thorough.  The rest of my experience of buying the glasses was completely downhill and I would give no star for what I went through.\n\nTheir frames selection is very limited in terms of economic pricing.  Most of the frames were name brand super expensive.  As a student, I could care less about the brand and more about saving money.  I looked at a bunch of different frames, from the cheaper ones to brand names.  The lady helping me pick out frames seemed to keep pushing the Kate Spades ones on me and saying how much better they looked on me than all of the other ones.  So I ended up getting them even though they were $100 more expensive than the no-brand ones that I also liked.  \n\nIn terms of the lenses, I expressed to her that I wanted to wear these glasses for a long time because the frames were so expensive and because I have a strong prescription, I was willing to pay more for thin, light lenses.  She charged me an extra $50 for that.  After I received my glasses, I didn't feel like they were any thinner than my previous pair and took them to another store.  After just looking at them, the guy at the store told me that there were thinner and lighter options.  I felt completely lied to and robbed.\n\nFinally, to rub salt into the wound, when I received my glasses, they lady did not spend any time adjusting then on my face.  Pretty much handed them to me and told me to come back if I needed adjustments.  It turns out that they were way too tight on me and gave me a headache and left marks on the sides of my face.  So I go back to get it adjusted.  My frames were blue-colored metal and I saw her take pliers and yank at them.  After I left, I noticed that there were scratch marks on the metal!  I could not believe that they would treat my brand new name brand glasses like that.  The glasses still didn't fit right but I was too afraid to go back again.  I went to another store and they adjusted my glasses by warming them up.  Did Illini Eye not have the capabilities to do that??\n\nI felt like they just wanted my money and after I paid, they completely ignored me and my needs.  Overall, I feel like I overpaid for these name brand glasses with lenses that are still too heavy and thick.  I've been wearing the glasses for 7 months now and they are uncomfortable and heavy on my face.  This experience has been so horrendous and I hate my glasses so much that I am seriously considering lasik surgery so that I never have to wear glasses again or have to deal with the hassle of getting cheated on a pair of glasses in the future.", "business_id": "xwteMLHEtxdTGHASpXQcfg", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-02-23", "type": "review"}

It didn't seem like much fun to do one without the other.\n\nThen, on a Wednesday afternoon, I decided it wouldn't hurt to check with the jewelry store across the street from my office, Renaissance Fine Jewelry.

That was music to my ears; I would have it for the weekend!!!\n\nHow could he do this so quickly when the other places wanted to keep my ring for 5-6 days?  I'll tell you why.

Being directly off the freeway also means they can often be faster to get to than other camera stores.\n\nPrices are competitive and the staff is very knowledgeable, friendly, and patient. Whether you're a first-time buyer or a seasoned professional, they can answer your questions and get you what you need. They're also very cognizant of wait times, with staff dropping what they're doing to get you helped or checked out.\n\nThe rentals desk is well-inventoried and the rentals staff are friendly, making it easy to get what you need, often even on short notice. Low equipment deposits also make it easier to get what you need, as you're  required to front only 33%, rather than 50% or even 100% of the replacement cost.\n\nIf you need a camera bag, Photomark has the best selection I'm aware of in the Phoenix area. All the major manufacturers are represented, and there are far more models available than at other camera stores.\n\nThere are a couple things that tend to scare new customers off unnecessarily. First, it's in an older (not \"bad\") part of town, which tends to freak out suburbanites used to newer construction, fewer minorities and homeless (and homeless minorities), and more standard traffic flow. I've never had a problem, nor has anyone I know. You should lock your car, but you don't need to brandish a Taser or wear Kevlar.\n\nSecond, the parking lot is small. Especially if you don't realize Photomark owns the entire center, it seems like there's far too little parking--but they own all three businesses and you're free to park anywhere in the plaza. Still, it's best to avoid going around midday, as it can be difficult to park during the lunch hour rush. It may also be ideal to take a smaller vehicle if you're not intimately comfortable with where your sides and rear and are.\n\nThe biggest downside to shopping at Photomark is that unlike Tempe Camera, they don't break down pro packs of film--if they don't stock or the manufacturers don't make a given film in single-roll packages, you're stuck buying an entire pro pack.", "business_id": "GiElN3AF8N4ZpfH6PNRjdg", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-12-31", "type": "review"}

Uptight religious types are nowhere to be found in this free spirited atmosphere, and that deserves a couple of stars alone. This is the third Exotic Art Show I have attended, and I have to be honest in saying 2008's was my least favorite. The cold may certainly have dampened the vibe (where were the portable heaters?), or maybe the acts were less to my personal liking. Miss Satanica, an eater of fire and glass, was great (and quite the trooper for continuing her show in spite of an injured ankle), but her weird lame sidekick did nothing for her. Of the Earth musicians had talent, but also oozed pretention and sounded like Rusted Root. Even the Ringmaster, Nick Tarr, was funnier last year. Some of the dancers were amazing, especially Fatima from Spell, and Jen from Of the Earth. I wished they had been on far longer. \n\nThe pieces in the art exhibit itself always vary wildly, from tame and classically beautiful, to the uber-graphic, violent, or decidedly non-vanilla fetish.  My personal favorites this year were Christian Correra (amazing frames as well as photography) and Sarah Clemens (whose gorgeous \"Breezy\" graced the cover of the program, and whom I luckily got to meet). \n\nIf you've never been, plan ahead for the Halloween party. It is a lot of fun in my experience, and is their other wild-side party of the year. Be forewarned, you cannot bring in alcohol (they have security who will check your bags), and you need cash to buy tickets at the door as well as drinks inside. Just beyond the back porch you will find a table where you can purchase tickets for alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. If you have a body bubble, you'll probably be uncomfortable, because these events are always super crowded and you have to  be one of the first in line if you want even a chance at a seat.", "business_id": "F3L3UuWJUez6ybJr4y5Agw", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-02-10", "type": "review"}

I knew of a place right down the street from me and to my disappointment it was closed! WTF! Any way I went searching for a cafe. I wanted to sit down and read the new times with a cup of coffee. I actually started my journey thinking I would stop at the drip. But when i got there that place just seemed to modern for me. I was in a funky mood and just wanted a nice cup of coffee, nothing fancy. So I saw an older man waving a sign that said \"Best lunch in town!\" and he was kind of dancing too! And I said to myself \"Yes, i think I will\". So I stumbled upon MacAlpines. They had just opened and I sat right down at the counter. I had two cups of yummy diner coffee and after realizing I was hungry too, I ordered a stuffed tomato that was oh so yummy with super fresh veggies. The decor was adorable and welcoming and I loved the juke box. 25 cents gets you two plays! anyway, I'm not giving it four stars because it took some time for the staff to warm up and be friendly. I don't know if it was just because they had just opened or if it was because I was still sleeping and needed a caffeine fix badly.

We had to say good bye to family at the airport, and so wanted a decadent distraction to followup the sadness.  Fancy phosphates and floats served us nicely!\nYou know how classic diners and decor are trendy now, and places are trying to make their restaurants look like they came through a time machine?  Well, this place is the real deal--an authentic 1920's soda shop, now surrounded by a vintage shop (it used to be a drug store).  The place is just wonderful to walk into.  \nOur waitress was unbelievably friendly.  You could tell that the 50's look for her was not just an act--it was her life.  Not only was she friendly, but fast as well.  From the menu, I tried a kiwi phosphate, a tiger's blood (cherry/coconut) Italian soda, tuna sandwich on sourdough, Navy bean soup, and a float to top it off.  All was delicious.  The tuna was not flooded in mayo and was the fattest tuna sandwich I've ever had.  The cole slaw on the side was also a bit dry (little mayo), which to me, is a wonderful thing.  A little pineapple acted to enhance the flavor further.  I am persnickety about slaw, but this I liked.  The drinks were deliciously fizzy.  For desert, we ordered the pumpkin cheesecake bunt cake.  Moments later, the waitress came back to tell us that sadly, she did not have a piece big enough to sell to us, but that there was a small piece left that she could simply give to us for free.  We agreed and added a float for good measure.  The float was pistachio ice cream and amaretto soda.  Unbelievable!  Hands down the best float I've ever had.  And I love that the spoons come in a shot glass of even more soda.  That way, when you eat some of the ice cream, you can add more soda.  Brilliant!  Oh, and the free piece of bunt cake?  It turned out to be the size of a normal piece of cake, but for free.  And it too was delicious.\nThe stores that flank the restaurant served as a good distraction while walking off a few of the hundreds and hundreds of calories consumed.  \nThe only real problem was coming down from the sugar high about halfway between Phoenix and Tucson.  \nI will be back.  And next time, I'm going to be crazy and try the \"dill pickle\" phosphate.", "business_id": "R6aazv8FB-6BeanY3ag8kw", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-12-20", "type": "review"}

While Costco's lot design is terrible, the standard corner entryway they employ works well here. Wrapping the parking lot around a corner of the building effectively extends the parking to two sides of the building rather than one. This creates more spaces near the entry/exit. In August when I have purchased perishables, I am appreciative of this.\n\nMy various customer service dealings over the past few years have all been positive experiences that left me feeling good about my loyalty to Costco and the Kirkland brand. Associates quickly handle returns without hassle, I am usually able to find an associate on the floor if I have a question, and it appears this particular location employs individuals on the long-term as familiar faces regularly greet me.\n\nWhere quality is concerned, I shop with confidence at Costco.

Since I'm single and live alone I tend to drift a lot more towards things such as cleaning items and toiletries as well as other items I frequently use such as batteries, spinach or non-perishables like pasta.  Frozen items are great as well and I gravitate toward the fruit to make smoothies.  Their return policy is unparalleled and their book section is nice.  I love indulging in a cookbook every once in a while when I go in!\n\nThis location does have a pharmacy, food court, optical department, and tire service center but I have yet to utilize those services.

More than any other person in the cigar shop business, he has impacted my tastes. There is not another person I am familiar with who will take the time to walk you through that what's, where's and why's of cigars. His pricing is excellent and Mr. Lee personifies the reason why one will become a regular client: He cares and let's you know it. Answering some of the reviews below... The humidor IS cramped, but that is simply because he carries such a great range of products. And, yes, he and his staff don't want the shopper to manhandle the merchandise. If we were to look at who has written about not being able to \"touch\" the cigars, 9 out of 10 of them are the reason why that happens. Cigars are like works of art. The more hands that touch them, the more likely it is that a wrapper will become damaged, that the foot will split, etc. And to answer Mike's review: I have spent many, many hours in this shop. I have seen numerous newbies come in to buy a cigar. And I have NEVER, EVER heard a response like what you have documented come out of any of the staffers at Don's. I find it very interesting that you then hawk a quick ad for Cigar Warehouse down the street. Comparing Cigar Warehouse to Don's is like comparing a fast food hamburger to a Ruth's Chris steak. Both beef, or a Kia to an Aston Martin. If you are reading this and are looking for a cigar shop that represents the best in the business, go in to Don's, ask for Mr. Lee, tell him Charlie Knox sent you... and see what your experience is... Finally, as an addendum, David's review hawks other shops, also. This is classic Yelpian BS. Completely unsubstantiated trollish statements that on their very face are almost impossible to believe. WHO would ever cap a cash purchase at $10? No one, obviously. I know people (and I am one of them) who will travel MILES across the Valley to patronize Don's. Even if I am at a competitors shop (and that happens occasionally), Young Lee's name is spoken of with respect and honor. End of story: Go to Don's. Have a great experience.

We were enroute to her place to pick up her bike and head downtown to ride around, so we stopped back by Slippery Pig after we had her bike on her carrier.  The guy asked us to leave the bike for about 30 minutes, so we went over to Lux and had a hot beverage while we waited.  Less than 30 minutes later, we headed back.  He'd secured her bike with the part her old basket was missing.  She'd asked him about touch-up paint for her bike, because it had fallen off the rack when she first got it.  He'd found her the touch-up paint for her metallic green finish, rubbed out some deep scuffs with solvent, tightened her kickstand, and put air in her tire.  The part she bought cost about $16.\n\nI bought my Electra at another shop in town, but based on the friendly, more-than-expected service at the Slippery Pig, I think I'll bring my bike here for parts and service in the future.

I also met Eric the owner and he's always been easy to talk to and always had an open ear to some of my questions on bike equipment. \n\nI finally decided to pick up my first 29er hardtail and decided to go with the Scott Scale Expert.

Yes, same day!  \n\nI also wanted to change out the pedals to crank brothers but unfortunately they didn't have them in stock.  Eric just let me borrow some demo pedals while my new pedals came in so that I could enjoy my ride the next day.

Miranda was seriously a miracle worker.  I showed her a picture of a style I liked, and she was able to modify the style to fit my hair texture and lifestyle.  I also had highlights that had turned brassy, and she brought them to life.  Further, I have thick hair, and it normally takes three hours to give me a highlight/cut/style.  Miranda finished in about two hours!  \n\nThe best part was that I ended spending less than what I had been spending at Salon Estique.  $135 for a highlight, cut, toner, and style.

I was promptly greeted by a very friendly receptionist. No snooty attitudes here!\n\nMy stylist was Miranda and she was great! She was very easy to talk with & most importantly listened to what I wanted . Nothing worse than telling a stylist you want a trim and end up with 3 inches less hair! We worked together to pick out a great color and she gave my long lifeless hair some much needed style (without taking off much length, just what I asked for!). Also, they use Aveda products which smell great and feel incredibly natural in your hair.\n\nThe only downside is that it is a bit pricey. Not out of this world expensive, but a little more than I've spent in the past. The cost is worth it for me as I only get my hair done  every 3 months or so. Plus, the peace of mind of knowing you are in good hands is hard to put a dollar amount on.\n\nI look forward to going back in a few months.

The store is a very intimate, cozy feeling shop, with flowers everywhere (of course) and lovely Christmas decorations ('twas the season).  After explaining what I was trying to do, the lady behind the counter sat us down at a table with several wedding flower books, flower flash cards (so they seemed) and a stack of post-its.  After we mulled over the options for a while and I narrowly avoided a few hysterical moments by the array of decisions I had to make, she came back over to see how we were doing.  We chatted for a while about the benefits of various flowers, the availability in April, prices, colors, etc.  By the time we were done talking I finally felt confident about what I wanted to do!  I'm sure I will call upon Community Florist when I'm ready to place my order- they will hold my flowers trimmed and in a bucket in their cooler until I'm ready to pick them up, and can even keep finished centerpieces cool if I need to hold them in the meantime.   \n\nIf I wasn't taking on the feat of doing all the flowers myself, I'd trust the project to this shop too, based on what I saw while I was there and the knowledge I gleaned just from one conversation.\n\nIt was definitely a positive experience, which I needed!", "business_id": "imSAkSzL5X1rUc3Z1ZMYeA", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-12-30", "type": "review"}

Follow the shelves with your eyes slooooowwwwwly up to the ceiling, hoping that your item will not ascend hastily through the ceiling to escape you. If that fails, shut your eyes, think hard about what you want, then try again. There's a better than average chance that it will appear.\n\nThere's also all sorts of jewelry and tiny bits of things.

Went yesterday, in a rush to pick up a small bear as a gift for a friend's young daughter who was down the road at the Phoenix Children's Hospital. I expected it to be a little busy. It wasn't particularly busy, maybe about ten people all up. Fortunately, I found what I wanted quickly. First problem, there were apparently two \"locations\" in the store for checkouts, and one of them was very cramped up against the merchandise (enough for no more than two people to stand one behind the other). Not particularly good feng shui. I went to the other, which only had a couple of people in line. A lady looked at me curiously from behind the counter (I hadn't even reached the front, the person in front of me was still being served by someone else) and then took my stuffed bear. She looked at the tag, futzed around for about ten seconds, then leaned back and handed it to me and said \"I'm just going to give this back to you...\" Then she walked to the far rear area behind the counter and proceeded to ignore me. Talked to someone. Got a sheaf of papers. Walked around. Put down papers. Talked to someone else. I stood there, still in line, and watched her walk around. Then when she asked someone else in the store area if they needed help I realised that she had dropped me. I stopped her and asked her if there was anything that she needed from me and she just told me to wait in line and someone else would attend to me. Fair enough. Then another person leaned out and took my bear (again, bear in mind that I was still \"waiting\" for the others in front to be done) and laid it on the counter \"ready\" to be checked out. I waited. Then one person consulted with the other, both with relatively confused looks. I had no idea what was going on. It seemed like none of them had ever worked there before! One person actually offered to take off the tag (with price along with other instructions) then talked to the other to ask if they needed the tag. Turns out that their credit card system was down - figures - and I was asked to sign a printout despite choosing to pay as debit. They then advised me to check and call if there were any problems, which I took to mean that I could be doublecharged or something. Finally, at least twenty-five minutes later I was out of there.

From the minute you walk in the door, you are made to feel comfortable and welcome. I'm 34 now, and have been wearing glasses since I was 9. I've been through my share of eye doctors, and there are some doozies out there. When you're that up-close and personal with a doctor (they're inches from your face during the exam), you need to feel comfortable. I have never felt anything BUT comfortable with this place.\n\nI always see Dr. Frank and really enjoy not only his professionalism but just the small-talk (some people can be so uncomfortable and uneasy to talk with, but not Dr. Frank). The last time I went to see the crew, my insurance was about to expire and I needed to get in ASAP; they fit me with Dr. Ben, and again I have nothing but good to say. From the minute you walk in the door to the minute you leave, you feel welcome and valued.\n\nI typically get very ill (headaches, nausea, and vomiting) from being dilated, and they are very compassionate towards me. Previously, they would use a diluted mydriatic. But now, they offer the option of a special camera that sees the majority of the retina without having to dilate you (well worth the extra money!). This has saved me 2 days in bed with the blinds pulled and the blankets over my head.\n\nI am NOT a guy who likes to shop. So when having to pick out glasses, it can be very trying. The opticians at the office basically ask you what you're looking for, and they bring a few pair of frames over that suit your tastes and complement appearance. Usually, they bring four pair over that are a perfect match, and I then have the difficult decision of choosing one. But they really do take the pain out the decision-making process and make the entire visit, dare I say it, enjoyable.\n\nAll-in-all, I can't tell you how highly I recommend this group.

My mother-in-law decided to bring all of our flowers back from Hawaii, so we figured we'd get them preserved. I called around and Floral Keepsakes was the only place I could find that did flower preservation. I called, and spoke with Lisa. She seemed very nice and even offered to wait after closing for me to take the flowers as soon as possible.\nWe took the flowers in, and she immediately said it was going to be a $200 deposit. My husband and I were shocked, as we were not expecting such a large deposit (which was never mentioned on the phone). She proceeded to explain that the deposit could go towards the arrangement. Where typically each flower ranges from $10 and up (I don't remember the exact number but you get the idea) to be preserved. We thought it was fair, so they could start doing the preserving. So we paid the $200. At this point, having not known any better, I assumed the deposit would cover the cost of the flowers.\n\nOne month later we went in for an appointment where we would choose the shadow box we wanted our arrangement to go in. We searched the store high and low, and we felt everything was extremely overpriced.  \n\nNow that the box was chosen, we discussed what flowers would be used. She charged a flat fee of $250 to re-create the bouquet. There was a separate charge for the leis, the boutonniere, etc.  Did I mention a design fee? Well we were charged that too on top of everything else. When everything was said and done, the total was somewhere in the neighborhood of $700. We decided to take all the extra's off and just do the bouquet and have our leis laying in the bottom because of the outrageous price! No Frills. We walked out paying nearly $650. \n\nUpdate: \nLisa contacted me directly to discuss our experience. Although we appreciate her reaching out, the main purpose of this review was not to bash her business. I just wanted people to be aware that getting your flowers preserved can be pricey, as I would have wanted to know that before I did it.\n\nI do want to give anyone doing this some advice- Budget for this, and if you don't like the display cases in the store, they allow you to bring your own (we were not aware of this). Bringing our own case could have saved us a few hundred dollars!", "business_id": "Rryjtan7HSL2Ux8FJ16qMA", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-02-03", "type": "review"}

Since it's such a big store, I figured I should at least look here.  So, I made an appointment for last Saturday to check it out.  It was stop #5 of 5 of the dress shopping tour with mom and mom-in-law-to-be.\n\nWe walked in and immediately felt like we were in a Costco type of warehouse.  The girls were communicating over their little walkie talkie type things.  I filled out some paperwork and was told that someone would be right with us.  \n\n\"Can I start looking around a bit while I wait?\" I asked.\n\n\"Nope - You need a sales associate to walk the floor with you,\" I was told.\n\nOK then...\n\n10 minutes later, Vicki came over and introduced herself.  She was friendly enough but lacked the confidence and experience I'd seen at some of the other stores.  Since I'd done some research on the lines that the store carried, I shared those with her and unfortunately, she didn't think they had any of the ones I'd written down in stock.  Actually, she wasn't familiar with any of them, and when we started walking the floor and choosing dresses to try on, she was not so knowledgeable either... furthermore, I felt a bit rushed - not the ideal bridal shopping experience at all.\n\nMy mom asked Vicki how many dresses were in the store, and she said more than 2200 - talk about selection!  I found a few dresses that I liked, but none of them were \"the one.\"  And had I found \"the one\" at I Do I Do, I'm not sure how confident I would've felt doing business at this store - I did not get the feeling that they are very customer service oriented...\n\nSo, if you are looking for a bridal gown, this is a decent place to check out, and the dresses I did like were all reasonably priced. (All of the dresses I chose were under $700.) But in recapping I Do I Do with the moms afterwards, we compared I Do I Do to Target, not a higher end boutique like where I finally found \"the one.\"", "business_id": "oQq14GDCo2lb9E0NB2LRhw", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-02-01", "type": "review"}

I gotta say I am surprised at the reviews when I read them.\n\nI went to I Do I Do (first stop in my wedding dress shopping).  Heather was my consultant.  She was amazing.  She didn't mind that I tried on dresses that I knew I probably wouldn't like, but had to try them on anyhow \"just to make sure\"  She said that is a good idea because what you think you don't like, you may be surprised.  \n\nSo I tried on this dress \"I didn't like\"  (i told her to pick something if I came in here and had no idea what i wanted, I totally was like, 'no effin way') And now its a very top contender!   I LOVE this dress, its like she knew me, or at least what would look good on my body type. I haven't made a decision yet as I am beginning VERY early looking for a dress because I do not want to be stressed out as I'm trying to do everything else.  There is one dress that is my \"DREAM\" dress and Heather said they ordered it and should have it within a couple of months.  (which is good since I am having major surgery and will need recovery time, another reason I am doing so many things now).\n\nHeather knew I wasn't going to purchase that day, I told her flat out, but I feel she didn't treat me any differently than if I had a million dollars to spend.  \n\nMy only complaint is that they do not allow pictures.  Right now I am trying to decide between 4 dresses... one is one from I do I do.   But I have no pictures of me in the dress to compare it to the other 3 (davids bridal and group usa)  \n\nOther than that I had a great experience.  I do not know who your consultants were.  I just say request Heather.  She was bubbly and upbeat.  She somehow made a size 16 dress fit on my body in a way that I could tell what it looked like.  I have a tattoo I want to cover during the ceremony and was concerned about it, she took the time to explain that we can add straps and showed me the different kinds of straps. it was just nice.\n\n(no i do NOT know her, I am not a friend of hers, and have no affiliation with her outside of this experience, I got her card and that is how I remembered her name)  I plan on going back to try on my dream dress and others, she told me that it would be okay a lot of people take a while to decide:)   I still don't even know if I will buy a dress from there or not, but we will see...\n\nAnyhow...  I am sorry you all had the experiences you did (like I had with Azteca Bridal Plaza, seriously do NOT go there, you can get better service at Goodwill)  \n\nRonney", "business_id": "oQq14GDCo2lb9E0NB2LRhw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-02-08", "type": "review"}

They have a little of everything and a lot of everything.  I say that because I am of the opinion that the more you know about what you are doing, the more you will find.

These are garments that just are not made anymore. I don't sew but my Mother did or I would be pretty much lost when I go in.  I have no shame so I am likely to ask for help from anyone in the store-employee or customers. The attitude is such that most of the people shopping there are really nice.

The employees are another story,    Some really are more helpful than others depending on what you are trying to do.  I think that is partly because they are always so busy. I've never seen the SAS store slow.  So, don't let one put you off, eventually, you'll find another who will help you especially if you are desperate like me.\n\nThe prices here really are great which is why it is worth it to go in and dig.

Knits aren't sold in large quantities like most of the other fabric they have-they are mostly just small-ish pieces that almost all have holes or stains. You have to check the fabric yourself, because they won't do it for you when you go to have it measured. \n\nI'd say on average, most knits are between 1/2 yard to 3 yards in length that are in the pile of fabrics. The exception is the bins next to the knit piles, which typically have much smaller pieces of material and are usually irregularly shaped. I have found some great, super soft knits in these piles-think fabric that is used by James Perse, Ella Moss, Splendid...that's what these feel like. It requires a lot of digging to find usable amounts of material in the piles that are also hole- and stain-free, but it's worth it! Knits are only $1.99 a yard here, which is a phenomenal deal.\n\nThey sell other fabrics that would be used for costumes, tons of sparkly fabrics, plus fleece, upholstery fabrics (though they don't sell upholstery thread), and a bunch of threads in different levels of quality/quantity. They do sell needles but they are behind the register, and you order them by telling them which number you want from the \"menu\" of smallish items. \n\nBEFORE YOU PAY AT THE REGISTER, you MUST have your fabric measured at one of the cutting stations-even if you don't plan to have the material cut! They measure it to figure out how much you are getting, then they make you a receipt and hold your material behind the register. When you are ready to pay, simply walk up with your receipt to the register and they'll calculate the total from your receipt and bring you your bag of fabric. They take most credit cards so I don't need to have cash here (it seems like the type of place where it would be cash-only, but thankfully it is not).\n\nCome here if you are prepared to spend time and effort finding the best and cheapest material around without all the glitz and glamour of a regular (i.e. chain) fabric store!", "business_id": "nbO0X6SNrZWOoDQS3WQCPw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-12-08", "type": "review"}

After reading the other reviews I wasn't sure exactly what to expect as no fabric store that I've patronized previously had as much as the reviews said this place would.  \nI have driven past this place for years and never noticed what it was, I always thought it was a costume shop.  Walking into this store I'm sure my face was priceless as I am also sure that upon first entry my jaw hit the floor. There was so much fabric everywhere. Not just your usual small bolts but giant rolls as tall as I am in most cases. I found not only the satin I was looking for but also many other fabrics that would also work that I never thought of before.  In addition the vast selection the prices were amazing.  So many deals on bulk fabric, definitely a sewers dream.  \nThe only caution I have for this place is that I needed three pieces of the fabric but I wasn't made aware that they only do one cut per person per fabric. Luckily the lady helping me understood my confusion at not being told this before hand and was willing to cut all three pieces for me.  I do wish that their thread selection was larger. Even though they have industrial size spools they mostly have primary colors. I had a difficult time matching the thread and fabric.

I've been shopping at BE since i was a kid in the 70's and after yesterday, I'm done.  I went in on Saturday and spent a couple hours, purchasing over $200 of clothes. Turns out one of the shirts I bought had 2 huge holes down the middle of the back, unsewable and totally unwearable.  I went back Sunday to see if I could return it for store credit and to trade in several bags of my old clothing.  Long story short; one of the managers gave me a really hard time about returning the shirt, as it had been half off, and she treated me like a total jerk for asking her to work with me, and acted like she was doing me the biggest favor in the world by accepting the return.  She was pretty snotty and rude.  THEN, when it was my turn to trade, a nice guy began helping me, and had accepted a couple of my things, and things seemed fine.  Said manager showed up, elbowed the guy out of the way, and began going through my items herself.  She purchased ONE item out of several large bags and sent me on my way.  It was an incredible blatant FU to me for \"forcing her hand\" when it came to my return.  What grade are we in again?  I am still amazed that this even happened.  What a great manager!

It's the only source of craft supplies that's handy while running errands in central Phoenix, and it's near one of the movie theaters that serves real food, so I shop here occasionally, and I always leave crabby.\n\nEvery section is tiny and understocked. If something at another Michaels catches your eye, but you postpone buying it, and you figure, oh, you'll pick it up at this one because you're here... no, you won't. Wood trim, wood embellishments, specific acrylic paint colors, specific scrapbook paper designs, the edgiest floral items... forget it. This Michaels will not carry that.

It's so small that it's impossible for two carts to pass in most aisles. \n\nThe major reason to set foot in this store is that you're desperate for tacky glue and can't face the chaos of Walmart. It has so far not found an excuse to stop carrying tacky glue. \n\nThere was also a moment of hope when the chain introduced Martha Stewart acrylic paints, which are at least interesting colors. But I'd really like to know whose bright idea it was that, chain-wide, acrylic paints should now be displayed entirely below knee level. Let me give you a hint, gentlemen: the tiny bottles of exotic colors are not bought by children. Nor is there a gigantic acrylic-painting movement among Munchkins. Your acrylic paint buyers are adults, which means we're mostly over 5 feet tall, and depending how the day went and how high of heels we're wearing, our urge to indulge in a series of deep knee bends can vary.

As a teen, it was a place to pick up something small here and there (cards, lamp, frames), and dream about what \"my house\" would look like.  In the early 20's, I was still just getting little things (posters, candles, linens) because I had no money, but I would have fantastic dreams about what I would do - one day.  Moving into the later 20's, this became my go-to place for creating upscale Christmas baskets. (My favorite was an Italian night basket with the pasta, pasta sauce, bread sticks, Italian cake, chocolates, a few bottles of wine and wine glasses - and something special like a CD or special espresso beans.  A classic given and appreciated SEVERAL times.) Now in my (sigh) 30's I've completely resigned myself to the idea that I will NEVER get anything but little things here.  And I'm totally ok with that.  Cost plus is my favorite place for Christmas.  I do stockings for my whole family and I can find things that work for everyone(Ornaments, Chocolate coins) and things that show I was really thinking of them (This year's had a theme - everyone got drinks but that ranged from Thai Chai to Japanese Saki).\n\nMy new favorite thing about Cost Plus is their jewelry section.  It's made huge leaps forward in the last 5-6 years.  Almost all of it is very \"today\" with prices that look very yesteryear.  I found beautiful handmade beaded dangling earrings for $5.  An amazing matching necklace was $15.  These both could have gone for 2-3 times this amount and been absolutely worth the price.  Let's home they don't realize that any time soon....\n\nWhile agreeing with a previous post about the cost of the furniture, I'd say it's most likely worth the cost as those expensive pieces have always seemed quite solid.  But then again - I don't go for the furniture. The things I love, which is a good chunk of the store, can each fit in a hand basket.\n\nIf you haven't been to Cost Plus before, give yourself some time and walk down each aisle.  It can be amazing the things you find hidden in the shelves that you might have missed if you just scanned down from the end.

Obviously, leading one to think that all the pillows in that display were part of the sale.  So I picked out two, went to check out, and they rang up full price.  I informed the girl at the register that they were marked half-off...she was nice enough, but she wouldn't honor the mistake - most other stores will.  \n\nFine, not a huge deal, but then some guy off the floor comes over, and very rudely snaps at me, \"No, you're wrong, those ones weren't marked.

He's SO sure that he's right that he asks me to waste my time to follow him back to the display, so he can show me himself and prove that I'm wrong.  So I humor him, walk back, and show him the large, red clearance sign directly above the pillows I had wanted to purchase.  By now, if I were in his shoes, I'd be feeling like a real piece of work.  But no, not this guy.  Not only did he NEVER apologize, but he would not admit that he was at fault.  Instead, all I got was a half-assed mumble, \"Well, it's wrong...\"\n\nIrritated by now, I decided to not purchase the pillows and started to walk away.  As soon as I turned away from him, the guy calls over another girl that was working there - who had nothing to do with the whole  fiasco - and he starts yelling at her in front of everyone within earshot, blaming her for putting the sign there.

I shop at TjMaxx & Marshalls regularly (like 2-3 times a week) so needless to say, I spend A LOT of money at both of these outlet stores.  Well the other night I had put a Kate Spade handbag on hold because I didn't realize I didn't have enough cash on me for everything in my cart.  anyway, I couldn't make it in the next day so I called them to ask them if even if they could hold it another day for me.  The girl on the phone politely answered \"no problem we will hold it an extra day it'll be here till close tomorrow\" PERFECT! So I go in the day after and to my dismay it's back on the rack hanging with the rest of the handbags, not being held behind the counter like the girl promised.  Well of course I didn't get too upset about it because it was still there so I went to press the button for an assoiate to come unlock it when all of a sudden a rude man with broken English and a thick accent comes up behind me and says \"excuse me but I am buying that bag\" WHAT?!?!?!?!?! Nooooooo No way was this going to happen to me right now, so I ignored him and went to find an associate to unlock it from the display.  I find a young girl with glasses that says she will unlock it and bring it to the counter for me.  So, as far as I'm concerned, I deserve the bag, and I am getting the bag so I go browse the jean section.  When I'm ready to check out I walk up to the counter and I see that same man standing there arguing with six of the store associates about my Kate Spade bag.  I walk up to the girl and say \"what is going on\"? She replies with \"well this man said that he got an associate to unlock the bag for him first\". So now I'm getting very frustrated I proceed to tell them that I have not only have this bag on hold for two days but since they didn't keep it on hold this is completely their fault that two different customers are arguing over the same handbag.  I back off a little bit once he starts to raise his voice at the associates and continue to argue with them.  I thought to myself OK I will just stand here and be the polite person and not argue.  Well about 15 minutes later I see the fat blonde woman manager waddle up to the front and declare that the rude man deserves the handbag and proceeds to check him out.  You can only imagine the rage I had at this point.  When I went to go ask the young girl with glasses what had happened the blonde manager stepped in and said \"oh (what ever the girls name was) couldn't find you so we just sold it to him, sorry\". And that's it, she cut me off. Another girl stepped in and said \"would you like us to call another store to see if they have the same bag?\"  UM NO! Are you kidding me?!? I live close to only one Marshalls in the whole state, that was the whole point of putting it on hold!  I thought to myself.  When I look at the six employees standing behind the counter I realize that a few of them know who I am as they look at me.  I can specifically remember spending over $1000 when I was checking out with two of them and yet none of them said anything in my defense, I was a regular customer who spent a lot of money in their store and nothing was said or done. I had three other items in my hand at this point, I tossed them on top of another display basket and walked out.  I honestly could not believe the rude remarks & in my opinion TOTAL sexism (because yes I am a woman) going on in this place.  Do not ever go here, this place is a nightmare. I will be contacting the regional manager tomorrow to tell him about my experience at the Camelback Marshalls that I visited quite often until now.

I've never had anyone stop to ask me if I needed anything and I've been shopping there for years. The dressing room has since been remodeled and now only accommodates 3 people at one time. This was definitely to cut down on theft. Which also means that if you need to try something on, you may have to wait in line. That would be my biggest gripe with this place. Ok, that and the parking (especially on weekends).\n\nPrices range from \"pretty good\" to \"yikes\", depending on how high end the designer item is that you are looking at. I've seen Armani denim there for $300 or more before. And I've also bought RL Polo shirts for $15 brand new. So it can really be a mixed bag. Come earlier on the weekends or you will pay. Parking is a nightmare and the store itself is crammed with people. Weekdays are better, with lots of registers still open. Overall, I like the brands that Marshall's has in stock. They are priced well-enough and the selection is decent. \n\nYes, Marshall's will get my business on occasion. As long as they carry Ralph Lauren.", "business_id": "5A_vuyESZFU9eCArpVfJCw", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-12-15", "type": "review"}

I shop at TjMaxx & Marshalls regularly (like 2-3 times a week) so needless to say, I spend A LOT of money at both of these outlet stores.  Well the other night I had put a Kate Spade handbag on hold because I didn't realize I didn't have enough cash on me for everything in my cart.  anyway, I couldn't make it in the next day so I called them to ask them if even if they could hold it another day for me.  The girl on the phone politely answered \"no problem we will hold it an extra day it'll be here till close tomorrow\" PERFECT! So I go in the day after and to my dismay it's back on the rack hanging with the rest of the handbags, not being held behind the counter like the girl promised.  Well of course I didn't get too upset about it because it was still there so I went to press the button for an assoiate to come unlock it when all of a sudden a rude man with broken English and a thick accent comes up behind me and says \"excuse me but I am buying that bag\" WHAT?!?!?!?!?! Nooooooo No way was this going to happen to me right now, so I ignored him and went to find an associate to unlock it from the display.  I find a young girl with glasses that says she will unlock it and bring it to the counter for me.  So, as far as I'm concerned, I deserve the bag, and I am getting the bag so I go browse the jean section.  When I'm ready to check out I walk up to the counter and I see that same man standing there arguing with six of the store associates about my Kate Spade bag.  I walk up to the girl and say \"what is going on\"? She replies with \"well this man said that he got an associate to unlock the bag for him first\". So now I'm getting very frustrated I proceed to tell them that I have not only have this bag on hold for two days but since they didn't keep it on hold this is completely their fault that two different customers are arguing over the same handbag.  I back off a little bit once he starts to raise his voice at the associates and continue to argue with them.  I thought to myself OK I will just stand here and be the polite person and not argue.  Well about 15 minutes later I see the fat blonde woman manager waddle up to the front and declare that the rude man deserves the handbag and proceeds to check him out.  You can only imagine the rage I had at this point.  When I went to go ask the young girl with glasses what had happened the blonde manager stepped in and said \"oh (what ever the girls name was) couldn't find you so we just sold it to him, sorry\". And that's it, she cut me off. Another girl stepped in and said \"would you like us to call another store to see if they have the same bag?\"  UM NO! Are you kidding me?!? I live close to only one Marshalls in the whole state, that was the whole point of putting it on hold!  I thought to myself.  When I look at the six employees standing behind the counter I realize that a few of them know who I am as they look at me.  I can specifically remember spending over $1000 when I was checking out with two of them and yet none of them said anything in my defense, I was a regular customer who spent a lot of money in their store and nothing was said or done. I had three other items in my hand at this point, I tossed them on top of another display basket and walked out.  I honestly could not believe the rude remarks & in my opinion TOTAL sexism (because yes I am a woman) going on in this place.  Do not ever go here, this place is a nightmare. I will be contacting the regional manager tomorrow to tell him about my experience at the Camelback Marshalls that I visited quite often until now.  Also, on a side note, it could be just me hating this place but I've noticed this store is A LOT more dirty then the T.J. Maxx locations I have been to. I mean like dust on the floors & items laying all over the floor, stuff like that.", "business_id": "5A_vuyESZFU9eCArpVfJCw", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-12-18", "type": "review"}

I know almost nothing about fishing. For the holidays, I decided to get him a gift certificate from Phoenix Fishing Supply.  I like to spend money locally instead of with big chains, and Phoenix Fishing happens to be within walking distance of my house.\nIn addition to the gift certificate, I wanted to buy a single lure. You know, so I'd have something more than a piece of paper to hand him.\nAs John K. mentioned in his review - there was the group of older guys (not employees) just hanging out near the front. The employees were all busy, so I was randomly looking at all the lures over several aisles. One of the older non employees offered his help - he spends so much time in this store he knows where everything is.\nHe seemed to like my sense of humor. I told him I was looking for a single lure (nothing too expensive) for the boyfriend. Didn't want to spend a lot, as I have no clue if it will ever be used - the real plan is the gift certificate - the lure is just a cute little add on. He asked what my boyfriend fishes for. \"BEER!\" (sounded a lot better than, \"hell if I know!\")\nWe settled on bass, and he guided me to that section.\nI felt like I was invading the boys club a bit - but not in an unwelcome sort of way. No rushing, no pressure - and if I do ever get into fishing, I have every confidence that everyone here (the staff AND the old boys club) would be happy to advise me and talk me through everything I need to know.\nI hope Fantastic Mr. It's Complicated invites me to join him when he's ready to use that certificate!", "business_id": "Xs7mmiB8DldSH_hye0_nrQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-01-21", "type": "review"}

Found a great table and chairs at Copenhagen; we were given an estimated delivery date of 10/7...in plenty of time for me to host Thanksgiving dinner for my family. That date was then pushed back to 11/16, and when still nothing came, I called and was told they did not have an update. I waited two more weeks and impatiently the salesperson told me that my $2,000+ purchase \"might be here at the end of December, might be here at the end of January, we just don't know.\" How can you have no clue where my shipment is?\n\nAfter writing a letter of complaint to the corporate office that went unanswered, I have given up and am cancelling my order to find a table elsewhere. I had always heard good things of Copenhagen, but this experience has not only ruined my family plans for Thanksgiving but has me searching again for a new table and chairs. The lack of any contact from Copenhagen has been most frustrating, I feel as though they really could care less if my furniture ever arrives. I will never buy anything from Copenhagen again.", "business_id": "qRllNpkNjFFj7sPlQkV1mg", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-12-10", "type": "review"}

Or would you prefer going to the mall, saving $15 bucks and having a pimply-faced teenager who spends most of his life on Xbox take care of you?  It's your choice!\n\nI was a serious - meaning top 20 nationally in my age-group - multi-sport guy when I lived in SoCal, so I think I know a good running store when I see one.

Things you might find at Tribal Multi-sport but otherwise nowhere else in the Valley that I know of.\n\nYou will not be disappointed.  Oh yeah, parking is a bitch at this place.

I recently started running again and needed some new shoes as my knee was bothering me.  I did a lot of research online and was all set to pretty much buy the most expensive shoes out there.  Why?  Because they're the best right?  Well, there are so many choices nowadays that I was a little overwhelmed.  So I decided to go to the Runner's Den because I heard such great reviews.  I walked in and the sales associate asked me questions about my background, mileage, etc...  He had me remove my shoes and examined my feet.  He then had me walk back and forth.  He quickly noticed a slight anatomical difference in the foot on the leg that was giving me knee pain.  He also measured my feet and found my left one to be 1/2 size larger.  He suggested three different models that would be ideal for me.  I told him I was partial to Saucony so he grabbed me a pair.  I put them on and we went outside and I ran back and forth on the sidewalk.  They felt great.  The best thing is was the model which was best for me was the $99 one - not the $140 one I would've purchased if on my own.  I'm a mid-foot striker with little pronation issues.  Most of the expensive shoes are for heel strikers or those with pronation issues.  I also purchased a shoe 1/2 size larger than normal as I've always been trying to fit my larger foot and compromising on overall comfort.  I've been wearing shoes too small for me in the past.  It's a small store with an excellent reputation so you may have to wait if they're busy.  Also, you'll pay retail prices.  However, I saved in the long run by buying the shoe that was right for me.

I am such a noob, that I hurt my ankle while running in $30 cross trainers. A friend recommended Runner's Den so I came in for their free running injury clinic and I'm so happy I did!  The Doctor was nice and very thorough and helpful. He gave me a few stretches to do and recommended a pair of shoes that would be appropriate for me (which was the same as the Runner's Den employee suggested while I was waiting to see the doctor, so sounds like they were spot on!) This was great, because my inner hypochondriac had already convinced my brain that I'd eventually have to amputate. Turns out my prognosis isn't that grim.\n\nAll the employees I spoke with were nice, helpful and extremely knowledgeable. I know a lot of people complained about higher prices, but I looked up how much the shoes I picked up were going for online, and the prices were exactly the same on all the major websites (eastbay, amazon, footlocker, etc) so clearly I'd rather support a local business! I'm sure prices vary with the different shoes, but the one I was looking at wasn't any cheaper anywhere else which was nice.\n\nIt's a good 30 mile drive for me, so I don't think I'll just hop in for random little things, but for major purchases like shoes or a sports bra, it's worth the drive!", "business_id": "P6H-p8fXbPq8VjO4kLTz4A", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-12-07", "type": "review"}

I hear there is a small privately owned computer shop on 24th St and indian School that gets great reviews. Data Doctors looked over my laptop for 20-30 mins in the store (20th/Camelback) and then the tech told me he would have to send it to the Tempe main lab for full assessment. $100 to take it in and figure out what the problem is. I got a call 3 days later from someone else stating they just recieved my laptop and were going to look at it the next morning, so apparently it takes them 3 days to send my laptop from downtown Phx to downtown Tempe. The next day I got a call saying they basically have no clue what the issue is but that they are going to reinstall windows and see if that takes care of the problem. That will cost me an additional $200 to reinstall windows!! At this point I feel like I am trapped because I have already spent $100 bucks and they have the computer. I reluctantly agree to basically pay $300 to have windows reinstalled in my 2 year old laptop. When will I get it back? How long could that possibly take, right? Well, 3-5 days he says. it will take 3-5 days to reinstall windows into my laptop and that is \"putting it ahead of 30 other computers for me.\" The guy is now acting like I should feel lucky that he is putting mine ahead of others because otherwise it could take 2 WEEKS?! 2 days later I get a call that it is done and seems to be working just fine. It will be back in the Phoenix store for me to pick up 2 1/2 days later...\nFinally, I get my computer back after 2 weeks and $300. Oh well, at least it is all fixed now, right? WRONG. Now my computer will not connect to my wireless network at home. So I call and talk to my wireless provider for 35 minutes trying this and that and she determines it is my computer that has a problem, not the service. I knew that because the other 4 laptops in the house work fine but I figured maybe it just needed to be reset-up or something. \nI called the Data Doctors store to ask them to help me over the phone with maybe a setting or two. The location I dropped it off at originally has NO RECORD of my laptop ever even coming thru that store and they refer me to call the Tempe lab. I call the Tempe lab and tell two different people my issue before someone decides to help me. They tap into my computer from the lab and look at a few things for 10 minutes and then tell me he thinks it is my wireless connection!! I explain that I have several other computers in the house and that I never had an issue with the wireless component until I got it back from them. He says he does not think it is the computer but I have to take it back to the store to have them try to connect it to their wireless network and go from there...but he does not think it is the computer itself. I have a brand new modem and router.\nWhat a bad experience that still is not over. \nI will never take my computers in to data doctors in the future and I would certainly not reccomend them to anyone else.", "business_id": "MTaaIqX7GJXdTPDDx4L90A", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-01-30", "type": "review"}

Being a cell phone owner since the days when they came in a bag like a heavy small carry-on bag, I have to say I HAVE NEVER HAD A PLEASANT EXPERIENCE IN A CELL PHONE STORE BEFORE.   EVAH. \n\nI've had a Treo for many years.  Last year, I dropped the phone and broke the screen.   Went into the Alltel store and they literally said to me, \"sorry you're screwed; we don't replace screens; you have no insurance; you're still under contract\" - so my only solution was to buy a new one for $600 according to the very harried and unpleasant rotund pimply fellow at the Alltel store.   Methinks there must be another way!\n\nSo I got on line and found this PDAparts.com for replacement screens.   They warn you: this voids any warranty!!!   But it was \"only\" $70 so I went for it.  They actually have a step-by-step video posted on YouTube on how to replace the screen.  Scary, but my trusty friend/co-worker Chris is an engineer so he did the dirty work for me in about 5 minutes flat.  YAY.    Phone worked perfectly until.... one day... the screen just went blank.\n\nSo I'm hosed now right?  And it's December.   The phone technically still WORKED, as in: it rings, and I can fumble to answer it... but I can't see who's calling or who is texting me or make calls... or read my emails... so it was kinda limiting.\n\nSo with much trepidation I wandered myself over to the Verizon store on Camelback, figuring I was now only 1 month away from the end of my contract and maybe I just had to bite the bullet and switch to a new phone.    They don't make the Treo 755p anymore, and I really didn't want to learn how to use a whole new phone... too busy.  But I guess I gotta. \n\nSo you walk in and they ask you:  do you need service or sales, and what's your name?    Service... Jane.     They put you on a list which is on a big monitor, and tell you: you are 4th in line for service.   Sigh... look around... and not 5 minutes later, I'm called up. \n\nThe very friendly and CUTE guy who helped me took a look and agreed, the screen is fried.    Do you want to pick out a new phone today, or can you wait a few days to get a refurbished 755p?    Huh?  I could get another 755p?    Yes we will replace your phone but we don't have them HERE so you'd have to wait a few days.   Um... okay... I guess I can wait, but, how much will that cost?   \"Oh, it'll be free.\"    FREE?    Sold! \n\nThe people working there were joking around with each other, easy going and super helpful.  There were other people in the store who were clearly stressed and in a bad mood, and from what I observed these folks were super-great at defusing them. \n\nSomething good is going on at that shop and based on my experience (a) I highly recommend them; and (b) I'm sticking with Verizon!", "business_id": "fN-ISSf1Ic68B2kDNek_uQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-12-27", "type": "review"}

As all the color drained from my face my friend asked what was wrong, and luckily she had her fourteen year old son with her (technology wizards) and he was able to convince me to live until I could get to the Verizon store to have them try to retrieve my photos. This all happened on a Friday night. I was so terrified that they would fail that it took me until Monday to work up the courage to go to the store. I had worked up an ulcer the size of a quarter, and when I went to the store on Camelback and 16th Street at first I was thinking... well I can't write what I was thinking but the store had moved.\n\nThe store was located between a mattress store and Baja Fresh. It was small, cramped, and always seemed stressful. I am happy to say it just jumped over to where a video store was located and is in the same general vicinity.

Finding the perfect engagement ring isn't easy, and if you're extremely particular like some of us, it's only more difficult.

In order to see Ritani rings in person, though, you must go to a select few stores - Hyde Park being one of the two stores offering them in Arizona.\n\nEnter Erik. Mr. Rominger greeted us about four months ago when we first entered Ritani. Brooke, my fiance, had a specific ring in mind, but it wasn't on display in store. So, Erik had that ring and another similar ring that we liked shipped in within a few days. Upon seeing both, Brooke couldn't decide which she liked more, so Erik suggested we have a custom ring made... perfect!\n\nThe custom ring process allows you to pick out exactly what you want regarding every aspect of the ring. Furthermore, you get to see a computer rendering and make and changes, then you receive (and get to keep!) a wax mold of the final product, and finally the final product. This process took, I'd like to say, about six weeks and was worth the wait.\n\nFrom wax approval to final product, there is roughly a two week wait. To fool Brooke, ensuring a surprise proposal, I contacted Erik and had him tell her it would take longer. He followed through perfectly and she was completely shocked when the time came.\n\nUltimately, Erik was there to answer any and all questions and needs I had along the way and got me a great deal on a spectacular ring.

You have the choice for more money to be spent back in the store (trade) or get the cash.  \n\nI've never actually bought anything here though.", "business_id": "OkRzw22eDg45do8i-1jHow", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-01-10", "type": "review"}

He right away said I do not know anything about snowboards but I will try my best to help. He helped my son from a to z with everything from explaining the board size, to the binding for the board and picked out the snow boot.

I had a lamp shade that I needed repaired, it is an old lamp shade from the 50's it is called a wedding cake shade. It comes in multiple tiers one on top of the other. \n\nSo I call down, and they tell me that they can fix anything, after i bring it in the lady at the front desk says that they can't fix it, and she has never even seen anything like it before and is flat out rude. Just as I am getting ready to leave a younger guy comes up and inquires about my problem, he explains that they need to take in the back to their fix it guy and see if he can fix it. We all proceed to go back and the man says he can fix it. \n\nEstimate given $20.40. Should not exceed that I was told...I was told they would call me if it cost any more then that.  \n\nI say sounds good, they say it will take a week.\n\nSo a week later I come back in and sure enough the shade is fixed, now they never called me to say it was done...I just showed up. They get the shade and its almost as good as new. Now comes the problem..the lady again...extremely rude. And when she goes to hand me the receipt she ads another  $20 for labor, $6.00 for parts and .50 for tax. So the total comes out to $46.50 to fix a lamp shade...apparently all they did was weld a few pieces of metal...no parts I can see..., says right on the receipt welded at seem, that cost about $1 in solder and maybe 20 minutes worth of labor. \n\n I felt ripped off by this lady. Per other reviews she was rude and I feel like they have some pretty shady business practices, I can't knock the work...but I would never go back here if I can find another place. I have added a photo of my receipt where she scribbled out the $20 and added the extra charges. Total Rip off.

If your handset is even slightly out of date they will tell you to wait (phoneless) 3-5 days for the replacement to get to you.\n\nOf course, you can always upgrade . . . for a fee.  . . \n\nBut if you have made the mistake in good conscience of taking the phone to a service center first and waiting an hour to see if your phone can be fixed, and then decide to upgrade while there, that's an $18 fee for trying to get it fixed in person rather than just putting in your ticket online and waiting 3-5 days. \n\nWhen you call to complain, you will be told that the charges are \"system generated\" and thus can't be removed. I found that escalating to a manager (using keywords \"cancel my account\") and telling him/her that you have a system that will generate letters to the attorney general and your credit card company and there is NOTHING YOU CAN DO TO STOP IT tends to work. I got my $18 back and I strongly suggest everyone else do this as well. If you don't get what you want on the first call, call back. And again. And again.\n\nThese policies apply no matter which plan you are on, and no matter how long you have been with them, and no matter how much other business you represent as a corporate customer.\n\nSo why 2 stars?

I also have found that I can get the extras I have to pay for with Sprint I can get from other carriers included within my plan. In addition to all of that the phone I wish to up grade to on Sprint I can get for less on another carrier without an upgrade discount. I had to way out the pros and cons and in the end I would rather pay the extra $12.00 a month and actually get what I am paying for.

What's more is even though I was in the store requesting an exchange on day 14 they count the day I received the phone, even though late that Saturday evening and despite the fact there was a holiday during this period, as day one.\n\nTwo weeks ago today I decided to leave Verizon with whom I have been reasonably satisfied except for cost, and explore other options. I have had a cellphone for 28 years and have, at one time or another, been with all of the major carriers. Two Saturdays ago I went to T-Mobile, AT&T and finally Sprint. On my way to this store I read the Yelp! reviews and thought to myself \"they can't really be THAT bad, can they?\" I've since discovered they are WORSE.\n\nInitially I was very satisfied with the sales process. I actually went online the day before and reserved phones, chose my plan, etc. I was a bit miffed that online I was told I qualified for three lines with no deposit but in store and after \"further review\" that I could only get two lines with a $50 deposit for each. I couldn't understand why as Verizon required no deposit from me two years ago and if anything my credit has improved somewhat sice but whatever. (When I received a letter from Sprint a week later it stated the phone number I provided could not be verified in public records. Are you kidding me? Guess I should have used my landline number. Oh well live and learn.) Because of this SNAFU the sales associate had to basically redo everything in the system so my time spent online was for naught but you can't fault an employee for crappy systems.\n\nNext day when I unboxed the phone and after charging it (even though I was told they are shipped to the store fully charged) and giving it a test drive I noticed a faint crackling static noise while streaming videos on YouTube. Initially I dismissed this as possibly being a fault with the video or possibly bad data connection but several days later while messing with ringtone options the same crackling static noise was there. As this was an HTC One M8 Harman Kardon edition and the main selling point was the superior audio quality I assumed getting a quick like-for-like exchange wouldn't be an issue. Wow was I wrong.\n\nAfter a lengthy back and forth with two different associates, one of whom the same person who sold me the phone, I was told that because it was now, by their strictest application of their policy, outside the14 day return policy, my only option was a refurbished phone through the insurance company. Really? One day and as I mentioned  earlier one of those days was a holiday during which no business could be transacted. Also this came after I was told by a member of their tech department there was nothing wrong with the phone and it was only after I demonstrated using the ringtones that they begrudgingly admitted there was indeed an issue. When I asked if I could appeal to a manager they informed me they were both managers and that nothing more could be done. When pressed a bit more , however, the assistant store manager was summoned. At last, I thought, someone who is empowered to make a customer happy. Wrong, again.\n\nHe introduced himself as Chuck and initially was upbeat and positive. Progress perhaps. I introduced myself as Charlie, plead my case, and he proceeded to tap away at the computer terminal. Good sign. Then he asked to see my phone again. He then proceeded to tell me had the phone been in like new condition perhaps he could have given me some leeway but since there was a gouge on the back of the phone that walking out of the store with a replacement was not an option. I wish I could take and post a picture of this\"gouge\" which is actually a minute abrasion of the plastic backing which you'd need a micrometer to measure. At this point in time and knowing he was fishing for any excuse not to help me I became exasperated. At the very same time Chuck became a first class prick. Very unprofessional.\n\nI intend to send an email to corporate but I'm sure it will only resort in positive feedback to the employees at this store for towing the company line. \"No waivers, no favors.\" So now I don't even have the option of cancellation without massive contract break fees. Be on notice, Sprint and the employees of the Town and Country store, on Monday there will be a call made to the AZ Attorney General's office as well as the Better Business Bureau about your lousy intractable business practices.", "business_id": "N6ff0yyo9Cv_7XPz-YDoow", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-12-27", "type": "review"}

I was set for the holidays. \n\nIn the middle of January (on the 20th, to be exact), my car veered into the parking lot, opened its door and shoved me out, saying, \"Go buy a new book, damnit.\" Who was I to protest? So, I did. I walked in gingerly, unsure if I should get another new book - at the rate I was reading, I would need a new one every week. Who really has an extra $68 lying around? Isn't that what libraries are for? Anyway, I succumbed and bought a book. Then I drove away, satisfied. \n\nYou see, Borders emails me coupons. And today, I updated my online profile so I can receive coupons from other companies, like Target and Priceline. Nothing like supporting the large conglomerates, right? Well, I like to think it's a small token of their appreciation, when, in fact, I know it's just a tease - save 10% on a purchase of 50$! Like, oh my god, that's totally worth it.

For some reason the part I needed wasn't in stock, which was kind of strange since four days earlier when I made the appointment- they clearly said the back glass would be replaced. I am no business tycoon, but when a customer is coming in to have a piece of glass replaced, I imagine you would want to have the piece of glass in stock-but I could be crazy.

I don't know about you, but if I had the packaging of something I bought four months ago, then I would likely be featured on the show 'Hoarders'. I informed him I didn't have the packaging but due to the bumper not protecting my phone, I wished to exchange it.

I pointed it out to the lovely lady who works there and she immediately took it back to the jeweler to investigate. They figured it happened while sautering the ring, were extremely apologetic and promised to have my ring ready the next day. When I picked it up I was told that the inside of the class ring was hollow, not solid gold. I don't know if a lot of class rings are like this or if it was just what they were doing in 1950. The jeweler filled the hollow space with gold and made the ring look brand new. When I asked if there was an additional charge for the extra gold I was told no. This was above and beyond my expectations. Not only did they make my beloved heirloom better than it was when I brought it in, but they did it quickly and with no expectation for extra payment.

This was my 11th Christmas with my wife and wanted to get her something to show that although the 11 years have had many ups downs, lefts rights and curve balls, that even after 11 years of me being a pain in the ass, she was still my life. Awww story out, comes every mans horror story, shopping, and shopping for jewelry. I had gone to your typical mall jewelry stores, Zales, Kays, and the other big name mall stores. Some stores were so busy I couldn't get helped, other stores wouldn't take me seriously as I was in shorts, T shirt and ball cap (weekend shopping). Those that did seemed to only want to push a certain collection of diamond or design, or old stock or immediately ask if I want to open a store card to finance or see how much I am approved for, sell a protection plan before I even made a ring selection or maintenance plans and really want to sell me everything but a damn ring. \nSo, on my lunch hour three days before this christmas (2015), I was driving down Indian School Rd on my way to Chick Fil A and saw their Billboard on the left side of the street just before 44th st. Said ok, I'm in a patient mood, lets try this again. I walked in thoroughly expecting to be either outright ignored, or have a certain item shoved down my throat.\n I was completely wrong. Peggy, was such a sweetheart, She asked me about my wife, why i wanted to get her a ring, what kind of style she has etc. really trying to get a feel for my wife to make the best recommendations of jewelry. And she nailed my wifes personality and style with ease. She showed me some beautiful pieces and I really liked this one ring, it was $1,000 over my intended budget, but the wife deserved it and Peggy's customer service and effort to really get to know the situation, it really was the perfect ring. So I bought it. Peggy wrapped it up for me and off I went. And still got my chick Fil-a sandwich. It is a family owned jewelry shop and I love supporting local AZ businesses. The other gentlemen present were nice and charismatic, but if you are a guy and are pretty lost like me on what to get, ask for Peggy, she will take care of you.", "business_id": "93EFuYATJ0rgqO0uJLRYfw", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-12-23", "type": "review"}

The other place I took my machine for 2 years, never had me in their system and never remembered the countless times I spent money in their store.\n\nI was really surprised that in 2 days a service tech had looked at my machine for a diagnosis, the other store didn't even get to looking at my machine until 2 and half weeks later to tell me something was even wrong with my machine.\n\nUnfortunately, my sewing machine is a Viking and it need some new parts that can only be sold and distributed by Viking dealers.  But the service tech did tune up, adjust the tension, and let me know exactly what needed to be replaced in terms I can understand and not part numbers and techie vocabulary like the other store.\n\nThe tech even got it to sew better, although I am still waiting for things to get replaced, at least they were able to give back my machine after 3 days in a working condition that I can still sew light weighted gowns and use my industrial Juki for the rest. \n\nOverall, their customer service is excellent and their staff knowledgeable and friendly.\n\nI may be switching my brand loyalty from Viking to Bernina very soon.  That and when I worked at Hancock Fabrics when I was 16, my boss ranted and raved about her Bernina.", "business_id": "iYj4QlA3Of2WHTtyYGTodw", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-01-06", "type": "review"}

Can't say I blame her because the customers were shouting for and at their unruly children and crying babies at decibels uncalled for. I think this clerk just wanted to disappear.

Wine would have been the easy choice, but flowers are always a better choice. I called up the morning of my dinner hoping to have the flowers delivered, but I was out of luck as their delivery van had already left for the day. No problem said the woman on the phone.

Perfect. \n\nThe woman on the phone made me laugh when I asked her opinion on whether I should get cut flowers that my hostess could arrange or a finished arrangement.

You should get an arrangement in a vase\". And so I did. \n\nThe flowers that I later picked up were perfect. A square low vase filled with a \"Spring assortment\" (I was actually wondering if that would look different out here in the southwest than at home, but it didn't) of hydrangea, pink roses, and other interesting filler flowers I had no idea what they were.

Most garden places I have looked at either have huge bags or no clue what I'm looking for. I looked online and found a Bonsai club that listed baker nursery as having Bonsai supplies.\nWhen we got there we loved how large the nursery was. They had a very large selection of plants and almost every kind of garden decoration you can think of. We kept looking through all the plants & thinking where we can put each one in our yard & garden. They had almost anything you can think of & a few things i had never seen before. It is rose season & the selection & colors of roses made me wish i had won the lotto so i could drop it all on flowers! \nI had heard though that they had a collection of Bonsai on display in the nursery & when we found it I was amazed! They were georgeous! It is truley amazing that something that small can look so majestic!\nWe did end up finding a small bag of pebbles & a small bag of Pumice which was exctly what we needed. We even bought a decoration for my new Bonsai. And of course my husband could not resist some plants either, so we got a few small things for him to put around the yard. When we had a good look around & were checking out we asked if there was anyone there that really knew a lot about Bonsai plants & care so we can ask a few questions. They told us they would page Charlie over for us.\nLet me tell you Charlie was great to talk to. I was a little shy at first because I am not starting with a traditional plant, but am trying to Bonsai a Gardenia, but Charlie told me it was great that I was trying it out on something so pretty. He walked us around & even showed us a few plants that he is personally working on. He assured us that what we were planning on doing was right on track and the nutrients we had to feed the plants with would be great!

Avoid BOB and STEVE at the Thomas/44th St. location at all costs! Got suckered into a Serta Perfect Sleeper here, and within a MONTH the nearly $1500.00 bed was sagging!  We didn't want to deal with it and are moving and called Bedmart about the warranty weeks ago.  They looked up our file, and said that an inspector would \"be in touch\" to set up an appointment to inspect the bed.  I waited a week and called back but they said not to worry.  I called a week later, and they said they would \"look into it.\"  Called again and they said they'd look into it again, but go no return call.  Finally, I called again today, for the 4th time, and STEVE told me there was no way it would happen until next year (after we move).  \n\nThat's annoying, and bad service, sure, but the reason I'm writing this is that they were patronizing, rude, and just plain insulting.  When I said I was dissatisfied at having to wait a month, after we move, just for the initial appointment, STEVE spoke to me like he was doing me a favor to look into why we had not been contacted!  In fact, he actually said this!  He was vague about the whole thing and when I asked a question about it, he actually said he could fax my request to the \"factory today\" or \"THROW IT IN THE TRASH!\"  \n\nBTW, the \"manager\" Bob said the factory is actually closed, so faxing it was not a favor at all!  Either way, are they really doing me a favor to follow up on the bad service for the crappy product they sell?  No!  \n\nI called back and asked to speak to the store manager, who answered the phone and identified himself as BOB.  Without even giving me a chance to say hello, he gruffly said he had heard the whole conversation and was not going to allow abuse.  I explained that I was the abused one, and that unless I had been on speaker phone, he had only heard one side of the conversation.  He did not like facts, and was even more rude after I pointed this out.  Needless to say, he clearly did not care about customer service, talked over me and cut me off, and spoke to me like he was Donald Trump and I was his peon contestant.  He proceeded to tell me that there would be no inspection anytime soon, since the Serta factory was closed until the New Year. \n\nBut he offered a hollow favor...if I wanted, he would call me Monday, Xmas Eve.  Umm, hello, but you just told me the factory who sets up the inspection appointments, is closed for 10 days...so what new information would you have in 2 days?  BOB did not want to be bothered with facts, and just wanted to shove it to me, whether it made sense or not, so he kept repeating and belaboring this.  \n\n\"When does the factory open, I asked?\"  But BOB, who either made up the whole thing about the closure, or knew only half the facts, or just wanted to keep shoving it to me, wouldn't tell me.  \"When do you want me to call you back, since you want everything on your schedule,\" he asked.  \"How about right when the factory re-opens.\"  \"How about we just have them call you to set up the appointment,\" he said.  Um, but \"I already did that weeks ago, and they didn't set it up,\" I pointed out.  (That's why I called 4 times.)  \"Whenever the factory opens, the next day would be fine,\" I said.  Then BOB decided, even though I told him this would not work, he would not follow up on why they hadn't called and just start over.  In other words, throw the follow-up request in the trash!  No, I said, I don't want that.  \"That's what I'm doing,\" and then hung up on me\n\nWe went to BedMart looking for a latex mattress that was firm.  But Bed Mart on 44th/Thomas convinced us that this spring bed would be great and would not sag.  They lied.  Then we call about the warranty because the bed is crap and they know it, we don't hear from them repeatedly.  Someone else at the 44th/Thomas location was supposed to follow up with me two days ago but never did (on my 3rd call).  Clearly, they want to get a bed sold, period.  If you have a problem, which eventually you will, they will tell you it is someone else fault, not return calls, patronizingly tell you that they are doing you a favor to follow up on your lack of service, and basically treat you like you are crap because you have a problem with the bed.  To top it all off, they will hang up on you and be rude.

When they have something on sale you can find really good prices.  I went in to buy a shotgun awhile back and the sales person talked me out  of it based on my needs and skill level.  I ended up picking up another one on black friday for a really good price.  This one is more spacious then the one on 19th ave, and has a nice parking lot.  I bought some cool survival stuff from here for cheap, some hiking boots and when my wife wanted some hiking boots and she was about to go to an expensive store I told her to go to big 5 and she got some for $20.

It was beautiful and I was in love the minutes I saw the carmel colored beauty. Within six months a peice of the frame came loose and pertruded through the fabric in the back. I called them and they sent someonne out to repair it. within  6 months it was broken again. They refused to fix it stating that it was outside of the year. I understand that placed have to set a time limit, but the fact that it broke twice in such a short time is ridiculous! I still have furniture to buy for my home and they are not on the list of companies that I would ever do business with again. In my opinion a $75-$100 repair should be handled as a courtesy for my inconvenience but they would rather lose the business.
