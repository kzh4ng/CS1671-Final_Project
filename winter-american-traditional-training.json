I went to check this place out on the way home from the airport one Friday night and it didn't disappoint. It is refreshing to walk into a townie bar and not feel like the music stops and everyone in the place is staring at you - I'm guessing the mixed crowd of older hockey fans, young men in collared shirts, and thirtysomethings have probably seen it all during their time at this place. \n\nThe staff was top notch - the orders were somewhat overwhelming as they appeared short-staffed for the night, but my waitress tried to keep a positive attitude for my entire visit. The other waiter was wearing a hooded cardigan, and I wanted to steal it from him due to my difficulty in finding such a quality article of clothing.\n\nWe ordered a white pizza - large in size, engulfed in cheese, full of garlic flavor, flavorful hot sausage. An overall delicious pizza, aside from 2 things: 1, way too much grease (I know this comes with the territory, but still, it is sometimes unbearable); 2, CANNED MUSHROOMS - the worst thing to come out of a can. Ever. I would rather eat canned Alpo than canned mushrooms. And if the mushrooms weren't canned, they were just the worst mushrooms I've ever consumed. The mushroom debacle is enough to lower the review by an entire star - disgusting!\n\nMy advice for the place is keep everything awesome - random music from the jukebox, tasty food, great prices, good crowd and staff - and get some decent mushrooms; why they spoil an otherwise above average pie with such inferior crap, I'll never know.", "business_id": "KayYbHCt-RkbGcPdGOThNg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-02-27", "type": "review"}

We were fine with that. Just after we received our drinks at the bar the hostess came over to ask us if we'd mind sitting in the lounge, a table with couches as seating. We gladly took the table in lieu of waiting 20-30 minutes as we originally planned on. We closed our tab at the bar and were seated in the lounge.

Overall I'd recommend Rusty's, but there are better places to eat.  The restaurant is long and narrow and when I came in was very busy.  The ordering system is very convoluted.  You wait in line to order at a window.  The person at the window though was also making sandwiches so there was a wait, about 30 seconds, between each group to order.  The menu board is on the sidewall of the hallway  (parallel to the line) so you can't really see it until you get up to the front of the line to order.  It would have been better to place it above the order window (perpendicular to the line).  And you thought you'd never use geometry after you got out of high school.  Then you head around the corner to the left to another line to get your drinks and place your order again at the cashier and pay.  The layout of the place kind funnels people this way, but why do I have to order twice?  Maybe this is so they can start working on your order and have it ready when you go to pay.  I was lucky to grab a table as I witnessed several parties hovering nearby looking for a place to sit.  If you have more than two people in your party I recommend that after make your first order you send someone to snag  a table while the other goes to pay.  I ordered a cheese steak sandwich and fries.  It took a while to get my food.  You would think they would have started working on it when I first placed my order, but that was not the case.  With the volume of people in the place I anticipated a wait, but it seemed to take longer than it should to get my food.  The cheese steak sandwich was OK, nothing special, but it was hot off the grill.  I should have known not to expect too much when the menu said it came with lettuce, tomato, and mayo.  Toppings that are fine for a burger but that should never be mentioned in the same sentence as a cheese steak.  I left them off of my cheese steak.  The fries on the other hand were great.  They were thick cut, hot & crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.  Overall nothing spectacular, the fries come close, but good hot food.  The tab came to $10.46 for sandwich, fries and drink, which is not too unreasonable.", "business_id": "WkD7OrSIHLzgOQo9wQHu-A", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-01-13", "type": "review"}

Decent service, mediocre food, fairly pricey for average bar food.\n\nDetailed review:\n\nAfter taking a small fish fry break, we resumed our quest to find the best fish fry in southern Wisconsin. With the roads in poor shape thanks to the recent snow, we decided to focus our sights on local offerings, and since Tully's is \"around the corner\" from our friend's house, we decided to give it a try.\n\nWe walked in and seated ourselves; we chose a small table that was located in a section \"in front\" of the bar area and adjacent to the pool tables. The salad bar and another small dining area are located on \"the other side\" of the pool table room... Odd layout for certain.\n\nOur waitress took our drink orders and we browsed the menu, which included your typical bar fare: lots of fried appetizers, burgers, sandwiches, and so on. I'll say this - there are a ton of items on the menu; even the Friday night fish fry offered 7 varieties of fish, 4 of which are all you can eat.\n\nOur drinks arrived and we placed our orders: AYCE baked cod with a baked potato, AYCE beer battered cod with cheesy hash browns, and AYCE lake perch with hash browns.\n\nWe were informed that our meals also included a salad bar trip... Too bad we had already ordered cheese curds. \n\nBut, being the troopers we are, we ventured over to the salad bar and built a few plates. It was ok for a bar's salad, but not great by any means. My tomatoes were mushy and tasted \"off\"; broccoli was dry and obviously came from a bag. Coleslaw earned decent reviews.\n\nCurds and fish arrived at the same time. Curds were breaded and typical \"from the freezer bag\" variety. Nothing special, and not worth the $6.79 price tag.\n\nFish plates each had two pieces; baked cod was drenched in buttery water and loaded with dill flake. Hmm... It tasted ok, but wasn't as flaky, tender, or flavorful as I'd prefer. Baked potato was foil-wrapped, and nicely cooked.  \n\nBattered cod had a decent batter that had just a hint of a unique flavor (we couldn't put our finger on it, as it was tasty), but it was fairly greasy and like the baked cod, the actual fish was quite \"lifeless.\"  The cheesy hash browns were good- nice and crispy, with only a hint of grease.\n\nBattered lake perch was just like the cod, only it was more greasy. I shed a small tear as grease oozed out of the piece I tried.\n\nThe bill arrived... $55 for three with one round of beers. Yikes.\n\nTully's = fail.\n\nService = 4 stars (good, prompt, fun)\nFood = 2 stars (based on fish only)\nValue = 2 stars\nMisc = 2 stars (not real exciting)\n\nI'd come here to drink some Miller Lites and to munch on some bar food during a game, but I'd skip the fish fry.", "business_id": "kOXJrbuB1a1Na6sf_WQnDg", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-12-13", "type": "review"}

I had the DBG burger with french onion soup and that was just the right amount for lunch. Came during lunch on a Tuesday and was seated immediately. Unfortunately I was seated at the corner and server did not know I was there for a long while. They have a new table side system that you can call for the server, and I pressed the button - still no server. I think the server calling system simply changes the light on top of the unit to red so if no one saw it, no one knows you are there. I was about to leave when the server came over and apologizes with a \"you sneaked passed me  ...\" joke. No - I was seated by another staff - did not snuck in.\n\nAnyway, the rating is for the food. Ordered the DGB burger with french onion soup and it was good. Juicy inside and sauce is tasty. The French onion soup is OK. onions, beef broth, bread and cheese baked in an oven. Oh - i did not know when he said fries or soup, choosing soup adds an extra cost to the bill.\n\nThe table side system also allows you to check out quickly with a credit card. While I like the efficiency of these systems, I find that it takes away the service part of a restaurant. I can order and pay right from there - so maybe I don't have to tip that much since all the servers do is to give me water and bring out my food.", "business_id": "4pZeC9W0EIiBTOJMnwG2vw", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-12-02", "type": "review"}

The neighborhood is a little sketchy, but not so much during the day. Since you're sitting outside, it's allowed for some pretty entertaining people watching.\n\nThe brunch here is awesome! I always get super excited when I can have biscuits and gravy (since the only animal I eat is of the fish variety). You can get biscuits with mushroom gravy!! The portion I got was huge and so dang tasty. \n\nThe drinks are awesome! Get the Hurricane..even if just for the cashier to yell \"HURRICANEEEE!\" when you order it... It's pretty fun and adds to the overall experience.\n\nI will definitely be back to try their dinner options and grab another delicious cocktail.", "business_id": "tb24fvNJfHhyKEXkKn12Xw", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-01-30", "type": "review"}

I made it back here less than two weeks after the Yelp Elite Event for a dinner with co-workers. If I come back here a million times, the view here will always leave me awestruck. There can't be a better place in The Valley to bring someone special to take their breath away.\nSince there were five of us and we love to share, we were able to sample a little of everything. We started with the scallops and duck ravioli. At the Yelp Elite Event I pretty much had a permanent spot at the scallop station so we all know how I feel about the scallops. The duck ravioli was delicious too. LOVED the appetizers.\n\nI have to say that those of us who ordered the filet mignon for our main suffered severe buyer's remorse after my co-worker shared her venison with us. The venison was tender and smoky flavored and not at all gamy tasting. Served with sweet potatoes, I am KICKING myself for not ordering the venison. I do have issues with eating animals whom I classify as lovable and beautiful so venison, along with lamb and rabbit are usually off-limits. Had I known what the venison was going to taste like, I think I would have made an exception (FORGIVE ME, BAMBI!!)\n\nMy filet mignon with horseradish crust, was not bad but especially compared to the venison seemed a bit dull. That didn't stop me from eating all of it.  I have to give them props for the bread they served because it came with a choice of mushroom truffle herb butter, arugula pesto (which was AWESOME) and the THIRD spread, which for the life of me I CAN'T remember was awesome too.....it really was a toss up between the pesto and forgotten spread.\n\nWe also enjoyed some delicious cocktails and a great bottle of malbec, and later some desert. I can only vouch for my Tahitian Vanilla Creme Brulee which was a great way to finish our meal.\n\nThe service was impeccable, although my co-worker and I were both given the lobster bisque when we ordered salad. This is hardly a tragedy though because I got to enjoy the lobster bisque too.\n\nDifferent Pointe of View is definitely a place you'd come only on a special occasion but it is, for this Yelper, one of the best fine dining options in The Valley.

Reservations are key for that special occasion, but the palette of flavor developed throughout the meal will surprise you at every bite.\n\nTHE STORY: Different Pointe of View is one of the finest pieces of culture in Phoenix. Nearly every table can enjoy miles of city and mountain views that lend an understanding to the city's form so rarely found.\n\nThe wonder doesn't stop at the atmosphere, however, as the food and and drink never stop wowing. The salad options change seasonally, but be sure to include one in your meal as an appetizer or small second course. During my most recent visit, I enjoyed the phenomenal Poached Pear and Micro Herbs salad, which included a cinnamon-cider poached pear, dried goji berries, Humboldt Fog cheese, toasted pistachios, and a d'anjou pear and tarragon dressing. Presentation is one of Chef DeMuro's greatest talents, and each ingredient truly shines as it arrives on your plate. The Blueberry and Rocket Arugula salad was also a favorite, with dried blueberries, goat cheese, Marcona almonds, shaved beets, and a sweet cabernet lavender vinaigrette that was astonishingly light, floral, and fresh.\n\nFor my entree, I ordered the Vanilla Brandy Poached Maine Lobster, which came beautifully served against 3 lobster and parmesan raviolis, expertly cooked with the perfect bite. The smokey lobster buerre blanc sauce added another hearty, yet southwestern element that finished off the dish.\n\nOf course, service is impeccable, and our waiter and sommelier truly acted as if they were happy to be serving us. We were tended to often, and frequently asked about each course. Needless to say, Different Pointe of View is just perfect for a rare, relaxing, beautiful, and immensely satisfying meal in the heart of Arizona.", "business_id": "3Zsjlum5kl5N5KV712aTMQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-12-27", "type": "review"}

They had broccoli rabe sausage and a nice filling.\n\nI forgot to mention the two types of bread for the table came with a selection of 3 amazing spreads:: blood orange butter, pesto, goat cheese reduction.\n\nThe duck was a great taste but I ordered the short rib and only \"tried\" th e duck.  The short rib was a tiny bit overcooked but i am mentioning it for the sake of being accurate... it wasnt bad and didnt take away from how good it was.  The polenta and veg inckuded underneth the shortrib also had a great taste.\n\nIt's important to note, 4 scotches (one complimentry), 2 bourbons and an additional 2 orders of ice cream were added to the bill before seeing $187.50.  To dome this may dound a bit much, but I dont believe those people travel to New York.  Furthermore, I understand price should be relative to the geo location and I still dont believe it was OVERLY excessive.  This place is great for those who want a mountaintop dining and drinking experience with high quality food.\n\nMy trip consisted of visits to Tomasos, The Mission, & Different Pointe of View.  Different Pointe of View would come in second to Tomasos.. but just because I am italian and love pasta :-)   If I am to be in PHX again, it will be a must gor me to visit Different Pointe of View again.... wiyhe the misses most likely.", "business_id": "3Zsjlum5kl5N5KV712aTMQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-02-02", "type": "review"}

This place is EXACTLY what I want when I go out to breakfast!\n\nThe location:\nTotally tucked into that strip mall at 4oth & Greenway where most people (including me) never get past Starbucks and The Gelato Spot. Small inside, but feels cozy. \n\nThe service:\nAwesome- nice ladies who fill up your coffee, are sweet to your kid and know that what they do is based on immediately making you feel comfortable. On a related note for those of you with kids- There is NOTHING I appreciate more at a restaurant than a server who 1) gets your kids food out as soon as possible. Eating kid = happy kid and 2) hands YOU the hot plate so you can take care of it, rather than dropping the plate in front of your 2 year old, announcing it's hot and leaving. DUH!\n\nThe food:\nFantastic- I had the chicken and veggie skillet. I never order skillets because they are always greasy and loaded with cheese. I took a risk and it paid off! Perfect combo of yummy but  not, I need to purge after this!\n\nThe price:\nJust right, a LOT of food for not  a lot of money. Me, the wife, and our full size 2 year old ate for under $25. And let's just say I took food home- NEVER happens :)\n\nThe customers:\nTotally cool- the place is full of regulars who were all nice to our little one. It didn't hurt that he went table to table saying goodbye on our way out, but nothing makes me want to smash a face as much as a person who is rude to my kid so mad props to the regs!\n\nAll in all, this place  is just my speed and we will be back...

The amount of people there was just about right - not completely empty (which would make me feel like it was unpopular for some reason) and not completely full (which would lead to inattentiveness by our server and an overloud environment). Our waitress introduced herself and asked for our drink orders promptly, and brought them back promptly. \n\nAfter looking over the menu, I ordered the filet mignon (medium) with steamed broccoli and sauteed green beans. We each had a starter - I had a salad with blue cheese dressing and he had the French onion soup. Neither of us was particularly enthused; my dressing tasted like mayonnaise and there were only a few slim morsels of blue cheese to go with my lackluster lettuce and single tomato. \n\nThe entree, however, truly redeemed any lukewarm feelings I had. It arrived only a few minutes after we finished eating our starters. The outside was charred - as advertised - but the inside was a perfect pink, just the way I like my steak done. The filet was spiced absolutely perfectly. Every bite was a new treat. The beans were also delicious. The broccoli was NOT up to par, but it was the only thing on the plate that was not divine. \n\nAfter we ate our entrees, it was after 8:00, so appetizers were half-off for Reverse Happy Hour. Although our waitress said they normally do Reverse Happy Hour only at the bar, she asked her manager and told us it would be fine to order appetizers from our table - great service there. We got the spicy chicken wings - another winner! The spicing was amazing. They were really, really good. \n\nOverall, we agreed that this restaurant was a winner. The service, filet mignon and chicken wings bring this place up to five stars, with only one star taken away for the broccoli and salad experience. I was really pleased with my experience here.", "business_id": "SgTjnyElc26gPUghVuCuSQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-01-18", "type": "review"}
