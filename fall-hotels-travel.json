After this review, I'm writing the president of AA and if action is not taken to correct the disservice at this location, I will never be a AAA member again. (been one since 1999) \n\nI recently moved from TN and needed to transfer my title and register my Dodge Ram in PA.  This process is costly regardless of where you go, but adding $36+ for every transaction makes AAA the most expensive.  I'm willing to pay for people to deal with this inconvenience for me, but AAA has made it worse than going to the DMV.  Each and every clerk at this location is incompetent, uneducated, and aloof. I should know, I've dealt with at LEAST a dozen. Go to the DMV.\n\nFor my very simple transaction, I've had to return to this location 7 (yes that is SEVEN!) times, and it still is not resolved. They've forgotten to request the title from my lien holder, issued the wrong plate for my vehicle, neglected to inform me of steps required by the state... I mean seriously, why would you pay $36 for EACH visit, just to get it wrong. Go to the DMV!\n\nWhy did you return there if you were so unhappy, you might ask.  Well once you begin the process at one branch, you cannot transfer to any other branch. (We went to Monroeville to transfer my wife's car and it took 30 minutes, ONCE.) Go to Monroeville, or cancel your AAA membership and go to the DMV!!\n\nOh, and 30 minutes? that's a dream... I'm waited between 45 minutes and 3.5 HOURS at the East Liberty AAA. Prepare to take the day of work... nay, the WEEK in order to complete any transaction at this facility. Go to the DMV!!!!\n\nIt has now been over 5 months since I started this process and it's still up in the air. they don't know what I still need to do, but they are happy to keep charging me to figure it out.  Save yourself hundreds of dollars and a weeks worth of lost wages and just GO TO THE DMV!!!!!!!! Yeah it might seem sterile and slow, but at least they aren't serial criminals. It'll be over with like waking up from a bad dream, instead of the reoccurring nightmare that is the East Liberty AAA.\n\nOh, and if you think this is a harsh review... Call their number, 412-365-7196. 9 times out of 10 it just rings and rings.. once I timed it for more than 30 minutes before I got an answer (with no apology).  If you are in the AAA, you'll know I'm calling.  It's the constant ring in the background that NOBODY answers.", "business_id": "-raHHPz6kBnQgBH-oCuDFA", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-09-20", "type": "review"}

My husband made the reservation with a special they were having for a dinner date night.  With the special, they give you a few Pittsburgh restaurants to choose from and you get a $50 voucher to that restaurant.  When my husband called the Priory, they said they would make the reservations and call us back on the time.  We never got a call about the reservation time which was annoying.  But the main issue was we checked in, talked to the girl at the front desk about having the shuttle take us to this reservation at Meat and Potatoes, and she set us up with the shuttle.  We go in the room, look around for the $50 voucher, and it's not in the room so we assumed (i know we should never assume) that it was taken care of with Meat and Potatoes when they  made our reservation.  We had a fabulous dinner at M&P, great food, great service, and the bill comes.  We asked the server about this Priory $50 voucher and he had never heard about it so the manager comes over and says they didn't give them anything but to have them call and ask for him and he'll work it out.  We called the Priory and told them this, the girl who answered gave us an attitude and said you should have asked for it.  Then refused to call M&P to talk to the manager.  She just said to pay the full bill and we can work it out when we get back to the hotel.  We gave the manager our phone and he was yelled at as well about this.  He took our word that the Priory would deliver it to him the next day and he deducted the $50 from our bill.  It was embarrassing and it wasn't the issue with the money, just the service with the priory.  This showed us two things: We won't be going back to the Priory due to the lack of service and lack of respect and we WILL be going back to M&P because their service was impeccable.", "business_id": "hBAcj7X5JHeX2hvmptwH-w", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-09-17", "type": "review"}

We needed to find a place not too far from Heinz Stadium for a reasonable price. We paid about $90 per night for this place, and the experience started poorly. We walked in and the two lobby TVs were tuned to Judge Judy (for the front desk employee's viewing pleasure). Employees watching reality TV during business hours really puts me off. It was hard to get the attention of the front desk staff because they were in the middle of a pizza order.  Two of the staff was working the front desk with a third suggesting toppings. It was pretty funny as one of clerks started to set up our room while another on the phone to the pizzeria kept interrupting the process with pizza questions. To the side the third clerk assisted with the pizza order. My wife pointed out her extreme cleavage, but I did not want to get lost there. We had a hard time understanding our clerk setting up the room. She tended to mumble, but did assert herself better when responding to pizza order questions. We finally got our room and headed up the very scary elevator to the 4th floor. In a way I felt as if we were at some sort of slum. I kept looking for gang tagging. The room was adequate (and I believe this was a renovated room), but a Motel 6 would be an upgrade. Whoever is doing the renovation has really poor taste and the quality of work is terrible. The swimming pool was a swamp (I am not kidding), but I am sure the frogs living in it were having a good time. The next morning we went down to the front desk again. This time the morning clerk was on a personal call and gave me an angry look because she felt that I was interrupting her call.  She did not even hang up; she just put the phone to her side, answered my question, and then continued her conversation. \n\nPersonally, I think this hotel would be great for a horror movie and Hollywood should contact this place. It needs to be knocked down, or management should tighten up the staff and improve construction quality. If construction is on track (and I suspect something is wrong), get staff that really is gracious to customers. There are people that need jobs out there and I assure you with proper management they will do a great job. Don't stay here for over $45 per night (the price is due to the breakfast offered). Personally I would not stay here until they fix the place, but for some reason I don't feel that it will ever happen. Something just feels wrong. Perhaps Clarion has stopped the remodel due to the economy.", "business_id": "Ml6Up5SH9GbJQ8oyIJsj_g", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-10-20", "type": "review"}

Between the winding bus routes, the inability of buses to show up on time, and the outrageous money spent on retirement plans, it should be disbanded.  The city needs to take over and reconfigure the entire system.  The Post-Gazette has printed some great pieces that explain how the system could be overhauled.\n\nI've been a bus rider since birth (I still never drive), and it's only gotten worse over the years.  Some routes are great (outside of rush hours), others are ridiculous, and some good routes were recently cut.  Until transfers are free (which they should be within an hour window, in my opinion), it was insane to cut the 500, which added $10 a week to my bus tab just to get to work.\n\nIt is usable?  If you don't care about being on time.  I shouldn't have to show up 10 minutes early to catch a bus that should be coming by every 20 minutes according to the schedule.  I shouldn't have to stand in the middle of downtown traffic to flag down the 28x Airport Flyer when I'm standing at the stop and have an enormous purple suitcase.  When I'm going to work, I look up when I should be arriving...And then go back 1-2 time blocks to make sure I'm on time since I can't trust the bus.\n\nBus riders understand not all buses use the exclusive bus lanes, but maybe Port Authority should build the delays that happen every day into the schedule.  For example, there is not a chance that an inbound 71B takes a similar amount of time during the morning rush hour as it does mid-day.  I know this from experience.  Why doesn't the schedule know this?\n\nThe buses are so bad that now that I am two miles from work, I walk to and from every day.  In fact, I often BEAT the 71B home.  That means as I stroll two miles down Fifth Avenue, not a single bus passes me.  On the busiest section of the busiest non-highway street in Pittsburgh (data according to me).  How is this possible?\n\nFinally, we live in Pittsburgh.  It's cold or raining or miserable most of the year.  I would gladly take fewer stops in exchange for heated bus shelters.  It would also be nice if these imaginary shelters could have bus arrival information.

The liquor selection was not extensive, although the wine selection was.  The hotel lobby I liked because of it's style.  It reminded me of rome, with a stairway up to the second floor with an overlooking balcony onto the lobby.  It was not very large, but it sufficed.  The room's were very descent because they had high ceilings and the river view was incredible.  The room service food is not all the great, and the work-out facilities are sub par.  I worked out at Bailey's next door, complimentary of the hotel, and it does not even come close to the L.A. sports clubs that are attached to Ritz-Carlton's.  After I worked out I ordered breakfast in the room and then got a house list of the wine's that were offered.

After reading the great reviews and hearing how classy and elegant it was, I was excited about checking in here for a two night stay. The front desk did offer me an upgrade to a large room with a great view of the river. Unfortunately, this was one of the only things great about the room. The telephone on the desk did not work at all and the bedding left a bit to be desired. An intermittent buzzing sound in the bathroom was so annoying I had to keep the door closed and the toilet did not flush properly. \n\nThe staff at the hotel left much to be desired. When I originally checked in and went to my room, I realized they had not provided me with my platinum upgrade. I called down to the front desk and was told they would have to check what was available and call me back. They did, then sent a bellman up with the keys. He handed me the keys and off he went, never asking me if I needed help moving from one room to the next. During my stay, I was expecting a FedEx delivery; when I checked the tracking number online to see where my package was, I discovered the hotel had rejected the package. Calls to the Fedex and then to the front desk and the package's sender were made and several hours later, the doorman arrived with the package. Oops - I guess it is a good idea to check before simply rejecting a delivery. To the hotel's credit, the manager did call and offer to send up an amenity or bottle of champagne for the mix-up and the delay of my departure by several hours. I thanked her but declined; several minutes later, hotel security was banging on the door asking me why I had not vacated the room. Wow. \n\nOne of the main reasons I stay at Renaissance Hotels is because they are known for being upscale establishments with a modern feel.

Not knowing much about Pittsburgh I read some reviews and settled in on the Renaissance for this special weekend...and was not disappointed. \n\nThe focus of our trip was a Cirque Du Soleil show at the Petersen Complex but I wanted to be central to everything so we could explore the town. The Renaissance is well located downtown. It is a short walk to Market Square, the Cultural District, PNC Park, Heinz Field and the light rail which take you to Station Square and the inclines. \n\nThe architecture of the building and lobby really was a draw for me. I love the old turn of the century style with the large arch facing the river. The lobby was a spacious cathedral ceiling-ed area with contemporary styled furnishings. You definitely felt like you were stepping into a hip upscale hotel.\n\nWe were permitted to check in about an hour early without any problem. I had requested extra pillows and a high floor with a river view. Both of these requests were accommodated. We were placed in a huge corner room with incredible view of the North Shore and Allegheny River. If it were baseball season, I could've watched a Pirates game from the room. \n\nThe room was what I would expect out of a 4 star hotel. The bed and pillows were perhaps the most comfortable I've ever slept in...and I usually prefer a firm bed. The bed was just soft enough while still being firm. The linens were soft and inviting. The bathroom amenities were Aveda and high quality. The shower had good strong water pressure. We were provided a K Cup like coffee machine in room and an iPod dock. Being that we were in a corner room, there were windows all around so light poured in. However there were curtains provided to block out enough sunlight and prevent prying eyes. Free wifi that was actually quite fast was a huge plus. There is a mini bar in the room which we did not use but seemed relatively reasonable...for a hotel mini bar. There is a convenience store across the street and a drug store and liquor store a block over so no need to frequent the mini bar unless you plan poorly. \n\nI did not eat or drink at the hotel however I was very tempted. The bar downstairs, the Braddock, has an incredible bourbon and scotch selection, as well as a well rounded menu. There were tons of a places to eat nearby so we wandered the area. There is a Primanti's within a 5 minute walk in Market Square as well as number of ethnic eateries on the same block as the hotel. The area surrounding the hotel is very walkable, however be warned that outside of the restaurants, everything in downtown Pittsburgh is closed by 9pm. \n\nWe parked our car across the street at the public garage and left it there in favor of cabs. We parked from about 1pm on Friday until 2pm Sunday for less than $20. The staff was helpful whenever we needed them. My wife had a cold and ran through a box of tissues every 12 hours. The staff provided extra boxes for us. Housekeeping was efficient and seamless. There was always a doorman out front and was happy to direct us accordingly or find us a cab if needed. Another small thing I noticed was that the elevators were lightning quick. Even on the 9th floor we never had to wait more than a minute for one. \n\nOverall I was very pleased with my stay at the Renaissance. The hotel and staff really helped make my wife's birthday weekend special by providing great service and accommodating all of our requests. This was my first trip to Pittsburgh and likely not my last so I will be returning to and recommending the Renaissance Pittsburgh.", "business_id": "A38wziZJdYoijhC5S6uWCQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-11-09", "type": "review"}

I brought my husband here for an early Christmas gift to see the Raiders @ Steelers football game (he likes the Raiders).  We were originally booked at Mansions on Fifth Saturday and later decided to book an extra night Friday so we could have a long weekend in town.  I booked Friday for the Renaissance.  Luckily for us, we had a mixup with the booking when we booked through a third party at the Mansions on Fifth for that Saturday and Booking.com ended up coming through with the win by helping us get booked for Friday night as well at Renaissance in a very nice room!  So we ended up staying at the same hotel both nights and it was just a few blocks from the Heinz field.  Both rooms we stayed in that weekend were beautiful, had large windows, and views of the river and baseball field.  The second night's room was definitely much larger, more windows (on two sides of the room since we were on a corner) and had an AHHHH-MAZING view of the river, baseball stadium, and football stadium.  Honestly, the rooms and decor in the hotel (including the marble lobby) really made this hotel stand out.  The service was great too.  We didn't end up getting room service since we wanted to try out restaurants in town but the service at the front desk was great.  I could not recommend this hotel more if you are staying in Pittsburgh, whether for a sports event or a show (there were so many theatres in that area including one attached to the hotel).  We listened to other reviewers and didn't do valet.  I called the hotel a week before asking about parking and they told me about the much cheaper city parking garage literally across the street from the hotel entrance, so we did that.  It was very cheap and we never used the car while staying there so that helped.  We walked to the strip district (also a mile away) to eat and there are a ton of restaurants nearby, including in the market.", "business_id": "A38wziZJdYoijhC5S6uWCQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-11-12", "type": "review"}

Granted, November is still usually a little early for snow, but looking at the weather forecast a week before the conference and seeing at least 3 days of snow did not exactly make my day!\n\nBooking my stay at the Westin Convention Center however, made things SO much easier.  They've got a covered sky-bridge directly connecting to the convention center from the 2nd floor.  No need to even put on a heavy jacket to go to your conference.  Everyone else is coming from around the city and bundled up and then has to carry their coats around all day (or check them if the conference is well staffed enough to offer this).  But being connected to the Convention Center I could just stroll across the bridge and right into my sessions.\n\nRooms were well appointed.  Beds were comfortable and the double showerheads were fantastic!  Toiletries were a little sparse.  ABSOLUTELY loved the free wi-fi.  So many full service hotels are charging for this these days and it is a HUGE pet peeve of mine to pay for a more expensive hotel and then to pay for Internet access on top of that.\n\nMy issue with my hotel room (don't know if it is true for all) was noise.  I was close to the elevator, but the door seemed particularly thin as I often heard people walking back and forth down the hall and talking.  I was also able to hear various building noises like running water, etc.  The walls between rooms seemed to be thick enough because I didn't hear other people talking or their TVs (or maybe there just weren't people staying in the rooms to either side).\n\nI enjoyed their room service breakfast menu.  They had a nice offering of healthy alternatives including granola, fresh fruit, yogurt, etc.  Delivery times were pretty spot on and the attendants were friendly and efficient.\n\nAnother big plus for the hotel is that it is connected to the Original Fish Market.  Good sushi, GREAT clam chowder and some other delicious fare.  There's access into the restaurant from the hotel's lobby and it is open until 1am for those late arriving West Coast travelers.", "business_id": "bWWrrsPWuoHuAGUCgH8Tyg", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-11-22", "type": "review"}

Close to all major attractions and never more than a couple blocks or a short cab ride away.  The green program was a first for me.  It was a little annoying in that the light in the bathroom kept turning off because I kept forgetting to stick my key card in the light switch.  The funniest aspect of their \"green\" program was the dual shower heads. There is a sign in the shower that reads something along the lines of \"we have provided two shower heads for your comfort. However one remains off to save water unless you turn it on.\"  Now... I don't know about you but I feel if they are trying to achieve some level of green why even bother to put an extra shower head in?  Not to mention if there is a second shower head available to use, I'm certainly not going to pass on it in order to save some water. I know it's not very supportive of going green but come on! \nThe next time I'm in the burgh, the Westin is where I'm staying.

We booked the hotel at a great rate on Hotwire.  Knowing fully well what we were getting ourselves into by perusing their website (what's in the neighborhood, price of parking, restaurants in the hotel, amenities, etc.), we were a little bit afraid that since the hotel was next to the convention center, that perhaps the hotel stay would feel too \"corporate.\"\n\nBut, this was not the case at all.  We felt so at home in this room.  We were on a high level floor (Starwood Preferred), and our large hotel window overlooked the rivers and the ballparks.  We even got to see fireworks the night we arrived!  I had called ahead to let the hotel know that my husband and I also were coincidentally celebrating our anniversary that weekend, so we were welcomed by a complimentary bottle of champagne and a plate of chocolate covered strawberries.  SOOO delicious, and SO good after a long day of flying across country.\n\nThe hotel charges $24/night for valet, which was worth it.  Self-parking is only a few dollars cheaper every night, but it really saved the long haul of luggage and having to walk with tired feet coming home late every night.  And the valet crew was outstanding.\n\nAnother perk is that there are two restaurants in the hotel.  One of them closes late every night, so there was no lack of food or drink any minute of our stay.  The additional bonus is that Downtown Pittsburgh is pretty hopping and busy, and being so close to many great restaurants and theaters, there is no shortage to all the fun and interesting things within walking distance of the Westin.\n\nAnd, to me, the best thing of all of the bed!

I was in town attending a conference at the convention center so along with how great everything looked, you couldn't beat the location. \n\nHowever, I had the absolute worst hotel experience at the Pittsburgh Westin. I am a Starwood Preferred Guest member and up until now have had great experiences, but this one was so bad it really makes me question the integrity of the brand and I am hesitant to stay at another Starwood establishment. \n\nEven tonight as I try to log into my SPG to see if my points for being \"conservative\" with the room were updated, I can't logon to the site as \"The system is temporarily unavailable.\" I should also note I have photographs of everything, because I couldn't believe how bad the stay was. \n\n1. The terrible experience happened before I even arrived. When I googled the hotel, accusations of bed bugs appeared on both Yelp.com and Bedbegregistry.com - and the hotel had yet to take the time to respond. A simple detail that if someone was paying attention they would be able to resolve. \n\n2. I arrived at the hotel after a 7+ hour drive only to find out that the bathroom in my hotel room was broken. After two calls to Guest Services, about 30 minutes later a maintenance man came by, and it took him about 15 minutes to fix it. So a total of 45 minutes before I could use the rest room after arriving. I had suggested to Guest Services on the second call that they move me to a new room and it was awkwardly laughed off. \n\n3. After using the restroom (finally!) I noticed the tub was dirty and there was mold on the top of the shower by the rod and on top and inside the mini-fridge. The mold was \"new\" so it could have easily been wiped off and taken care of if the room was being properly clean and attention to detail was paid. The fact that the hotel lacked the ability for such simple house keeping was surprising. \n\n4. The paint in various places of the room was chipping and some of the furniture, most notably the side table were knicked and scratched badly. \n\n5. Because of the bed bug reviews, I stripped the sheets to look for evidence. I did not find any, but did become aware of many brown and black tar stains on the sheets that were tucked in to the mattress. \n\n6. I begrudgingly ordered room service because of how late it was by the time I got settled. I ordered the Turkey BLT with lemon aioli and arugula salad. Instead I got cold, what-seemed-like-day-old deli meat, burnt bacon with a thin, thin layer of mayo, not aioli. The arugula salad did not have 1 piece of arugula - it was mixed greens with shredded carrots instead. When you read the description and look at what I actually received, it is very, very disappointing. \n\n7. The coffee pot in my room leaked all off, wetting the sugar, napkins, etc. \n\n8. They charged the wrong credit card after both myself and my office manager telling several different people which card to charge. I had booked the room on a corporate card, and my office manager had believed she straightened everything out at the front desk that they were to charge the card on file because I would not have the corporate card with me. The first thing I was asked by the front desk was for a credit card. After I explained the situation to the front desk, they insisted that the card on file would be charged and they just needed my card for \"incidentals\" - after back and fourth I gave in and gave them my card, assured it would not be charged. Then when I checked out two days later, I once again confirmed that they would charge the card on file and they still charged the wrong one.

Thankfully, my experience with Courtyard Pittsburgh Shadyside was the former.\n\nMy first reaction was, \"Wow, this room is huge.\" For $179 a night (part of a wedding room block, so unsure if this is discounted or not), we got a queen bed with a nice sized living area (couch, chair, coffee table, desk, etc.), and a balcony overlooking the city. The bed was situated in such a way that it has you looking straight out those sliding glass doors once you're all tucked in - a really nice setup for a Courtyard. And above all, super clean. Even the wi-fi was fast and free, and therefore, fantastic. I was impressed.\n\nSo much so that I can more or less forgive the slew of minor annoyances/inconveniences/nitpicks/whathaveyou. They are, in no particular order:\n\n- No room service and the food court-type restaurant in the lobby holds limited operating hours.\n- Despite the size of the rest of the room, you've got tight quarters in the sink area outside the bathroom. Ladies, before you get all dolled up, you've been forewarned.\n- Slow. Ass. Elevator. My. God.\n- Busy, construction-plagued intersection surrounding the hotel.\n- Mandatory valet. This place is nice, but not nice enough for mandatory valet. Just sayin'.\n\nAgain, these bullets should be taken with a grain of salt as the alternatives are more \"nice to haves\" rather than \"musts\" when checking off boxes for prospective hotels. At least, for me. As you can see from the rating, the good here more than outweighed the, well, not bad - let's just say, slightly annoying.\n\nIf you have reason to stay near Shadyside versus downtown, this is your hotel. But hey, if you have business downtown and just wanna stay here anyway, have at it - the hotel has a free shuttle to bring you there, if you're so inclined.

It's located on 5th Ave right by the college with shopping on Walnut St. just two blocks away, and a ten minute drive to downtown.  Great safe location! \n\nUpon your arrival they greet you with a goody bag full of candies, muffins from Paddy Cakes in Bloomfield, rice Krispy treats, juice, and crackers! What a nice touch!  We arrived two hours before check in and they were kind enough to get us in early.  The girls at the front desk were very nice and helpful.  They even checked on us after we got settled in to see how we liked the room.  \n\nOur suite was nice and roomy.  It could've used a little more loving when it came to the cleaning and remodeling but still much better than staying in a cramped hotel room with three other people.  You get one parking pass per room.  You can normally buy another pass but they were sold out due to the Notre Dame Pitt game.

I have been traveling to Pittsburgh for business and staying at the larger hotel chains which were just ok.  This place was so much nicer and friendlier.  It's a hidden gem for sure.  It provides amenities that you would expect of a chain hotel including free wifi and direct TV and free on site parking.  However, no hotel has the personal touches such as the friendly staff of Sean, Whitney and Chef Winston (who will make your custom breakfast to order).  And this place even has a small movie theater.  \n\nAt first glance, their web site appears that this mansion is better suited for weddings and the like.  While it does appear to be ideal for those types events, it's a great place to stay for business travel when you are tired of the hotel chains.  It was also less expensive than the major chains in the area.  This place works for business travelers looking for the comforts of home.  It's a great location within walking distance to Walnut Street and its restaurants, pubs and shops.  \n\nThere is no hotel bar to hang out in or room service or a fitness center, but I found that the rest of the amenities and comforts of this place make me not care or even need those things.  They call this place a \"bed and breakfast\" but it is the nicest, most impressive bed and breakfast I've ever seen.  I will be staying here for all my business travels to Pittsburgh.

My only objection is that when you spend 30% more to stay in a Bed and Breakfast, you expect a little bit extra. This was sorely lacking.\n\nSome background: I arranged this as part of a secret date for my wife and I. When the mansion called to confirm the reservation, I asked what special things could be done for our arrival, and was promised a callback the following day which never came. I never followed up either, and really let it go as a miscommunication.\n\nSo we arrived at the hotel, and checked in and were shown to our room, which was on the third floor. First thing I realized is that there's no bathroom in the room. The reservation states that a \"full bathroom\" is part of the room (which you'd expect), but come to find out it's in the hall, which means every time we want to use it we have to dress, and head down the hall in order to get into the bathroom. Thankfully the bathroom is private, but none-the-less this is frustrating.\n\nI had also read online that there is a movie theater on site, with an extra large screen, and that it's available for renting and using. However, when I asked about it, I was told \"oh, I don't have a key but you can use it tomorrow.\" Since we were staying one night, this was a major disappointment.\n\nThe last straw, though, was a mixup about breakfast times. Since we were returning home with a time schedule, we had to leave fairly early. The guidelines given us at check-in stated breakfast started at 8 am, but when we went downstairs in the morning there was no one to be found. Come to find out from the chef that breakfast doesn't start until 9 am on Sundays, a fact nobody bothered to mention! Chef Winston saved the day, however, by serving us right away and getting us on our way home, which is the reason the inn gets as good a review as they've gotten.\n\nFinally, about halfway home my phone rings and it's the Inn. Thinking perhaps I've forgotten something I answer, only to find out that they had misplaced the room keys we had given back when we checked out, and they wanted us to double check that we didn't still in fact have them. The keys were eventually found, at the inn, but the lack of professionalism and organization in something so simple as keeping track of keys really was a turnoff.\n\nIn all, if you need a bed to sleep in this place doesn't hurt, but the price coupled with the lack of amenities would make me look elsewhere.", "business_id": "Ump9ZR6bsyXnHgxWCxcHxA", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-11-21", "type": "review"}

I put a $4,000 down payment for a wedding at the Mansion via telephone and requested a refund 3 days later. When touring the facility prior to that time, the Mansion did not inform me that the down payment was nonrefundable.  I never signed any paperwork that stated the money was nonrefundable, namely the contract that was sent to me after the down payment was made. I was also not told that the money was nonrefundable when the down payment was authorized over the phone. The Mansion would not return any of my phone calls after the refund request was made and responded minimally to my emails. They would only refer me to a \"Payment Schedule\" that was enclosed in the initial tour information packet, which they claimed stated that the money was nonrefundable, afterward openly acknowledging that they made a mistake in not realizing that this was not in fact stated on the cited form. The Mansion did not respond to inquiry by the Better Business Bureau on my behalf, to the investigative attempts of the Attorney General, or to the informal resolution attempts of the attorney that I had to secure. After six months of legal suit, they randomly decided to refund me the full amount minus $200, without notice and with no reason given.  I am now stuck with attorney fees, not to mention the hours wasted.  I do not understand why a small business that survives on referrals would conduct themselves in such an unethical and extremely unprofessional way.  No services were rendered, aside from giving a brief tour of the facility and running my credit card over the phone (which certainly doesn't warrant a $4,000 fee).

If you're going to the bar, THEN you hit \"Lobby\" and end up at the bottom of the hillside, which is still elevated above the access road. Sounds a bit convuluted, but it's not that bad.

First we checked in after trying to park for seemingly forever (we noticed on the way out - that the sign directing you to the parking deck is only posted on the way OUT of the property - not on the way in so when you come in late and it's dark, you'd never see it!  Room was decent - no complaints for the cost.  We went down to the restaurant to get a snack for my daughter and a glass of wine for me... it took FOREVER!    Finally we got our order and were off to bed ... not!\n\nThere was a group in the room next too us who were talking loudly (almost screaming) and it all came through the door...Our mistake was not calling down to complain (which in retrospect we should have but we kept thinking eventually they would go to bed :(  Finally after 3:30 am it died down.\n\nWhen we went to tell the front desk what happened, the girl had this 'deer in the headlights' look and did express regret we had a problem.  I asked if we could receive a discount on our room and she checked with the manager and quickly came back and said no since we didn't call them about the problem :( but they could comp us a breakfast.  I relayed our story from the night and our feelings we didn't want to return (esp when we saw the line at the hostess stand) but took the voucher since it was that or nothing.\n\nThe restaurant was worse for breakfast.  We stood out by the hostess for at least 10 min and couldn't even get the hostess to let us know how long it would be before be seated.  Two other couples and us were all in the same boat. Hostess was totally overwhelmed. Walked back over to the desk and expressed out findings and she asked us to walk back over.  Long / short the line finally disappated quickly and we were finally seated only to find that there was only a buffet ... so the question that begs to be asked - why was there a line to begin with?!   There were tables and servers?  Bad planning and execution?  Why wasn't there a sign indicating that it was buffet or nothing?  \n\nHonestly, if we didn't have the voucher, we wouldn't have stayed after a walk through the buffet area .... The quality was awful... No plates for oatmeal, stale bagels, beyond runny eggs, undercooked sausage and no pancakes or waffles...\n\nOn an ancillary note, the hotel was swarming with middle, high and possibly college teams.  This didn't bother us since we've been on a dozens of these trips with our daughter.  The problem with it was that the management of the hotel seemingly didn't notice that they were totally booked and staff appropriately for the weekend.  \n\nFor $135+ for a room for the both of us - to stay 8:30 pm until 10:00 am - with all the problems we had with the sound control and service...definitely was not worth it.  The night before we were in the Penn State area and stayed at a Super 8 for a 1/3 of the cost and had a great night sleep and decent free breakfast.  \n\nIf we find ourselves back in the area ... would not stay here or recommend it.", "business_id": "U12GISjtUQ7j9KMJ0nfnDQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-09-25", "type": "review"}

Located in a convenient and bustling Charlotte neighborhood. Near the mall if you're into dinners or lunches at places like Maggiano's. The Phillips Place shopping center also boasts a Palm, a Dean & De Luca (why don't we have one of these yet in Atlanta??? Seriously.), a PF Chang's, and . . . some of the cutest little boutiques this little girl has ever found. Historically, I made myself decide pre-check-in if I was \"allowed to shop.\" It's that good - from Luna to everything else, so many tempting pretties, and right outside my hotel room door!\n\nThe type of service you'd expect from a busy and well run Hampton Inn, always good and reliable Internet service and a well-equipped business center if you need it - plus the whole place has an \"exterior\" that makes it look kinda like a mini White House.

[I will edit this when I get their names.] Love the smoothies in the AM! Also, when the Concierge Lounge isn't open for breakfast on weekends, they give you vouchers for their AYCE buffet downstairs. \n- Bellboys: very attentive\n- Location: right in the center of Uptown (in my opinion) and close to my work area. About a 5 minute walk to a central bus station and I believe the train station is nearby. Less than 10 minute walk to the Time Warner Cable arena and not that far from the Bank of America stadium.\n- Early Check In: has been granted every time I've come in earlier than check in time.\n\nAverage:\n- Clean & Decent Sized Rooms: not expecting too much here as I really just need the shower + bed \n- Gym: Cardio & weight room is decently sized (for a hotel). Their pool is a standard size. Yoga mats (+ space) are available.

I've only been upgraded to a room that's on a higher floor. Also, try changing rooms if you're given the rooms located underneath the concierge lounge.

When they're restocking the vending machine, you're going to have a hard time sleeping through that. \n- Occasionally, super loud people can be heard through the walls/doors (but this isn't really the hotel's fault...)\n- Occasionally booked solid during busy weeks in Charlotte (they host a lot of events and there's the annual basketball tournament)\n- WiFi: isn't free for non-Rewards members. Also, it's pretty slow for today's standard.\n- There were ~2 times where the fire alarm went off (not during the same stay though) for no reason (we were never told what happened).  \n\nUnexplored:\n- Parking\n- The other restaurant (not their breakfast room and not Champion's)...\n\nOverall: I always try to book my stays here if the rates are within my company's allowable ranges.

The look is very modern which I happen to love. It has a decent gym, which is also rare for a hotel. There is a very soothing bar area with live, gentle jazz music.  The staff are very professional in demeanor and friendly.  This COULD be an awesome place to stay. \n\nI experienced the following over two stays:\n\nI arrive 11pm, exhausted from travel, only to be told that the hotel is full.  The only room they have left to offer me is half a \"parlor\" room. I was given a SOFA BED to sleep on. I had made the reservation several weeks prior, with guaranteed late arrival. \n\nI get to the room and the electronic key does not work. I call the front desk on my cell phone and wait in the hall 20 minutes half asleep for a guard to show up. His key does not work either.  \n\nOk, this kind of thing happens sometimes at the best hotels, right?  \n\nI gave a shirt and slacks to laundry. That evening I receive someone else's underwear instead of my own clothes. \n\nI gave a pair of jeans to dry clean, specifying not to wash because they would shrink. Well the jeans arrived that evening no longer my size.\n\nA pattern develops.\n\nOn the third night, around 11pm a large heavy set man knocks at my door. He claims to be security but show no identification.  He wants to see my id.  Highly suspicious, I don't open the door and I slip my gym copy of my license under the door. Later he returns with police and insists I accompany them to the front desk. Later they apologize for the error.  What were they were thinking?\n\nA waitress in the bar area ignores several requests for menu and a drink over a 20 minute period. The bar area has maybe half a dozen customers at the time. \n\nA gym attendant wants you to sign in but has no pen. \n\nThe \"weather report\" button on the phone gives you a recording describing YESTERDAY's weather.\n\nEtcetera.\n\nBottom Line:  Stay here for the serenity and beauty of the decor, but you will need the patience of a saint!", "business_id": "4nFqPL-glgDm9v7bZptskQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2007-11-15", "type": "review"}

The doormen are always there opening the doors, I am always asked if I need help carrying all my ish, the breakfast menu is amazing ( I personally order the oatmeal - it comes with a sliced banana caramelized on top, and the mixed fruit - blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries!) , the breakfast buffet is equally good, and the staff are always smiling and thanking me for staying there. The beds are amazing and the dual shower heads is a major plus. The most amazing part about this hotel is when I come by at 5:45am on Monday they ALWAYS have a room available where I can check in to, drop off my stuff, crash for a few hours and get ready for work (avoiding the whole get ready in an airport bathroom shenanigans). \n\nThe only two reasons why this place isn't getting 5 stars is because 1) The gym only has three ellipicals, they are outdated and one has a TV which doesn't work (everyone else raved about the gym, maybe i just have high expectations) and 2) the room service dinner menu kind of sucks. The only thing worth getting is the vegetable quesadilla with chicken.

FOOD. The restaurant (Ember, Bar 10) is a pretty terrible and relatively expensive choice. Examples: Omelet = $18, and it is greasy, tasteless, and they used canned mushrooms; Breakfast buffet (the reason I got the omelet) is typically left to become stale and lukewarm; Dinner choices are typically salty (i.e. Fattoush salad) and greasy (i.e. sandwiches and burgers). I will say that the pancakes were excellent, but they are not the best (nor do they beat Hyatt's pancakes). \n\n2. LOCATION. While the Omni and other comparable hotels surround restaurants, shopping, and other area attractions, this hotels is 5 blocks from anywhere (even a pharmacy). Need I say more?\n\n3. SERVICE. No doorman, concierge has no good suggestion but \"Try Ember,\" and housekeeping seems to come only when you are in your room. On housekeeping, I am also quite sure they do not even vacuum as some cracker crumbs I spilled were still there TWO days later. They also tend to forget some essential (i.e. washcloth or soap). \n\nIf this were a cheap, sub-$100 per night hotel, I would manage. For Charlotte, which is not terribly in demand, this hotel should be spotless, sexy, or at least charming. It is neither, and for that reason, I suggest one try other hotels before this one.", "business_id": "4nFqPL-glgDm9v7bZptskQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-11-12", "type": "review"}

I stayed in a King Room, with a gorgeous view. My only complaint is that no matter what I set the temp to on my thermostat, my room was FREEZING. Other than that issue, I couldn't have been happier. The beds are SO comfortable. I took a trip to Charlotte alone, on business, and stayed in my room most of the time, while not working. My room was clean, elegant, and that bed! I guess they're called \"Heavenly Beds\"? It's true. Tons of pillows and clean, white sheets and blankets on probably the most comfortable mattress I've ever slept on. I wanted to take the bed home with me lol. Because my room was cold (I don't know why this room was so cold!) I was in that bed quite a bit. Their customer service is stellar, and although pretty pricey, their food is excellent. I ordered a late-night club sandwich, and it was perfect. The staff at the Westin Charlotte work incredibly hard to make sure you're comfortable, and have all you need for a pleasant stay. Check out is at noon instead of the hotel-common 11 AM, and an extra hour, or 1:00, is complimentary. If you are not a morning person (I'm so not a morning person) or have a late flight, this is a very nice thing.

The lobby is adequate, rooms are predictable and safe. If you love beige, you'll love the interior decorator's style. Views: Nonexistent (it is Charlotte after all, what are you expecting to see, suburbs?). Water was hot, beds are cozy and clean. I didn't see a single cockroach.\n\nLike any large metro hotel you'll see a interesting variety of people - business peeps for a conference, kids on a tour all wearing the same coordinated clothes, and random weirdos (like me). And of course on the right weekend when there is a game - lots of Cowboys fans. People watching is a sport in itself - all the tarted up ladies (welcome to The South y'all) and kids freaking out.\n\nLets talk about the bar. The first night I went I got served twice with STRONG drinks (negroni, then gin & tonic), and only $10 bucks. I'm gonna like this place, I thought - I wonder if the locals come here knowing the drinks are strong. But alas... the SECOND night I ordered a whisky sour and it was basically sour mix. When I subsequently ordered a double it came back with a shot floating in the top and... wait for it.... the charge was $24. Yep, you read that right - they charged me for TWO drinks (and for some reason added on a $2/drink charge). \n\nI asked for snacks, and they served me some peanut things that were wet. I guess the dish was still wet from the dishwasher. So it was soggy snacks.\n\nAnd finally, one of my drinks was served in a hot glass (straight from the washer??) So it's quickly melting and getting warm. Bartending 101 dudes. I knew the score because the night before a woman asked for them to repour her martini in a COLD glass. Apparently her glass was hot. At the time I was thinking - what a b*tch, but then it happened to me. Sigh.\n\nThey also charge for internet usage, because apparently the owners think it's 1995.\n\nI didn't stay at the restaurant. My friends said it was $26 for a breakfast buffet. Ouch.\n\nParking will add another $20 / night.\n\nThese little things added up. The Westin has this vibe of trying to be a nice fancy uppity hotel - people waiting to call cabs for you (we used Uber, half the price), and when my bill was emailed to me they called it a \"guest folio\" instead of a \"bill\".... all fancyshmancypantsy - but the thing is they miss the details like a competent bar, and they nickel and dime you for things like internet... in 2015.\n\nPros: Clean, predictable rooms, fast elevator, people watching.\nCons: Bar is hot mess, nickled and dimed for fees, beige.", "business_id": "4nFqPL-glgDm9v7bZptskQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-11-23", "type": "review"}

I believe the 5th dryer actually worked.  The one night we wanted to use the hot tub it was closed (looked like maintenance maybe).  The valet is wayy expensive, my friend stopped by for literally 10minutes (they didnt even move the car), and they wanted 12$ !!  The real reason I gave 4stars is because of one staff member.

In my experience the ultra-luxury hotels keep a respectful distance from the less-fancy brands. But if one of your hotel fantasies is to stay really close to a Ritz Carlton, Charlotte can make your dreams come true ... it's just gonna cost ya' a couple of Benjamins.    \n\nSee, the deal with all of the hotels at Charlotte City Center (Holiday Inn, Ritz Carlton, Aloft, Omni, et. al.) is that they are in very close proximity to one another and the City Center.  They are all within a 4 to 5 block range, so you are definitely paying for location.  But it's a good location if you're trying to take in downtown or you have pursuits at the City Center.      \n\nSo, about the Holiday Inn - I like the fancy, modern furniture in the lobby.  I appreciated that it is a very tall hotel and on the side where my room was, it looked out at an art deco office building. So it was amusing to watch the workers doing their work thing as I whiled away the hours at Le Holiday Inn.  \n\nThe room was comfortable and had some nice touches, including an ipod docking station, FREE wi-fi (which seems a bit scarce in Charlotte) and two types of pillows with helpful, little signs denoting them as \"Firm\" and \"Soft\".  I love it when my pillows communicate with me, so I know what I'm getting myself into.   \n\nThe hotel also has a feature that I have never encountered before.  On the roof - which also houses the pool - there is a painted \"track\" for aerobic activities.  I tried it out for running, but I found that an open rooftop on a cold, windy, and rainy day makes for an unpleasant exercise experience.  In my brief little jaunt around the track, I appreciated their thoughtfulness and decided that this feature is probably better for walkers than runners.  Nonetheless, I think it's the thought that counts.  \n\nOverall, I liked the room, had pleasant customer service experiences, and would be willing to stay there again if I went back to Charlotte City Center ...", "business_id": "Fi5sQxROyTLp5qDuYKz6bQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-11-30", "type": "review"}

There were a few customer service issues I had that I'd like to mention so that others are aware. \n\n1- I booked the block of rooms 3 months in advance via the 1-800 number on the website. I have a military ID and requested the military discount. I was given the discounted rate for all 5 rooms and was told I only needed to present my ID upon arrival. Unfortunately, when I arrived the girl at the check-in counter told me that I could not have all 5 rooms at the discounted rate, that I could only have two of them. I pitched a royal fit and 40 minutes later they gave me all 5 rooms at the rate that I was quoted. Bad way to start a fun occasion.\n\n2- I emailed back and forth with Tracy Bernstein about specifics that I needed for this gathering I was hosting (iPod player, Microwave, Fridge, Early Check-in). I was told these things would be ready and they were not. We never got the iPod player, Microwave or Fridge. Bad customer service, Tracy.\n\nNOW, I'd like to tell you about the wonderful things at Holiday Inn City Center. \n\n1- Very clean and modern. I loved the decor and it made great back drops for my photography.\n\n2- The rooms had adjoining doors which made it very easy for our guests to mingle.\n\n3- Jay Jay at the front desk was so friendly and helpful. He arranged a private limo service for us beautiful ladies for a great price. I've been told he has the \"hookup\" so make sure you get with him if you need anything special. \n\n4- Adam is the food and beverage manager and he was so good to me. He offered to bring a 6 foot table in to our room with table cloths for FREE. Are you serious? FREE? He even came by the room to make sure we got all that I requested and warn us about the no noise policy starting at 11pm. We very happily toned it down by that point. \n\nThe stay at the hotel was wonderful and the event was great.

So while we got a weekly bill and could see what was being charged, he just ended up passing it along to HR.  \nWhat do you get in a RI suite?  Queen bed, pullout sofa in the living room.  Maids come each day and change the linens if you put the little card on the bed, and change the towels that you put on the floor or in the tub.  They often forgot to leave me some dishwasher detergent, which maybe wouldn't have mattered for someone working most of the time and eating out but I did a lot of cooking.  So if you're the jobless plus one spouse or domestic partner in one of these scenarios, prepare to make a few front desk calls about supplies. \nNice things: complimentary beer and wing, fruit and cheese and other kinds of buffets throughout the week.  Breakfast every day.

I believe it also had an inside pool and a work out area, but we never saw either.\n\nAlso, this hotel is very near the Time Warner Cable Amphitheater (we were in Charlotte for a concert) as it was just a few blocks away.

There is also a full service restaurant and bar in the Lounge area of the Hotel.\n\nI will also give them a nod for their complimentary shuttle which will travel you anywhere in a three mile radius of the hotel. The dude driving the shuttle was very polite and curtious ... I'm guessing because he didn't have to stay or work in the Hotel itself.\n\nUnfortunately, that's where the good stuff ends.\n\nThe gym facilities are atrocious. 2 Treadmills, a recumbant bike, and an Elliptical machine with maybe 4 medicine balls littered around a room that measures 6 ft x 20ft, if that. A grotesque pool with a grimey bottom that on more than one occasion I considered drowning myself in to free myself from my mortal shackles and break free from this prison of a hotel.\n\nConcierge wasn't helpful at all -- when I arrived at the front desk and asked if I could score a bottle of water to use the gym, because I didn't feel like paying the $4.00 fee for drinking the Fiji water they had in my room, the guy at the front desk stuck up his nose and snootily informed me \"You can purchase water from the gift shop.\" Sorry buddy, at over $150 bucks per night, you can *give* me a water for the cost of... free. Also, what kind of idiot buys bottled water as a gift?\n\nThe in House internet is the slowest you will find. I'm a computer / IT guy myself and it is flagrantly apparent that this place throttles their bandwidth usage. Online Games of any type slow to a crawl, and streaming video sites such as Hulu or YouTube take forever and a day to load. This is the year 2010 -- we should have hover cars by now, but apparently its too much to ask for a sad excuse for a Hilton to manage their Internet Connection enough to let me watch the Keyboard Cat before dying of boredom.\n\nThe location is also horrible. Right next to the Nascar Hall of Fame ... and thats about it. Everywhere you'd want to go is located 1/2 mile or so into the city, so you have to take the shuttle to get anywhere. Without the shuttle, this place would be unstayable.\n\nAlright / Mediocre Rooms + Satisfactory Shuttle Service + Snooty Concierge + Horrible Gym Facilities + Atrocious Location = Don't waste your time. I saw a park bench a few blocks away that I will be living under during my next stay in Charlotte.

The Hilton Garden Inn Charlotte Uptown was booked for me, not by me, with all good intentions.\n\nAs a business traveler, I often get in late and must be up and out quite early, often as early as 5am.\n\nLocation is adjacent to major sports venue. Strike one. Urban center, so there is apt to be street noise that can permeate the rooms, and there was quite a bit of this - emergency vehicle sirens, loud auto sounds.  Strike two. The hotel is not well insulated from outside sounds.  The room doors and the rooms themselves are not designed to contain noise so it does not effect others.  I could easily hear even not loud conversations in adjacent rooms on both sides as well as guests speaking not too loudly in the halls, even after 1am.  I got precious few hours sleep that night!.  Strike three, and they're OUT was the obtrusively loud plumbing sounds.  When adjacent rooms used their facilities, whether it was the toilet, sink or shower/bath, I do not know.  I just know that it created a roaring sound in MY room.\n\nWhen I mentioned this to the desk person the next morning, she acknowledged each of my stated concerns, indicating that this is just the way it is at this property.\n\nIn addition, for anyone in need of ready and waiting cabs, this is another negative for this property.  I requested a cab pick-up for 5:50am, and was assured one would be there and waiting.  As you may have guessed, this did not happen.  Despite their best effort, no cab was there.  About 10 minutes later, one arrived, but it is somehow unsettling when one is on a tight schedule and relies on punctuality.  Of course, I built in some fudge factor so I did not go nuts, but if you need reliance on either waiting cabs at-the-ready or reliable pre-arranged on-call cabs, you might be sorely disappointed in what this hotel can assure.\n\nOn the plus side, their FREE Internet in the room was quite fast, measured at about 9Mbps down and up.

Location wise, this place is absolutely perfect. Uptown Charlotte is the center of the business district in the city and the Omni hotel is located right in the middle of it. This hotel is absolutely ideal for anyone traveling to Charlotte on business or if you want to be located in walking distance to dining and entertainment. Also, most of the buildings in uptown Charlotte are connected to each other via walkway, so you can easily commute around the uptown area directly from the Omni hotel.\n\n Now the rooms of the hotels didn't match the overall presentation. They were fine, but they were nothing special and even seemed a little dated. The lobby of the hotel is very nice, but the rooms were just ok. It comes with a nice plasma TV and there's a decent amount of space, but the beds weren't the most comfortable and the room looks about 10-15 years dated. \n\nThere's a bar in the lobby that is great. The bartender was awesome and hooked up a few special drinks that I asked him to make. It's a relaxed scene with comfortable chairs and couches spread through out. It even has a pretty good happy hour scene for a hotel bar. \n\nOverall this place is a great stay for anyone who desires to be in the uptown area.

My review is based on both my experience in the meeting rooms and an overnight stay in a guest room. \n\nFirst off, the hotel staff down in the  meeting rooms for our events were very helpful and did a good job providing everything we needed for our meetings, including a nice catered lunch.  The bathrooms, ballrooms, and meeting rooms were all clean and well appointed for our event. 4 stars for the meeting space. \n\nHowever, as some of the other reviewers noted, the guest rooms could certainly use some major updating, as this property is older.   As noted in other reviews, the place is a bit on the noisy side and you may need to use the disposable earplugs, which are stocked in the drawers beside the bed. There were quite a few loud drunk people in the hallway and you could certainly hear way too much noise while inside your room. However, if you are just crashing after a night of partying in downtown the noise may not be a huge issue.   What is a little scarier to me is the fact that I noticed a couple of bug-bites on my legs this afternoon.  I didn't notice anything during the night last night, but honestly, I had been drinking before crashing for the evening so it is not surprising that I didn't notice anything at that time.  Now, I did not see any actual bed bugs running around but seeing those bites on my legs today certainly makes me wonder.  Based on those factors,  I am going to say 1 star for the guest room.", "business_id": "QThlnQ7AvzZwXHKD5DjdCw", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-09-27", "type": "review"}

Years ago, before ever considering living in Charlotte, I flew through CLT on my way to Vegas (from Orlando).  I was very impressed by CLT's cleanliness, wide open spaces, and modern feel.  And we loved the look of having the row of white rocking chairs in the main terminal; it really created a friendly atmosphere.  My traveling friend and I both said, \"Why don't we fly through Charlotte more often?\"  Living here, now I understand why: unless you fly USAirways, you will most likely never fly through CLT.  USAirways has the monopoly on CLT and pretty much regulates the pricing on flights to and from Charlotte.  \n\nThe airport has a nice collection of restaurant options, but I've often had very early morning or very late flights and been unable to enjoy them because they don't operate on the same schedules as all flights.  The airport could use a few more stores to occupy your time, too, but I guess that's all part and parcel of being an airport.  At least they have some bookstores and a couple of Starbucks.\n\nA few things that the airport does have the capacity to improve on, though, are (1) the baggage delivery, (2) the services outside of security, and (3) parking.  CLT has THE slowest baggage delivery I've ever seen an any airport.  Expect to wait 30-45 minutes for your bag.  If there are two of us traveling, one waits for the baggage while the other gets the car.  That way, we're not waiting an hour and a half, only 45 minutes.  \n\nIf you're waiting at CLT for someone to arrive, there is NOTHING for you to do.  No restaurants, no shops, no nothing.  If their flight is delayed, you're out of luck, my friend.  You can wander upstairs to the ONE Starbucks, but then you have to fight the crowd of travelers vying for their place in line.  Plus, when you're waiting for someone, you get to wait near the baggage claim with no windows, depressing lighting, and a low ceiling.  How dreary.  And what a \"first impression\" that person gets.  Ick.  \n\nLastly, the parking.  While it's nice that you can pay to park there pretty cheaply compared to other airports (it's up to $4 a day now), you'll wait for shuttle service to and from the airport.  Allow an extra 30-45 minutes onto your time.  Holidays are insane; you're lucky to find any parking at all.  And paying more for closer parking doesn't mean you have any faster shuttle service, so you might as well park farther out.  Recently, I got to the airport and a sign said, \"All lots open.\"  However, when I got to the two main remote lots, they were both closed (even though I could see empty parking spaces).  There were no signs to the one open lot that I didn't even know existed (row \"Z!\"), but I happened to find my way there after trial and error.  I felt like I was parking in a field and I felt sorry for the person working the one toll booth there because they had no contact with civilization at all, no overhead in case it rained, and newspapers taped to the windows to allow some privacy and block the extreme sun from coming in.  Odd.  For a modern airport, the parking has a backwoods feel.\n\nOverall, I rate the airport high because it is much nicer than a lot of airports I've been to, but I had to take at least one star away because of the fixable problems they have.", "business_id": "3Q0QQPnHcJuX1DLCL9G9Cg", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-11-07", "type": "review"}

See, when I booked my virgin transatlantic flight (yes, virgin with a lower case v--as in, I was popping my passport cherry; not capital V, as in going on the airline), I needed an airport that wouldn't drive me batty with traffic.  As fun as it would have been to fly through a big name airport like JFK or LaGuardia, I think I might have regretted it.  In fact, on the return leg, I was even more grateful.  \n\nBeing a noob, I took to the interweb for advice.  I had read in some online travel blog about how I should book 3 hours between connecting flights for the first stop back on US soil to get through customs, get to the new plane, blah, blah, blah.  I read that Charlotte was well organized. My flight only gave me two hours and change BUT there was a later one on the same airline to the same destination if I should happen to miss my connection.  So I felt okay about it. \n\nWhen we touched down on US soil, the flight attendants made an announcement that a Lufthansa flight had also just touched down and that their plane was MUCH larger than ours and that we should head the heck out ASAP if we have connections to get. Panicked, we all made a run for it to customs but were too late.  Stupid Lufthansa people.  As we stood sulking in line, we realized how quickly the line was moving.  Customs agents throughout the room made sure that travelers were in the correct customs lines (\"US and Canadian passengers ONLY on the LEFT--EVERYONE ELSE ON THE RIGHT\").  They came through the line to make sure everyone in line had their documents and KEPT THEM OUT instead of tucking them in some side pocket of some suitcase somewhere only to waste time fumbling for it later. Finally, they segregated people into mini-lines for customs agents to be screened.  All told, we stood in line (behind Lufthansa even!) for just 15 minutes. Take that JFK.  \n\nI might even add that unlike most airport staff, the folks here even seemed to be a bit friendlier.  Customs agents smiled and played with babies.  Volunteers standing in corridors handed us free luggage tags.

Well let me tell you.  As a pretty well traveled guy who takes a pride in being comfortable anywhere, no matter how run-down or low-maintenance, and has thoroughly enjoyed sleeping in dirt-floor mosquito-net bungalows in Laos - the only way to possibly be comfortable here is to down a bucket of beer and pass out cold.\n\nYou want to forget you are staying here.

Holes in the sheets.  A 6-minute long airport shuttle that only leaves every hour.  It was a smoking room - and I don't smoke.\n\nNow you're not so surprised when the people who checked in before you checked out 15 minutes later.

We figured we would try it out so we called for the shuttle to come to pick us up because we had no place to stay. We sat out in the cold for 40 min when we were told it would take 15 min by hotel staff that helped us. Cold and exhausted we went back into the airport to see if there was another option. Nope.

I figured, it would be best to stay close to the airport so we didn't have to deal with the rush hour traffic. Driving in from the Denver area, I asked my girlfriend to look for a place close to the airport. She found this place on Google with very good reviews. I'm not sure why she didn't use TripAdvisor. Probably because I always tell her \"Google Knows everything\" lol. Anyway, we arrived and were greeted by a nice young lady and the place seemed fine. The lobby area was clean. We made our way to the room, which upon first glance seemed okay. The sitting area was a nice size and the kitchenette area was clean. However, as we made our way in, I noticed the musty odor that is mentioned in other reviews. I decided to look at some reviews and see if maybe we were the lucky recipient of a room that had not been renovated yet. After reading the reviews and comments from the manager, I figured this must be the case. No problem right? Sure, I called down to the front desk and said to the nice young lady \"I see in your reviews, the hotel is having some renovations done and it seems we have received one of the musty smelling rooms that hasn't been addressed yet. Do you have a room that has been renovated, that we can be moved to?\" Her response was, \"we have been doing some renovations, however not to the rooms. I don't have a nicer room that I can move you to. Sorry.\" Well, I said to my girlfriend, it's just one night and I don't feel like driving to another hotel. After sitting on the old, run down, uncomfortable love seat watching TV for a while, I said, we should probably move to the bed as it has to be better than this seat. So, we got ready for bed and pulled the comforter back to find sheets that must have been queen size because they definitely didn't fit this king size bed. Whatever, hey the bed has like six pillows on it and two extra in the closet. Great, not, the pillows were plentiful, however they're about half the size of a normal pillow. Okay, I'm tired of trashing the place. Have a look at the pictures (worth a thousand words.) I'm sure with some true renovations, this will be a decent place to stay. I would guess the very good reviews this place has received are the work of some reputation building company or maybe we did just receive one of the older rooms and they didn't want to relocate us.

One time the car they gave me has 67,000 miles on it and the Hertz employee wrote on the paper dents and scratches all over because there were so many.   Most of the counter employees are rude or cold and not helpful.  I asked why I don't get Carfirmation or find my name on the board, the lady just rolled her eyes and there was no apology.

Every other time I have had no issue doing this mindless walk to the car, but during my recent visit oh how times have changed.I walk out to the garage, no name on the board, and whoa....no cars in the garage. WTF!  Considering I just walked past about 75 people in line, inside, all I could think about was those people are SOL, cause there are no cars here. Where are the cars? I reserved this thing a month ago.  I go to the little gold booth area and they start the tap dance, blah blah, yada yada, oh your car is coming, they are finishing prepping it now.Just go wait outside there and we will bring it around to you. Waiting, waiting, waiting....finally here it comes and when they said prepping they were putting that mildly. This thing was wet from the car wash. We threw the bags in the trunk and thought lets get out of this place before they take the car back and give it to one of those poor souls in the line inside. I did get the Nissan Maxima just for comforts sake since I knew we would be driving quite a bit.By the time we made it to Hendersonville, NC, we knew something was really wrong with this car. It was pulling to the left and the passenger side door would not close properly. Upon further inspection, it appeared as if the car had been in an accident, because the door moldings were different colors.  There were sunflower seed shells all over the floor in the back and some under the drivers foot area.  But damn, these people rented me a wrecked, should not be on the road car. This car was not safe, but were 2 hours from Charlotte by now. I called to express my concerns over the car (had to leave a voice mail - 3 more calls and each time I had to leave a voice mail, they never pick up the phone) When I received my return phone call I was told that I could try and call Asheville Hertz which is not corporate to see if they have a corporate car they could switch out.  Now they want me to do their work, no way I am not doing that. I told the representative that they need to make the calls and arrange for a new car. So she agreed and said she would get back to me. Two hours later, I called and left another voice mail.  The representative finally called me back, and unfortunately I missed the call, but her message was \"I tried calling you but a man answered and said I had the wrong #\". Ok dumb dumb, that would mean you dialed wrong because my number is on my rental agreement and my voice mails. I'm getting pissed now.  Now there rest of her voice mail goes like this \" I could not get you another car, the Asheville location does not have any corporate cars, so I would advise you to call roadside assistance and have them tow you a car and switch the car out.\" Many expletives by me....@#$%^&*  Is this person kidding me. So just to put it on the record, I called roadside assistance to tell them this ridiculous thing that the Charlotte Hertz wants the to do for me and they were....\"we don't do that unless your in an accident or the car is broken\". During that conversation with roadside assistance you could tell that they knew Charlotte Hertz was just trying to dump me anywhere other than dealing with the issue. Roadside assistance agreed that the car should have never been in service with a faulty door, but unless the car was un-dberivable, they would not come to assist in this matter. I was fine with the outcome with roadside assistance, but I wanted it on record the stupidity that Charlotte Hertz wanted me to do.There was another gentleman at our hotel who also had rented from Hertz (probably in that long line I saw), and said it took him 4 hours to get a car. It seems that between FEMA renting cars to go to SC to help the flood victims and the Nascar race, Hertz was scrambling to get cars for customers who had already reserved cars. I was not going waste anymore time on dealing with this whole car fiasco until drop off. During drop off we were met with a fantastic customer service professional by the name of Tenille. I explained to her the situation and what had happened. She could clearly see that there was something wrong with this car. In less than 3 minutes she was writing on the windshield some Hertz coding to take the car out of the rental pool.  Tenille was extremely professional and apologetic about how this issued was NOT HANDLED.  I told her my most concern was that if I had been in an accident, I had no idea what the integrity of that passenger side door would have been, and she totally agreed. Tenille did a price adjustment to the rental of 50% which I am sure was probably her maximum allowed amount. I certainly appreciated her making the adjustment, considering my aggravation and valid concerns.", "business_id": "eThu9hCL8NOjOxswQ-cFSg", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-10-15", "type": "review"}

I wound up here and I think I'm officially done with Choice Hotels forever. I've never had a positive experience aside from this one Econo Lodge in Walterboro, SC.\n\nThis hotel is located in the middle of a vast array of garbage food restaurants. If you want to go to a grocery store, they're all 15 minutes away. While the hotel might be convenient to some attractions, it isn't convenient to things an everyday hotel guest would need or want unless you like McDonald's and Waffle House. Gross.\n\nThe beds are not comfortable at all and this hotel has resorted to using these god awful square 15\" pillows. Who the hell can sleep on a square like that besides a child!? It's beyond ridiculous and not to mention annoying to try and sleep on. Pair the lack of comfort with the 11:00 check out and you have one unhappy guest! I requested a late check-out time upon check-in as I advised I'd be working overnight. 12:30 was the best she could do as she made some kind of, apparently phantom note. The next morning at exactly 10:58, the phone rang and reminded me that I was scheduled to check out that day and that check out was 11:00. Blah, so much for sleeping inn at Sleep Inn.\n\nThe hotel is quite noisy as it borders I-77 and the immediate area isn't all that great. Noise from other guests was relatively nil though.\n\nThe mini freezer and mini fridge were nice, but it didn't make up for the overall room quality.

After 8 days of hearing this constantly in the evening and middle of the night (it will wake you up) i believe i have gone crazy and am at the point of yelling at people thanking them for letting it slam :)\nOther thing is the windows have zero insulation so people just hanging out by the pool having a quiet casual talk late at night will still bug you being you can hear them perfectly.\n\nStill keeping my 4 star rating due to how nice the staff is and value this place is.\n\n***And to the housekeeper that stole my snickers bar......

This was the week of the monster Nov storm that hit the east coast and I was exhausted from driving slow in the rain.  It was late and not being a NC native, I had no idea that I wasn't in the most favorable part of town.  Check in was smooth, though the front desk guys were not very friendly, but just doing their job.  \n\nOddly, the room was nicer than I was expecting and the bed was decent too.  I wasn't expecting this as I was jaded by my earlier experience at a filthy Quality Inn in TN.  After seeing some of the interesting people hanging around the neighboring rooms and driving in and out, I decided to empty my car completely.  I know, I sound like a snob don't I....well I checked out the crime blotter for the area on my phone and read that there had been a robbery in the neighboring parking lot which resulted in a shooting, a few days earlier.  So I made sure the door was locked.  Luckily it was pouring, and I think this disabled some of the regular activity that happens at this motel at night.  The TV kept timing out every hour, but other than that the room was decent for a motel.\n\nIn the morning as I was leaving, I was trying to pack up my car while holding my dog's leash.  I put him in the front seat with the door cracked, and proceeded to try and shove my guitar back in my trunk.  I was having some issues fitting it back in despite it fitting fine the day before.  In my frustration, I didn't notice the 2 meth-head looking guys walking towards me, babbling fastly about what kind of guitar I had, did I need help, \"Let me see it\", and about ready to grab it, as my new rescued swamp dog knocked the front door open with his nose and barked like a crazy dog at them.  They walked off pretty fast as their toothless hobo friends looked down from the balcony.  If it had not been for my dog, I would have knocked the guy in the mouth with the guitar case. \n\nI had also read that a few days earlier, up the street, a pregnant teenager was shot while sitting at a bus stop and died while her baby struggled for life in an incubator.  I didn't realize that Charlotte was such a shit hole, and I'll never go back.

The clerk at the front desk was very friendly and attentive when we checked-in and addressed us by name every time we went in or out of the hotel. \n\nThe room was spacious, well appointed and clean. \n\nSome of the appliances (full refrigerator, dishwasher, two burner stovetop and microwave) in the kitchenette were a bit dated, but they were fully functional and all of the other fixtures in the room were clearly updated within the past few years. The cupboards were stocked with dishes for two and all appropriate cooking utensils, there was also a kitchen sink and a roll of paper towel above it. \n\nThe kitchen had bamboo-like flooring, the bathroom was all tiled and the rest of the room was carpeted. \n\nThe built-in along the wall beyond the kitchen included a table and chair as well as a desk space and an office chair, there were some large drawers and the flat-screen TV was mounted in the corner. \n\nThe window was large and fully-operable (side-to-side); it also had a screen. It had decorative curtains, sheer curtains and black out curtains.\n\nThe bed had a nightstand and table lamp on one side and a floor lamp with a small table attached on the other, beyond the floor lamp was a comfortable recliner. Available  electrical outlets (as in not used by lamps, clocks, etc.) were easily accessible on both sides of the bed. \n\nThe bathroom (like the kitchen) was recently updated and included ample cabinet and counter space as well as a spacious bathtub/shower with a curved shower rod (to give you more elbow room).\n\nJust inside the door (technically in the kitchen) was a spacious closet.\n\nI know this is a lot of detail on the room, but when I stay in the hotel it's my home away from home and it's important that I'm comfortable... I was very comfortable at this Candlewood Suites and would definitely stay there again!!\n\nSide note: When we got out of the game it was almost 11pm, my boyfriend was hungry and ever place we passed was closed.

The owners said that they would leave the cabin key with the bar next door. That should have been a sign to us right there. Anyway, we arrive about 11:30pm, go to the bar and get the key as arranged. The waitress hands us the key and TV remote in a KOA bag and we go off in the night to find our cabin. We open the door and the smell of stale beer immediately hits us.

We both need to go the bathroom, so we head to the bathhouse. However, the doors are closed and locked shut.

The Sorenson room also offers a private bathroom with a claw-foot tub that is over 110 years old (but has excellent water pressure).  Shampoo, soap, body gel, bath salts (I think that's what they were), and even a hairdryer are all provided.  This was nice since we forgot a couple of those things.  \n\nFor the breakfast portion, we had a spinach and cheddar quiche that was the fluffiest damn quiche I've ever had.  Pardon my French! My fiance is a Vegetarian and it was extremely easy to make.  He also had a myriad of drink options.  Some ready to be poured, some in waiting.

Also, there was a delicious pear and cranberry compote for each of us. \n\nCraig and his beautiful (and friendly) dog joined us for breakfast and some wonderful conversation.

I complained about the management and received little compensation for all that had gone wrong. \n\nIn the 6 months it took to begin planning my wedding reception to briefly following the reception I had 3 different events coordinators. The first two were amazing, but they left for good reason, the hotel events department was barely a-float. \n\nThere's literally a list of things that went wrong, but the two most concerning: \n1) The hired serving staff (many from temp agencies) didn't do their jobs! \n2) One of the hired staff were high/drunk, and when he and others were asked for help by my family were giving them sass and they still didn't help. \n\nDuring the wedding, all I saw was how things were going wrong. So unfortunately, I didn't enjoy majority of my reception. When you spend all that time planning and spending $$$ and things are being executed half ass or not at all.. it's pretty distressful for an already stressed bride. I complained about this, but it wasn't until I got in touch with Marriott International that anyone called me back. They admitted they were going through many staff changes and apologized for the various incidents. \n\nWhen you spend about $14,000 for SOLELY service and drinks (we catered food). I expect top notch service. My overall bill still had the 22% service gratuity (which they deserved NONE of - which I argued). In the end they reimbursed me $990 which was half the service gratuity. I hate to be ungrateful but that's ridiculous. \n\n\nMy only reason to write this review is because I wish I had known that their events services had gone downhill in past few years. I held an event there in 2010 and the events coordinator at the time, Diana??, and the service were great. People plannng events here should ask the following questions: \n1) Are they still using temps and what experience/requirements do they have?\n2) If things don't go right (which they have someone from the staff on floor during your events - so they can see it themselves), how can they offer compensation or fix the situation??\n\nAt the end - the temps were what were blamed for all the awful service (not clearing plates - my family cleared plates, serving drinks in CANS - when i made it a point everything should be served in glassware, etc...) So that's who I would ask the most questions about. \n\nI hope that things change for the Marriott in the future. They used to be one of the best places to hold large scale events in Madison.

They live about 5 or so miles from the actual fest and because drinking and driving is never in style, they'd gone ahead and arranged a day in advance for 2 cabs to come pick our group of 7 up at their place of residence at 8:45pm. \n\nNow, this was my virgin visit to Madison at Halloween time so I wasn't quite sure what to expect, though I can't say I wasn't warned. I knew streets would be closed down and blocked off and this wouldn't be your typical Madison experience, but without seeing the Mad city madness first-hand, it was hard to anticipate just what we were up against when it came to our group versus on-time transportation on this hallowed eve. \n\nUnion Cab did miss the mark as far as sending the two cabs that we'd ordered more than a day in advance to arrive at 8:45pm. The first cab arrived at 9pm to pick up the first half of our group off at the fest, but when the first group arrived at said bar and realized that the second group had still not been picked up, they asked if that cab could go back and get us, ya know, since there was supposed to have been another cab there 30 minutes earlier anyway. But the driver said they were unable to locate the second cab and that it was against the rules to come back and pick up the second group who were still waiting since they were not the assigned cab. Makes very little sense, but at the same time is sort of understandable on such a crazy eve, but the reservation should've counted for something. \n\nWhen we (the second group still at the house) tried calling Union, all we got were busy signals being that it's one of Madison's busiest cab nights of the year. So naturally, we did the only thing we could... crack open another beer and wait and chug and wait and chug and wait. It was just before 10pm when our cab finally arrived. The driver was super fun, quirky and costumed for the holiday and quickly made us forget about how Union had failed to provide us with transportation until over an hour after the previously scheduled and agreed upon time.\n\nAlso worth noting, because it won Union back a lot of stars that would otherwise have been missing given the tardiness, is how immaculate the shiny, gleaming Toyota Prius cab was. It smelled divine, and not overpowering or like it had something to cover up. And -get this- it had cloth seats. CLOTH SEATS. It didn't smell like sh*t. ZERO crumbs. Sans stains. Not even a whiff of urine or vomit. Where the hell was I? Bizarro World, surely. \n\nSo, while I don't know that I'd trust Union as my chariot on a big day where I needed to be somewhere in a timely manner (ala the airport), they were plenty fine for a casual booze-bender and the amenities (no puke stains or pee smells) made the ride a pretty enjoyable one.", "business_id": "5TQQy_x_ArR3_5L5L0fFVQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-10-28", "type": "review"}

There are also a handful of amazing cats on the property that will gladly accompany you for a stroll on the property.  It's nice to hear that the B&B is also pretty sustainable.  All the food they make is pretty much from their farm/garden (fresh eggs, veggies) and anything that can not be grown on their property is from close by.

The driver did get caught up in traffic and was 20 minutes late for a 10 minute pickup, but we get that. Was nice getting to the game in the shuttle bus.\n- Staff generally friendly. We left an iPod in the restaurant, and the staff was really nice to call us at the room and let us know. But then the front desk was emphatic in saying they didn't have our iPod, only to take it around all of the folks drinking in the bar to ask if this was somebody's iPhone.

Also, When I checked in the lady was rude and said they were not allowed to put a rollaway in my room even though there was plenty of space AND I had already reserved and paid for it prior to arrival. (As a matter of fact, the reservation required me to reserve it because we had 6 people and it said the max to room was 5 without the rollaway.)  She then proceeded to tell me she called her manager and her manager told her the couch was the \"rollaway\" bed we reserved and argued with me when I explained that a couch and rollaway were not the same. Very rude girl, allowed her kids behind the counter even when she was not there with them. When a customer walks in the door, it is not a very good impression when the first thing they see is a boy approx 10 years old behind the counter. We were very tired when we came in and had to deal with this for 45 min. She finally agreed to bring the bed up, and when we received it, it was tied together with trash bags??  The hall floor was dirty with spots, and we didn't even bother with breakfast. I had to keep socks on my children because the floor was so dirty in the room.  When I received my bill under the door in the morning, they had added another rollaway on to my bill so it had charges for 2 rollaways instead of the 1. When we went to leave in the morning, the same lady was working the front again.I spoke with her about it and she said she fixed it. I asked for another receipt and all she had done was charge $10 less on our bill, and our bill was still showing we had a $10 balance for the other rollaway. At this point, I was done dealing with her and wasting my time. She said her manager would be there soon, so we went to eat and went back in an hour to talk to Que the manager. The front desk lady said Que had come and already left in the hr we were gone but would call me later. This was even more upsetting because we could have been on the road driving.

Let me start out by saying that the staff here was awesome! Very friendly and helpful. That is the ONLY reason I give it a two rather than a 1 star. The rooms were old and small. Yes, old building, charm, history, cool, but in the heart of downtown Phoenix in this modern age, you can update your buildings to keep the old charm and still allow for the enjoyment of modern conveniences. A hotel is a customer service oriented business and the building itself is crucial to the customers experience. Our room was very small but ok, could be livable with the right amenities. Very few outlets so tough to charge up computers and phones. None in the Bathroom! None! So I had to blow my hair dry in the other room. The bathroom had a huge sink but zero counter space. So what was the counter put my toothpaste, make up, hairbrushes and such on while i got ready? A toilet seat. Yup. No counter in the bathroom. It had the charm of an old place with the type of tile but so much of the tile was chipped and the paint peeling away from the walls it just felt old and dirty and run down. The drain in the shower didn't work well and I was standing in several inches of water while I showered. No room to room AC so you were at the mercy of how cool the people at the hotel wanted to keep the place. In AZ its 100+ all the time. I bet our room at night was 77 degrees or more. We were sweating and it made sleeping tough. We probably will opt for a more modern place just for the AC and clean feel next time and be willing to pay a higher price for it.", "business_id": "_yfprBETaYgySkKyl8ZWMQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-09-28", "type": "review"}

I asked specifically for a non smoking room and was told that all rooms were non smoking.  My immediate thought was, \"if all the rooms are non-smoking, that means that EVERY SINGLE ROOM is a smoking room.\"  When we got to our room, I couldn't tell if the room stunk or it was just a lingering of the lobby smell on my skin/hair/clothes.  Short on time due to an unscheduled but enjoyable stop at A & R Bakery & Deli in Blythe, we quickly changed our clothes and headed out to attend the event that brought us into Phoenix in the first place.\n\nAfter a wonderful evening with family, we returned to our room.  It was immediately obvious that we would NOT be able to sleep in the intensely smoky smelling room.  I could not even take off my shoes since the carpet had white crusty spots in between the beds.  (Don't even make me THINK about how that occurred or why it wasn't cleaned!)  I called the front desk and the young girl on duty was extremely sweet and apologetic.  She moved us to a new room which was MUCH cleaner and less stinky than the first.  If she hadn't moved us, or if the new room hadn't been so much cleaner, I think I would have just packed my poor mom into the car and made the 6 hour drive home!  \n\nMy advice to Phoenix visitors, avoid this place.  Smokers might not mind the stench, but non-smokers will notice the smell even in the \"clean\" rooms.  I was irritated that the dry clean only clothes I brought and wore only for about 2 hours to a family event had to be cleaned again due to smelling like cigarettes.

However the service was lacking quite a bit. \n\nFirst, when I got there I was the first to arrive out of my group, my event coordinator didn't get in that early and was not there to greet me or show me around, nor did anyone else bother to show me to the event room or how to get where I was going. I take that back, the girl at the front desk handed me a map and pointed me in a somewhat vague direction that didn't help much. I was told I would have easy access to the room to unload my car at, well without any employees to show me the access door I had to hoof my boxes from the parking lot around the building the long way. I did not find that back door until long after the seminar started. The room we were scheduled in was changed last minute for some reason, I believe  it has something to do with the final head count that we gave them. The room we ultimately in was a bit cramped for the number of attendees we had. \n\nI had to introduce myself to the catering manager and chef. No one came in to remove the places and trash from breakfast until almost 11 a.m. nor did they check on us. The boxed lunches weren't made right, only upsetting a few clients, but still.... I had to pop into the kitchen myself a few times and track someone down to help me. With the amount of money we were paying, it should have been perfect. For a cheap continental breakfast and a mediocor box lunch it was about $40 per head, kind of a lot. \n\nOver all my seminar went well at the hotel, but there were some behind the scenes issues that I really wish I did not have to deal with throughout the day. I wouldn't not recommend this hotel for you event, just make sure to cover everything prior to your event. Such as on sight contact, exactly how the food will be prepared, appropriate signage and whatnot. \n\n**I have not spend a night at this hotel so this review should not reflect on making overnight reservations.", "business_id": "LtJszEtHhXMZR0y6lbdswA", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-10-29", "type": "review"}

Part of my low rating is due to the air conditioner in the meeting room having a bad filter, such that some cool air was coming out the sides of it but not the center, and the room stayed warmer than it should have.  Shuttle service was par exellence and the staff was attentive and helpful, which is why I give the place two stars instead of one.  It's the many room problems which bring my ratings down.  They gave me a disabled access room which I didn't need, meaning there was a walk-in shower with a big wall-chair.  Thankfully, at least the air conditioner in the room worked well, and the pool area was nice and the grounds clean.  Biggest issue was that the door to the room did not close all the way automatically, and I came back one night to find that the cleaning staff had not shut it all the way.  Thankfully, none of my stuff was missing.  The bathroom door, on the other hand, was on a spring and tended not to stay open, so it took more time than it should have for the steam to clear after I showered.  Also, the bathroom door had a couple of holes in it, a bit damaged from the inside (not all the way through, but it did look bad).  And the lighting in the bathroom was also badly in need of an upgrade.  It was lit by the type of fluorescent bulb that flickers for several seconds before finally coming on part way with a steady light, and then a few more seconds for full light (which honestly wasn't all that great).   Therefore, I had to leave the light on all night because using the bathroom in the middle of the night would have presented a problem otherwise.  Add to this that both the cable service on the television AND internet access were intermittent.  When I tried watching in the evening usually only half of the channels had any reception.  As for internet, I had to re-sign in at least twice each day to get access, and even then it would periodically blink out before coming back on, I'd get \"disconnected\" messages all the time.  \n\nIf I ever return to the area, I'll be choosing another hotel, as there are plenty around the area within walking distance to this place.", "business_id": "CfzoA3TQ8YQcFTOncJFbQQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-10-12", "type": "review"}

The staff was very friendly, especially the front desk. I greatly appreciated it after having had a stressful flight to Phoenix from Boston after a few delayed flights and cancellations on the part of the airline (I won't mention their name since they're usually pretty good). The kind lady who checked me in was patient in dealing with me when I had to call my credit card company to clear a charge freeze due to traveling.

I was greeted immediately, there was adequate staffing to handle the number of people. They did the walk-around on the car I rented for two weeks, a VW Passat.

First, the 12V outlets in the car were non-functional so I could not charge my phone for navigation on the road and had to stop frequently to recharge. My timelines didn't allow for me to mess around with Enterprise for a replacement car, but it was very annoying. Also, the car's seat belt warning light would come on for no reason and beep, even though I was wearing a seatbelt. Eventually, I latched the passenger seatbelt and it stopped the problem, but there was nothing on the passenger seat to have caused the warning to go off. Regardless, the car performed as otherwise expected. I explained the problems upon returning the car and they were immediately responsive to resolving my problem with a fair accommodation.

The extra cost for parking was a bit ridiculous. It should be included in the rate, however it was only $12 to self park. Also we used the hotels free shuttle to get us to an event but the shuttle stopped running at 10:30pm and our event started at 10:30pm so we ended up taking the light rail back which is just a very short walk from the hotel.

Front desk receptionist was great and accommodating to a late check out for us. Overall it was a great hotel and we would stay there again! The reason it gets only 4 stars is because of the extra parking fee and the shuttle not running after 10:30.

I didn't have a car, so the parking lot didn't bother me, but the area on one side of the hotel was sketchy and had a fair amount of undesirable foot traffic. The nearest station to get on the light rail was 3 blocks either way from the hotel.\n\nUpsides: The staff was friendly and super-helpful in recommending EXCELLENT restaurants, including hole-in-wall, genuine Mexican joints. The hotel has a shuttle van that will, if you reserve it or can snag a ridealong, take you anywhere within five miles of the hotel for free, and then pick you up again. Naturally you should tip the driver (also a great guy), but it still beats taking a cab. The driver gets bonus points for letting us jump out and grab a coffee on the way to our destination!

We had 2+ days of trainings in their conference rooms and 5 meals here.   \n\nHotel service: PERFECT. Its what the Ritz gets its reputation for and this Ritz does not disappoint. They open car doors, take out your luggage and bring your luggage to your room without expecting a tip.  In the conference area, the servers clear away your plate or drinks almost immediately once you finish. If you need a special accommodation - I asked for grated cheese during dinner - someone is close by to happily help you. The bartender walks the room once you sit down for a meal and asks if you want refills - and she remembers what you ordered! We ate a couple of meals by the pool, which is separated by a gate with a funky lock system. Every time I left, someone would notice me leaving and run over to open the pool gate for me. Attentive service is so wonderful!\n\nRooms: Not the nicest furniture I've seen - wood looks a little shoddy - but the bed is comfortable.  I love the turn-down service in the evenings, where they remove all the pillows and prepare your bed to sleep in and also bring you two bottles of water.  They also have a full coffee and tea bar with about 4 bags each of coffee and tea and a mini coffee maker that pours the hot water or coffee directly into your paper mug.\n\nToiletries: All Bulgari. Awesome.\n\nFood: We had a break between meals that included tea and coffee and a bunch of accoutrements like chocolate chips, whipped cream, cinnamon sticks and flavored syrup. Coolest coffee bar I've ever seen.  The food here offered healthy options - always salad at meals and turkey bacon for breakfast (they actually had no sausage or pork bacon). And they had tobasco sauce at breakfast - I didn't have to ask for it - yay.  Food is generally what you get at an american restaurant, nothing too funky aside from the jicama salad, but everything was good.", "business_id": "HLQUH1VAw4KbSV-IhxOPEw", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-10-12", "type": "review"}

Not too big a deal, but you could see the other staff getting visibly upset. They eventually called in a manager to expedite the line. Very nice.

The linens and towels were nice, yes, but not a-mah-zing. What did stand out were the two trays of complimentary food that each of us (I was traveling with three other people) were provided.

When I first walked in, it impressed. It had tasteful, old school decor and helpful people at every turn. The problems started when one of the people in our party had his card declined at check-in (not for the room cost because those were already covered, but for the incidentals). I am told that this decline was not his fault and I would certainly believe him as this is not the type of man who runs up his credit cards. Either way, the hotel staff should have asked another one of us for our cards, but for some reason they just stubbornly kept trying to run the same card for 5 minutes. This was while the rest of us waited, twiddling our thumbs. Oh, yes and we were already running late so this was very annoying. Finally, a manager came over and said that they would figure it out later. Well, within 10 minutes when we were finally in our room, here comes a call on the room phone telling us to come down as soon as possible and put a card on file. Ummm, okay. And why couldn't they just ask when we were just down there???? The room did not impress and was in fact so terribly run down that even the marble in the bathroom had rusted in spots and the pipes under the sink were corroded and leaking. Really, supposed \"Ritz-Carlton\"? But here it is, people. Probably the most rude thing that I have ever experienced from a hotel W down to La Quinta: I went to the front desk to ask for a razor and shaving cream. The woman at the desk very helpfully and condescendingly directed me to the tiny gift shop closet where she said they sell it. So, here I was expecting to pay $12 for some crappy bic and a tiny bottle of foam. But no, I guess they were out of them because none was to be found. When I came out of the shop-closet she asked if I found it. I said no, there wasn't any in there. She replied oh, well I will see if room service can bring one to your room. Now, that's odd. When I went to my room, housekeeping was just outside the door. I asked if they might have a shaving kit and the maid rolled her eyes, dug around in her cart and handed me a \"ritz carlton\" official box with a razor and tube of cream inside. For...real... What terrible, money-grubbing, uncouth service! So, yeah. Perhaps consider staying here if you like to be treated like trailer trash who is not nearly good enough for their moldy, falling apart hotel. But, then again I think there is a W nearby.

There's a glut of hotels to choose from in the Camelback area.  They're all cheap in the summer so I chose the Homewood Suites because its always nice to have a big room.\n\nThe location is easy to get to and a block off of Camelback Rd.  Its close to shopping, plenty of restaurants and there's a good sports bar across the street.  Its not the newest Homewood Suites.  If I had to guess, its a late 90's or early 2000's build.  Its good in regards to the rooms being huge and all multi room setups with living rooms and bedrooms.  I don't think they have the \"Studio Suite\" that the new Homewood Suites have.  The only bad side is the decor isn't newest even though its relevant and in good shape.  There's a full kitchen with a stove, dishwasher and fridge.  And they're still courteous enough to leave the bag of microwave popcorn.\n\nThe linens are fresh and white although they have a non white comforter which shocks me in the hotel world.  I think the comforter choice is a brand thing though.  There were two flat screen TV's in the upper 20in size.\n\nI asked for a high floor away from elevator and was given a 1st floor next to housekeeping on my particular visit.  That was disappointing especially since they acknowledged the disregard for my request when they checked me in.  Somehow they did not have my Hilton number which was odd.  They attributed the low floor to no having any top floor rooms available because of a new room they were installing.\n\nThe one sad feature of the hotel was the gym.  It had an elliptical and treadmill.  The treadmill was out of order.  There was a stack of weights too.  It wasn't the best gym I've seen and pretty emblematic of 90's hotels.  You'll find your average new Hampton Inn with a gym 3 or 4 times as large.\n\nIts a solid hotel, its affordable and as an extended stay format its a nice place to stay.

I booked several stays through Orbitz so i can book my flight and Hotel together and on those stays Hilton accpets my Honors number but when i review my account to see how many points i had i noticed on those 2 stays there were ZERO points. Come to find out that booking through another site Hilton won't honor those stays. This is crazy as most people don't ever reall book direct to a hotel when traveling on buisness. I had been a Marriott Rewards member for over 10 years and will be switching back because of this, Embassy Suites are nice and cost much more and for me to not get the points is a deal breaker for my dollars. Wish this policy would change and when i called she simply said sorry company policy and if you want the points you have to book seperately. Extremely dissappointed i must say!", "business_id": "FQudBiBiz9bGQLF_kK8UCg", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-10-19", "type": "review"}

The first room they gave me was room 115 and reeked of cigarette smoke so I didn't even set foot in it. Then they tried to move me to another room which had double beds which is not what I booked. They finally put me in room 321 and that's where all the problems really started.\n\n Such an outdated hotel I'm totally disappointed. The bed is comfortable and the furniture is fine. Breakfast was tasty. \n\nThis hotel was built in the 80s and clearly has not been updated since. It has popcorn ceilings it does not have down comforters. The window panes on the sliding glass doors do not block any sounds from the street. I could hear trucks backing up and idling. I could even hear the Embassy Suites shuttle and its reverse warning. while it does have a balcony, you can hear everyone else who's on their balcony. I could hear all these cackling women waiting for their friends to go to the airport from the main entrance at ridiculous hours of the day and night who seemed to forget that they were at a hotel and there were people who  might be sleeping. Perhaps the hotel could put signs out so the five a.m crowd doesnt think its okay to yell across the parking lot. Maybe a sign that says please be considerate of your neighbors and they are still sleeping. There is also a Dove's nest in the palm tree outside my window and that was annoying as hell. \n\nThe air conditioning is not really temperature controlled so if you want your room a particular temperature it doesn't really work that way. The engineer explained it to me but I don't remember. All I know is that I wanted the fan to run to make some white noise and he said that's not possible. \n\nEvery bedroom either faces the swimming pool or the parking lot. Every entrance to every room faces the interior courtyard. Its just a bizarre set up for a hotel. \n\n Most of the staff was very friendly and helpful considering the condition of the building. \n\nThe bathroom makes no sense. The shower rod is one of those curved shower rods but given the small tub and the position of the bathroom door there's no reason for it. There's also a full bathroom vanity in the master bedroom. I guess that's a good thing but it kind of is strange. \n\nI just expected more from one of the higher end Hilton brands. What I've noticed is that this hotel seems to attract a lot of really white trash customers because the rooms are rather affordable and you can cram tons of people into the big rooms. The Biltmore name makes it sound like it's going to be much more luxurious than it is. They also charge $10 a night for parking when you can park about three feet away at Macy's for free", "business_id": "FQudBiBiz9bGQLF_kK8UCg", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-09-20", "type": "review"}

Let me preface my review by saying that usually I stay at Motel 6, but I've decided that at age 50, life is too short for hard beds, lumpy pillows, creepy carpet and ice machines right outside your door, no matter how screamin cheap it is. Amazing that when you pay more, it's really, really nice, The grounds are gorgeous and lush, meandering little paths, fairy lights, fountains and outdoor fireplaces at night. Reasonably attractive guests (not to heavy on the gold bling, yet we were in Phoenix so not particularly tastefully understated either). The R.P. was the venue for a couple of \"Bride Magazine\" weddings (generous breasts but not really over the top, so to speak, and nicely tanned ASU sorority and fraternity members who got a bit sloppy as the evening wore on. Clearly the dads have been minimally impacted by the \"economic crisis\". Excellent service, not a hint of snootiness. Just warm and efficient. We liked the pre-paid $22.00 gratuity charge. It eliminated all traces of sucking up and false cheeriness. The fitness facility was decent with a lovely outdoor stretching area on the second floor. Nice roomy hot tub and iced citrus water magically offered to rehydrate and wet our whistles. Still I could have done without the \"romantic spanish guitar muzak\" constantly playing in the background, clearly providing ambiance for those who don't know the difference. I happen to, being a classical and jazz musician. It makes my husband crazy, but what's wrong just rustling palms and trickling water? Must we always have to listen to someone else's musical selections? Okay, how was our room? Not bad, but probably the weakest part of the resort. Certainly an atmospheric \"love shack\" for 2 mature adults who have been married forever. Don't know what they intended us to do with all those pillows. For the bi-focal set, the room was too dark and clearly designed before CFL's became the new green way to save energy. Royal Palms, the light is cold, cold, cold. Deep six the cutesy stenciled Disney birds on the walls and re-paint. Color does matter! Excellent bathroom with plenty of shower space for fun and recreation. Very plush bed was too squeaky and springy for my aging back. For the money, I expect dead quiet and a mattress to die-for.

The resort includes a pool, a small gym, several lounge areas with firepits and fireplaces, and the wonderful Alvadora spa (with massages, facials, outdoor-facing showers, and shaded lounge areas to your heart's content).

The resort is nestled up right against Camelback and there are lots of courtyards and hidden gems around the property. We went to the bar for happy hour (great happy hour deals) and then went to T. Cooks for dinner. Our table had rose petals and candles and our menu said Happy Anniversary on it! Our meal was fabulous and when it came time for dessert, they brought over their special for the evening and in chocolate writing, it said Happy Anniversary! We truly felt like we were being treated like royalty! When we got back to the room, our bed had been turned down and there was a platter of fruit and chocolates and it also had the chocolate writing that said Happy Anniversary on it! Wow!

Yes, you're in Phoenix, yet somehow you're worlds away from it all. \n\nThe room was serene and beautiful. The color scheme and accents had a Mediterranean influence, exotic yet familiar and calming.

The main courtyard with its center fountain, its Mediterranean style accented by palm trees and flowers and the mountains in the background is stunning.

There isn't a spot within the Royal Palms that isn't scenic or relaxing. \n\nService is top-notch. You get the sense that they will do anything to make your stay more comfortable. \n\nAnd if you really did not want to leave the property - no one would fault you for this - there is an amazing on site restaurant, T.

From the moment you check in to the moment you leave, the staff makes you feel like a VIP.

We absolutely love Royal Palms and we were just as impressed with our stay as we were the first time we came 2 years ago except for one issue- Mosquitoes!  \n\nDuring our last visit we stayed in a designer casita and loved the private patios in front and back.  This trip we stayed in the Montevista area in an Estate suite.  The room was great but the lighting is really dark and it was hard for me to put on make-up in the evening.   \n\nWe especially loved our dinner at TCooks. We had the King Crab, Farmer's Salad, Antelope and Mushroom side dish. Very good food.  We appreciated the anniversary dessert and the special print on our menu.  We also appreciated the special anniversary chocolates and bottle of sparkling water in our room. We are always impressed with how friendly every person working on property is and how considerate they are when pushing carts around. I love every single nook and cranny of this resort.  We really enjoyed looking at all of the artwork and the library room near the business center.  We never saw that last time! \n\nSome people may not know that you can utilize the steam room, showers and plunge pool at the spa as part of your resort fee.  If you can't afford the $200 for a treatment, this is a great way to utilize your $30/day resort fee.  I love sitting thru a couple cycles of steam and then taking a gloriously long shower in the huge spa shower room.  I also escaped to the spa waiting room to read my book for a little while too. \n\nMy husband was just \"ehhh\" over having a DJ at the pool Saturday and Sunday. He prefers the \"Zen\" quality of the small pool and prefers subtle music.I felt the DJ played a great variety of music that was not overwhelming and could appeal to a variety of crowds.  We have never stayed at Royal Palms for a holiday so we were a bit surprised at the crowds.  On Sunday we had a difficult time getting a chair at the pool. The pool staff was great though and did their best to get us set up in our preferred location as soon as quests left.    \n\nEven though we had a great visit, unfortunately, we are suffering quite a bit today and sent an email to the hotel to bring it to their attention. There are tons of pesky mosquitoes on property and they are so sneaky that you don't really ever see them!  I saw quite a few in the spa and in our room and did my best to swat them if I saw them. Never once did I feel like I was getting \"bit\" by the mosquitoes and I didn't feel like I was constantly swatting them away. However, upon returning home yesterday my husband and I were covered in bites.  I have at least 30 bites and they all flared up 4-5 hours after we got home. My husband is having a reaction to the large number of bites he got, and has a more severe rash today. We are disappointed that our wonderful trip to Royal Palms is clouded because we are so uncomfortable today.  When we checked in there was no mention of possible mosquitoes, so my hope is that they either heavily spray/treat the mosquito problem, or tell future guests so they can bring their own bug spray.  Or, as part of the resort fee maybe they can possibly provide cans of bug spray as a convenience.  \n\nAgain, we love Royal Palms but we are so uncomfortable we felt we needed to share as part of our review", "business_id": "rLAeltELaGdQKh_LYIllEA", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-09-02", "type": "review"}

The grounds themselves are gorgeous, and the hotel is kept up very well.\n\nThe problem lied in the staff. When we came back from breakfast, our room was being cleaned with the French doors propped open by the housekeeper's cleaning cart. There is a specific sign that says to please not leave the doors open because bugs get in, and indeed they did as we had both dead and live bugs including a baby lizard!\n\nWhile at the pool, my husband went up to ask for our tab as we wanted to leave, and the server was apparently having a terrible day. He lit up my husband about what a terribly run place this bar is, and how they were out of everything, computers down, & a litany of profanity in expressing his dismay at having to work there! We could not believe this, and were taken aback.\n\nWe asked that are covers be turned down on our final evening there, as there were yellow stains on the comforter. While it seems that the sheets were changed, the same yellow stains were on the comforter after they cleaned the room.\n\nThere were other issues, I won't bore you with the details, we did make the front desk aware of the entire list and she did deduct $75 off of our stay of 3 nights, but that didn't make up for the ridiculous charges and abuse we endured while being there. The parking charge of $15 per day is also absurd, especially since we took other means of transportation everywhere we went during our stay.\n\nWhile the grounds are beautiful, I would appreciate going to a place that is was not as unprofessional as they were here, including some snide remarks made by the valets, in an attempt to be funny. \n\nI fully expected management to call me the next day after my list of gripes, however our business was apparently not important enough for them to do so. I also suspect that the front desk person did not even convey these to management, which we did ask to speak to before we left, but were told she was not in.\n\nThere are plenty of other gorgeous resorts in Paradise Valley and Scottsdale who will receive our business in the future.", "business_id": "rLAeltELaGdQKh_LYIllEA", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-09-07", "type": "review"}

In the room, a book about the history of the resort was available with all the spectacular pictures of each type of room. \n\nCompared to the picture in the history book, the renovation of the bar looks great. We stopped by on our first night and had a few drinks. We are from Las Vegas, so to say that bar looked great.... is a great compliment. We also had lunch and breakfast at T Cook's. The service we got was great each time. The sever remember we were here for an 80th birthday, so each time, he brought out a complimentary desert tray. \n\nOverall, I had a fantastic time.

The girl I had doing mine was rather snotty about my normal routine and pushed me to change the things I did in my every day life bc my face was too dry (keep in mind I had a dermatologist appt the next day and they told me my face was fine).. So not a fun experience with the facial. Than I had a body scrub which was super nice and a massage from the same girl and she was great! \n\nThan I had a blow dry and the woman was so rough on my head it almost made me cry when she shampooed my head. She almost drenched my face and blamed the sprayer than she put me under a dryer so my hair would dry faster because she had broken her arm and still couldn't use it very well and she accepted taking another client in between to cut his hair. Not okay!! Than when she went to go blow dry my hair she kept pointing the hair dryer on my scalp burning me! And she did a zig zag part (very 90s and out of date) claiming it was her signature as well as curling my ends making me look like a 10 year old! \n\nOverall I'd say the whole spa experience really was not worth it.

Chad, our guide, took his time to explain how to use the ATV's and made sure everyone was comfortable. \n\nHe was very knowledgeable of the trails and the area as well. His experience enhanced the tour, since he was able to stop along the way to explain what the trail ahead had in store, while also pointing out mountain ranges, lakes, and other tid bits.\n\nThere were some slightly challenging areas along the trails, but everyone was encouraged to go at their own speed. No one was expected to do anything that made them uncomfortable. It was very clear that safety was a priority. \n\nThis was an awesome time. I'd recommend it for locals or tourists.

Oh, and my wife likes their complimentary happy hour.\n\nThe Scottsdale location is no different. In fact, the rooms may be even more spacious than other Embassy Suites, especially the rooms on the angled corners. A couple of things that also made this Embassy Suites stand out from most of the others we've stayed at: 1) the layout is an open, wing-shaped structure, not a rectangle that encloses a central courtyard, and 2) the pool is outdoors instead of indoors.\n\nMy wife did take advantage of the happy hour (actually, a happy \"two\" hours, from 5:30-7:30) with a couple of glasses of wine each day. The bartenders are very generous with their drinks, and they also serve complimentary cocktails: Tequila sunrises, screwdrivers, and margaritas seemed to be the most popular drinks  being poured.\n\nThe back of the hotel overlooks the pool area and a golf course. The living area has a small wet bar with its own sink, a good size mini-fridge, and a microwave.  The furnishings were clean and comfortable. Flat-screen televisions in both the sitting area and the bedroom. Mattress was a little soft for my wife's taste (she likes a really firm mattress), but I thought it was comfortable. \n\nWiFi is free on the first floor, but there's a daily charge on the upper floors where the guest rooms are located. We saw quite a few guests bringing their laptops down to the bar/lounge area just off the lobby.  However, if you are an AT&T internet customer/subscriber, internet access is also free on the upper floors, you just need to logon using your AT&T user ID and password.\n\nMy only complaint is that the bedrooms have a small clock-radio whose time is \"radio-controlled.\" That is, there are no external controls which you can use to set the current time, just the alarm time. Supposedly the clock sets itself through some radio signal, but our clock was 12 minutes ahead. I did a Google search to see how it could be manually corrected, and if you take a small (jewelry size) Phillips head screwdriver and remove the top faceplate, there are controls under it which can be used. Very frustrating, since I didn't bring a small screwdriver. So when I set the alarm, I had to set it for 12 minutes after the time I wanted to wake up. \n\nBut overall a very good experience. We stayed with a large group of about 150 people for a conference over Labor Day weekend, and the staff was very courteous and accommodating.", "business_id": "sOa-OpRFi1OVU7CC6Hwoig", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-09-02", "type": "review"}

Service was outstanding.\n\nWhat really sets them apart is the breakfast buffet.  I would almost rate the buffet as well as any outside restaurant I've ever eaten for breakfast.  The omelet cooked to order was done perfectly.  They have obviously perfected their system and serve an incredible number of omelets to guests each morning.  The buffet of eggs, sausage, potatoes and bacon is very good as well as coffee, juices, fresh fruit, breads and pastries of all descriptions.    For family travelers, I can imagine this is a huge draw.\n\nThe evening happy hour in the lobby is equally well done.

Good and bad. Sadly, it's mostly bad. \n\nFirst bad experience, called for a cab twice because somehow they neglected to send a cab out the first time. The customer service person was rude. I had to wait an hour and a half for a cab. \n\nNext experience,  the driver neglected to tell me his credit card machine was broken BEFORE I got into the cab. So we pulled into a circle K to get change. I finally arrived at my destination and the guy had no change!! I basically got swindled from the driver. \n\nNext experience, the guy claimed he only knew his way around Mesa. I'm pretty sure Discount Cab services all metropolitan phoenix area. To NOT know your way around PHOENIX????!!! Come on! \n\nNext experience, the guy went about 10 miles under the speed limit. These methods only piss people off. DO NOT TRY THAT CRAP WITH PEOPLE! \n\nMost cabs do not have GPS. If they do, its probably a scam from the drivers NOT to use it. Admittedly, some drivers are nice enough to pull out their own GPS from their phones.\n\nGood experiences:\n\nDespite the headaches, the cab services does get me there. And that's pretty much it. Sad, I know. \n\nIf you are planning to take a cab - always call ahead and schedule. At least an hour.

Tonight as I was leaving Walmart, I noticed an elderly lady that was disabled and distraught. She realized she had lost her phone when we went to call for a cab to pick her up and take her back to her senior care facility. My daughter and I happened to be walking by and it was without question that we would help her. I called Discount Cab but was unable to determine if her phone was found and was told to wait a day to call back since the driver may have not turned it in yet. I continued to wait with her making sure she knew she wasn't alone and that the absence of a phone would not be a limitation to her. When Michael showed up, he was unaware of who he was driving and as I proceeded to explain the situation, he didn't miss a beat! He immediately got on the phone and was able to locate the phone. He realized that his patron was protected by ADA and she needed her phone asap. Not only did he get her home with her groceries but he also drove completely out of his way to get the phone off of Camelback only to come back to the 19th and Cactus area. He called me from her phone to let me know he picked it up and I spoke with Dorothy afterwards to confirm she got home ok and that Michael helped her with all her stuff and gave her a big hug. I almost cancelled that cab for her and took her home. Had I done that, we never would have witnessed how caring and compassionate your driver was. If there was ever a brand ambassador for your company, Michael would be it. I have never taken a cab in my life but if I did you can guarantee it would be Discount Cab. It's so rare today for people to stop and help one another without wanting something in return and it was really a blessing to witness the sincerity in Michael's actions. Simply put, he is an asset to your company and has a servants heart. He understood his customer and her needs and met every single one. We all could be so lucky to have that kind of service. Michael is #1 in my book and I hope that you share this all the way to the top.", "business_id": "6InaHoU8KNlDeGP48RqzBg", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-10-27", "type": "review"}

We had reserved through Costco Travel a Standard Size SUV which should have been a Ford Edge or Equivalent. My husband brought home a Chevy Equinox, which is classified by the manufacturer as a compact SUV. We intentionally wanted a larger SUV to fit our family for a weekend road trip. Unfortunately we were on a tight schedule to proceed out of town for a fast weekend trip to visit family in California so we did not return to dispute or question the apparent discrepancy between what we thought we paid for and what was issued to us. I include this detail only to substantiate my claim that Budget Rent-A-Car conducts business using dishonest and questionable practices. \n\nMy REAL issue is an unauthorized charge to our bank account using the associated VISA card number that we rented the vehicle with almost four weeks ago. Our family of four + our family dog (an English Mastiff) traveled in the vehicle from the afternoon of Friday 8/28 and returned it first thing in the morning Monday 8/31 after ensuring that the gas tank was full and that all cups and wrappers were cleared out (the courteous thing to do). Upon returning the vehicle at the Budget center a walk around of the exterior, validation of mileage, AND a check of the interior passenger cab AND luggage area were all performed before we were issued a final receipt for $159.82 of charges for the rental + fuel. \n\nOn Wednesday morning 9/23, almost four weeks later, we recognized a memo hold for $150 against our checking account by Budget. We contacted Budget immediately and were informed that the additional $150 charge is a vacuum fee for excessive dog hair. It's important to point out that our pet can only fit in the luggage area of the vehicle and an adequately sized travel blanket for pets was laid beneath her. IF the amount of hair in that area at the time of return was deemed excessive, requiring effort beyond the normal cleaning and vacuuming that they should do for every rental car, then we should have been told at the time of return. If that was the case we would have taken the opportunity to clean/vacuum it ourselves and bring it back to Budget rather than pay an arbitrary and excessive fee almost a month later. There was also no follow-up communication or warning by mail, phone, or e-mail to inform us of Budget's decision to assess this fee. The Budget Terms & Conditions on our rental reservation also do not list a cleaning fee in the Additional Fees section and the only fee we were aware of is the $150 penalty fee for smoking in the vehicles which are supposed to be smoke free. \n\nWe immediately requested to speak with a manager to dispute the fee, but were advised that a manager was not available and that we would receive a call back in 24-48 hours. As of Thursday morning 9/24 the funds were in fact taken from our account despite our dispute filed directly with Budget with no follow-up call. I called again Thursday afternoon 9/24 requesting a manager. I was placed on hold for more than five minutes, only to be told that there was still no manager available to speak with me. I was told we were in queue for a call back and that we needed to wait. Frustrated I began to list for the agent the multiple reasons why we were disputing this fee, the main one being the amount of time since the rental, subjectivity of the issue, and lack of proof. He then informed me that he was looking at photos of the interior if the car. I asked if the photos were dated and he advised me yes and that even a photo of the odometer was taken. They had not been offered to us on the day prior so I requested copies of the photos and our rental agreement, providing two separate e-mail addresses for them to be sent to. At 10:11 P.M. I received an e-mail, lacking text or contact information for follow-up, containing only a single photo of the EXTERIOR a car WINDOW with \"Detail Dog Hair 8/31/15\" handwritten on it. This is far from the 'proof' I was expecting to corroborate their claims to a cleaning fee. It has also been more than 48 hours and we have not received any call back from a manager, rather we received a very short e-mail response from their escalation department, lacking any apology, insinuating that the vehicle was returned in 'such poor condition' that it required detailing and that the billing was deemed to be correct. Again, no contact information was provided for me to speak directly with anyone at a manager level. And I STILL do not have any visual proof of this claim that the vehicle required extraordinary vacuuming effort.\n\nWe have very little faith in Budget's dispute process or business practices after reading several customer reviews online at Consumeraffairs.com & BBB.com (who reports 529 claims against this location in the past three years).

It is a remarkably good airport given the tremendous growth in the Valley of the Sun. \n\nThere are 3 terminals: \nTerminal 2, the smallest and oldest, (United, Continental, others)\nTerminal 3, next largest and oldest (Delta, Northwest and many others, including international flights)\nTerminal 4, newest and bigger than the others combined, dominated by SouthWest and US AIrways (formerly America West)\n\nFor locals, there are the West and East long term parking lots. You can park in the West and walk to Terminal 2; East is much larger with an annex and hi-rise, and closer to terminal 4, but you need to take the shuttles. To help you remember which is east and west, PHX names the shuttles Gecko, RoadRunner, and one other I can't remember! \n\nFor visitors, to get a round the sprawling valley, you need to rent a car. The recently added offsite Rental car Center is huge and well organized into 4 floors with different brands on each floor, and a lot of shuttle buses that are dedicated to each terminal. It is about 1 mile from the airport, but allow 10 minutes for shuttles and loading when you drop off your car. \n\nThey have recently upgraded Terminal 2, expanding the security area and remodeling the restaurant. Terminal 2 has little in the way of food and shops. Terminal 4, organized into 7 separate buildings of gates connected with long hallways and moving sidewalks, has more food and shopping choices, but not on the order of PDX, or DEN. Because of the sheer volume of flights, Term 4 can have a long security check-in line, so plan accordingly. \n\nIf you have questions, there are roaming information assistant volunteers, wearing blue sports coats and hats. Signage is decent and most monitors have been upgraded to flat screens. \n\nSky Harbor is located close to Tempe (ASU) and no too far from downtown PHX. The edge of Mesa and Scottsdale are about 5 miles away, but it is 20 or more miles from other parts of North Scottsdale, Deer Valley and North Phoenix. Overall, it is fairly well organized and a clean airport with a lot of flight options, especially on SouthWest or US Airways, who use it as a major hub. For other airlines with a smaller foothold, you have to often connect through LAX, DEN, SLC, ORD or SFO depending on your final destination.", "business_id": "hW0Ne_HTHEAgGF1rAdmR-g", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-11-17", "type": "review"}

I appreciated the free Wi-Fi, even if you didn't have power outlets available. (Or if you did, I didn't see any in that nook next to Starbucks.)  But two huge negatives haunt me.  First, the entire having to go through security to reach your terminal thing sucks.  What I mean by that is, instead of going through a single TSA line and then having access to multiple options once you get past the checkpoint, you go through the line and then only have access to the options near your gate and only near your gate.  This is a major criterion on which I judge airports because if, say, you're flying a red-eye and every option in that particular terminal is closed, then you have to go through security multiple times.  I realize that there are other terminals, since it isn't obvious how to actually GET to the other terminals (unlike Atlanta's underground train), you're on an island.  Which leads me to my second complaint.\n\nEverything was freaking closed!  Yeah, I was taking a redeye, but at 10pm on a Friday, I expected at least ONE thing open.  (And not just the Starbucks.)  Maybe there are other terminals with options catering to a later crowd, but I fly Delta and, had I not packed a couple granola bars, the flight would've sucked more than normal.

Since I'm usually sleeping, I've been lucky to wake up shortly before the announcement with time to make the gate-change. As has been noted in other reviews, the terminals are far apart and gate changes can be rather drastic.\n\nOne big positive is the lack of arm rests on the seats. This makes it real easy for a peep to catch up on some quality nappage. There are also a lot of places to eat or drink at, all with the standard airport mark-up but with at least some variety. This 'port makes for an acceptable layover, but I've so far been able to avoid checking in here and suggest the same.", "business_id": "hW0Ne_HTHEAgGF1rAdmR-g", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-09-18", "type": "review"}

And for the initiated it's probably not too bad. But for someone who only flies here once or twice a year, it's a painful experience. It's precision maneuvering to get to the right curb, awkward layout of ticketing, and then a total disconnect in flow from the ticket counter to security.\n\nOnce at security, triple check your ticket to make sure you're at the right security gate. Whereas other airports are laid out to have only 1-3 security gates that pretty much lead to any gate, you best pay attention because each security station only serves a handful of gates. I know this isn't a hard thing to do, but it's just another nitpicky step that makes flying here a pain.\n\nConnections are the greatest downfall of this airport. If you're lucky, you may fly in to, say, gate A18 and then connect to gate A22. No big deal. A few months ago I flew into gate A30 and out of gate B20. Doesn't seem like a big deal? They're 47 miles apart. Okay, not really. But it was a loooong walk with only a couple of moving sidewalks thrown in. And don't even try to consider moving between terminal 2, 3, or 4.

Yes, it's overpriced, yes it's lousy, but even here there are less options than normal.\n\nWhat I do like about Sky Harbor is the addition of free wifi. And it's pretty good wifi. Fast and easy to log in. Big plus in that category.\n\nNot sure what else they can do to make things better. Most of the problems are caused by the layout. I don't like to fly here, but sometimes you just have to suck it up and kiss Aunt Beatrice.", "business_id": "hW0Ne_HTHEAgGF1rAdmR-g", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-10-22", "type": "review"}

It's clean, the lines move pretty fast (whether it's for security or to check-in), and there's a lot of different food options. Speaking of food options, one thing I do recommend (time permitting) is the food court BEFORE the security check. There's a lot of options here. Off the top of my head Paradise Bakery, Chili's, & Flo's come to mind, but I know there's a lot more. That's not to say you don't have options once your past security (Nathan's, Pizza Hut, Blue Burrito, and standard cheesy airport bars come to mind), but I just find the options on the other side more appealing. \n\nOnce you're past security and closer to the gates there's a lot of seating, but finding an outlet for electronics is limited (like at most airports) but not horrible. And yes, like others have mentioned there is FREE Wi-fi, but at times it can be slow, but I guess it's better than nothing (I fly out of SFO where you have to pay for Internet). \n\nOne pretty big thing to not about this airport...and I'm not sure if this is a good thing or bad thing, but security is pretty tight. If there's ANYTHING that seems suspicious/over-sized liquids they will find it, and you'll have to get rid of it (or check it in). I guess this isn't a bad thing since it means they have good security, but it can be annoying. The same carry-on bags that I'm easily able to get through security at other airports I always check-in here, since I KNOW (yes, this always happens without fail) my face wash, hair products, and cologne will be confiscated. \n\nOh, I guess another thing I should note is that this airport used to be NOTORIOUS for having a super slow baggage claim. Nine times out of ten though I don't check-in bags coming into this airport, but the last time I did have to check a bag in, it actually came out pretty fast, so I don't know if the slow baggage claim is still the case. \n\nOverall, this is a good airport (and if it weren't would it really matter?).

The terminal reminds me of a backwards E, like the second E in EMIN3M, except that there is another prong to the backwards E.  The concourses are not spacious at all, the seating limited, and consequently the crowds spill out into the walkway areas.\n.  \nTo go from one end of Terminal 4 to the other necessitates using really narrow moving walkways which are on the spine of the E.  It is really hard to maneuver if you want to pass the throngs given the limited space.  The distances are long, the bruises will be many, either to you but most likely given by you as you negotiate your way between flights.\n\nThe other thing that must be mentioned is that Sky Harbor is not a business person's airport but rather a tourist airport.

Further exacerbating the tourist nature of this airport are the snowbirds who flock here so that they can seek skin cancer in all months of the year, not just summer in their native habitats of the Upper Midwest.\n\nGet going on the remodel since it is long overdue and make sure you take in mind the tourists and the business traveler when updating this airport.", "business_id": "hW0Ne_HTHEAgGF1rAdmR-g", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-09-05", "type": "review"}

I remember my cousin picking me up outside, but that's about it.\n\nSo this time I was just changing planes San Diego to Milwaukee via Phoenix on US Airways.  Actually if you looked at the tail of our plane, it was a former America West plane that they must have not painted yet.  If you are changing planes, make sure you give yourself enough time to get from terminal to terminal because the walk is looooong.  Unlike other airports that have shuttles and trams, Phoenix does not, but they do have lots and lots of moving walkways.\n\nAs someone else mentioned, it does feel a little dated... brown leather seats, maroon/brown carpeting... I understand the Southwest theme, but it could use an update.  There seems to be a lack of seating in some areas... my gate was clustered with three other gates at the end of the building and there were people sitting all over the floor, people standing while most of the seats around the gates were filled.  And in looking around, there was plenty of space to add more seating without getting in the way.\n\nSome areas in the terminal have more options for food and shops, so you may want to make a note of it or stop on the way to your gate.  On other areas, you may be more limited... there was an shop and a \"cafe\".  The cafe is where I had breakfast, but it wasn't that great... I should've just gone for a pastry, but their Dark French Roast Coffee was awesome and I'm so glad they have giant to-go cups.\n\nMy flight was about 30 minutes delayed... it had to do with a delayed plane from Mexico and then customs had to clear the plane which added to the original delay.

I remember the feeling when I was a kid and I'd step off a plane and see that memorable carpet pattern, and think \"I'm almost home!\"\n\nThe carpet has been updated, and that is the least of the changes the airport has been through since I was flying unattended at the age of 5.  \n\nThe majority of the following refers to Terminal 4, as that is where I usually am and where most passengers go through.\n\nFood: If you're willing to pay for a real meal, you can get some decent options here.  La Grande Orange, Blanco, Sauce, Chelsea's Kitchen... all good.  However I do not recommend the on-the-fly kiosks trying to sell you a half-baked breakfast burrito.\n\nSecurity: On par with other major international airports.  The lines can be long during peak hours, and you have the intrusive machine that scans you as you stand ironically in the pose of a frozen army man.  I've had my pony tail searched.  Remember that the largest airlines share the same terminal, so Terminal 4 is much busier during \"rush hour\".  \n\nTransportation: The rental car agencies are off-site, so you have to use a shuttle if you are renting a car.  Not ideal, but at least there's a simple solution.  The parking garages are the same way, unless you pay for nearby/covered parking (and you sure will pay).  The new and improved Sky Train will get you around the airport for free, and deposit you at the Phoenix Light Rail station if you choose to use public transportation and avoid all that parking mess.  Driving around the airport is easier than it is in other cities, but it's still \"airport traffic\"... be careful.  Watch the signs, or you'll have to do a loop and go at it again.  Within the terminals are some very long hallways with people-movers to get you to your gate without requiring a nap in between.\n\nShopping: Solid airport selections.  Books, magazines, snacks, etc.  There are some gift-shoppy Arizona-style stores, so if you forgot to pick up a souvenir until now you can go ahead and buy a saguaro sweatshirt or scorpion paperweight.  There are also some of those electronics vending machines where you can buy phones and iPods and such.\n\nOther: As featured in Twilight, beware of the confusing women's restroom.  I haven't been lost in it since I was young, but I guess it's still there.  There is now free WiFi and charging stations at or near each gate.  The whole airport is full of museum-style displays and art exhibits if you want to learn something on your way to retrieve luggage.  \n\nIf you call for an airport shuttle, make sure you know what side of the terminal you're on.

I've been in this airport a lot, but only for connecting flights. I've never gone through security here before. I live in OKC and love our sweet little airport, but departing from Sky Harbor, I now appreciate how well-designed and thoughtfully considered our airport is. \n\nSo, here are just a few things that I think need a serious overhaul:\n\n-They didn't check my ID as I went into the line for TSA. They only looked at my boarding pass. This is weird, because it seems to me this is the one place where you have enough control to make sure you check every single person's ID against the name on the boarding pass. \n\n-The lines for security are whack. You pick from one of three lines, which we will call A, B and C that feed to two people, who we will call right and left. Well, left is not only pulling from A, she's also pulling from D, the pre-approved frequent travelers who use a different line. Then you have right taking from C. No one is taking from B, which unfortunately was the line I was in. Other travelers clearly saw that we had been there for a while. When the third person who arrived after us breezed through without regard, I finally got pushy and spoke up. Why not have one line that feeds into the next available agent? \n\n-The bag scanning line is built around a 90-degree angle, so you have to move your bags several times. There is also not much room to line up so you can't work very far ahead of your exact turn to walk through, so you waste a lot of time standing in line when you could be prepping your bins. It also seems like it would be safer in general if the agents could look down a long line and see what's happening. A lady walked through the scanner before she had pushed her bag up onto the ramp, and I felt really weird. I didn't want to move it, because it's not mine and if there is something bad in there I don't want to be seen touching it. But the alternative is to risk watching someone leave a bag behind. I had to get an agent but that took some work. \n\n-I actually overheard the woman doing the body scan say, \"I'm doing the bare minimum today.\" Somehow that is not comforting to me. \n\n- Finally, when you arrive at the crowded gate area to board your flight, they have rows 1-5 line up at the same time, with groups snaking over into each other's lines. It was at this point that someone came over to check my ID against my boarding pass. There's no way of knowing you really checked everyone at this point. Plus you're weaving your way through five lines of people, weighted down by bags, who have to find their IDs again. It's just weird. \n\nI'll keep OKC's streamlined, thoughtful procedures and nice staff any day.", "business_id": "hW0Ne_HTHEAgGF1rAdmR-g", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-10-29", "type": "review"}

Once you've been through departing a few times, you learn the terminal layout and parking options.  But on first experience, it's a befuddled mess.  Knowing the parking layout isn't easy. Numbering system is inconsistent. And you see people struggling to tell their ride where to pick them up on a regular basis in baggage claim. At-airport parking is also very expensive at $25/day.  \n\nTo its credit, PHX does have some good eating options.  Better than almost all other airports even.\n\nOther than that, it's a messy design, the place is showing age, and you have to budget extra time in case there is traffic.  Guess that's the price of having a downtown airport.  I'd love to see them build a modern international airport in Buckeye.  They have enough land out there and (with the new loop) it would balance out some of the traffic load so the highway around the airport isn't so congested.\n\nBetter bet is to park in the Spot parking at E 40th and Van Buren.

I fly Southwest, so...well you know...\n\nPhoenix Sky Harbor is my home airport, so I fly in and out of it on a weekly basis. In comparison to all of the other airports I get to go to, Sky Harbor Terminal 4 ranks pretty high. It is \"newer\", especially the D Gates, compared to a lot of other airports and well maintained. Here are a few things to note:\n\n1. They just recently switched their wifi to Boingo. They still have a complimentary option, so I guess this isn't a big deal. I just cringe whenever I see Boingo hotspots. Maybe because they stole the name of one of my favorite bands from the 80s.\n\n2. Power outlets in the Southwest areas are not too plentiful. They have a few pedestals, some with 6 seats, others with no seats, throughout the terminal. I've always found these to be way too small (impossible for 6 people to sit at once) and awkward. They also have a number of choice comfy seats with outlets. I guess I shouldn't be complaining about free power.\n\n3. The D gates are by far the smallest, so there is often no wait/very short wait at security. If your flight is going out the C gate, and you have some time but don't like waiting in lines, go through the D gate security checkpoint and walk over. The walk is not that long - Airports are like malls: you know you're going to be doing some walking.\n\n4. I travel with a S'well water bottle so I always have water on the plane. Just don't forget to empty it before you go through security. There are a number of water bottle filling stations throughout the terminal. I usually use the one by the women's restroom at the D gates or the one at the beginning of the A gates.\n\n5. All of the gates in Terminal 4 connect, but not too easily. It is a U-shape, from the A-D. The A gates and D gates do not connect. It's a pretty ice walk, though - if you have the time. And they also have a lot of moving walkways. And guys with carts.

I checked in about an hour too early so I was able to explore a little bit between terminals. Terminal three is like a mix between a mall food court and a ghost town.
