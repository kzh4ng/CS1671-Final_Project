While grabbing a brew at Voodoo, my friends and I were feeling a bit hungry.  Thankfully a menu was available and Capri pizza was just across the street. \n\nWe ordered a small cheese pizza to pick up.  I was pleasantly surprised!  The cheese was not greasy, the sauce was flavorful, and the dough was chewy yet crunchy... what more could you ask for?  We were really impressed with the quality cheesy pizza from Capri.\n\nNext time we'll try the pepperoni and post an update.  I see yummy pizza in our future.

I had noticed this pizza place before and had wanted to try it but never really had the chance before today.  Inside it looked like your normal pizzeria with a counter to order from, a pop cooler, a display dessert case and a pinball machine which was sadly not on. The temperature inside was pleasant as the air conditioner was set to 66 which was a good change from the stickiness outside.  We were greeted almost immediately on entering and I ordered a plain slice.  A few minutes later we were on our way with my slice of pizza.  I was happy to feel that the box was actually hot and so the slice was properly warmed.  Upon opening it I was also pleased to see that the slice was pretty large.  The pizza itself ended up being really solid.  On it there was a good covering of good tasting cheese which did not fall off the pizza when eating.  The crust was crispy and of medium thickness which meant the slice wasn't floppy.  Finally my favorite part was the sauce which had some good flavor to it.  As a matter of a fact you could see the spices when looking at it closely.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would eat here again in the future.  I liked the pizza that I had here and may even order a whole one in the future.", "business_id": "lHP5STO7aomlEQixH8m1aA", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-06-29", "type": "review"}

We also got a small dinner salad with house italian. It was delicious and a decent portion. Finally our pizza came. It was huge! (we ordered the 10').

Secondly, the spaghetti & meatballs was bland - I had to add my own salt, and the meatballs tasted like they were frozen and not handmade, they were watery on the inside.   Lastly, the Vegan pizza was horrific! I didn't even finish one slice!  The sauce was bland, the dough was tasteless and the slices could barely be pulled apart.  The veggies ontop didn't have muchtaste either and I definitely bit into something bitter.   They threw old wilted basil all over it and it wasn't even fresh green basil - it was gray.

The restaurant is tucked into the corner of a shopping plaza on Camelback & 20th St, right next to Fry's. \n\nThere are a few different options for dining here. You can order at the counter for a grab and go option. I saw quite a few people come in an pick up orders that they called in. They also offer delivery. Of course there's a dine in option as well. They have a small bar where you can sit, as well as indoor and patio seating too. After coming here twice, I've had an overwhelming feeling that the tables inside are in desperate need of reorganization. It feels a bit too spread out in there. \n\nThe service has been good on both occasions that I have gone. Everyone who works in the restaurant seems to be very friendly and welcoming. I've only been on weekdays and both times I think the bartender was also serving as a waitress which made things a bit held up when the restaurant unexpectedly filled up around 8 PM on a Monday night, but the staff handled it well and did their best to make sure everyone was taken care of.\n\nThey have a decent draft list of beers, about 5 options, with one of them being an NYPD custom beer. Some happy hour specials too which included discounted beers and pitchers. \n\nAs for the food - I have tried a few different things. The garlic knots, bruschetta pizza, bruschetta appetizer, and penne ala vodka with sausage and peppers. All of it was very good. The portions on the pasta are BIG! Not that I'm complaining, I love leftovers.

We've been good customers and tipped at least $5 per delivery.   I had a super busy day and just didn't feel up to cooking so  I ordered our pizza on line, as usual, and about fifteen minutes later I  received a phone call from a sympathetic clerk saying that she was sorry, we are no longer in their \"delivery boundaries.\"   Way to reward loyal customers Domino's.   Luckily, I found out that we are within Pizza Hut's \"boundaries\" and their pizza was delivered within 30 minutes--cheaper and better.", "business_id": "lOJ4sMs1EIZzqBV7duiO6A", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-06-20", "type": "review"}

I tried this place for the first time this past weekend and we had a pepperoni pizza, garlic knots, hot wings, and fries. Everything was brought out quickly and everything tasted on point. I got to give them kuddoes because some places have good pizza and bad wings, but this place had both. Great customer service.

First, I really hate that they walk you through the kitchen on your way to your table.  It seems so unsanitary.  \n\nThen, as soon as we sit down, the up-selling starts.  I really, really hate it when a server goes over and over the drinks and appetizers trying to up-sell you.  I can read a menu.  I don't need every drink and appetizer described to me.  Same thing with dessert.  I understand that you see my children and think that by going on and on about the desserts that my children are going to beg and plead to get dessert and that I'll cave.  Nope - not going to happen. \n\nI had the bruschetta and it was such a huge disappointment.  It was chopped tomatoes slapped on top of a huge loaf of garlic bread.  The best part of real bruschetta is the crispy, toasted bread followed by the garlicy tomato topping.  This was nothing more than diced tomatoes with no seasoning on top of a huge loaf of bread - the result was bland and mushy and nearly impossible to eat.  seriously gross. \n\nWe then had the chicken pesto pizza.  Again - gross.  It was positively dripping in pesto cream sauce.  It had so much sauce on it that the cheese on top slid off and the sauce dripped all over the place.  Really, really unpleasant.  \n\nAlso, we were there at 4:30 so the place wasn't busy yet but, the service moved at a turtles pace.  Maybe it was so slow because the server was up-selling every other table as well.  On and on and on.......about the appetizers, drinks etc....  \n\nOverall a huge disappointment.  I will not go back there again.", "business_id": "sllZXXYijYUs-n80uSa96w", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-07-22", "type": "review"}

The next day my boss wanted to know why the pizza charge wasn't reversed like I told him I was told by Dominos. When I called the next afternoon I get a whole different story from a RUDE MANAGER named Amy. Her solution to the problem was to keep hanging up on me and not answering the phone when trying to find out what was going on with getting the money back since we were not given our pizza.

We have visited this place frequently since the review and this last visit had to be shared. The food and service we received this last time we were there was sub-par. I had a slice of pizza and an iced tea. Husband had chicken parm that he asked for without the pasta. My slice was good. Hot and crispy. Everything else was bad. Tea was watered down and tasted like water. Tap, not filtered water which is the nastiest water in America. The chicken parm was cold and came with more pasta than chicken. A little piece of over-breadded chicken that was sitting on a cold pile of pasta (that my husband asked to do without). Waitress seemed new and was trying her best, but it was a disaster.\n\nSo I guess if you order a pizza to go you will be safe. As for sitting down, I would avoid it until they fix some issues.", "business_id": "WTxfdir4ZTJLA6aq6N6HzA", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-07-05", "type": "review"}
