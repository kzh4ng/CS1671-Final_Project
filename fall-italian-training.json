The mother asked the server for a new steak as hers was a bit salty (I've never had the steak as I'm vegetarian but my guests have mentioned the abundance of salt). The server apologizes and returns to the kitchen. The owner comes out and fakes an apology claiming his steaks are perfect. At this point the whole restaurant is listening it's that crazy.  The  best part? He comes out again and says \"I really enjoyed the steak you sent back.\" He was eating the steak and had some in his mouth! I can't make stuff like this up!\nAt this point the whole place feels bad for the mother and daughter. Clearly an awkward situation. The owner got so nasty the daughter tried to reason with him and he said \"it's not my job to make people happy\" that's strange considering he wants our business. \nSo the mother tries to pay the bill with a $100 and leave but he said they can't make change.

Actually, wanted to go to Piccolo Forno, but they said they only take reservations for groups of 6 or more and for two of us there might be a half our wait. We wanted a sure, immediate thing so we decided to try Lidia's.\n\nDRINKS: My husband had the cabernet and said it was fine, nothing spectacular but def what you'd expect from a cabernet. I had their Prosecco. It was good, not as sweet as I'd like, but still tasty.\n\nAPPETIZERS: We didn't order any dishes intended to be appetizers (you'll read what I mean), but we did enjoy the basket of bread and unique spreads (garbanzo and something, olive and something) that came with tit. The bread was not straight out of the oven, but it was definitely fresh-baked that day.\n\nENTREES: I ordered 2 appetizers instead of an entree. The first was the octopus dish, and it was THE BEST OCTOPUS I'VE EVER HAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Tasted like what it was but without being too briney/fishy. Also had a great texture. And the other items in the dish (capers, etc) complimented it really well. I don't use the word delicious that often, and I use delish even less often. But that was deliciously delish. \nMy 2nd appetizer-turned-entree was the cheese crisp. It was tasty, but super heavy. I chose the crab and scallion filling for that one, which was nice, but I think the whole cheese crisp idea (essentially cheese melted down to a \"cracker\") did not suit me. After a few bites I decided to pack the rest, but haven't eaten much of the leftovers.\nMy husband tried the pasta trio (unlimited) and liked it, though he didn't rave about it. I think there was a spinach ravioi, some type of alfredo linguine, and a pesto with meat and a red sauce, so there was a good texture/flavor variety from what I could see on his plate. He ate two full plates of the variety of pastas and was stuffed!\n\nDESSERT: We shared the Tiramisu. It was very fresh and authentic tasting. I felt like there was a bit too much espresso/coffee powder sprinkled on top, but perhaps my palate is sensitive to that. Overall it was yummy.\n\nSERVICE: Friendly and attentive.  \n\nDEALS/DISCOUNTS: None\n\nOVERALL: Glad we tried it. I would like to try the other well-rated Italian restaurants in Greater Pittsburgh, but I have a feeling I'll go back to Lidia's someday for that octopus -- so freakin' good!", "business_id": "XmdTkxKyJd7TuDLoiic1kg", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-11-22", "type": "review"}

We have only been on weeknights, and with reservations, however, so I'm not at all discrediting the reviews that discussed poor service on weekend nights and/or without reservations.\n\nThe pasta trio special was good when I had it, but my favorite dish is the gnocchi with duck ragu. I also loved my husband's wild boar ravioli. Skip the overpriced wine and order one of the house sodas instead. The ginger cranberry is fabulous!  We also love love love the frico and burrata appetizers. The frico is large and rich enough that it's really enough for two people, but the appetizers are yummy, so everyone might as well get their own and bring home whatever they can't finish.  \n\nNote to parents of babies, this restaurant is very family friendly, in our experience. We loved bringing our infant daughter here and were pleased that the restaurant offers slings for carseats for the smaller babies as well as highchairs for babies who are of sitting up age (many places don't have the slings). The lady's room and its changing station were very clean. The staff often stopped to smile back at the baby when she was smiling at them, and our waiter asked if we needed anything for her.

I have, and always will be a fan of fine Italian cuisine, so one could argue that I was biased from the moment I stepped in here. Nevertheless, it would seem that this small restaurant tucked away by the Bank of America building, certainly lives up to expectations. \n\nThe diner is spoiled for choice by the authentic menu items, though the choices are not overwhelming. Dishes are described in only three or four words which allude to traditional Italian ingredients and preparation. Then again \"potato gnocchi, tomato porcini mushroom sauce and parmigiano\" already sounds delicious.\n\nThough we waited awhile to be seated, we were handsomely rewarded with free champagne, which kicked things off nicely. The grilled octopus or \"polipo\" was outstanding. Lightly chewy and savory with a nice grilled flavor. The scallops must have been sourced from another planet because they were each the size of small dinner plates. Perfectly browned coat with soft white flesh in the center. Veal Milanese was also quite good, though possibly a little tough. Awesome arugula + parmesan + balsamic garnish. For dessert we had the Semi-Freddo with almond nougat caramel sauce. Great finish.\n\nI would definitely come back here again. My mind wasn't blown, but the food was pretty good and the restaurant's atmosphere felt a little more traditional than those of its contemporary Italian counterparts in the US.

This one wasn't my choice though, and knowing how I feel about chains as well as my high standards for Italian cuisine, I bit my tongue and hoped for the best.\n\nWe had to wait about 10 minutes on a Tuesday night to be seated. Apparently Olive Garden is a hot commodity in Champaign....\n\nWe were seated and I was quite indecisive about what to get. I settled on a build-your-own-pasta with alfredo/cream sauce and added Italian sausage. For my choice of soup, I got the Tuscan bean, and of course the notorious breadsticks. The soup was pretty tasty, it had like beans and zucchini and onions and a bunch of other things in a tasty tomato-y broth. Not bad! The pasta I got wasn't too bad either, the noodles may have been a little overcooked but the sauce was pretty creamy. I did not like the sausage. I'm no tubular meat expert but this tasted really institutional and for the upcharge it cost to add it to my pasta, I probably should have just went meatless or ordered the chicken, like my smarter date did....\n\nThe thing that really upset me about the experience though was the service. I don't remember the server's name, he was actually quite personable, but our meal felt very very rushed. Our soups came out quick which was good, but I was not even halfway done with mine before our dinners had arrived and we had to move our soups out of the way to eat our dinner. I'd consider myself a fast eater, too so this was frustrating, especially since I wanted to actually talk to my date, you know, the reason why I'm here in the first place!! This wasn't the last straw though, I was probably 75% done with my entr\u00e9e when the server comes up and asks if we are interested in desert. Ugh! We looked at each other and both agreed this meal was unnecessarily rushed. At that point I just asked for the bill which he pulled up on those tacky tablet things a lot of chain restaurants have now.\n\nThe food wasn't even as bad as I thought it was going to be, but the hurriedness of the service really put me off. 2/5", "business_id": "H0D2HYqLd9MRCq68rtbTyQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-10-05", "type": "review"}

It had been a grueling day and I wanted to get away, so I hopped in the car and started driving until I saw a storefront with a line out the door. After waiting for about 15 minutes I pointed to the picture on the wall. Having no idea what it was, I had ordered Tempura Udon.\n\nI dunked one of the thick shaggy pieces of shrimp into the savory broth and watched as the tempura quickly soaked up the broth. The flavors were ethereal.\n\nMy initial slurp of thick slippery udon is among the great food experiences I've ever had. Unfortunately, I've never had udon that has compared to that first steaming bowl.\n\nAfter driving by Cherry Blossom Noodle Cafe in Phoenix many times, I finally stopped in. They excel at their namesake with tasty noodles and more offerings than you can shake a wet noodle at.\n\nIt's a calming space with a quick, friendly wait staff and a menu that's mostly Asian inspired. There's a section dedicated to Italy, though I'm not sure how much curry and ginger Italians use in their pasta.\n\nCherry Blossom also offers many salads, including Tokyo Chicken Coleslaw ($7.60). It's essentially a Chinese chicken salad with grilled chicken, cabbage, lettuce and daikon sprouts in a tangy vinaigrette dressing. It's deliciously light and refreshing.\n\nA friend once told me that the spiciness of a spicy sushi roll was invented to help disguise the flavor of fish that might not be so fresh. While I'm not saying that the Spicy Salmon Roll ($5.60) wasn't freshly made, it was so fishy that it was inedible. Spicy as it was, it couldn't disguise the flavor that remained with me after the first try.\n\nThe California Roll ($4.40) fared better, but then again it was just a California Roll, imitation crab, cucumber and avocado wrapped in rice.\n\nMoving right into noodles, the egg version used in the Korean Spicy Beef ($10.50) were so chewy and fun to eat, I only wished the bowl was larger. Spiked with green peppers and tender sliced of beef, this wasn't as spicy as I has hoped, but this was quickly remedied with a side of chile paste.\n\nMy eyes widened as my Ebi-Ten Udon Noodle ($8) arrived. It was a large bowl filled with huge udon noodles paired with soup and steamed spinach. Along side were several pieces of shrimp tempura that were golden and inviting. Could this be what I've been searching for all of these years? After one sip my hopes plunged; just not quite the same. The flavor of the dashi, the basic soup stock used for udon, was a little too strong. Don't get me wrong, it was a very good bowl but, not quite the sensation I experienced so many years ago. Perhaps it's never as good as the first time.", "business_id": "AkOruz5CrCxUmXe1p_WoRg", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-09-30", "type": "review"}

And about the food: I can't speak for the entire menu as I've only been there once but the vegan sandwich I ordered was just ok and the fries were terrible (frozen, cheap???).

Ok, normally I'm a big fan of anything beef-related, but that type of sandwich is more targeted toward my dad, not me. However, the Chicago Style hot dogs are absolutely delicious. I also love the presentation...they wrap up the hot dog with a sheet of paper, and drop the fries inside the packet and roll everything up. It looks like a wrapped burrito.

I used to love it. A friend and I each got groupons to go so I thought great can't beat half off. I hadn't eaten here in years. Nothing has changed it's dark and outdated. They need a Ramsey make over for sure. \n\nThe service was good although it was very difficult to understand our waiter he had an extremely thick accent. \n\nThe Caesar salad was very good. The veal parm which is my favorite of all time was not good. The veal was rubbery and the breading soggy. The pasta was way overcooked although the sauce was good. \n\nThe Tiramisu was soggy as well. The cake at the bottom was soaking wet. Yuck\n\nIf not for the groupon I would have sent this back. But half off an overpriced meal made me think I got what I paid for. \n\nWell we had another groupon to use so we went back. The second time the service and atmosphere the same. \n\nMe thinks there is a microwave doing heavy duty in the back. This time I had seafood risotto BLUCK! The Risotto was undercooked and had no flavor. The seafood tasted dirty and there was grit in my shrimp. This Risotto was a disaster! My friends vegetables were mush. It was worse than the first visit. \n\nThe worst part of both visits is that the restaurant was almost empty on a Sunday evening and the food was sub par it makes no sense to me. \n\nThe long and the short of it I wont be back.
