I have used Aqua Plumbing in the past and I needed a water softener that I had purchased online installed.  I was originally quoted a price of $1136 or $124/hr.  I set up the appointment with Angela (who does not work there anymore) and I told her that my wife had to bring our kids to school and would be out of the house from 8:00 - 10:00am.  She assured me they would be at my house before 8.  Unfortunately, they weren't there at the scheduled time and when he did show up with no one home I was informed that I would have to reschedule the appointment, which I originally did not have any issue in doing.  We scheduled two more appointments and both appointments were cancelled due to \"emergency\" work on their part on one instance and not completing another job in the second instance.  We did eventually connect and unfortunately I had been sent the wrong part which delayed completion.  This day, the guys were at the house for approximately 7.5 hours.  Upon receiving the correct part they returned to complete the job, this time taking a full day for completion.   After completing the work, he did not have a billing total for us and we were told that we would be notified about the total.  They were very accommodating in allowing me to pay installments but when I received the total bill it was for $2096.  At no time were we ever consulted or informed about the added price or additional work.  I would think that if there were going to be such a large discrepancy in price, they would have first informed us about the change before proceeding, seeing as the original quote said it would take just one complete day.  As someone who is not in tune with this type of work, how would I know any better?  I believe that I should have received a more accurate quote if this was the case initially so that I could explore other options.

The decor was very Irish-pub, but it's too new to feel truly authentic.  It's not something that the management can change unless they want to close the place down, have a smoky peat bonfire inside for about a month, then bring in every chain smoker in Las Vegas for an additional month, send the help around to ding edges and rub things with century-old grime and generally batter the place up.  Yeah, I know, not all pubs are battered, but there is a distinct feel of age and wear in even the cleanest of them.  The service was okay--the waitress had a few too many tables to handle well, and that's not her fault.  The food was decent as well--I had bangers and mash.  Unfortunately, it wasn't as authentic as I would have liked.  The bangers were dead on--with thin, crisp skins and nice fatty pork inside.  The mash was made from real potatoes, not instant potatoes, but the cabbage was some bright green stuff (or was that parsley?).  The gravy had a very red-wine flavor--lovely, but not traditional.  And the peas?  The frozen green things, not proper marrowfat peas.  It was the sort of interpretation that will and should appeal to Americans who haven't gone to English schools in the UK.  My complaint is simply that  I wanted Bisto gravy, marrowfat peas and overcooked green cabbage instead of a more upscale treatment.", "business_id": "muqFM9Hoamh_fGL4MPeZqg", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-01-19", "type": "review"}

I was going to order to go, so I could go back to my hotel room and take my time about savoring it. The first two places were closed, due to Chinese new year.\n\nThis restaurant is situated on the second floor of a large shopping center. I entered to order my Pho, the nice gentleman at the counter asked me if I was local. I replied that I was ordering to go, so that I could eat it in my hotel room, and he insisted that I eat there to retain the freshness and the hear. I am glad that I took his advice, because I realized the delicate rice noodles would not have had the same texture by the time I took it back to my room.\n\nThe atmosphere was very accommodating and relaxed. I couldn't shake the song that came to my mind as I sat there eating my Pho all alone, observing the other customers. Although it was an authentic Vietnamese restaurant, that night it was full of mixed clients. Oh, what song you ask?  Billy Joel's \"Piano Man\".\nWhy, you ask?  There was a table full of drunk people, an Asian couple and a white couple. They seemed to be enjoying themselves, but from the effects of hard liquor, they were having a \"party atmosphere\" where it began to spread to other tables.\nThere was another table, a Hispanic couple who came in as the drunk table of four started a conversation as to spread their intoxicated overflow of cheers. Contrary to my initial perception, the Hispanic couple were not locals at all, and that they were from Arizona. Go figure, it seems that everyone has a story.\n\nThen there was Davy, who's still in the Navy, and probably will be for life. No, the actual guy was not named Davy, and I have no idea if he's in the Navy, but I got the feeling that he was born in Las Vegas, has never been out of Las Vegas, and probably will die in Las Vegas. Such is life. He too, just like me, was eating alone.\n\nOh, the food?   The funny thing is, Vietnamese Pho has caught on as a fad to us Koreans since the mid 80's. In fact, Pho was so popular to Koreans, that Koreans started Pho restaurants themselves, catering to other Koreans. To us non Vietnamese, variations of authentic Pho is acceptable and perhaps at times even preferred. After all, these are the times that we live, and the country we live, where \"Fusion\" is ever changing things. I would give the Pho, (given my non authentic Vietnamese taste buds) a (3) Star. It satisfied my need for \"soul\" food that night after a long day at the convention center. Overall, I really enjoyed the atmosphere, thus rating overall a (4) Star.\n\nI would definitely go back again next time I am in Vegas.", "business_id": "CoJivG0wxNIBXyOF7MNqSQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-02-20", "type": "review"}

The bisque was literally 3 parts cream, 1 part salt, and trace amounts of elemental lobster. It was inedible. The saltine crackers were stale, which didn't help matters. On the flip side, I did enjoy the crawfish \u00e9touff\u00e9e to an extent. There was bountiful amounts of crawfish meat, but not enough rice to go with the salty base. The fish & chips, shrimp po-boy, and burger that the rest of my family ordered didn't fare much better. \n\nWhile the food was lackluster and somewhat abysmal, the service was great.

Unfortunately, everything about the place overshadow the decent food and just plain out bring the place down. Dining there was like dining from hell. First, the service is about the worst I've ever experienced. They spilled the boiling pho on my gf's friend and rather than apologize, they put the blame on her. Second, they completely got my order wrong and while they admitted it, they never corrected so I ended up eating the wrong pho anyway since I was too hungry waiting for what I ordered. Next, the entire place was disorganized and smelly. Busboys were busting tables all around us while staff were running around but never really getting our orders or that of our neighbors' orders properly. I can only guess this place is still in business because people don't know where else to eat in LV. Here's a tip. Spend the money and pay 3x the price to eat pho at one of the restaurants in any of the major hotels (Mandalay, Bellagio, etc...) and you will still get better value for your money.

But it is only a 10-20 minutes drive for most living in the LV and not a 3+ hours pho pilgrimage.\n\nAnyway, I was sick the past few days and once my appetite has finally returned, I wanted something easy to ease my tummy into, and I remembered ordering their porridge the last time I was really sick.  So I scan the menu for the porridge section, and they have a few listed, but I think only 2 without pork blood. So I was debating between the Beef Porridge or Shrimp Porridge (which in the Chinese translated portion of the menu stated that it has both beef and shrimp, but I found out that is not the case).  But the waiter was kind enough to ask the kitchen to make it a special order so my porridge order will have both beef and shrimp.  That is a plus in my book for customer service.  The porridge came out piping hot, with strips of ginger, cilantro and fried onions, and have diced up bits of shrimp and a lot of the beef (the ones used in pho).  But it wasn't what I had in mind (the Chinese version with minced beef), but the porridge itself was good and I think I would be happy with just that.\n\nI also ordered their Beef Salad, not knowing exactly what it is, and it turned out to be a plate of veggies (the kind used in making Vietnamese Spring Rolls) with the traditional Vietnamese herbs and strips of beef.  This is definitely a healthy dish, with lots of crunchy veggies that can really tire out your jaw from chewing, but the flavor was lacking. Although I will say that it is refreshing, with all of the mint and basil leaves. Personally I will not ordered this particular appetizer again.\n\nThey also have a special Bun entree that is not in the menu, which includes pretty much all the topping in the Bun section.  My friend ordered it the last last time I was really sick, and it looked great and I am sure that it tasted great too, but the only way to get it is to specially ask the waiter for this special order request.  I will for sure order that the next time I head back and after that maybe try their hot pot.\n\nDecor - 4/5 I like the new look. The flat screen TV anchored to the back wall plays a constant stream of local advertising, which helps remedy boredom when dining solo or when your dining companions are just not entertaining as the reruns of ads.\n\nFood - 3/5 Overall a good bowl of pho, bun and most appetizers.\n\nService - 4.5/5 Being receptive to custom orders is a good thing.\n\nPrice - 3/5 I think it is par for the course.", "business_id": "Yq8LiVymGA7vBpGCQuDfRw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-12-08", "type": "review"}

While I have lived in Las Vegas for close to fifteen years, I'm an original downhome Texas girl.  I'm an avid fan of country music.  I attend Cowboy Christmas EVERY SINGLE YEAR, which is where my father pointed out a cowboy hat he would be interested in for Christmas.\n\nFast forward a few weeks and he drops the subtle hint (with a coupon) where I can find this particular cowboy hat.  So, I go to the Sheplers at this location.  There, I asked the young man working at the cowboy hat section about the style that I wanted in a size 7.  He pointed out my wrist tattoo, bantered with me about professional and collegiate football teams and several other things before he informed me that the hat I wanted in that size was out of stock.  My sister asked if there was another location and when he confirmed that there was, she requested that he call and inquire about the hat we wanted in a size 7.  A few moments later, he came back and smugly informed us that they had that hat and that he had asked for them to put it on hold.\n\nThe other location is inconveniently located inside Sam's Town on Boulder Highway.  And...once I made the trip out there, I not only discovered that he gave them the wrong hat style, but requested for them to hold a size 7 1/8.\n\nI appreciate that you thought my shopping experience would have been made better by the banter that I didn't need, but I would have preferred to not waste my time traveling across town for nothing rather than you know my favorite football team.

I've always been under the impression it was a custom cake place, which it is, but they offer great individual treats too. I figured if it has been around all these years in a odd business office center, it has to be good.\n\nWe came an hour before close and there wasn't much in the way of what was in the counter.  We normally wait til we get home, but the BF really wanted to eat the mini almond raspberry tart on the drive and it was so good we had to turn back and ask about it. I guess it was meant to be.\n\nHe grabbed us another dozen of those tarts ($1 each mini 2 inch tart or dozen for $11). They are on a nice crunchy pastry shell, with a thin layer of raspberry jam, buttery cake, nice glaze on top with almonds, a tiny dollop of whip cream and raspberry on top. It's not a sweet dessert, but very comfort food type satisfying. The BF absolutely is gaga about this, and I really enjoy it too.\n\nThe lemon meringue ($3, 4 inch tart) was rather nice as well! I am not a lemon dessert person until recently I've been able to appreciate them in small doses. So for me to love it, I think that means a lot. It wasn't overly lemony (I hate that fake tasting lemon many places do!), the meringue wasn't too stiff or sweet, the pastry shell was perfect. \n\nAfter talking with the owner, it sounds like a majority of their business isn't foot traffic, but a lot of supplying cafes on the strip, banquets, conventions, hotels, etc with pastries and doing custom event cakes. \n\nThat means they always have treats in the back in mass quantities that is possibility not in the display case so make sure to ask!!! He always makes extra and prefers not to have a lot of stuff out in the case that are better assembled fresh (like a fruit tart), but he can probably whip it up for you if the components are made. I kinda like that approach - made and finished to order. The only problem is I wish there was a way to see/know all the secrets hiding in the back, but I'm sure he will run down what's available for the day.\n\n There wasn't a pastry over $3 I saw so I feel its very good prices for the quality. I guess since they make so much, they can keep prices low. The owner is French so the desserts are made in a French style of baking. \n\nI don't know why this place isn't somewhere with better foot traffic because they seriously would be successful on that front as well. This recent week we've gone to a few very busy and famous local pastry shops and honestly, this was a strong rival to the quality of those places, maybe even better. At least to the BF he preferred this over the spot we tried in Henderson, and thankfully closer to us near his family's neighborhood. \n\nWhat a nice hidden gem.

Since my mom is a frequent gambler there, the hotel gave us special rates on their Courtyard rooms - very cheap ($42 a night).  I should've taken the tower room where my brother was at $69, much newer and easier to get around.  \n\nWhen I walked into m courtyard room, it smelled like crap, really.  I think it was either the shower drain and/or the AC.  They didn't have an elevator for the 2nd floor where I was, either.  And for those older customers or with crutches like I was (sprained ankle), it was no fun. Also, guests were blatantly smoking right next to the \"No Smoking\" sign inside the rear lobby.  My bedsheet the first night had lipstick remnant in the edge.  What was housekeeping doing? Normally, I would have left and gone to the other section.  But with my ankle the way it was, and no elevator nearby, it was better to stay put.  \n\nFofrtunately, I slept in the other bed.  I happened to have a mini can of Lysol and sprayed the room with it.  I also had a small bottle of cologne that I sprayed.  It was more tolerable.  Housekeeping was informed and the room was cleaner and fresher the next day. The TV worked fine, but the outlet with the free high speed didn't work.  Fortunately, there was wi fi, and my laptop got a very good signal.  That was cool  But how dumb - to get to the electrical outlets to plug your computer, you have to move the dresser with the TV on top.  I did, but I'm guessing a lot of people could not slide 200 lbs. so easily in a carpeted room.\n\nThere was activity in the hallway all night Friday and Sat. You could hear the neighbors next door, obviously young drunk men telling each other NOT to sleep and keep drinking and partying.

From the time we first called till the actual event, the catering managers kept in touch and made sure everythnig was going as scheduled.  We started out with the program including interactive game for the anniversary couple, and much of the family members entertained using the DJ's microphone and sound system.  \n\nThe food was good for a catered event,  They brought the salads out in unison.  Ten minutes later, they cleared off the salad plates, and all of the entrees (chicken or beef) were put on the tables. After a half hour, the servers then removed the plates and served the dessert and coffee.  They poured wine, white or red. The serviers were good except that perv that kept staring at my nieces and almost tripped a few times because he was distracted.Then there was a two hour dance with lots of hip hop. disco. and evem some ballroom music per quest request, and the DJ kept things moving\n\nThere were some glitches overall, and none of us will stay in the Courtyard again.  Otherwise, we would go back there again, as long as we knew OJ Simpson wasn't around anywhere.", "business_id": "TKE1cyjs9q2PoqMXqEV9Eg", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-01-20", "type": "review"}

After reading reviews of the Courtyard rooms (horror stories), we decided to upgrade our room at check-in to the tower rooms for the offered minimun of $20 / night / room.  We were not disappointed.  The rooms were modern, clean, and reasonably well sound-insulated.  The rooms were nicer than at the Anaheim Hilton, where we had been the two nights prior.  We never even saw a Courtyard room, so bad were the reviews.  We ate at the Grand Cafe, and found the food to be fresh, tasty, and well prepared.  We also ate at the Feast Buffet, a good deal on it's own, and even better if you sign up for their player's club.  Very good food for breakfast and lunch- did not try the dinner.  I'd stay there again, no hesitation.  One note, check-in took a while, but I hear that generally in Vegas it takes a while to check in.  \n\nWe booked our stay through AA.com vacations, and they waived the ~$17/day resort fee- package deal special I guess.  Overall, a good value.", "business_id": "TKE1cyjs9q2PoqMXqEV9Eg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-12-31", "type": "review"}

Lack of planning on one's part should not translate to a bad rating on a hotel. \n...Hardly ever having played at the P/S, we received postcard for free nights. Figured we'd take a chance, and get some free nights booked. We travel to Vegas for Biz quite often, so why not stay for free (and save the time share points).\nWe were expecting nothing special. Check in was easy, Bell man service was excellent, Valet super simple. The first time we stayed we were bumped up to the Suite in the tower. Walking down the hall we were preparing ourselves for a good laugh. When we walked in the room, it was amazingly nice (compared to expectations). They bumped us to the best room (I have literally gambled less than $100. in the P/S), without asking. Clean, newish, very nice. Wasn't Pallazo, but wasn't $250 a night either. \nAs of this writing, we have stayed a total of 12 nights, and have paid $39.00 total (added on an extra night we had to pay for) including all taxes. Some stay were 100% zero cost. October, November, & December are great times in Vegas since it is very quiet and the hotels want your biz.\nRestaurants: Mexican Food, Fairly Standard, 7~10, Italian 4~10 (pretty cheap and nice setting, but not real great taste! Maybe their pizza is better??) Cafe for Breakfast is usually decent 7~10.  Didn't do the Oyster bar but it's packed out ALL the time, so must be good. There is a Subway and Johnny Rockets (got a 1/2 price shake with the player card!) .\nBottom Line  - Stay in the tower!!! Don't expect opulence, but clean should be expected. Bring an extra towel for yourself, they only give you two, and aren't real accommodating on extras.

Reserved through Otel, good rate, cheap and easy for the one night we would be there for a show at House Of Blues. Drove in from SLC, was on a time crunch and didn't anticipate a non disclosed $100 room deposit. Not on confirmation emails where it was clearly printed, \"includes all fees\"....ok...so my travel companion stated that it is normally common sense to anticipate a deposit at any hotel(true) & car rental, etc...this I should have thought of as we are both in banking and card services & see it all the time. Due to the spontaneous nature of the trip this didn't cross my mind but would have been something I would have noticed and could have planned for if it was disclosed at anytime before we left..instead we showed up in a hurry to get ready and go and spent a lengthy amount of time in check in line where we were told there was this $100 room deposit & had to scramble it between 2 cards & cash therefore tying up last remaining funds for gas, food, the show. Not a fun start, if Otel or the Palace had mentioned this in advance I would have planned accordingly. I didn't expect much from room since it was inexpensive, in the \u00e7ourtyard and we were just there overnight so the only complaint is the shower...the head, the pressure and temperature is not pleasant. They need to consider a small investment in upgrading these. \nUpon check out it was another long, slow line then more problems, which seemed to be the theme with others at the counters..they need to staff more people during the peak check in and out times and have some sort of sense of urgency..so, due to agent error/communication and how entered in system they were going to refund us $75, after much discussion and discovery of more hidden fee's and a manager takeover to resolve issue, we got our authorizations approved to be released, $25 on my card, $50 on his & $25 in cash minus some 8.71 fee of some sort, again not on any documentation, just looked at it and verified again(no mention of $100 hold/deposit)...manager was professional, courteous and the only redeeming part of the people we dealt with. I think I might have paid some $14.99 fee for wifi & random unused and un needed services. \nAll in all, I didn't have high, unrealistic expectations as it was inexpensive, booked through another party, but the check in and out time shaved precious minutes we needed to relax and enjoy our very limited time there.  I can say I almost 100% will not stay here again and likely will not use Otel due to the lack of $100 deposit mention on the very detailed invoice I got after booking. I called customer service one time but the nature of my question seemed lost in translation as the reps are in Turkey & their first language is Turkish. All I know is Hi, how are you(Merhaba Nasilsin) which didn't help much.

They've been around for at least 10 years, at it's just recently that this run of izakayas have emerged in town.  Perhaps that's why, but this perennially packed joint has lost some of its crowd.

I think many are not, so it would be worthwhile if you can read Japanese.  The setting is wide open so it's great for people watching, especially since it is frequented by mostly young patrons.  Service is passable, some girls are really nice and others are pretty much all business.  But your stuff comes promptly, and service is rarely something to complain about.\n\nThe food, as may be expected from a place with such a large menu, can be hit-or-miss.

So we looked at a few other places while we waited, which reaffirmed our decision to buy from the Jewelers.  No other place felt nearly as comfortable.\n\nWe did get a better idea for the overall design during our search though.  A center stone with a halo of small stones set around and below it, with more stones down the ring itself.  When we returned in the afternoon, they had the two pieces from other stores with heart diamonds in them for us to look at.  One was in a ring, and just a little to big and expensive for our budget.  The other was the right size and cost, but was mounted in a pendant.  To give us a closer look, Laci had one of the jewelers remove it.  We still weren't sure if we wanted to go with a round stone, or the heart.  Amy couldn't quite decide.\n\nThat's when Mordechai came over and offered to make up 2 rings for us.  One round, the other with the heart stone.  That way we could see them both, she could try them on, etc. before we bought.  They did ask for a deposit, but at this point we Knew we were buying something from here, so it was a no brainer.  They even have a ring we like for my wedding ring, but we'll get that closer to our wedding.  \n\nSo 2 weeks go by and we head to the store again, to see these two rings.

We were able to choose 2 different types of Korean BBQ, a soup, and a beer or soju for just about $26. This is a great deal when it comes to Korean BBQ. The portions were ideal for 2 people. Most of the waitresses were friendly and helpful; however, we had one girl as our main waitress and she was not attentive and awfully rude. She left the bulgogi (Korean marinated beef) on the stove too long and it almost burned, so I had to flip them over, cut the meat, and distribute myself. Anytime we asked her for something, she seemed angry and frustrated. We said \"thank you\" for everything she brought over (with extreme delay I might add), and I never heard her once say \"you're welcome\". She spoke fluent English, so I knew that wasn't the issue. Also, the food... I guess coming from the NYC area I am extremely biased; however, I was rather disappointed. The food wasn't bad, but it was nowhere near my expectations. The bulgogi was in large pieces and not juicy and the pork bulgogi was not spicy (pork bulgogi is supposed to be a spicy, flavorful dish). The side dishes were the most disappointing part. Usually, in Korean BBQ houses, you receive a bunch of side dishes to compliment your meal. Korean Garden BBQ House only gives about 4.

Maybe other locations are better, but this one was very underwhelming.\n\nWe wandered the furniture section for a few minutes but were never greeted or helped in any way. Even the guy working the register by the front door looked like he'd rather be anywhere but there. Not a good sign.", "business_id": "fpDFSoDPNzIFke8ZZ-yO1g", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-01-07", "type": "review"}

Well, donuts of course. Sadly, I rarely eat donuts for breakfast. Something about deep fried pieces of dough covered in sugar, sugar, and even more sugar (glazed, powdered, cinnamon sugar, etc) for breakfast seems so unhealthy. But, occasionally, I like to indulge my sweet tooth in these pillows of goodness. \n\nAfter looking over the display of donut selections, I ordered one sugar donut. Nothing fancy, just a plain donut covered all over with white sugar. The very friendly woman packed my donut in a little paper bag, and I left to go to Starbucks. Originally, I planned to eat my donut with iced coffee, but I made the mistake of trying a little piece in the car. When I arrived at Starbucks, only half remained of my sugar donut, leading me (but not my tummy) to regret only buying one donut. \n\nThe donut itself was very good. Much more soft and fluffy than the dense, sometimes stale supermarket donuts, less sweet than the sugary morsels at Krispy Kreme, and definitely tastier than Dunkin Donuts and other donut chains. Ronald's sugar donut was one of the best sugar donuts I've eaten (my favorite sugar donut being from a bakery in Korea). Crispy on the outside thanks to the sugar and freshness of the donut while being soft and light in the inside. The best thing about this donut was it wasn't too sweet, which was perfect for me. Also, these donuts are vegan, which somehow makes these donuts more healthy than the regular donut (or at least I'd like to believe that). \n\nWhenever I'm in the mood for donuts and I happen to be in that area at the right time of the day, I'll stop by Ronald's Donuts to try another one of their highly-rated donuts.", "business_id": "w4SGmsvFzqyAIs7CSQ_J-g", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-12-16", "type": "review"}

I had the pleasure -I use this term loosely- to visit Roxy's Diner during my Stratosphere Hotel stay during mid-March 2013. My cousin and I went to the Casino floor to hit up Starbucks then venture over to a food place for some midnight munchies. Gosh it sucks to be 18y.o and in LV; so many restrictions. Anywho, we arrived at Roxy's around 11:30pm and the hostess came and sat us by the kitchen. Our waitress didn't come to our table for ten minutes. It wasn't even half-max capacity in all of the diner. More like fifteen people who were already served.\nThe waitress finally comes with the gnarliest attitude known to man and takes our orders. We get two cheeseburgers and onion rings to split. Let's fast forward THIRTY MINUTES later: my cousin and I are sitting there at the kitchen counter waiting for our food. I had Goshly patience that night because my cousin was about to blow a casket. Appartently the sh*tface waitress never put our order in!!!! What the f......? The chef who had seen us sitting there like two big barneys on his way to and from his break saved the night. He politely re-took our order, gave us a fifteen minute wait time, then proceeded to hook us up Thank You Bob. Our burgers and onion rings were superb and The Chef gave us an order of shrimp with french fries *on the house*. All the food was delicious (we ate in our room).\nWhats hilarious is the fact the waitress finally came back with a check in her hand and plopped it down on the counter. Succubus. But I digress. I tipped The Chef for all his kindness and this little experience didn't deter my Roxy's adventures that happened the next day *wink, wink*. We'll leave that one for next time.\n\nWhat you can take away from this overdue review: be patient, very patient. You'll never know who will come save the day. Also, screw that waitress.", "business_id": "83C1eqPfmQHTy_8MC4Ug6w", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-01-20", "type": "review"}

It was my best friends wedding night so I came with him and his husband. Sigh. I'm not gonna lie...when we first came into the room we were kinda sad. There were about...4-5 guys maybe? It was a Saturday night so I thought that was kinda wack.  We sat near the stage where this clown was dancing around with a slinky hangin from his package...uhhh....if you wanna dance around with a slinky I'm gonna need for something to FILL the slinky. Otherwise, you look silly, sir. He came up to me, grabbed my hand and claimed he was waiting for me to loosen up...uhh..I was just waiting for him to get off the stage.  Or at least lose the damn slinky, it's not like he was bad looking but I'm sorry, I just can't get over the corniness of that thing.  \n\nAnyway, we endured this dude for a couple more mins hoping someone would catch our eye. By the time he was finished, my friends were over it because it was clear the strippers weren't into making money...my friends are gay and it was made clear to them that they wouldn't be getting any attention. I don't get what the deal with that is...these guys paid money just like us ladies...get over it and do the damn thing! Their money is just as good as anyone else!! I'm pretty sure they wanted to go home and consummate the marriage anyway so it was cool. So I was left to fend for myself. I went to the bar and got liquored up because I was determined to have a good time. I waited and waited and waited...FINALLY...this sexy ass, caramel skinned dude gets on stage. He started dancing and I knew that was what I wanted...could have been the liquor that made him more appealing but who cares, for the first time the entire night I was finally excited about something!! Once he finished dancing I immediately headed for the stage and asked for a dance. I never had a lap dance from a male stripper before so I had no idea what to expect.  He took me to a semi-private area away from the stage and got to work. Siiiiiigghhhh. That shit was amazing lol. He licked, lifted and stretched me in ways I've never experience before (the licking was torso and above so don't judge too harshly lol). He was talking about something I couldn't even remember but it sounded sexy and I was half drunk so whatever he was saying really didn't matter. By the time it ended I could've sworn he said something about exchanging numbers but I can't remember clearly enough...I remember him walking away like he forgot I was supposed to be paying! but of course he came back and was like \"I actually need that 20 bucks tho\" lol! This dude really deserves 5 stars but considering I wasn't really feelin the rest of the club I settled for 3.\n\nI was riled up once that was finished so I splurged on a dance from someone else...I really should have just left with my fantasies in tact from the first dance because the 2nd guy clearly didn't know what he was doing. Oh well...u win some, u lose some!

Did not pay much attention to the cost until I got back to the house and was informed by my wife that we were charged near .23 cents per copy, (OUCH) Now we had close to an additional .45 product cost. Office Max price was .11 cents a copy. Wife went the next day to complain and was told that the heavier paper is a default setting on the copier.  She asked the manager why my husband was not asked if he wanted that paper or made aware of the added cost.  His response was that because I wanted the copies right then, they will not change the default.  My wife told them this is a poor way to do business.  They need to let the customer know that they will be paying double if they want the copies right then and give them the option of picking them up later.  The only thing they would do is give us 20% off of our next order.  My wife told them we will not be back.

The place definitely does look very 60s with all the yellow and orange decor. You're allowed to sit wherever you want when you come in, which is always nice. There was about 7 groups of people already in the restaurant, which was kind of surprising because it doesn't look like a place that'd be that popular. I heard one of the waitresses say to another waitress, \"wow, we have a lot of new comers today.\" So I'm guessing it's slowly getting more business\n\nWe seated ourselves and ordered coffee and orange juice; it came out immediately. The coffee was pretty good, I had about 3 cups! The orange juice wasn't fresh squeezed, but still refreshing. \n\nAfter looking over the decently sized breakfast menu I decided to order the Waffle Breakfast. Normally I'd get the pancake breakfast, but I wanted to try something a little different. It was only $5.95 and came with one waffle, eggs, and your choice of bacon/ham/sausage. I chose sausage of course! My boyfriend ordered the Country Breakfast for $6.25 which included 2 sausage patties, 2 eggs, home fries, and a biscuit with gravy. \n\nWhile waiting for the food to come, we noticed they had Trivial Pursuit cards stacked on the table, so we got to play that to pass the time, it was very fun! \n\nOur food came and we dug in. My waffle was Very dry, even after filling all the little squares with butter, jam, AND syrup (I know, that sounds a little overdone). It was pretty disappointing. I was hoping to have a good waffle experience, but it wasn't. I also got a sausage PATTY, which I'm not normally fond of. I mean, it obviously tastes the same, but I prefer links. My boyfriend ate all his food, but said it was mediocre. \n\nI'm sure if we ordered other dishes, like the Hash and eggs or chicken fried steak, it would've been pretty good, but we just wanted to order something different and it wasn't satisfying.

We ordered one of their dinner packages last night, knowing our 2 small children would pick off what we had. The total with tax was $29.00 and came with a HUGE amount of food! My husband really liked everything we got. Mongolian beef, sweet and sour shrimp, special fried rice, BBQ ribs, egg rolls, wonton soup, and fried shrimp.  It was a lot! My kids love wonton soup, but seemed more interested in the crunchy toppings. I wasn't a big fan of the sweet and sour shrimp as it had too much batter for my taste. So much batter - the shrimp resembled onion rings. Lol! Their fried rice was enormous, and I'd definitely order it again.  \n\nI saw that they had duck, and mu shoo, among other things.

Sometimes I wish we could give negative stars. \n\nI honestly do NOT know how this company has managed to stay in business 35 years with all the shady business practices they had. I spent all day Tuesday on the phone with them (literally 3 hours of calling back and forth)...\n\nFirst off, we were shown a lovely privately owned Townhouse by a broker on the weekend. He told us all the information he knew about it, and said that Sell-Abration manages the unit, so we would have to pay $75 for an application fee. We paid it, and got approved in 2 days.\n\nExcept, when we got approved, they approved us for a rent amount higher than what we offered. They screamed and bitched about the broker not having the right to suggest we offer a little less (The owners wanted $1030, we offered $1000). I asked if water, sewer, trash and HOA dues were included in the rent and was told yes. \n\nSuddenly next time I call, there's a magickal $200 non refundable cleaning fee (they called it a \"deposit\" but last I checked, you get deposits back). I ok it with my husband and call them back. Next they claim suddenly that we have to pay trash.\n\nWhen I point out that they said we didn't have to pay it, she said \"Well we don't MAKE the trash, so why should WE pay for it?\" \n\nNext call they claim that we have to pay for any plumbing repairs that happen in the place, that we have to pay for any malfunction in the appliances (even if we didn't cause it), and that we must pay for carpet cleaning once a year. (apparently the cleaning \"deposit\" doesn't cover that)\n\nSo my husband gives up and says \"Whatever. We like the apartment, we'll just deal with it.\" and goes in to sign paperwork. We're not happy with all these surprise fees and such, but we don't cause damage/destruction of property so it's ok. \n\nHe gets in there, and goes to pay the deposit, but... they don't have a lease available for us to look at. Who takes a deposit over $1000 and refuses to give a lease? They also then give him a piece of paper saying that if we don't enter a lease by the 19th, that our deposit is forefit. She says she'll call the owners right away to find out if they'll accept our ferrets... but then she gets a call, gets off the phone and tells Sean \"It's 4:30. I have places to be. Give me your money and get out so I can go to them.\"\n\nThankfully the next day it turns out the owners REFUSE to allow ferrets into the home, so we managed to get the deposit back and ran like hell from those rude, bitchy women. \n\nSucks we're out the $75 for the application fee though. :(\n\n----\n\ntl;dr version - Stay away from this company unless you enjoy a bunch of hidden fees popping up after you pay them for the application. They don't inform the broker of any of these charges, so that you have to pay $75 for an app. - Taking a deposit without having a lease ready to review and sign is a BIG no-no.", "business_id": "tbWpb6NSXL0spSIzIArphg", "stars": 1, "date": "2009-01-15", "type": "review"}

In my opinion old school casinos equal down to earth. The Boulder Highway corridor is home to a handful of the Las Vegas old school casinos. Off Boulder Highway at the  southwest corner of Harmon Avenue, stands the Longhorn Hotel and Casino (abbreviated Longhorn). \n\n  The Longhorn is a cramped casino with nothing to attract the eyes. Many people would agree that it is a smoky casino that could barely fit a bar. To give you an idea of the unattractiveness of the Longhorn; the hotel section is a Motel 8. Regardless that old school casinos fall short of drawing in the public with an attraction that might include a dancing water fountain or replica of Venice; they headline value. The Longhorn draws the public in with dinner specials and $1 beer. \n\n  I have paid a visit to The  Longhorn two times. The other day, I was in the vicinity of Boulder Highway at dinnertime. I was up to an inexpensive dinner in the Longhorn's Chuck Wagon Cafe. \n\n  On the weeknight that I visited, there were plenty of parking spaces in a parking lot that is overdue for a repavement. From my parking space bordering a bus stop off Boulder Highway and directly across the street from the East Cannery, it was a few footsteps to the Chuck Wagon Cafe. But before revisiting the cafe, I'd stop at the one men's room in the casino. It was clean. On the short walk from the men's room to the cafe, I took notice of an antiquated cashier counter and an advertisement for $1 beer. \n\n  I have visited Chuck Wagon Restaurant twice. The difference between the two visits was that this time  they seated me right away. The $6.99 steak special seems like a steel which draws in the public. This is one of a few dinner specials they offer. For around $10, they offer the shrimp and lobster tail and barbecue platter specials. Now that I ate their $6.99 steak specials on two occasions, I come to the conclusion that it isn't really that special. The special excludes soup that costs $2 extra. On both occasions a third of the small steak was fat that I passed over attempting to chew. In my opinion, the Boulder Highway corridor offers better dinner specials at casinos that include The Joker's Wild, the Water Street casinos in downtown Henderson, and Railroad Pass. To be fair, I am putting off a review of the Chuck Wagon Restaurant until I try their barbecue platter. \n\n  After leaving the Chuck Wagon Restaurant in the Longhorn, I walked to the bar. Considering how cramped the Longhorn is, it was a few feet away. At the bar, I enjoyed a $1 Miller while I played Caveman Keno. The patrons were upbeat and friendly. When my portable battery charger dropped, we were joking that it sounded like a gun went off. The Longhorn is a down to earth casino. \n\n  I appreciate the old school casinos that in my opinion are down to earth. The disheartening thing is there are less of them. Once their gone their gone. I  see myself returning to the Longhorn sometime in the future to try the barbecue platter in their Chuck Wagon Cafe before I unwind with a $1 Miller while I try to strike it rich playing Caveman Keno.", "business_id": "4W7yfl1ve7mRt_ImUIYE_A", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-01-14", "type": "review"}

But to be honest, for $9.99 a person for dinner, it's pretty dang good. You must have a players card to get that price (FYI, one persons card will cover up to 2 people). There is a huge variety of dishes (American, Asian, Italian, Mexican) but I would skip the Asian cuisine (it's hard to find good Asian food in Vegas... With the exception of sushi). I didn't try the prime rib but my dad seemed to enjoy it (though he and my mom REALLY enjoyed the collard greens). The albondigas soup was decent but not up to Mexican standards haha. The Mexican lasagna was delicious (it was kind of like a mix between tamales and enchiladas, good combo). The salad bar was SMALL. I was sad that there was no blue cheese. The mashed potatoes were good and the Chinese chicken nuggets were basically nuggets dipped in sweet and sour sauce. This buffet has an ice cream bar (pretty good but how can you go wrong with ice cream??) in addition to the desserts section (good variety of cakes, pies, and cookies). The service was good (all Vegas hotels have excellent service for the most part). Overall if you're starving at Sam's Town and its before 9PM, this is the place to go!

I guess what spurned this review after so long(I've been her client for a few years) is that I just had my hair done here in San Diego by someone else and I almost cried when he took the towel off my head.

You need to go see Tammy ASAP.

There were a couple of hours to use wisely ahead of my doctor's appointment at Advanced Foot &  Ankle Specialists near Mountain View Hospital. After the twenty mile drive from Henderson I was up for a Chinese Restaurant luncheon special. I was driving around the area when I decided to pull into the Lake Mead at Buffalo Smith's-anchored shopping center to see if there is a Chinese Restaurant. I was in luck when I  saw Diamond China 2. \n\n  Before stepping inside, I checked out their luncheon special menu hanging on the window. The luncheon special that is served Monday through Saturday from 11:00 am to 3 pm looked worthwhile. This menu separates the luncheon special into three price points ranging from $5.50 to $6.95. Corresponding to this review are pictures of the luncheon special and restaurant menus. The luncheon specials include a choice of white or fried rice, skinny crunchy noodles with duck sauce, hot tea, and eggflower soup for dining in. The $5.95 price point includes two cheese puffs, and the $6.95 price point includes one piece of egg roll. In similar style to many of the Chinese restaurants, the highest price point includes the shrimp-based entrees. \n\n   Diamond China 2  is a rectangular shaped restaurant. The rectangle is divided into two rooms. Customers walk into the left room where the take out counter, cash register, and view of the kitchen are. Customers that are dining in proceed into the room on the right. \n\n  The dining experience was more casual than the take-out atmosphere in a Chinese Restaurant that would include New York Chinese or China Go Go. This is a full service restaurant. And good service at that. The waitress, hostess, and cashier, who's name I believe is Grace was exceedingly polite. \n\n   At the time of further reviewing my choices, there was a pot of hot tea with a cup and a bowl of skinny crunchy noodles with duck sauce rested on the clean table. I have reviewed several Chinese restaurants in the Las Vegas metropolitan area and never have I seen the waitress offer complimentary hot tea. The hot tea is delicious here. Too bad I have been unsuccessful finding the quality of hot tea that Chinese restaurants serve in a Starbuck's. But that is another review all together. I selected the chow mein soft noodles. They served it on a plate divided by fried rice to the left and the chow mein soft noodles to the right. It was delicious and in my opinion far better than the chow mein noodles served in China Go Go that are more filler than tasty. And those onions that were interspersed with the chow mein noodles added to the deliciousness of the entree. Between the crunchy noodles and the entree, I enjoyed a bowl (not a cup) of eggflower soup. \n\n   The best part of this lunch was that before a well-deserved tip, all this came to $5.95. That's a few dollars less than a fast food restaurant. The Diamond China 2 luncheon special was $5.95 well spent.", "business_id": "HNmyXUXKSr3JI2yXuU7EMQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-01-27", "type": "review"}

Many times during the 16 years I've been going there I've heard customers say \"...the cat is sick - put it to sleep...\".   Dr. Steelman will NOT put a cat to sleep if the illness is treatable.  She would only put a cat to sleep if it was to put the cat out of pain/misery.\n\nThe new building has a whole separate room for the POPPY CATS.  Visitors are always welcome and encouraged.\n\nAs far as being difficult to get appointments.  It is - she's the best - everyone wants to bring their cats to her.   Dr. Steelman doesn't work 9 - 5.   She's often at the hospital late into the night - midnight or later.   Yes, you might have to wait when to come to the hospital - Dr. Steelman doesn't rush patients.    Just know that while you're gumbling about how long it's taking that when it's YOUR TURN Dr. Steelman will spend as much time with YOUR cat as needed too.\n\nWayne B.  I'm sorry you adopted a sick cat.   I find it difficult to believe that the staff at Bonanza would just shug off symptoms of illness.    I've even had Dr. Steelman call and tell me to bring in a cat on Sunday (when they're closed) because the cat was sick.\n\nAnd for those who really can't wait for appointments.  Dr. Steelman allows people to schedule \"drop offs\".   You bring your cat in the carrier between certain morning hours and Dr. Steelman will examine the cat when she gets free time during the day.  The cats are monitored by the staff, so don't feel like your cat will be ignored.", "business_id": "SjecRG_pi3galAFTqAVqRg", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-01-14", "type": "review"}

Dessert (to share) was a bowl of berries atop a dollop of mascarpone, and was a sublime way to finish the meal. \n\nWe were there towards the end of the evening, when everyone must have been frazzled, but the service was unfailingly polite and attentive. And the fact that the restaurant pulled off such a delectable meal on one of the busiest nights of the year speaks volumes.\n\nThat being said, what could March\u00e9 Bacchus do better? If anything, the service level doesn't always reach the amazingly high standards set by the kitchen. Management is aware of this; the owners are always on the floor and very responsive. I've never met restaurateurs more committed to getting it right, and I'm quite confident they will do so.\n\nIn the meantime, Chef Stratta will be in the kitchen until he finds a permanent replacement for recently-departed executive chef Dave Middleton. Being able to enjoy Stratta's cuisine while taking in March\u00e9 Bacchus' beautiful lakeside ambiance and enviable wine selection is really quite something.

So I won't say too much about the long wait time for seating and dining. \n\nHowever, I have been a hostess before. So normally when a guest checks into a restaurant and that if you ask them to wait in the waiting area, you should write a small description what each group looks like next to their name. Here, the hostess would literally ask all the group in the waiting area if their last name was so and so. Of course I over heard this one guest said \"No, I am not them but I've been here for 20 minutes and not sat down yet\"....,,,that could of been easily avoided! Me and my boyfriend had reservation at 8 but didn't get sat until 20 minutes later, so I guess a reservation here doesn't mean too much for them. Also the bartender was the first person you see when you walk in and she takes down your name too. She was seriously emotionless and only said ok. No greetings, welcome, or a smile. Well maybe you shouldn't be the first person diners should see when they enter. \n\nI am giving this place a 4 star because of the whole dining atmosphere. It is different and probably something you won't find anywhere else in vegas. There's nothing better than drinking a glass of wine next to a beautiful lake. Such a romantic feel and location. They also have a long list of wines as well as wine bottle selection that can be purchased in the waiting area and can be brought to your table to enjoy. \n\nAs for the food, their steak Tar tar and duck breast salad were on point. Flavorful, clean, and just the right amount to share. But I am sad to say I didn't enjoy my main dish, braised short rib ravioli. It was creamy and thick, with no flavor. My boyfriend enjoyed his salmon plate though!\n\nAs for the service, they were nice but not as friendly as other places I've been too.", "business_id": "lqx--hrRwe0oK6WnFYNXlg", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-02-21", "type": "review"}

I found John Mull's Meats and Road Kill Grill on Guy Fieri's list of Las Vegas hot spots, and I knew it was sure to satisfy us both.\n\nJohn Mull's is way out by the North airport, about twelve miles or so from the south end of the strip. Needless to say, this was not a cheap cab ride by any means, so I hoped the food would be worth the trip. Their \"dining area\" consists of canopy-covered picnic tables out on some gravel. I'd bet that gets a touch warm in the summer months.\n\nEven at 1:15pm on a weekday, the line to order stretches outside the entrance door, and they only let people inside five or six at a time. It ended up taking about twenty-five minutes for us to get inside, and another twenty before we had food in hand. All of the meats were pre-sliced and sitting in metal warming trays for serving. It makes me wonder why there was such a long wait for food, since the plating involves minimal effort. The guy working the line was incredibly friendly and energetic though.\n\nTrue to form, I ordered a 3-Meat Combo of brisket, ribs, and hotlinks. For my two sides, I rather brilliantly picked a potato salad/macaroni salad duo.\n\nThe macaroni salad had a high mayo content, which the southerner in me always appreciates. I also liked the plentiful pimentos. The potato salad wasn't very different from the macaroni, as if they just used the same base and substituted potatoes for pasta. Similarities aside, I liked the macaroni salad better.\n\nMy meat trio had the hotlinks right on top, so that seemed as good a place to start as any. The casings had a nice snap, while the meat inside was very finely ground. There wasn't any smoky flavor that I could pinpoint. Even more disappointing, most of the slices weren't spicy at all either, with just one slice that had any real kick to it.\n\nThe razor-thin brisket looked more like deli meat than barbecue. Looks can certainly be deceiving though, because this brisket had a great smoke level and was incredibly tender. The flavors I found were mostly natural beef, salt, and smoke, since they had cut away all of the delicious bark. \n\nI saved the massive spare ribs for last. There was plenty of meat to go around here, that's for sure. The ribs were juicy and cooked just right, with only a slight tug needed to separate meat from bone. I tasted some smoke, but not as much as I expected. Smokelessness aside, the slightly sweet glaze was a great flavor addition.\n\nEating outdoors is something I'm rather accustomed to, but what I don't enjoy is having to spend the entire time fending off swarms of bees. I had to sacrifice my sugary soda just to get them away from me long enough to eat. My overall impression of John Mull's was that they're definitely lacking in terms of organization. Between the $100.00 worth of round trip taxi time (including tips) and the excessive and unnecessary wait for food, I don't think John Mull's is worth all the trouble.", "business_id": "lAher1puKzN9r3LALx-JqQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-02-11", "type": "review"}

It has never been that big of a deal. The Casino is kinda trashy and looks old. All the girls are decked out in the Hooters girl uniform of hot shorts and tanks. I guess it keeps the gamblers distracted? The clientele is mostly male or couples who enjoy Nascar.\n     We ate at  the restaurant and sat at the bar. The bartenders seemed kinda surly. I guess I wouldn't be so peachy if creepy guys were staring at me all day either. We ordered wings and a couple of vodka sodas. The wings like at all Hooters were pretty good. Our drinks were so bad!

We arrived on Thursday afternoon and while Hooter's doesn't have their own shuttle, the airport has shuttles going anywhere on the strip for a fair price (I think mine was $12 round trip). We checked in and the guy at the front desk was really nice. I told him we were there celebrating my birthday and he upgraded us to a tower room on the 18th floor! Very cool, especially since it seemed like there we a lot of people there already.\n\nThe room itself was pretty standard. I kind of felt like I had gone back in time though. The room screamed 1976, but then again, you need to remember what hotel you're in. One thing I wasn't crazy about was that they had this great vanity area for getting ready, but someone forgot to put outlets near them... Everything was clean, but the beds had this comforter thing made out of funny material and it was that and the sheets on the bed. I thought about calling down to see if I could get a normal blanket, but decided it wasn't a big deal. \n\nThe casino is somewhat small, but the slots are kind of loose. My first day there I won $150 on slots alone. They advertise 24/7 $3 Blackjack, but I never saw any tables. \n\nThe walk to the strip was about 10 minutes from our room to the front of the MGM. Not too bad, but don't forget anything at your hotel because it sucks to walk back. I spent more on cabs than I wanted to, but if you think about it, Hooters pretty much paid for them with the money I won.\n\nI don't know if I would stay here again.

That answer gets you bonus points. \n\nThis review is for the Hooters restaurant and Casino. I did not stay in a room. Nor would I, because the wood paneling and the bright orange was just too much! I imagine this elegant motif carries itself through to the rooms. Much much too demure a place for me to handle staying there. \n\nHooters remains true to their motto. They stay tacky. And they own it, which is why I actually like it. The waitresses still walk around with their logo tank tops, nylon covered ass cheeks, LA Gear tennis shoes and tube socks. It comforts me to know that I experience Hooters the same way patrons did when the place first opened.\n\nI like their wings and fried pickles, although I will admit, the food here, no matter the location, is always mediocre.

You see, they come from environs where Asians are not a small minority, but a small majority.  Just by virtue of sheer statistics, I'd expect that the pho experiences they've had are \"better.\"\n\nThat said, I love pho.  I've been eating it for years.  I've lived in NoCal and SoCal, and in my opinion, Pho Saigon 8's a good joint.  As the best in Vegas, it may not better the best in Cali, but I still only go here whenever I crave pho since I live here in Vegas - and I have frequent cravings.  I've eaten pho from about half a dozen different spots in Vegas, and this is the best one out of all of them from a value and pho quality standpoint.  Pricing is pretty reasonable - not a killer deal, but a very good one relative to the other pho restaurants in the area.  There's a wide variety of different pho combinations (deriving from variety in the combinations of beef offered, from flank to tendon to beef balls to tripe).  One observer noted that the broth is quite salty and not oily - she is dead on.  I have a weakness for saltiness, so I don't mind it, but you'll be reaching for water after you finish your pho, especially if you delve into the broth.  Another small plus is that they are quite generous with the basil and sprouts add ons relative to other Vietnamese restaurants I've had pho at.\n\nAlso, since the restaurant is relatively new, the dining area seems relatively clean, if spartan.  Pho Saigon 8 always seems busy whenever I go, which is good from a food turnover standpoint.  The bathrooms aren't particularly nice...a bit skeevy...but could be much worse - by Asian restaurant standards, I'd say it's slightly above average.  The servers are generally workmanlike; not particularly friendly, but not rude either.  You may have to work to get their attention if you need something though, and they never check up on you after serving you your food like non-Asian restaurants.  The non-pho dishes I've eaten and seen eaten by friends have always been of comparable quality to the pho too.  The pho comes out quickly, and the restaurant can accommodate everyone from single diners to large groups.  \n\nI'd like to give this a 4.5 out of 5, but since you have to award a 4 or 5, I'm giving it a 5 because I eat here regularly as a fan of pho, it has very good value, and I believe it to be the best Vietnamese food in the area.  As a bonus, they don't have any annoying credit card minimums which seem to sneak up on you in some of the local Asian restaurants.", "business_id": "33aOj9haiHsULCUmFOZ7uQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-12-21", "type": "review"}

I was a little disappointed with the over all experience though as there were two vehicles, exactly the same 2011 GMC Terrains, same equipment, both within $500 of each other. When I came in to finish the paperwork, one had been dropped to $17,998, from $22,500. So I chose that one instead, as they remained firm on the price of my original choice $22,998. I was told that the mark down was a mistake, but they would honor it. The very next day the price of my original choice went down to $17,998 as well. Which I found out when I had to drive back down to sign additional paperwork, Certified certificate (?) the very next day. Frustrating, but I get it, but if they would have been more flexible on the price of my original choice, I would have paid more than $17,998 and taken it, since it had less miles. By the way, my original choice is still sitting on the lot, even at $17,998. \nWhen I went to take it on my very first trip, my dad checked the oil for me, and we were both puzzled over the fact that there didn't seem to be any oil in the car. So I took it to a shop that was close to where I was purchasing gas, because although I am NOT a mechanic I do know that engines are supposed to have oil, the mechanic at that shop was super friendly and confirmed that the engine was about a quart low. I watched him pout another quart of oil into the CERTIFIED VEHICLE that I had had for just over ONE WEEK!\nThen the coup de grace, I went to the DMV on Monday, 2/10/14, (my only day off this week), and spent 4.5 hours waiting (I get it, that's NOT AutoNations fault :-), when my number was up I sat down at the window, started to go over the paperwork, and was informed that the smog had expired the WEEK BEFORE! She told me there was nothing that she could do, and told me that I would have to come back the next day. On the way home I called Wayne and told him what had happened, explaining the situation in full as my temp registration was expiring on the 11th, he was great, told me to bring the car back down anytime and they would smog it for me and go to the DMV for me. GREAT!! Great customer service and service recovery. I took the car to my parents, as I can't just take time off to spend at the dealer or DMV. I called the next morning, yesterday as it happens, and spoke to Steven, who said that I would have to wait for Rob to get in at Noon because he wasn't aware of what they had worked out (good thing I didn't take the day off). So my parents took the car in after noon and they smogged it, but then said that they would not be able to go to the DMV in time and that we would have to go BACK TO THE DMV. My dad didn't want to let the temp expire so he spent the rest of his day at the DMV. It's bad enough that I had to ask them to go down and get it smogged, but then for him to have to spend his day at the DMV was ridiculous! He's retired but his time, anyones time, is more valuable than that, in light that it was a simple mistake that could have been caught and rectified prior to me driving off any one of the times that I was down there.  \n\nSo, while I have recommended the Terrain, it's great (now that it has oil), I would hesitate to recommend AutoNation. You're people are great, but you're processes, quite frankly, suck. \n\nThank you for your time! \nGabi", "business_id": "_kTq21tqta7cPkkJYTtcqQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-02-12", "type": "review"}

Much of Buddhism does not fall under the general \"religion\" rules.  No prosthelytizing, no supernatural beliefs or dogma and no belief in a \"heaven and hell\" or all-knowing higher power.\n\nThe SGI-USA Buddhist Center focuses on a particular brand of Buddhism known as Soka-Gakkai, which is the most established and followed form of Buddhism in the United States.  I was told that the President of the global organization donated some of his personal money to cover much of the costs of construction because he felt the Las Vegas area was a crucial place to have a presence.\n\nI went to the community center a few months back to check it all out.  Luckily I got to see one of the monthly valley-wide meetings that everyone attends.  You're likely to hear a lot of chanting, perhaps a video from an SGI presidential address in Japan, and lots of people talking about how Buddhism has improved their lives.  What struck me most is the diversity.  You'll find people from all ages, races, and walks of life.  No formal dress code.  Just come as you are.\n\nThere are plenty of volunteers who are there to explain SGI Buddhism  to newcomers.  Much of the day-to-day and weekly experiences involve attending smaller meetings with people in your neighborhood, often hosted at a member's home.

I have never seen anyone as shady and dishonest as Al Rehman. During my visit at Dessert Nissan Las Vegas I have repeatedly explained that I WILL NOT be taking the car home on the same day. Al keeps pushing for a President-Day sale and rudely ripped up the lease proposal in front of my friends and I when he couldn't force it on us. \n\nI went to look for an Altima to lease in my name because the lease on my family car is about to end. I have previously looked at Fletcher Jones Toyota so I know even though I'm 24 and haven't financed s before, I have no issue leasing by myself between my income and credit score. I was approved for a 2014 Camry SE with $1500 down MSRP $27,106 before any negotiation. The Altima I looked at yesterday was roughly $23,000 MSRP. \n\n\nAfter running my credit Al came back and told me they only finance to 1st time auto buyers and not lease. However if I wanted to lease he would make an exception for me (typical sales strategy) but I'd have to put $3 - 4k down to drive off. It's funny to me how a camry that cost $4000 more only wants $1500 down and he is asking for so much more but I do understand every dealership has different policies so I thought altima just wasn't for me. As I was getting ready to leave Al then asked me how much I would put down and I said no more than 2k. He does his little walk around the desk and came back to tell me \"that would be the lowest they would go\" and then explains the rest of the proposal to me. So finally we are both clear on the fact that I could lease by myself. In the next half an hour he tried to trick me into signing the proposal before picking out a color; he lied about the car not having bluetooth audio and said if I want that it would be at least another k until I confronted him to look at the window feature breakdown of the car I test drove. I highly doubt an experienced car sales would not know what their base model comes with so it is very shady to trick your customers into thinking they have to pay more for something that comes with the car so you can milk your commission.\n\nAt last I explained to him once again I would be able to make a final decision within the next few days but I want to find out insurance and registration details first. This is my first car I'm going to make certain of my decision and not drive it straight off the lot. He tells me I would never get a deal like today and walks off ripping the proposal.\n\nI really hope my experience would be helpful to anyone trying to buy a car at Dessert Nissan Las Vegas.

Group of 5. Spent almost 2 and a half hours there, entirely waiting for food. Went as a suggestion from a friend, because it was the only Thai joint around with extended hours, (until 3am I believe). Decor was tacky, unnecessarily dimly lit and noticed there was stage with a DJ booth and microphone for karaoke.

Starving, our entire group scoffed it down, but was left extremely agitated due to its painfully stingy portions. This exact thing happened every 10 minutes per dish, coming out one by one, often bland and unexciting. It also didn't help that our waiter never seemed to care, even as we deliberately showed signs that we were impatient and unstatisfied. Not a single word, apology or update on the speed of the food.
