Not only is the staff incompetent, but they are very rude and treat you with disrespect. Their main concern is collecting money from patients and do not care about how the patient is feeling. Today I took a friend of mine, who has been sick for 3 days with a high temperature of 103, to visit  this office because he didn't have health insurance and I wanted to pay for him in order for him to receive care. They charged me $200 and we waited to be seen. Our regular doctor, Dr. Chris was unavailable and Dr. Dino was busy, so we were forced to see Dr. Kristen Spratt. Anybody who has has ever used Dr. Kristen Spratt would understand when I say she is incompetent. I guess these days anyone can become a doctor since a letter score of C in medical school is considered to be passing. That's not my point anyway. So Dr. Kristen Spratt checked my friend, if that's what you want to call it, and said that even though you have a high temperature and are very sick I cannot give you any medicine and you will have to wait and if you are still sick by the end of the week come back Monday. I explained to this genius doctor that my friend is very sick and can't wait and needs medicine and cannot come back because he does not have health insurance and can't afford to come back. So she got very emotional and denied giving him medicine. I asked to speak to Dr. Dino regarding this matter and he refused to see me. After my friend and I left, I recieved a call from the office saying that I am no longer welcomed at their office and I was in effect kicked out. Not to mention my family and I have been patients of theirs for a long time and we have brought Dr. Dino a lot of business over the past years.  I am a very sick man and need doctor care and it is very bad for Dr. Dino to refuse to see me. I am very disappointed by the way I was treated and would like for everyone to know about his office and to not go visit this very poor example of a medical establishment.

So long, in fact, that he has moved offices.  That is probably not all that uncommon.  More so is that doctors change the rules of their practices to make seeing them that much of an onerous process.  I have gone through that too.  A while back, this happened here, and Carolina Neurological rewrote their terms of service (or whatever it is called) so that if you are X minutes late to an appointment, you have to reschedule.  Guess who was X minutes late?\n\nReally, it is not that I have a problem with such a policy.  What I do have a problem with is that they said that they could still fit me in, and some X + Y (note that I did not use variable K, nor did I multiply so as to end up with K * Y, as that could result in KY, which is for another review) minutes later, I was told that I could not, in fact, keep my appointment.

I met her on her first day at work there at MMG Uptown office.  She was young and full of energy.  That has never charged.  She has helped me through minor ailments and major chronic diseases that I have experienced.  She is very smart, energetic, caring, compassionate and professional.  I left out one important fact.  She is extremely bright and keeps abreast of all the new information and procedures that become available on human physical and mental health issues.  She volunteers every year to help the needy and works several times a year in the hospitals to keep informed on the regular procedures and problems that arise there.\n\nOne of the things I like most about her is she is a Christian.  She prays for her patients regularly and cares about their families and how things are going at home and at work.  In my opinion,  you will not find a better doctor here in Charlotte,  North Carolina.  She is a Family Practitioner / Internist and has been rated one of the Best Doctors In America year after year.  That speaks volumes.\n\nI think it is important to recognize Doctor's who are making a difference in the world and Doctor Robinson is one of those Doctors.  I feel lucky to call her my Doctor.\n\nNew Comment. (UPDATE)\nI have been with MMG for about 20 years now.  When I call in to get an appointment now days my Primary Doctor, Dr. Robinson has No appointments available for sometimes 6-8 weeks.  The staff encourages me to go to her Nurse Practitioner or another available doctor.  I say no I want to see my doctor.  I guess when you get your quota of patients you are assigned a Nurse Practitioner.  I don't know?  You build up a familiarity  with your doctor and a history of all of your tests, past issues, current issues and then you can't see your own doctor it doesn't suit well with me.  Maybe a small, more family style of doctor/practice is the best way to go. They would perhaps be more available to the patients they see. It seems like in a large practice like MMG, you seem  to get thrown around a lot over the years. I truly feel bad for leading the readers of YELP to possibly be unable to get an appointment with her, their new recommended, doctor and then be unhappy with the service.   What bothers me the most is if you can't get an appointment with your doctor they will suggest that you see another available doctor.  When you are late for an appointment if it is more than 15 minutes late you may as well turn around and go home. If you go up to see your doctor after being 15 minutes late, they don't offer any options.   No one will care why you're late,  what happened to you on the way, or anything.  They just put you down on the books as a no show.  This happened to me recently and I had a broken ankle was using a new cane to get around,  had to walk a long way in the parking deck and I was walking very slowly. When I got up to the receptionist no one cared if I was in a tragic accident on the way to the appointment, if I got pulled over for some reason, if my child got sick at school and I had to pick him up on the way which put me behind some, or if I was sick as a dog and had to pull over in order to vomit several times, or couldn't find a close enough parking space and had to ride around looking and looking for a handicap space to park. No excuses mattered that was obvious because they didn't care why I was late.  All I got was reschedule.

First, I met with Dr. Moore in July 2011 and she was great. She was friendly, knowledgeable. I liked her a lot. I don't think it's appropriate to get into detail, but it was the least painful woman check up ever. If you're local and plan to stay local, I highly recommend. \n\nHowever, in December of 2012 my parents got a certified letter saying I failed to keep my follow up appointment (which I never made) to check on my diagnosis of dysplasia. Uhm WHAT? I assumed my results were normal since I heard nothing for a year and a half. When I called to figure out what on earth happened, I found out that my results were abnormal. When I didn't come back in July of 2012 (because I moved to Boston) it flagged them to follow up with me. I guess that took 6 months because the letter came when I was home for Christmas. \n\nSo not only was the letter misleading (it insinuated I was pre-cancerous when I was not) and my results were not communicated with me, but on top of that the nurse I spoke to was outrageously rude to me. She seemed annoyed with me for being worked up about the letter and tried to intimate that it was my fault for not coming back in July 2012. She didn't seem to understand that I had no knowledge of the abnormal results or why I would be upset about a certified letter saying I could get cancer if I continue to ignore this diagnosis. \n\nNow my blood tests are exhibiting discrepancies consistent with some leukemias and I remembered this. I called the office again to ask about my medical records (the receptionist was very helpful and great!) and to have someone call me back to refresh my memory on my abnormal results. Once again, the nurse's attitude was inexcusable. She started interrogating me on my follow up care, asking why I hadn't been back since 2011 and why I thought I had two, normal results consecutively if I didn't. I had to once again explain that her office didn't notify me until DECEMBER 2012 and my last pap was in JULY 2012. \n\nLast, and this is the best part, she started questioning my current sexual information (Do you have a boyfriend? Do you use condoms?). I felt it was highly inappropriate, not least of all because I don't know actually who I'm speaking with. I'm still not entirely clear on how someone can be so rude to a scared patient, and I don't understand their follow up policies at all.

We have seen several doctors at the practice and love them all. They are so nice, so friendly and always ask me, as a mom, what my gut tells me and how I feel. This is something that has made me appreciate this practice so much more. They understand that while what they're treating our children for might be something they see regularly, it can be terrifying for us as parents. They allow us to ask all the questions we have until we feel we have the answers and have been adequately informed. After we moved to Charlotte from California, my son's primary doctor took the time to go over the California vaccination schedule with me and compare it with the North Carolina schedule. He spent plenty of time talking about each one and making necessary adjustments, taking into account the amount of time we still spend in California.

I could not wait to go to Dr. Johnstone's office to tell her the news & talk with her about the prenatal care that was to come.  Unfortunately, due to the fact that it's a 45 minute to a 1 hour drive to Dr. Johnstone's office, my husband asked if I could please find a doctor closer to our home in North Scottsdale to go to for the prenatal care as he did not see any sense in driving so far south to frequent appointments when there were perfectly capable doctors much closer to home.\n\nHesitantly, I agreed to switch doctors.  I asked my primary care physician at Mayo Clinic Thunderbird who she would recommend and she gave me the name of an OBGYN only about 15 minutes from my home.  My husband and I visited them for several appointments.  The doctor and the office staff were courteous and nice.  They seemed to know what they were doing/talking about.  However, this doctor WAS NOT Dr. Johnstone.  I missed her, her patience with my questions, her terrific way of explaining things to me in a way I could understand, etc.  \n\nAfter I cried and cried to my husband to PLEASE let me switch back, I returned to Dr. Johnstone late in my 2nd trimester for the remainder of my pregnancy.

They are running a business and sometimes they are very busy and down to business, but I find that if you greet them with a positive attitude, a smile, and your respect, they will be equally respectful to you.  \n\nI would definitely recommend Dr. Johnstone and her practice to anyone.  It is true sometimes they run behind and you need to wait to be taken back for your appointment a little late.  I am not put off by this as I worked for Social Security for approximately 8 years and I understand what it's like to fall behind when giving your full time and attention to each individual as they deserve.  Also, I would imagine it would be reasonable to think some patients may be a little late for their appointments causing the whole office to fall a little bit behind.

Dr. Drewitz  (and a few others) got pretty awesome reviews elsewhere online and was a peer-voted TOP DOC in the Phoenix Magazine. While that's not the patients voting, Yelpers, I suggest you do your own research. \n\nNote: I will update my review if I need to go back.\n\nNow to my experience. I called with digestive stress thinking it was a pretty serious episode that I was having. They got me in quickly but with a young doctor that hadn't received very good online reviews. They were quick to assign this one to me and although i was leery, I decided to just give this guy the benefit of the doubt.\n\nAs another Yelper just before me mentioned, although I don't know if we had the same doc, the bedside manner was virtually non-existent. While he may just have a laid back personality, professionally, I prefer my docs to act like they give a shit.\n\nSo then after asking me a few perfunctory questions about my current symptoms, he does the \"stethoscope to the heart and back\" routine and sends me to a kind woman to schedule my CT scan at a local Imaging place. Again, they got me in pretty quickly.\n\nHere's where it went awry for me. I went in for the scan on a Friday and the CT techs said the drs. office would receive results in 2 to 3 bus. days. I called Digestive Health Center - Coronado in 4. They had the results but the dr. had to sign off so someone could tell me my results and hadn't. Meanwhile, I'm beginning to panic cause NO NEWS IS BAD NEWS when you're a patient with a condition.\n\nEIGHT BUSINESS DAYS LATER, I call back like WTF? The assistant was apologetic but noted he STILL hadn't signed off on my results. Now remember , that this is simply so they can tell me something IS or ISNT wrong with me. Jeez!!!!!\n\nSo I said I need another doctor then. An hour or two later another doctor calls back to tell me all is fine. For this frustrating episode, I receive a dang near $200 bill (after insurance pays their part and note how quickly THAT arrived vs. how slow the follow up was) and after paying $350 out of pocket for a CT scan.

The office staff in the pre-op section of the clinic was abrupt and unfriendly much like the reception I received from Dr. Sweeten.  When Dr. Sweeten entered the exam room for my consultation visit, she didn't introduce herself, opting to jump immediately into taking medical history notes.  She was dressed in decorative scrubs, so I just assumed that she was another office staff member.  Dr. Sweeten pulled out a couple of diagrams of the female reproductive organs and began to chicken scratch on them as she described the procedures she intended to perform based on my symptoms.   My inner voice questioned if I was making the right decision, but I was under the gun as the end of my medical plan year ended, so I decided to schedule additional procedures.  As I spoke with the office assistant in charge of scheduling, I mentioned that Dr. Sweeten might want to upgrade her systems in place to describe the procedures to patients.  I politely suggested that the office might want to consider updating their handouts such that Dr. Sweeten doesn't have to write upside-down on the handouts from how the diagrams are oriented, adding that printed information about the procedure would be nice.   The receptionist in the out-patient clinic section of the facility was a little more courteous.  The clinic scheduling system was a nightmare.  I had to wait for more than an hour for both of my procedures as at least ten to fifteen other people waited in the waiting room for either their appointments or to pick patients up.  Once I got back to the exam room to change into a gown, I saw lint balls on the floor and a black handprint on the exam room table.  The clinic staff handed me a plastic milk crate IN which my hospital gown was placed and directed me to place my shoes and clothes.  The clinic staff appeared annoyed that I asked for a different gown that had not been in a crate that others' had already used to place their shoes.  Dr. Sweeten met me in the pre-op waiting area prior to my first proceedure.  In reference to the suggestions I made about her pre-op consultation, she curtly and sarcastically stated, \"I hear that you didn't like my drawings,\" to which I politely responded, \"No I didn't.  I think that you could put together something in Microsoft Word that would look much more professional.\"  I didn't get a response.  The short version of the story is that my period and vaginal discharge continued without interruption for approximately 5 weeks, as the doctor advised.  I then had a \"period\" for one day that included minimal spotting of which I was also advised was possible.  Three months after the procedure, I'm back to having a painful full period with clotting just I had prior to my procedures.  I knew that the return of my period was possible as stated by Dr. Sweeten, but something in the back of my mind wonders...  wonders about a lot of things...", "business_id": "kOT8AO8e1e3J9pUBJ2C7Iw", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-02-01", "type": "review"}

She was kind, down-to-earth, smart and a good listener. However, in the end it was the doctor and one of the front office staff members who are the reasons why I won't return to this practice. As a 30-year-old married woman who moved to Scottsdale from CA, I was hoping to establish a relationship with an OBGYN here in the Valley so that I already have a trusting relationship with a doctor when my husband and I decide to have a baby. I was a happy patient of my last doctor for 12 years.  I scheduled my first appointment at this practice as a new patient and was seen by Whitney Padgett. It has always been my understanding that standards of care require doctors to actually see a patient if it is his or her first time going to a specialist. I was a bit shocked that I was seen only by Whitney and never a doctor at all, even though I was new to the practice. This aside, I returned for a second appointment and this time I saw Dr. Carol Hahn. I came to my appointment with Dr. Hahn for a problem and not the usual annual appointment, so naturally I was a bit worried. From the moment she walked in, Dr. Hahn was curt and condescending. She spoke to me as if I were below her. (I'm a professional working women who is married to a doctor) She typed notes on her keyboard with little eye contact. And, at one point corrected me as I was speaking about my health and at another point she made an unprofessional joke while performing my exam. However, the real shock to me came when she tilted her head down and asked me in a tone as if I was a teenage girl, \"Are you sexually active?\" I know this is a standard question, but my chart indicates that I am a married woman and that I take oral birth control for pregnancy prevention. Do you think she could have read my chart?? Or perhaps glanced at the clinical notes from my first visit to the practice? As I left this appointment, I was paying my co-pay and getting ready to head to work, I was told that I could not leave without paying the bill from my previous appointment. I explained that I had just received the bill two days prior for my previous appointment and had it at work with a stamp in my outgoing mail. I was told that I could not leave the building without paying that bill in person right then and there. When I explained that I'm still within the due date and that I have it ready to go in the mail, the lady told me that I would need to wait for a manager to approve it before I could leave. I told her that I needed to get to work and that I did not have the time to discuss this. I put the charge on my credit card to appease them and finally walked out the door. I can tell you that I will never return to this practice again. From the level of care I received to the treatment and finally the billing practices, this place was an unpleasant experience.", "business_id": "eovEq5kDSdf0WF_P_bD2Uw", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-02-27", "type": "review"}

When we met with that first surgeon, he said he could help our son but given the size and placement of the cyst and the risk of it breaking, he recommended that we go to someone who handles these type of cases more often. We asked who he would recommend if it were his son, and he said Dr. Shindell.\n\nWhen we called Dr. Shindell's office, they were able to get us in for an appointment the next day. Needless to say, we were extremely anxious, but Dr. Shindell's calm demeanor and extensive experience helped us worry less. He explained all the options (including a brand new procedure that just finished clinical trials) and possible long-term effects. There was absolutely no pressure to take any one option over the others, and he was willing to give us the weekend to think over our options.\n\nIt took us about 20-minutes to decide what to do. Dr. Shindell immediately set up the surgery date and called Hanger Orthotics to squeezed us in for a fitting even though it was the end of day on a Friday.\n\nThe following week, our son had his surgery (would have been sooner, but we had to wait for his custom brace to be made). Dr. Shindell met us at the hospital to explain the details of the surgery ahead of time. After the surgery, he met us in the waiting room and explained the recovery plan and what to expect.

The waiting room was modern and comfortable, employees friendly. They ran a few tests on my vision, gave me an update on next steps, then dialated my eyes, sent me to wait in the waiting room, and then they called me back to give me my estimate.

They called me back for the surgery (with someone else) and then we waited in that room for almost 45 minutes. The whole time we could hear the employees laughing, telling stories and shooting the breeze. It was really annoying. When I finally went in, the procedure took approx 5 minutes per eye and they did a great job talking you through it the whole time. It was painless. They also provided sunglasses and goggles to sleep in. From start to finish, I was out in 2 hours. My husband was a little pissed because he was prepared to pick me up in more like 3.5 hours, not 2. Big difference. \n\nOn my day after, I didn't need glasses. At my check-up, I was almost 20/20 and was at 20/20 by my 2 week check-up. I am incredibly pleased with the results.

I took away a star for the long wait times, going back and forth between waiting and examination rooms, and the misquote with how long the procedure would be. \n\nOne nice thing they did was call me before my 2 week appt to ask if I wanted to reschedule.

I don't know how much he truly \"hears\" me, but I think he tries.  The office manager is a different story.  I had a visit in early 2013 and reported difficulty breathing.  The doctor was supposed to call in an inhaler.  Two days later, nothing had been called in.  I followed up and was again told it was called in.  Went to the pharmacy (verified location) and they had received nothing.  I went back a few months later for stomach virus symptoms.  The initial visit and mishap was totally disregarded and not even \"remembered\" for that matter.  I had to pay another visit shortly after because my symptoms were not getting better.  Nothing was done, and I spent about 5 minutes with the doctor.  I was told it would get better on its own.  Now...  Since September, I have had an open balance with this office, and I SHOULD have called to pay it sooner.  Having said that, I can also say there is no justification for the message left on my voice mail by the office manager.  It was downright rude and condescending.  She was shaming me and bringing up my place of employment.  I was totally shocked at how unprofessional her message was.  Needless to say, she got what she wanted...  but I will not go back to that office...  the mediocre service was semi-acceptable; however, the office manager's disrespectful and inappropriate behaviour is totally OVER THE LINE.", "business_id": "BZqn7i_Z-MJ1QrxCyjFZSw", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-02-20", "type": "review"}

Dr. DeSanto always listens to questions reasonably, isn't a meds pusher, reassures when parts of pregnancy that are wacky are just natural progressions. When DD2 had her shoulders stuck, he managed to get her out and keep me calm at the same time. He genuinely cares about seeing the baby and having ultrasounds. Unlike many other doctors he doesn't hold back on ultrasounds, communicating expectations for the current and future appointments & post-partum. I love Esther his nurse also. I have seen the NP in the past, she was also magnificent. I don't ever want another OBGYN!", "business_id": "nEaJwY77drRqQkJqcd9LRg", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-01-06", "type": "review"}

She's straightforward, no sugar coating, no emotion, no small talk, just strictly to the point. That's usually not my go to type of doctor but besides the personality factor I didn't have any other reason to switch at the time. \nI guess I should have gotten worried when she prescribed Zoloft for me because I was \"depressed\". I've never been treated for depression nor had any other doctor ever bring it up. I was young, unmarried, still in school and pregnant with horrible morning sickness. Would you be thrilled? I did not take the Zoloft, which now has a huge law suit for birth defects! She also wanted to give me zofran for my morning sickness which I refused to take as well. \nI went into labor at the hospital at 8pm and dilated until about 4 am that morning. Dr. O'sullivan didn't show up until almost 6am. My daughter sat in the birth canal so long that when she was born she was not breathing. My heart dropped when I didn't hear my baby crying. What did the doctor do? Nothing! Absolutely nothing. She stood there looking so confused. The nurses ran the baby over to the table and called a code. Other nurses literally ran in and revived my daughter getting her to breathe. Dr . O'sullivan did not even touch my daughter once while all that happened she just watched. If it wasnt for the amazing staff at good Sam my daughter would not be here or may have had long term effects. Even worse is that the same thing happened to my cousin. Dr O'sullivan was her OB and took a very long time to show up at the hospital as well. My cousin had already had two children so she knew the risks of waiting and told the hospital she's not waiting anymore so go get the doctor on staff. The dr at the hospital delivered her baby with no problems but just imagine if she had waited for Dr. O'sullivan to show up what could have happened.", "business_id": "nEaJwY77drRqQkJqcd9LRg", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-12-18", "type": "review"}

This office has been very difficult since I started going there last month for my pregnancy.  I was referred by a friend to Dr O'Sullivan and because of an emergency I was only able to get in with Dr De Santo.  I have had about 3 about in a 6 week time.  The three appointments I had made were made to my convenience, around my work schedule.  I was called three times, once for each appointment to reschedule.  These reschedules had nothing to do with the doc running to the hospital to deliver a baby, they were simple errors made at the front desk.. on three different occasions.  Very frustrating to say the least.  I had to reschedule all three of my appointments and miss work each time.  Every time they called to reschedule, I would still get a reminder call for the appt they had just cancelled (which was automated and after hours).  Not only was that annoying, but I worried I would be charge a no show fee (with their own fault) and would call them first thing in the morning to point out their fault and to make sure I didn't have an appt.  They never sounded surprised that I was telling them that THEY had rescheduled me and that I didn't'  have an appt.  One day, I had to stop by in the morning, first thing to give blood.   I was told that they open at 8--and that was great because I wouldn't be missing work (I just started a new job and really don't want to be coming in late all the time or using PTO), when I arrived at 8 for blood work (along with 2 other women also there for blood work), the front desk informed us that the lab technician is not in to take blood until 8:30am, another break in communication from the front desk.  I would not recommend this office and as soon as I am done with my follow-ups I am out of here!  The doc himself is very knowledgeable but is not moving along with treatment for my miscarriage, and does not listen to mine or my husband's concerns.  He is also not very personable and doesn't take the time to explain things--rather he beats around the bush.   I also enjoyed how at every appt they would ask when your last period was, \"hello, I'm pregnant!  And my last period hasn't change the last 3 times you've asked---look it up on the chart!\"  This office is very unorganized!  They made me feel like a number and not a valued patient.", "business_id": "ZcaBYLRDDY4ecAPDGWBQzA", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-12-06", "type": "review"}

I wasn't there, but my husband felt very good about Dr. Bailey, who seems to be a good doctor. However, the follow-up and communication from this office are absolutely horrible and unprofessional. First, we had to transfer my son's medical records from another office. Then, we waited to hear back from Entegrity to know if my son would be a good candidate for sublingual drops treatment. We waited several weeks and I had to finally call twice to learn that, yes, indeed, my son was a good candidate and that I could order the $200+ treatment for 3 months (not covered by insurance) and pay with my credit card over the phone. I did call back (at least twice) to order the treatment and was told I would get another call to pick-up the treatment. My credit card was promptly charged, and after 10 days, I was still waiting for a call back. I called myself (again) to be told I could come pick-up the treatment at any time without an appointment. I came with my husband and son on a Monday morning, and was just handed a case and 2 forms to sign (including a waiver of liability). No word about the treatment. I asked to talk to someone before signing anything, and then was told that I didn't have an appointment, so I would have to wait! We ended up spending a good hour at the office to finally see someone who answered our questions about the treatment. I was told that in the notes it said the doctor had called us to go over the details (neither my husband not I ever got a call from anyone).

This review is for my 2/25/15 visit at the north scottsdale office off of Scottdale road and 101. I asked the office staff if there was another location and this is the only Entegrity ENT in Scottsdale, so here goes. \n\nI was here last year as a new patient and my experience has been positive, so i have returned this year for another condition i was suffering from.  \n\nI saw Dr. Samuel Bailey both times and he has great bedside manners with positive energy and always smiling.  I hate grouchy doctors :P\nHe answered all of my questions and i didn't feel like i was being rushed. Most doctors offices usually have their PA or NPs do all the work and doctors will only see you for 5 minutes tops but Dr. Bailey gave me his full attention and was super friendly,  and kind.  He explained things easy and thoroughly enough for a child to understand AND still had time for my questions. \n\nI have not seen other doctors here, so i can't speak for them but Dr. Bailey has been one of the kindest, caring and considerate physician I've dealt with and i highly recommend him for all your ear/nose/throat needs. \n\nAs for the office staff,  they must have new staff because nobody at this office treated me bad like some of the things that were mentioned in other negative reviews.\n\nMany doctors offices want the patients to pay up front if you haven't met your annual deductible but Entegrity will file a claim with your insurance first before they bill you,  so i don't agree with some of the reviews complaining about the office only wanting money.  \n\nBottom line;  if you need to see an ENT specialist and want to see a doctor that will actually listen and pay attention to you explaining your symptoms who is very kind and caring, then schedule your appointment with Dr. Bailey. You won't like him if you're one of those people who don't like nice and friendly doctor (trust me,  i know some people who prefer their doctors to be a$$holes).", "business_id": "e0B-vLvKxGiGV_pTT7vwcg", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-02-25", "type": "review"}

It's just the office policy and many of the front desk employees that are unyielding and like to disappoint clients and not provide 100% customer delight.\n\nDoctor: 2 out of 2 stars.\nCustomer Service in Office:  0 out of 3 stars\nTotal:  2 out of 5 stars.", "business_id": "9f5WxUG_Vc-PzBmX6SeTew", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-01-20", "type": "review"}

He tried to change a therapy for me that cost less than $1.00 per day (covered by insurance) to one that cost around $10.00 per day and NOT covered by insurance. I had a side effect from a drug he prescibed. He told me that was not one of the main side effects. Several drug sites list this side effict I experienced as 3 on their lists. He is also dropping my insurance this March.

I too followed them from their old location & have been going here for about 8 years now. The current location is very nice & clean. The girls up front are nice but Rosie is by far the sweetest. I used to see Dr. Silvia Castro for my annual but I think she has been pretty busy with her new baby & other patients, so for the past 2 years I have seen Gretchen. She is amazing! Such a sweetheart & really does take the time to listen to any questions or concerns you may have. My only gripe with my last appt on 1/4/11 was that I had to wait 45 minutes before I was seen. I understand things can get busy, especially at the beginning of the year, but it can get annoying to wait 3 times as long as your actual appt time itself.", "business_id": "9xpYUYI4wbNA4XufvVfKzQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-01-05", "type": "review"}
