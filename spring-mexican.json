As he took our order, I had a few questions as we ordered because I had never been to a mad mex, and he seemed annoyed and kept looking away at his other tables as we told him what we wanted. Slow for everything, and I felt like it was an inconvenience to even ask for a drink refill. Even when he brought my togo box, we had our payment ready he told us he would be back to take it. Like if you're at our table, why can't you just take my card with you? What if we were in a hurry? I have been a server and I would never say that to a table, and I have never experienced this at a restaurant before.

I don't rave about \"good\" food. I rave about amazing food. The type of food that I have dreams about. The type of food that makes me want to bring about a thousand dollars cash and gorge myself untill I need an ambulance.\n\nThe taco stand outside of Reyna Foods makes just that kind of food. Too often when we think of Mexican food, we think of a variety samey tasting, samey textured mixtures of ground beef, yellow cheese, beans, and tomatoes stuffed into a processed flour tortilla covered with a plastic sauce (I'm looking at you Emiliano's). Reyna's doesn't just break the mold, they hurl it at the wall, smash the pieces with a bat and then scatter the dust in a blast furnace. The tacos here are aboslutely amazing. Fresh ingredients cooked right there on an old plancha-style grill that has absorbed the flavors of countless meals and stuffed into fresh corn tortillas are a truly enlightening experience. I mean it. \n\nThe first time I went here was to just grab a quick snack while walking around in the Strip district. I saw they offered tongue as a protein choice and thought to myself \"What the hell, in for a dime in for a dollar right?\" Best. Choice. Ever. The first bite was like reaching the Seventh Level of Enlightenment. The Buddha said I could ask one question. After careful consideration I asked, \"Can I have another taco?\" After that I made a vow that I would forever be a loyal raving fan.\n\nThe tacos are assembled to your liking. I like mine with the works: the perfectly cooked meat on the warm tortilla then covered with queso fresco, tomatoes, lettuce, onion, cilantro, fresh lime juice, and sour cream. The flavors all play well together to strike a classical tune of a Mexican bolero on the pallate. As previously mentioned, I like the tongue. It has a wonderful richness and gameyness to it that I have come to love. My far less adventurous girlfriend stays with the chicken. They have other choices ranging from pork, to steak, to shrimp, to the ever popular ground beef (gotta please everyone I guess).\n\nAfter you order your tacos, try one of the fresh made flavored waters there. The fresh lime water is always my favorite, and is there every day, but they also have hibiscus, watermelon and other flavor selections. My girlfriend got the horchata, a milk based concoction with cinnamon, nutmeg and sugar. Or you could pop inside the Mexican grocery for a Coke hecho en Mexico. My favorite Coke because they use cane sugar, not HFCS.\n\nThe only downside is that they close right around 3:00 PM.\n\nCome to Reyna's. The tacos are amazing.

I need to fulfill my hunger, I need to fulfill my existence by having people listen to my needs as I request them, and most of all after my needs are met, I leave a small token of my appreciation in the form of a tip or gratuity. If my simple needs cannot be met, then I become very disappointed.  This is where yelping has become my source of self help.\n\nFor starters, my wife enjoys the food here, it is very affordable, and the food (when we get it) is usually very consistent (it is very good). On this evening we had a very simple fair, but as we were greeted by the \"chip / salsa\" gentleman, we quickly requested a mild salsa.  (usually the standard as you are greeted is the medium / hot salsa and the OMG that is hot \"white salsa\") Since my spanish is not very good, like a fool I spoke english very softly and slowly, \"M-I-L-D salsa please for the lady\". Our mild salsa never arrived. This was the first sign that it was going to be an interesting night.\n\nUpon our server coming over, we had a tea and water (the tea is very sweet and makes my mom jealous....it is soooo good.) The server took our order, a single chicken and cheese quesadila, 2 soft beef tacos, and a side of rice.  Again, we asked the server for a side of mild salsa, and once again, it never came.\n\nIn the meantime, the food came out pretty quickly, but without the side of rice.  Now this is really starting to get under my skin....This is the best part of the meal as it is not greasy, it has good flavor, and is quite enjoyable, yet, in this meal, it NEVER showed.....The server apparently got sidetracked, we didn't see him for a few minutes, but as we did not have a large meal, it was over halfway gone.  We were soooooo disappointed as this was my recommendation for a lite fair tonight, and lite it was.  No mild salsa, no rice......why bother! \n\nSince I felt I was not appreciated, and my needs were not met, I felt like a bad date, and just wanted to break up right here! I'm feeling This Ends NOW! Sure the server apologized, but then reminded him that we never received the salsa we asked for TWICE!\n\nIt is times like this that I remember why I started Yelping, to search out the truth in restaurants and to hold every person in the hospitality business accountable for the lack of interest in the customer.\n\nThe customer deserves good service, good food, and at times a reasonable expectation of those needs.  \n\nI am in sales, my motto I live by is...... \"You can have price, quality or service, pick any two, but you are not going to get all three\"  in this case, I got price, but neither service nor quality was provided.\n\nSure I will be back, but with lower expectations.\n\nNCFoodGuy", "business_id": "CxGK5_GoIhG9798zYPsvfA", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-05-14", "type": "review"}

I should have taken the bet. We requested the mild salsa and we actually received it. We requested sweet and water and also received them in a timely manner.  ( It is Sad that a highlight of the meal was that you actually received your drinks correctly).\n\nThe meals were very prompt, very tasty, and the server was very attentive even though we were located in the back of the restaurant due to the crowd. She even refilled our drinks, prior to them getting half empty.\n\nThis was a redeeming visit for this location and as usual, I will continue to follow up on our visits.\n\nI have given three stars, as I mentioned earlier, it just isn't consistent enough to receive 4 stars.\n\nNCFoodGuy", "business_id": "CxGK5_GoIhG9798zYPsvfA", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-05-28", "type": "review"}

Well, that's easy, let's open yelp and find something within a reasonable walking distance.\n\nThis place pops up as one of the best within a walking distance.

Very much at the pinnacle of decent restaurants located in the university vicinity of Charlotte, it has all the ingredients: the food is of upper-end quality, it's modestly priced, and has a fresh atmosphere. HOWEVER, if you are looking for a place with a staff that can understand and replicate English well- this place is not for you. I've heard various people toss that comment around every now and then. It may just be my opinion, but it seems as though the best authentic, non-American eateries are those with misplaced English skills, or a complete lack thereof. \n\nNow I myself usually don't deviate from an ace menu item once I've found it, and as such I've had the same \"Southwest Quesadilla\" from Zaps for the past 6 years. First thing I've ever ordered from 'em. Think I care? Nah. Sure don't. I have only recently been \"around the block\" with other various items on the menu and to no shock whatsoever, find them all exquisite as well.\n\nOverall, here are a few things to consider about the business: 1) Adequate spacial constraints with an up and downstairs, each consisting of its own outdoor section, 2) lakeside view, 3) great food/ menu combinations & a plethora of menu items from a very basic \"kids\" to a \"make-your-own\" spin off anything they have to offer really, 4) generous portion sizes, 5) full bar selection and quality margaritas, 6) drink specials for every day of the week, 7) VERY quick service (9 out of 10). Can't beat it.\n\nAnd for Cinco de Mayo? This is the place to be.", "business_id": "rg1-6A-8SKXGh_p-Abbyxg", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-04-23", "type": "review"}

The seafood is never overdone and never fishy but there is always a little difference in the execution.  On this most recent occasion, I was given the option to have beans and rice on the side as opposed to inside the burrito, but I don't think I have ever had the burrito with rice and beans.  It was also stuffed with a decent amount of spicy yet almost fruity jalapenos which I have never noticed before.  I have also ordered the same burrito and it has come to the table smothered with queso.  \nPlease don't mistake that I am complaining.  The food is great.

One of the more prominent ones, specifically in relation to the central-Illinois locale, is that there is no good Mexican food here. You may recieve recommendations and you may choose to believe them, but remember this: it's all relative.\n\nDuring my 3 year stay in this small midwestern town, I was duped into trying the fare at a variety of Mexican eateries. Always hoping to replicate my Pilsen, Clark Street or the lady that sells tamales out of a cooler experience I never turned down an invite. On a recent trip back in search of gainful employment (in the form of a university sponsored job fair) I was implored to try Fiesta Cafe. It was the straw that broke the camel's back.\n\nQuantity over quality appears to be the motto here, as it is at many C-U establishments. I ordered tamales and was greeted with rubbery and unpleasant masa wrapped around a minimal amount of chicken. The sour cream did indeed come in a school lunch single serving container as mentioned in another review, and the rice and beans were sorely lacking in positive qualities. \n\nI gave two stars, however, because the service was good and they carried tamarind Jarritos.

Or maybe they gave you crack when you ate here...either way my experience was not the same.\n\nWent at about 4:00 on a Saturday, not a busy time for a restaurant so I wasn't scared away when we were the only ones in the entire place, next time, I'll make sure to think twice.\n\nThey started us off with chips and salsa, and I'm rather shocked that no one has mentioned their chips are a total fail. Salsa was decent, but the chips were an assortment of sweet potato chips, stale blue corn chips, sweet fried chips (sugar and everything), and stale normal tortilla chips. All in one bowl. If they weren't stale, the blue corn and normal chips would have paired nicely with the salsa. But rubbery sweet potato (don't get me wrong, I like sweet potato)  and sugar coated with salsa? Really?\n\nWe decided that we were going to order an appetizer and then a meal to split, and I love a good artichoke-anything so I ordered the artichoke dip. When it came out (like 20 minutes later) I had to ask them if they brought us the right dish. It was a bowl of queso and no matter how hard I searched, there was not an artichoke to be found. They didn't bring us any other chips to go with it, and let me tell you, sweet potato chips and queso don't go so great together. To make it worse, the menu said it was $6.99 but they charged us $7.79, if it was good I wouldn't have cared so much about $0.80 as I do.\n\nI thought a good beef fajita dish with a cup of chicken tortilla soup would be a safe bet, but they couldn't even do that right. They brought out corn and flour tortillas with the fajitas. Word of advice, if they ask you which you prefer save yourself the trouble and get the flour. The corn ones were so wet that they literally tore to shreds when I tried to peel them off each other. There wasn't a whole lot of beef in the beef fajitas either, and what was there was lacking in good flavor. And for the soup, Half Moon Sports Grill makes a better tortilla soup than this place...and they're a sports grill. \n\nOverall, food was bad. Service was very slow considering we were the only ones there, and I would never, ever eat here again. Did I mention they didn't give us silverware? We had to go steal it off another table.", "business_id": "e5kc0CQ4R-PCCDgb274gSg", "stars": 1, "date": "2009-03-28", "type": "review"}

The service overall was really friendly and prompt and I didn't have a whole lot of complaints on that end.\n\nMy one complaint? The portions served. I got a chimichanga that looks like a fried burrito from chipotle with a side salad. It was a pretty good chimichanga, but i didn't feel that great after eating the body weight of a newborn with a side salad to boot. As you can tell, I'm not big on leaving anything on my plate. \n\nLastly, the cherry on the frosting for me was the white chocolate pecan dessert thing they give you at the end. It's their version of the chocolate mints that they give you with the bill.

Think angelhair tossed with lots of great grilled veggies - then throw in some black beans and an asian soy sauce of some sort. YUCK. The combination of the textures and flavors were all wrong. I ordered the Chil-Rubbed Sirloin and ordered it medium. The temperature was perfect, which was a nice surprise. However, the \"chile-rub\" tasted like straight up chili powder. Nothing more, nothing less. The mashed potatoes had diced CARROTS in them, and I'm sorry, no matter how great of an idea that may seem, carrots are NOT a good idea in mashed potatoes. They tasted alright, but again, the texture and just the overall flavor was all wrong. The hubby also ordered a margarita, which was good, but we've definitely had better.\n\nAll in all I was a little disappointed.

When I got the tray, I initially thought they had mistaken the dish for a three rolled tacos, with mole-like sauce? First I had to decipher if it was fried, which was later confirmed. Then the sauce on top was definitely something that you cannot label. It had a sweet, mole, yet bitter taste, with sour cream that was light and fluffy and made it look like whip cream. I know . . . strange you say? The pork was dried out and even the two of us could not finish this one meal that was split. The beans tasted hallow, if that's even possible and the rice was extra dry. \n\nI am sorry to give this such a harsh review, but it's the truth and sometimes the truth hurts.

The first time we had a very large party and the service was great! We were seated quickly and served drinks and our food in a timely manner. Prior to ordering I checked out other Yelp reviews just as you are now and the things that stood out to me we're the chips and salsa and the margaritas. Well, everyone said it and I'm gonna say it too! You must try the chips and salsa (my favorite chip is the wonton chip, a little sweet heat! Yum!) and of course to go with it get the top shelf conmemorativo margarita...so, so, so good! I also got the spinach and portobello mushroom quesadilla and it was good. \n\nIt was so Delish that I brought a different large group of friends back to this place. Unfortunately, the restaurant was much busier and I'm not sure they handled the large crowds very well. We were told 1 hour wait, but after 20 minutes our buzzer went off. When we gathered our group to be seated the hostess told us it was a mistake and asked us to wait off to the side in the dining area. This wait was another hour before we approached the hostess. She was very rude and told us it would be 'awhile' but wouldn't give us a time frame. When we asked if it would be 10? 30? 1 and a half hours? She said it would be at least that! Unacceptable when we were told an hour wait. I asked to speak to a manager and Tony was extremely responsive! He worked it so that we were seated right away! The server  was fantastic as she stepped in to take our large party and we were seated outside her section. The chips and salsa came out quickly and she was great with getting us drinks (of course I had another round of the margarita) and the food was great. This time around I had the salmon. So delish! And the desserts were covered by the server as an apology for our wait. \n\nThe manager Tony was great, responsive and helped me to overcome my disappointment in the rude hostess encounter and he brought me back to a 4 star rating for the great service and food once we were seated. I would definitely recommend this place and the margarita!", "business_id": "e5kc0CQ4R-PCCDgb274gSg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-03-17", "type": "review"}

Well, I just got back from eating dinner here, and I couldn't think of anything I wanted to do more than write this review -- that's how good it is. \n\nI'm in town for business and a buddy who lives in the area suggested this place for dinner tonight, and boy am I glad he did! \n\nLet me start with the ambiance. Very nicely decorated and furnished in the Southwestern style that is common down here but done nicely, not gaudy or tacky in any way. There is a nice outside patio seating area, however considering I'm from Seattle and the temp was still pushing 100 degrees, we opted to sit inside.\n\nOnce we were seated, we were tempted to order the \"Limit-2\" margaritas that they are apparently famous for, but decided against it. After taking our drink order, the waitress brought us a basket of chips and a bowl of salsa.\n\nLet me stop right here.\n\nI knew just from looking at them, that these were no ordinary chips . Not only were they a mixture of different types of chips (regular tortillas, sweet potato, and wontons), but each type was topped in a different seasoning -- my favorite being the wonton chips topped in seasoning and some powdered sugar, giving it a sweet and spicy flavor at the same time. Amazing. I asked the waitress what the seasoning but I swear they were laced with cocaine as well. Hands down the best chips and salsa I've ever had in my life. I would go back just for that!\n\nOnce we overcame the confusion of what the \"Super Salad\" was (it turns out she was asking if I wanted soup OR salad), I ordered the Pueblo House Salad to start with. It was a very nice sized salad (could easily have been shared by two people if someone wanted to), and delicious with their honey chipotle vinaigrette dressing.\n\nFor the main course, I opted for the Santa Fe Stuffed Chicken Breast, which came off the \"Sam-Mex\" section of the menu. According to the menu, \"Sam-Mex\" was created by their executive chef with \"the influence of Mexican, Spanish, Native American and American Southwest Cultures.\" The chicken breast was stuffed with herb-goat cheese and served over a roasted red pepper cream sauce with a pine nut & cilantro pesto, grilled asparagus and southwest rice.\n\nWords cannot describe the amazing fusion of these different flavors as they combined into one superbly mind blowing dish.\n\nI'll be honest, it was hard to concentrate on the conversation with my buddy as I was distracted each time I took a bite -- but don't let him know I said that!\n \nAt the end of the meal, as we opted not to order dessert (or the crazy margarita), we were treated to what the waitress referred to as \"white chocolate tamales,\" compliments of the chef. Of course, know that I have read some of the other reviews on here, it seems that everyone gets these little treats, but whether the chef really intended for us to specifically have them or not was a mute point after tasting them -- a great finishing touch on an amazing meal. \n\nWhile I don't often get down to this part of the country, I will always have fond memories of this little \"cafe\" called, Sam's.", "business_id": "e5kc0CQ4R-PCCDgb274gSg", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-04-23", "type": "review"}

We were greeted and seated right away, we chose the patio to enjoy then spring weather. The ambiance was casual and made you feel like you were eating at home.  The service was quick and the staff very knowledgeable.  We even got a personal visit from the manager to ensure we were enjoying our dining.  \n\nWe started the dinner off with the best chips and salsa I have ever tasted. The salsa tasted like heaven and I am very picky about my salsa. I believe it was made with some adobo sauce. To wash it down we tried the pitcher of canyon margaritas.   The prickly pear and cranberry provided a nice flavor twist although it was a bit too sweet for Dave's liking. \nFor dinner, Dave tried the Southwestern tortellini  and I had the mini chimichangas.  The tortellini were covered in a chorizo cream sauce and was delicious.  The mini chimichangas did not disappoint mouth watering flavor in every bite.  Both meals were superb.  We decided to splurge for dessert and tried the tres leches cake with a strawberry sauce.  It was the most moist tres leches I have ever tried (even ones I have tried to make).  It was the perfect ending to a great meal.  If that wasn't enough they provided a commentary dessert, a divine white chocolate almond tamale.  A fun twist on the traditional tamale.  Even the left overs the next day were amazing. \n\nOver all this was a fabulous place to visit.

The mango margaritas were amazing as well.\n\nWhat really amazed me is the staff service all around.  The bartender was attentive. I inadvertently left my iPhone by the bar and didn't realize it was missing until an hour after I left the cafe.  I called the cafe and sure enough they found an iPhone which I went back for it and once there the manager verified that I was the rightful owner and got my iPhone back.  Today I needed a copy of my receipt for my business expenses, which I forgot to take with me, and I called for it. The staff person who answered and general manager located the receipt and e-mailed me a copy of it.  Again, I cannot be any more happier with the customer service all around.

Because of that, and the fact that they have a wonderful large outdoor patio (perfect in March), we wound up here two nights in a row, even though we found the food, drinks, and service mediocre.  Group decision, not a personal preference to return.\n\nFirst thing, both nights, the service was Extremely Slow.  It's annoying when multiple servers/bussers walk by without even a 'someone will be right with you'.  On our second visit, the hostess actually stopped to ask us if anyone had been over after 15 minutes sitting at our table without any wait staff talking to us.  We must have looked irked.\n\nSecondly, they limit you to 2 margaritas, so they should be fantastic, but we all found them to be incredibly inconsistent in taste and alcohol strength.  Out of the 4 margaritas I personally had over two nights; 1 was Fantastic, one was overly strong, 1 tasted like a virgin, and 1 was just okay.\n\nAs for the actual food, the chips they serve with the chips and salsa were an interesting and cool mix of yellow and blue corn tortilla, sweet potato (my fav), wonton (second fav), and flour tortillas with a dry seasoning (next fav).  The salsa was meh, but the untraditional chips didn't even need it.  This was the best part of the meal.\n\nI had the chicken fajitas night 1.  The chicken was really dry and had an abundance of unnecessary seasoning on it.  The accouterments were just standard.  I ordered the steak/shrimp fajitas night 2.  The steak was very good but the shrimp was tasteless.\n\nAll in all, I cannot see why I would ever return to this restaurant.", "business_id": "e5kc0CQ4R-PCCDgb274gSg", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-03-20", "type": "review"}

I thought that the first meet up was going to be hard to beat because it was so good but this place knocked another one out of the park. I think I just found my new favorite Mexican food place in town.\nFrom the outside it looks like a hodge podge of different additions obviously added at different times with no thought at trying to make it match at all. Even the parking lot was a little crazy. Walking in the two front doors continues the hodge podge theme. This is a family owned restaurant that has been here awhile for sure. We sat in the front waiting area for the rest of the group to show up and I had to use the bathroom really quick. Those were also scary. Questions started to arise about this place. I hope the food is good. We waited a little while longer and they decided to seat us even though our whole party wasn't there. Then we walk in to the main dinning are. Now obviously at some point they gutted the entire inside and completely remodeled it. It was very nice. It was a large open space with an exposed ceiling and lots of tables. We were taken to a back section where several tables had been pushed together for us. Maria our server came over and chips and salsa were on the table immediately. She did a great job the entire night. Best services I have had in awhile. She took everyone's drink orders and drinks started to come out a few at a time. Once everyone was there and ready to order she went around the table and took everyone's order. Offering suggestions and helping with custom orders.\nAfter what seemed like only a few minutes. Dishes started to come out as well. One or two here then a few more over there. Finally everybody had what they ordered and it all looked and smelled really good.\nThen fork went to mouth and somewhere a chorus started singing. Wow this was really good. I had ordered a Carne Asada steak with a cheese enchilada. I couldn't pronounce what it was called when I ordered it and I won't even attempt it here. It really was some of the best Mexican food I have ever had. The steak had a great flavor to it and with all of the cheese and sauce and everything it just added to it. I couldn't even finish. Although there wasn't too much left.\nEven after that I still had to try some dessert especially after I saw churros and ice cream on the menu. This was not a mistake. It was so good. The ice cream was fantastic and the churros were warm and soft.\nEverything was amazing. Maria was a great server. The company was fantastic as usual. Maria even split the check up for us even though there was a handwritten sign up front that said they didn't do that.\nI hope to have many return visits here. My new favorite Mexican place hands down.", "business_id": "BESmH-lmMm34_EefL8X9fQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-05-16", "type": "review"}

We were both happy to see that they had such a great selection of Mexican beers and so hubby was able to get a Bohemia instead of settling for the usual Corona or XX. I was super happy to order a Michelada and as always that put me in the mood for seafood which is perfect since Comedor Guadalajara not only has traditional Mexican entrees but a variety of Mexican style seafood dishes on their menu.\n\nEven though we were served chips and salsa immediately upon being seated, we decided to start with the chorizo bean dip since that sounded pretty tasty. I was expecting it to be served in a small dish like the salsa but instead it came out with a giant portion and a bunch of thicker chips topped with melted cheese. Fortunately my fellow Yelpers helped us out but we still couldn't finish it. I love bean dip in general but this one had a great flavor from the chorizo and I didn't feel like it was too greasy. I would say that the chorizo bean dip is a must-order if you are with a group.\n\nAfter that, we got our entrees. My hubby got the Tampiquena steak which was a skirt steak seasoned and broiled and served with rice and beans. Most people would call that carne asada so I am not sure why they didn't name it that on the menu. I thought Tampiquena was when they chop up the steak and put chili sauce and cheese on it. But I haven't seen that outside of Texas so maybe that's a regional thing, I don't know. Anyway, he loves steak so was happy with the meat but he thought the rest of it was just ok. Growing up on the border we are picky about tortillas and these were not very authentic looking and he said they also were not great tasting but not bad either.\n\nI ordered the Campechana and that also turned out to be a humongous portion (see pic). They serve it in a huge bowl like soup instead of a tall footed glass dish like seafood cocktail (cockteles) are usually served in. However, it wasn't really that much more substance in the bowl, it seemed to be mostly Clamato. I did like the flavoring of the broth but I thought the quality of the seafood could have been better. I also thought it was really weird that they served it with lemons and not limes. That kind of gave it a weird taste but I added some more hot sauce and that fixed it!\n\nEven though its not the best Mexican food I've had we still had a really good time. It's a pretty nice looking restaurant, I am really surprised that some of the other reviewers called it a dive? Also, our waitress Anna was awesome and everyone else we interacted with seemed really nice as well.", "business_id": "BESmH-lmMm34_EefL8X9fQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-05-17", "type": "review"}

You go through the doors and then are shown your table and your mind is thinking how is it possibly this is the same building you were looking at on the outside.  It's huge, and opened, and I didn't even see the entire place. It's well lit and the colorful! A very nice surprise!\n\nWe were a party of 8 and our server was Maria, and she was amazing, she made sure we had everything we needed and more. When you 1st walked in the podium for the hostess says NO SPLIT CHECKS, so our party didn't even ask, we would have figured it out, but when it came time for the check, Maria had already split them up for us.  Love great service!\n\nThe chips are fresh, the salsa, well for me it's perfect! I could have stood it a tab bit hotter, but it had the perfect bit of heat for me, but for a fellow dinner, it was too hot for him.\n\nOrdered a cheese crisp and some guacamole for appetizers and the cheese crisp was just that, a cheese crisp nothing too exciting to write about, but the guacamole, omg it was soo fresh tasting, I loved that stuff!! I think I might have even licked it off my fingers, I'm sure I could have eaten the entire bowl myself  (or did I).\n\nOne of the Wednesday night specials was a poblano pepper stuffed with cheese and topped with green chili sauce with grilled chicken, and it came with beans & rice. OMG AMAZING!!!!!!!!!! I didn't even see it on the menu but damn I want it again! The pepper was fresh, the green sauce was delish, and the grilled chicken just tied this dish together! The beans and rice were perfectly cooked. AMAZING!!!!\n\nMy meal filled me up pretty well, but I did order a churro, and it was the perfect way to end a great meal. Love churros!!!

I am not a native of Arizona and I think this may make my review somewhat biased. I wasn't too impressed with the food here. I had a chili relleno and a chicken burrito, both smothered. The portions were large, as expected in a Mexican food restaurant, the service was good, the gentleman that was helping us was extremely courteous. The margarita that I ordered (strong) I needed an extra shot, it wasn't strong enough for me. When this happened the Manager came over to me to make sure everything was ok - which was awesome! Needless to say, I added the shot and the margarita got demolished!  My chili relleno was a little soggy and I asked for it extra crispy, not too important, but I just wanted it cooked a little longer than normal. One SUPER positive things I can say about Comedor Guadalajara is that they had some of the best rice and beans I have ever had! \nAll in all, I think my overall experience has to do with the Mexican food here tasting distinctly different than the Mexican food in Denver, both of which are as authentic as you can get, not this Tex Mex B.S.\nWhen I go back to Phoenix, would I come back here, probably not, I would want to try a different place to see if they have a different Phoenix, authentic Mexican food flare.

When we arrived, we had to be flagged into a parking space by one of their parking attendant (very nice feature) as the lot was very full. There was a 45 min. wait and lots of people waiting! We met a family who used to live in McAllen, Tx, and they raved about this place, so we decided to wait it out, esp. after all the other good Yelp reviews. It's in an interesting part of town, so it wasn't like there was another Mexican restaurant five min. away like at home. Hubs had the carne asada tacos and I had the combo #8. The beef was outstanding! Good flavor and charred to perfection!!! Large portions! The rest of the meal (beans, rice, tortillas, taco & guacamole) were good, but we're very, very spoiled Texans. If we lived here full-time, this would be our place definitely, but compared to home, this was a good, but nothing to 110% rave about. However, the service, mango margarita's and warm churro (soooooo good!) sundae allow us to overall give it the four star rating.", "business_id": "BESmH-lmMm34_EefL8X9fQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-03-06", "type": "review"}

The one thing that stands out about Comedor (at least to me), is the sheer scale of their operation.  Huge parking lot, huge waiting area, huge restaurant, huge menu, you get the idea.  I've been told that depending on your arrival time, the wait can be epic.  On a Saturday at lunch, I came here with a friend and the wait was a pretty benign 10 minutes.  Once seated, I pretty much settled into a familiar groove as the menu, the service, and the flavors all reminded me of local Mexican establishments I'd frequented for years.\n\nWe were actually seated all the way in the back room.  Took us about three left turns to get there, but even the back room was packed.  That said, the place wasn't crazy noisy.  Very casual, comfortable atmosphere inside.  Our server was on her A game the whole meal as she was friendly, fast, and accommodating.  I had asked my friend what (if anything) was the signature dish of the house, but she couldn't really point to any one thing so I decided to go for a combo plate this go around.  Since this is a Sonoran Mexican food establishment, I figured a collection of familiar Sonoran favorites would be a appropriate.  Combination Plate #1 contains a cheese enchilada, beef taco, bean tostada, rice and beans.  For $9, I figured that would be a good way to peer into Comedor's own house take on these familiar staples.\n\nFood came out less than 10 minutes after we ordered.  The food was good, though you could be forgiven for thinking you were eating the exact same food with the exact same taste as other local Mexican establishments.  I suppose that's not necessarily a bad thing if you're like me and enjoy food at said establishments, but my friend was correct that none of the items really exceed any other place I've been.  My favorite item was the beef taco and it reminds me of one I've had at La Pi\u00f1ata.  The enchilada was also good and it reminded me of one I've had at Macayo's.  The beans and rice were also good and reminded me of those I've had at Mejico Cocina.  So all in all, the food was tasty and familiar, but you can absolutely find these staples at various Mexican establishments throughout the valley.  The big difference here is just a matter of scale.\n\nTotal cost for the combo plate, glass of water, tax and tip came to about $12.  The entire menu is pretty inexpensive (which likely explains the huge crowds here) and there's plenty of variety on the menu to choose from.  Next time I come here I'll probably give the seafood menu a try (though it'll probably remind me a lot of Mariscos Playa Hermosa).  So three stars for the food as it was good even though the cuisine didn't stand out too much from other similar valley establishments.  Four stars for the ambiance and atmosphere as the environment is super comfortable, family friendly and the restaurant is well kept inside and out.  And five stars for the service as they did a great job getting us seating pretty quickly despite the crowds, the server was excellent, and I had no trouble getting a parking spot at their huge lot.  So yeah, four stars is probably about right.  A good value for people of pretty much any means, only super-sized.", "business_id": "BESmH-lmMm34_EefL8X9fQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-05-31", "type": "review"}

You see they have a daily rotating specials menu and it so happens to feature the best veggie burrito (this is saying a lot coming from me, since I am obsessed with burritos and have lived in Phoenix for most of my life) for a little over $5 on Tuesdays! It is so massive.. if you know the size of a Chipotle burrito, imagine that, but doubled! Seriously, it consists of two very large tortillas, which are needed to whole the damn monster of a burrito together. This happens to insure that the contents don't spill out of the tortilla! Genius. I am fairly sure this burrito weighs more than most new born babies.. yes, that's even considering how all the hormones people consume today are making babies larger each year - this burrito would still out weight them my friends!\n\nAnyhow, the burrito is large enough to satisfy me for three complete meals. Awesome for $5. The guac that they make is top notch, and their rice is truly amazing. It all tastes very authentic, and I love that I can easily make it vegan since they don't add any secrets into their food. I just have to ask them to hold the cheese and sour cream, and they have never once slipped up on this! Which also keeps me coming back.\n\nOh, and the salsa bar is to die for! I am usually creeped out by salsa bars (think Baja Fresh - yuck) but they actually make some damn good salsas and usually have a bowl of chopped onions... I can never get enough.

My friends had been going here forever for this special and we decided to make it a weekly thing. This has been going on for a while now and I've since tried all their tacos. I'm sad to say that most of them are just \"okay\". The one that stands out above the rest is the shredded beef taco. The beef is seasoned well and is tasty.\nOne time we went I didn't feel like eating tacos so I got their steak burrito. It was not very good. The rice that came with my combo was bland and barely edible. I actually left most of the burrito and all of the rice on my plate. I left feeling unimpressed and still hungry. Another time I got the chicken achiote salad. It was delicious. If you decide to eat here, it's probably the only thing I would recommend. Other than the daily specials they run, this place is pretty expensive for the quality. That salad and a bottled mexican Coca Cola ran me more than $10. Same thing for the burrito combo. The tacos seem to be the only economical choice they offer.\n\nNo matter how good the service is I don't think that I would ever give Chico's 5 stars, but they lost a 3rd star from me because the last 3 times I've been in there, the older lady who works at night on Tuesday has goofed up my order. Yes, 3 times. 3 weeks in a row my order was messed up. I don't know if maybe she is new and hasn't gotten the hang of it yet, or if she just wasn't paying attention to me when I was placing my order. I could understand more why my order was goofed if I had ordered something ridiculous with lots of substitutions, but I didn't. The last time my order was messed up it took them 15 mins AFTER they realized their mistake to remedy the situation. By that time my friends were all done eating the 3 tacos they had ordered.

We had plenty of chips and salsa, and our drinks were never empty. She was friendly but not overly pushy. \n\nAMBIANCE \nIf you're looking for quiet and romantic, don't come here. The restaurant is very open and the acoustics are awful. The decor is simple with Mexican flare, but not terribly gaudy. \n\nOVERALL\nGreat place for a quick downtown lunch if you don't mind Americanized Mexi-food that could be cheaper.", "business_id": "-lOSaCuBRAvX5JBifx-EMw", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-03-30", "type": "review"}

Most of the group are on limited funds, so we thought a pretty tasty chain would be ok. Now as I write this there are things that make me want to bump it to a four then other things that make me want to bump it down.\n\nLet's see... I wasn't sure what to order and everything looked just about average in terms of dishes, so I ended up with Chile Rellenos. I rarely ever get this, so I figured tonight would be the night. Our waitress took forever to come over at first and I felt like she wasn't completely with it. She may be bilingual and a little less with the English, so she was very very quiet. She got half our table drinks and then disappeared. Eventual she came back with the others, but she could've fit them all on one tray. A few more minutes and we had some tasty albeit boring looking chips. They were so large that they could only get so many in each bowl. The salsa was terrible. Completely bland with little taste. Mostly it was chunks of tomatoes and some juice. Boring. After way too long our food came. No silverware or anything, just the food. I ate most of my beans with a knife (it looked clean!) I found on my table. We asked for sourcream and silverware. She brought the sour cream but nada on the whole silverware thing. Eventually someone found me a fork (I think from a place setting behind me) and I dug in. Great Chile Relleno! very tasty, and I think the sourcream made it for me. At the end of the meal, the waitress did agree to split the check between each of us to her defense, but overall it was a very average experience like you'd expect from a white-washed pseudo Mexican chain.", "business_id": "-lOSaCuBRAvX5JBifx-EMw", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-04-17", "type": "review"}

Being vertically challenged, I was pleased that the booth bench was high in relation to the table level, but it certainly could have had a lot more cushion.  \n\nWe were brought drinks, had orders took, and tortilla chips brought promptly. I really liked the chips. They were paper thin, very crispy, and were glistening with fresh, hot, fryer oil. The pico de gallo type salsa also tasted very fresh and home-made, but it could have done better with a few less chopped onion chunks in it. Upon request, we were also brought a bowl of more picante salsa, which had the flavor of roasted red chilies. Nice.\n\nOur orders, both from the lunch menu, were also served quite quickly.  My husband had a cheese enchilada/chicken taco combo (~$6.25) which came with black beans (on request), rice, and a cabbage garnish. I didn't even see the taco since my husband devoured it so fast, but his enchilada was swimming in a mixture of cheese & red sauce which he said was pretty tasty. \n\nI had a chicken enchilada (~$6.75). There were nice chunks of breast in there that actually tasted like chicken, unlike some other mexican joints where the meats all have the same texture & flavor. The enchilada was drizzled with a nice green chili sauce. The spanish rice was a little bit nondescript, but was more edible than some other restaurants'.  Mine was also served with black beans as requested, and a cabbage garnish. There were also more big chunks of onion in the garnish. I'm not an onion hater, don't get me wrong, but I'm sure after this feast, nobody would want to be within four feet of me. If I was on lunch break from one of the nearby offices, I'd probably request they go easy on the onions, lest I offend my work-mates back at the office.\n\nAlthough I arrived with a huge appetite, I was stuffed after devouring everything on my plate. The service was very good. Our waitress was quite attentive and quick. The food was delicious. The prices were reasonable.

We were greeted at our seat pretty quickly and the server was friendly, and that is why I am giving this place two stars...it is definitely not for the food. Actually I take that partially back, the chips and salsa were good. The salsa was nice and spicy. I ordered the Mexican Pizza. It came on a thin tortilla with cheese, ground beef, onion, and a slice of green chili on each slice (I enjoyed the chili). I expect a Mexican Pizza to be thick and crunchy; however, this was flimsy and greasy. I couldn't even pick up a slice without it completely falling apart. In addition, I must have went through ten napkins trying to sop the grease from my hands. It was a little better when I piled salsa on top of each bite, but it was not something I would ever consider ordering again. My mom ordered the lunch special of two tacos with rice and beans. Now I cannot discuss the taste of her meal, because I didn't try it; however, the taco shells were just plain, out of the box hard corn taco shells. I've never understood why a Mexican restaurant wouldn't spend more time on the things that make Mexican restaurants great. Tortillas are amazing. I love them, and I think the majority of people feel the same way. This is why I cannot stand to see a boxed taco shell in a Mexican restaurant.

I've experienced better\" fits perfectly. I was so excited to come eat here :( Like Los Compadres it had been on the list for a long time. A 4 star Mexican place with very few bad reviews seemed like a safe bet. This place also showed up on Chow Bella a few days ago. I was prepared for another kick ass meal but figured I was in for meh service based on what I read. Seems like I received the complete 180 of an experience.\n\nGot there about 7:30 Saturday night. The place was 65% capacity at most. This surprised the heck out of me considering the time/reviews and recent writeup. Figured I was doomed for a night of waiting. We were at out table within 2 minutes and the waitress was there to take our drink order and drop off salsa in less then 5. She quickly returned with some HUGE glasses of water an a basket of chips. I was ready for these amazing hot from the fryer chips I had read so much about. What I got instead was room temp chips of which 1/2 had a nice freshly dipped in grease then cooled coat on them. I'm a good sport so I tried one of the greasy ones and all I could taste was room temp oil from a fryer that needed fresh oil in a bad bad way.. Blech :(\n\nThe salsa however was very tasty. The red was far from burning hot that I had read so much about. It was warm but far from spicy and was one of the best things I would eat all evening. The green was also very flavorful and masked the gross chips well.\n\nWe ordered a huge pile of food including a cheese crisp and guacamole which hit the table quickly. We were then in for a good 20 minute wait before the rest of the food showed up.\n\nFood Details:\n\nGuacamole:\nVery simple prep here. Avocado, Onion, Salt and 800lbs of tomatoes. I absolutely HATE fresh tomatoes but that's just a personal preference. The quac was fresh and tasty. There was nothing \"wrong\" with it there's just much better at countless places.\n\nRice:\nSo far from exciting I don't specifically recall. I just remember having a bite and moving on. Was a little greasy and bland :/\n\nBeans:\nJust went I thought dinner was a complete waste I took a few bites of these and WOW! some of the best beans I've ever had. Pretty sure there is a huge amount of lard but who cares. The texture was perfect.. the flavor was perfect.. I could have been satisfied with a side of quac, couple tortillas and a huge bowl of beans. Half of it was smashed/creamed and the other was whole beans. I'm not even a bean person and it was the only part of my plate that had been scrapped clean.\n\nCheese Crisp:\nNo real crisp at all. Just a tortilla with melted cheese and a major pool of grease.\n\nGreen Chili Tamale:\nThe texture was very rubbery but it was at least spicy. This was another \"not bad but far from great\" items.\n\nGround Beef Taco:\nThe shell was nice and crispy and didn't taco fail. The meat inside was this super fine texture but did not have a lot of flavor.\n\nChili Relleno:\nOh man.. I've been trying to figure this one out. Terrible is the only word I have for it. There were two of them on the table and they were both the same. The batter was literally water logged and there was nothing on the plate to do that. They weren't greasy.. they were watery. I'm nearly positive these were made in house, frozen, and heated to order. There's no other way they could get a spongy soggy texture like that any other way.\n\nEnchilada:\nSuffered from more cheese on top of my enchilada then inside of it and a serious lack of red sauce. Don't get me wrong.. I like cheese but it was 10% red sauce and 90% cheese. I couldn't even really taste the red sauce to see if it was any good. The enchilada was a corn tortilla with a sprinkle of cheese on the inside. It was literally flat on the plate like someone folded it then smashed it down that's how skimpy the filling was.\n\nRed Sauce:\nDon't know.. there was not enough of it on anything to actually taste it.\n\n\nCould this have been an off night? I guess its possible but I order so much variety that it pretty much rules out having a bad experience because a single item wasn't good that night. Is this the worst Mexican in town? Far from it.. But there are so many other great places I feel sorry for anyone who might call this their only Mexican stop when they have a craving. They are missing out on some real good food out there.", "business_id": "hWhVP-28LYP3llaMlAJ_JA", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-03-22", "type": "review"}

On the good side, it was BIG for $2.60, and full of goodies, lots of cheese and a good but not excessive helping of lettuce.  Good value.

That's the feeling I had yesterday afternoon when I foolishly decided to try La Tolteca for the first time...\n\nWhy was this a foolish decision? Because I got sick. Super duper sick. Which I should have known was going to happen because the Fish Burro I ordered tasted terrible. And now, here I am, 24 hours later, still trying to keep fluids in my body in between trips to the bathroom.\n\nNow I know what you're thinking... \"What does he expect? He ordered a Fish Burro!\" And I know. You're right. It's just that I've had such good luck with fish tacos at a couple of other restaurants lately (Canteen, Tacos Atoyac) that I decided to see what sort of magic La Tolteca could create with their mahi mahi. Apparently their in-house magician has Mondays off.\n\nI seriously don't know why there's so many four and five star reviews of this place on Yelp. It's not that great. Even if my burrito hadn't made me ill, I still would have felt compelled to write something to balance all the positive reviews on here. Maybe the corn tortillas they use on their tacos deserve the accolades that other reviewers can't seem to stop talk about, but my flour tortilla was below average. It was dry and it tasted like paper.\n\nAs for the burro, I specifically asked about the filling prior to ordering it and I was told that it only contained cabbage, fresco cheese and guacamole. Sadly, when I took my first bite, out spewed a white, mayonnaise-like substance. The burro's filling was more like a fish salad of sorts and it tasted off. Very off. And the fish wasn't hot. Actually, nothing it the burro was the least bit warm. And the guacamole was on the side--not inside the burro. But again, I was starving at this point so I took it down. Every last bite.\n\nI knew immediately that something was wrong. I considered removing the food from my body as soon as I got outside, but I decided to keep my finger out of mouth and let things settle. Big mistake. There would be no settling. I consider myself to have an iron gut, too. I can basically eat anything in any quantity (not that I do this often) but normally I have good luck. I haven't been this sick since eating food from a middle-of-nowhere farmstand while bike touring in the Caribbean.\n\nI'm giving La Tolteca two stars because I did like their hot sauces--all of them. And they have cheap beer, too ($2 Coronas all day, every day). However, as Michael S. noted in an earlier review, everything I tried tasted off. Tangy is fine when that's what a place is going for, but everything I ate tasted slightly tangy in a ugh-this-is-going-to-make-me-sick sort of way. Not cool.\n\nSo that's that. I really don't think I'll be back. I have no desire to explore the bakery case and there's way too many small taquerias around to take any more chances with this high-volume, supermarket of a restaurant.", "business_id": "apCfJVnRyaw6oVUBKujpUQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-05-03", "type": "review"}

They have a small grocery section, to where you can even get yourself a 40-quart tamale steamer, obviously you can use it for other uses as well.

Its a noble effort to bring Mexican staples and unconventionals to the big city in the middle of Arizona, USA, but the product are tinged with americanization; from their weekend menudo, which is wholly rubbish, to the carne which is a grade above what you would get in a true Mexican market (damn FDA).  Though the latter may sound like an unusual gripe, its that stringy gato-grade-meat that makes fajitas and tortas uniquely tasty.  I was impressed one time, however, when my buddy Graham snagged a few pounds of fajita meat for the SuperBowl from PHX RM, and they marinaded it for him in a sturdy plastic bag which included whole jalapenos to boot.  However, I beleive it was Graham's skill on the grill that made them very tasty and moist rather than any particularly amazing grade of meat from the Market.\n\nAs a hispanic, the place feels appreciably disingenuous.

As of June 1, 2009 travelers must possess either a passport, passport card, or WHTI-compliant identification to enter the US by air, land or sea. Contrary to popular belief however, Americans will be able to visit the Phoenix Ranch Market without documentation.\n\nGENERAL DESCRIPTION/DESCRIPCION GENERAL: Phoenix Ranch Market III is an upmarket Mexican-style mercado complete with an interior food court called \"La Cocina\" (The Kitchen). It is located in a rather unpleasant part of town, but manages to attract a large following of gringos eager to inject some diversity into their palette without risking turista.\n\nTHE FOOD/LA ALIMENTACIN: Offerings in \"La Cocina\" run the gamut from Mexican style tortas, to more iconic tacos and burritos. Many items offer a choice of meat, from ham to carne asada, to carnitas. A separate area offers various seafood dishes. Everything is ala carte, suprising those hoping to economize using an American style \"combo\".  Despite this, \"La Cocina\" remains popular, especially at lunch time.\n\nSERVICE/SERVICIO: All orders are taken by an attendant standing next to the line for the cashier. Most guests do not wait long before placing the order. Some have reported difficulty communicating with the attendant however, the other employees tend to have command of the English language. Visitors are responsible for retrieving their own orders and seating themselves at long bench-style tables. \n\nPRICES/PRCIOS: Like Mexico itself, the Ranch Market is not the bargain it is made out to be. Prices that may look low for entrees quickly increase when adding in the cost of beverages, churros, and gas. Most respondents however, believe that the mercado occupies an important niche between true fast food and more sophisticated self-serve meals. \n\nSPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS/CONSIDERACIONES ESPECIAL: Some have accused the Phoenix Ranch Market from being too acommodating to non-Latino customers. While this concern cannot be dismissed, it is obviously the case that all of Mexico has fallen to this trend. New hotels now gleam along the shoreline in Puerto Penasco, golf courses spourt in the arid desert outside Cabo San Lucas, all while Costcos can be found in such tourist-heavy states as Veracruz and Guanajuato. The Calderon Government and America's Hispanics will have to confront the tension between assimilation and authenticity one agua fresca at a time.", "business_id": "VXIkI9_EbDbYHeO9IzKjJg", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-05-20", "type": "review"}

It's the closest Market to my house, it's fun and lively, the produce looks great, and the prepared food smells wonderful.\n\nBut I don't love it.  I'm actually somewhat annoyed by this store.\n\nNumerous times I have entered looking for something and haven't been able to find it.  I know you're thinking it's some wierd gringa item I'm looking for, but this last time I was looking for canned tomatoes to make chili.  Canned tomatoes!?!?!  I'll cut them a little slack because I actually sent the husband to do the dirty work and he couldn't find it after asking 2 or 3 employees.  I have a sneaking suspicion that they do actually have it there, because it would be ridiculous for a Mexican market to not have canned tomatoes.\n\nAnother time I took an out-of-town friend.  He was so enamored with the beauty of the bakery items that he wanted to photograph the many cakes and pastries.  But the tub-o-security rolled over and said \"No Photographs!\"  Seriously?  These people work so hard to make such beautiful creations and we can't take pictures?  Of food?  (Ironically, the next day we went to Taliesin West and were encouraged to take photographs of everything except the gift shop.)  And, we left empty handed because the store didn't have 2 of the ingredients we needed.\n\nBottom line:  If I'm incredibly unspecific with the ingredients I am looking for, I can definitely do some grocery shopping here.

I am actually salivating as I write this on a full stomach.  It's damn the diet kind of food because this is one of life's great pleasures.\n\nThe most important thing about Rito's green chili burro is avoiding a blowout.  A blowout is defined as recklessly biting into the burro and putting too much pressure on the bottom of the tortilla.  This creates a hole in the tortilla and the stew drips all over you.  Not only do you lose out on the greatness of the broth, but you have a mess on your hands.  Avoid a blowout at all costs.\n\nThe best method I have found is to massage the burro from the bottom up so as to get some of the liquid to the top of the tortilla.  Then when you start taking your first few bites, suck in when you bite.  This ensures you get plenty of liquid with each bite and you sufficiently reduce the pressure on the bottom of the tortilla.\n\nIf the unfortunate occurs and you do experience a blowout, the best course of action is to remember the three second rule and quickly lick up all the broth on your hands, fingers, and table.

Getting food @ Rito's was on the list.  I've lived in Garfield for 2 years, but I work outside of the neighborhood from 9-5, so I'm never around during Rito's business hours (according to a sign inside, M-F, 9-4).  I rode my bike over on a fine, sunny Friday around 12:30.  I approached from the south, so I could see the patio seating.  If you approach from Roosevelt St., it's easy to miss this place!  There's no signage of any kind, but lots of people parking and waiting outside.\n\nThe atmosphere is absolute hole in the wall.  You order through a window with bars at the counter, which is a practical arrangement for the location.  Garfield is pretty chill these days, but that has not always been the case.  There are chairs along the wall for your waiting pleasure, but not nearly enough and they get snagged quickly.  There's a limited menu, but the day I visited, there were 4 specials written on a chalk board.\n\nI am an enchilada girl, so I was pretty happy when I saw them on the specials board.  I know burritos are what Rito's is known for, but I figured I could come back any day and try a burrito.  I ordered 2 cheese enchiladas and a side of beans.  I waited about 15 minutes for my food.  I put it in my bike basket and pedaled home in anticipation of a great Mexican lunch.\n\nThe enchiladas were generous, but the sauce was not nearly as tasty as the sauce at Carolina's.  And the enchiladas were pretty greasy.  The beans were soupy and delicious.  I will not order the enchiladas again, but I will go back and give the burritos a try.  The sodas are in cans, so I passed on a beverage.\n\nI'm glad I didn't wait until next week to make my Rito's excursion, because a sign inside announced that they'll be closed all week for \"spring break.\"", "business_id": "Xo9Im4LmIhQrzJcO4R3ZbA", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-03-23", "type": "review"}

But the long wait can be difficult to bear and the burritos are approaching $6 a piece. \n\nWith that being said this is some of the best green chile I have had in Phoenix. It is mildly spicy with fresh onions and tomatoes, and lean chunks of tender pork. I certainly appreciate that the meat is not accompanied by layers of fat, which I have experienced at other valley eateries. I must confess. I love me some tasty pig and this slightly-too-thin sauce is just squealing for more. Nearly double would be about right. \n\nRito's also needs to add some combo plates to that barren menu. Give me a green chile plate with rice, beans, and flour tortillas for a bit more than a solo burrito and I will repeatedly frequent your establishment. Currently if you'd like some rice and beans with your burro you're lookin' at $8 plus for your lunch. This is not Scottsdale! Some claim that this place has \"the best\" beans. I disagree. They are a bit too salty and runny. On the other hand the rice is simple and satisfying. Also, while not made in-house and instead purchased from Mama Lola's, the tortillas are still quite good. \n\nIn a nutshell visit Rito's if you appreciate some tasty green chile and have lots of time to spare and patience to endure the long line and longer wait. I would recommend going early or late to avoid the lunch rush.", "business_id": "Xo9Im4LmIhQrzJcO4R3ZbA", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-03-02", "type": "review"}

The person in front of us ordered about TWENTY burritos to-go, so it took our food a pretty long time to get out. I would say we waited about half an hour, which kind of sucked. But the food was really good just like all the other reviews say! I ordered the rice and bean burrito with green chile sauce. I think $8 for a burrito is pretty fair, especially considering I could only eat half for my lunch and will be eating the other half for dinner tonight. Plus it's always nice to support a local business. Next time I think I'll try the enchilada.\n\nOh and they only take cash and they seem to run out of coins frequently, so if you have exact change that is even better. And there is no seating inside.

It had cubed pork in it, but I was in love before I even hit any meat. The flavors are so delicious and all of the sauces together were perfect. The beans were super yummy and tasted very fresh and flavorful. We ordered a shredded beef taco that was a special for the day just in case the burrito wasn't going to be enough for the both of us, but it ended up just stuffing us until we couldn't breath. That taco was really good too! It seemed like they freshly fried the taco shell and they were very generous with the beef!

Not everything I had was a home run, but a truly legit Mexican take out spot.\n\nI had recently seen the Check Please AZ segment and read the Yelp reviews about this place.  I live downtown but up until now I didn't even know this place existed.  So I decided to stop by at opening on Saturday morning.  The location is exactly what I expected.  A divvy hole in the wall in the middle of residential street in the Garfield District.  The only parking is in the street and the building isn't labeled so be sure to know the address of this place in advance.  I had heard this place was typically busy at lunch during the work week but expected to get in and out pretty fast on a Saturday.  Uh, no.  The line was 12 deep when I arrived which was just 5 minutes after 10am.  The crowd in line was super diverse (white, black, hispanic, and even asian folks) so clearly word has gotten out about this place.  I believe you can call in your order if you wanna run by and pick it up rather than wait in line like I did.\n\nSo after about 10 minutes in line, I got to put in my order.  The dish that seemingly everyone talks about as Rito's 101 is the Green Chile Burrito Enchilada Style with Red or Green Sauce (I went with Red).  A family friend raved about their refried beans so I got some of those in the bowl as well.  Total price was $10 (FYI, they take credit and debit cards now so its no longer cash only).  Took about 20 minutes to get my food.  It's strictly a takeout place, but they do have a tiny amount of seating outside the building.  Being that it was a warm summer day when I went, I decided to just make the 5 minute drive home to eat.\n\nAlright to the food.  Portions are huge.  Burrito comes in a huge bowl and was oozing red sauce with beans on the side (see my photo).  Smelled divine.  I've had a lot of burritos in my time, but this is up there with some of the best I've had.  Great chunks of meat mixed in with Hatch green chiles.  The red sauce and cheese complimented the tortilla very well and the sauce wasn't as watery as I had feared.  Great burrito all around.  The beans on the other hand were a disappointment.  Maybe its just me, but I prefer my refried beans to have a little more chunkiness to them.  Rito's beans are almost more of a puree.  The taste is fine, I just prefer to taste like I'm biting into actual chunks of beans.\n\nAll in all, I was impressed at the size and quality of the food I got for the money.  As busy as it was today, I can't even imagine how busy it gets during the work week.  Next time I come here I'll try to call ahead and maybe give the chimichangas a whirl.  Would certainly recommend this spot if you're in the neighborhood.  And if you're still hungry after eating one of their burritos, its your fault.", "business_id": "Xo9Im4LmIhQrzJcO4R3ZbA", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-05-17", "type": "review"}

It was admittedly bland. I added lime but decided against any of the bottled hot sauces on the table. I should have spooned over some of the salsa but hind sight 20/20.

Particularly South Phoenix where you can find great Soul Food at Lolo's Chicken and Waffles, Pizza at Amano, and of course various different types and regions of Mexican food. When I say Mexican food I'm really referring to the sort of hole in the wall, real deal family owned operations that are all over the south side of Phoenix. So many of them dot each street corner and call like the Sirens of the night. Marisco's Playa Hermosa is exactly what I mean by this.\n\n\"We bring the sea to the desert\" is their slogan and it's so true. Stepping inside you'll feel like you were just transported to Mazatl\u00e1n, Mexico, the only things missing here is the ocean. The place is just splashed with bright colors with hand carved tables and birds with a welcoming and friendly staff. With so much to take in it's hard to focus on any one thing, though with so many bird carvings hanging from the ceiling I almost felt like I was in the Tiki Room at Disneyland, less the chatter of the birds of course. \n\nChips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant can be a very good benchmark to judge the rest of your meal, Marisco's would have to be at the top of these tests. Their chips are slightly thick, warm and a little on the oily side, this way the salt can adhere well to them. Accompanying are 2 different salsa, red and green. The red has a certain sweet and hot bitterness that is tasty and even better when washed down with a cold beer. The green is made of creamy avocado and with a warm chip is absolutely delicious. Neither were very hot but that's the thing with real deal Mexican food, its not always hot and spicy. So you'll have no reason to expect the \"burning ring of fire\" the next day! \n\nWith so many different and tasty sounding items to choose from, deciding was pretty tough as I really enjoy some good seafood. So imagine this, 8 large perfectly cooked shrimp, swimming in a creamy tomatillo and cilantro sauce, then topped with a sprinkling of cheese. If this sounds like something you would enjoy then go ahead and order the Camarones Culichi ($13.99). You will also get a basket of hot fresh corn or flour tortillas for dunking as well as rice, beans and a fresh lettuce salad dressed with lime juice. The beans have a nice texture with good flavor but the rice is nice! Well steamed and seasoned, the rice has a bright white color which might look bland, but after one bite you'll be wrapping it up in a hot tortilla and dunking it into the beans. \n\nThe Mojarra Frita ($15), a fried whole fried fish, sounds and looks good, but decided to be more like a daddy's little girl and order something less involved. Crab Enchilada's ($13) are not only the house specialty but are good to the last bite. 3 corn tortillas over stuffed with sweet crab meat, rolled together with cheese and covered in a slightly spicy red sauce. Again with the rice, beans and salad this is a pretty large plate and for the money, a great value. The enchiladas were actually featured in Gourmet Magazine at one time, who knew?\n\nOn the back of the menu you'll find a section called Camida Mexicana which are plates of regular Mexican fare such as burritos, taco's and fajitas. Not trying the Carne Asada Taco's ($6.99) would be a real shame since the meat is so tender and the flavor so beefy. A plate full of 3 tacos, double tortilla, chopped beef and onions, with rice and beans is both satisfying and ample. Douse the tacos with some of the guacamole salsa and you'll have a party on your plate! The Quesadilla ($7.99) is just cheese and a tortilla, while good it was quite ordinary. However the smell from the Fajitas De Pollo ($10.99) was amazing! I'll have those to myself next time!\n\nFor dessert you can stick with maybe a Mexican Coke ($2) made with real sugar or a large glass of over ice Horchata ($2.50). Though for something more, the Flan ($4) was different than what you normally get. More cake like and dense than silky smooth, it was decent enough and a nice finish to so many savory dishes. Otherwise there aren't any other desserts offers, like you'll have room after such good sized portions anyway. \n\nMarisco's Playa Hermosa is a real gem and has the menu, friendliness and comfortable vibe to back it up. While the neighborhood feels a bit on the seedy side, as they say, nothing ventured, nothing gained?", "business_id": "Cp6JGY5YIRncTV_My9nf9g", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-03-20", "type": "review"}

This is literally the gold standard.\n\nNot to say there isn't amazing ceviche in other places, or even great ceviches at trendier spots.  This is just what all ceviche needs to start its life as: shrimp, cucumbers, onions and tomato.  Slice of avacado on top, ample selection of hot sauces if you so desire.

When it's 115 outside, getting a lovely, air conditioned place to sit, drink a beer, eat great food....and leave for under $20 for two people makes this a true find.\n\nLast note: the place is freaking ADORABLE, the service is amazing, and if you go more than twice, they will start to remember you.

I was a liitle doubtful but with my first bit I was in love. Sooooo good and so flavorful without the guilt that comes with eating fried food.

You each get your own ceviche tostada and plate of rice, beans and salad (all delicious). They also bring a warmer with corn or flour tortillas.

Plus, there are little chunks of octopus in the sauce itself. If I had to choose a favorite, it would be the fish (or the seafood in general), but every bite of everything was honestly amazing. It may be the best sauce I've ever eaten. \n\nThe service was superb both visits---super friendly, fast and helpful. The server was the one who recommended the molcajete in the first place, actually.

The shrimp needed no sauce at all. The breading was perfectly seasoned and the shrimp were some of the largest and tastiest I have had. There was way to much food for even a hearty eater.

It is so good I have purchased some to take home for later (ask the waitress - even comes iwth chips).\n\nThe first two times I ordered a whole fried fish ajillo, covered in sauteed garlic, peppers and onions.

Note - I did not come for rice and beans ;-).\n\nOnce my wife ordered the Camarones Culichi Shrimps In A Green Sauce, Tomatill & Cilantro, which was excellent.  The waitress recommended it and she was right.  The sauce seems to have some cheese mixed/melted in that made it sinfully savory.\n\nAnother time I ordered tacos al pastor.  OK, I know it is a seafood shop but after the nice ceviche I was ready for some flesh.  The tacos were very good. I liked how their al pastor was crispier than some.  Maybe a personal preference, but they were good.\n\nKey note for me - they offer a variety of margaritas.  I prefer the upcharged one where they mix it themselve, not the premix bottled one.

You have been missing out.  My husband and I were in PHX for a short vacay and after standing in the Hertz rental car line for 40 freaking minutes, I told him we are not going to Chino Bandido but the closest Mexican restaurant we can find on Yelp with the highest ratings.  Lo' and behold, it was Mariscos Playa Hermosa!  Literally 2 miles from the airport and easy to find.  \n\nWe are so glad that we were able to find the best Mexican food we've ever had while in PHX, but it was hard having this as our first meal of the trip.  Every meal after this was just not cutting it.  Therefore, we planned the last day of our trip around the fact that Mariscos Playa Hermosa closed at 8pm on Sundays. \n\nYou really can't go wrong with the menu.  The first time, I ordered Fish Enchiladas and my husband ordered the Garlic Fish platter.  Both were amazing.  Their complimentary ceviche tostada was also delicious, as well as their salsas.   The 2nd time we went, I ordered the Camarones Culichi and my husband ordered another fish dish w/ vegetables.  Both were amazing again.  However, if you go here I would highly recommend the Camarones Culichi.....just because it's not something you find  at any mexican restaurant.  It was so delicious that I licked the plate of sauce clean after eating all of the shrimp, and I don't care how uncouth that might have looked because you will probably end up doing the same.  (Now, if you cannot handle spicy foods, you may want to be very cautious.  Maybe order an Horchata drink to go with the meal, or a side of sour cream to buffer the spiciness.)

At max, there are maybe 15 tables in the entire joint.  However, don't let the size, location, and lack of flashy chain-like display fool you.  The menu has a wide array of choices from fish tacos to different styled fish plates.  I had a fish plate prepared with garlic and a lemon pepper seasoning (Pescado Ajo Mojo I think) as well as an horchata for my beverages.  The food was impeccable!  In my experience, coming across fresh seafood in Phoenix is hard.  The seafood was well prepared and fresh (no gamy-fishy taste).   Additionally, the menu has pictures of almost every dish so you can gauge your interest in a choice (Visual examples appeal to me).\n\nService:  Spot on along with the food!

I've been desiring amazing Mexican restaurants in Arizona.  Since I moved here, I've been to several places that were underwhelming, at best, and generally just not good to me.  So, I'd given up on Mexican Food in AZ and I just didn't eat any.  Well, a conversation in Yelp Talk about Mexican Food inspired me to check out some different places and this one turned up in my searches on Yelp and other websites.\n\nI'm happy to say that I was so thrilled and enjoyed my meal very much at Mariscos Playa Hermosa.  Again, another hole-in-the-wall, but still quite the find.  Mariscos is located in a pretty seedy part of town, so don't get nervous going there.  They close early, so you'd better arrive early.  You will find that there is a full bar inside this colorfully decorated resto.  Don't eat at the bar.  That things not suitable for anything except decoration as the bar itself doesn't extend out far enough to make it comfortable to sit there.  (this is a tip from a person who opted to sit at the bar)\n\nI tasted a few items off the menu.  The shrimp in diablo sauce was my favorite.  I ordered extra diablo sauce on the side.   The sauce has a smokey taste with the heat of the peppers.  Perfect for my heat seeking taste buds.  They prepare the sauce \"fresh to order\".So there is a charge for $3 for the extra sauce on the side to go.  I used that sauce to make more shrimp diablo at home later that week.  \n\nI also enjoyed the camarones culichi... shrimp in green sauce.  Culichi is a tomatillio sauce made with some dairy product and cilantro and of course the poblano or tomatillio peppers.  The sauce is simply to die for.  I left there satisfied and happy!  \n\nI will return and take a friend for the Molcajete Caliente with verde sauce.  Can't wait.  I'm sure it will please.\n\nThey have a check-in offer too, so be sure to check-in.\n\nOh, that parking lot is TINY.

I wasn't sure what to expect but the food sufficiently impressed me.\n\nYou get two salsas with a basket of chips--both of which are super delicious. The avocado salsa was tasty and not super watered-down like at some places. The red one, which is semi-spicy, is very tasty. I don't even know how to describe it. It was just so.... TASTY.\n\nWe received some salmon (I think?) ceviche on a crispy tortilla with our meals. Very yummy and the veggies in it tasted fresh. I ordered the enchiladas de jaiba and the others ordered fish tacos. Both were good although I think I liked the fish tacos better than my enchiladas. I thought the fish was really good and light. I noticed the rice seemed to be made with those frozen mixed veggies you get at the supermarket, which I thought was kind of funny, but it still tasted good so I guess it didn't matter.\n\nService was very prompt even though the server wasn't particularly engaging.

The chips were very oily and I wasn't a big fan, but that initial impression was soon overcome with the best tasting ceviche on top of a crispy corn tortilla. My mom, who isn't a fan of cilantro, said that it was the highlight of her meal. \n\nMy dad and I decided to share the House Special/ Molcajete ($30 for two people), which consisted of shrimps, two tilapila pieces, two chicken slices, and two beef slices in green sauce. It came with corn tortillas, rice, beans, and salad. None of my family members can eat spicy foods, but there is also an option for the \"Diablo\" sauce, which I heard is pretty spicy. We were definitely not let down - it was just the right taste and the right temperature. My mom got the garlic shrimp (I think it was $13?) and the portion for the main piece was relatively small-medium in size, but it also came with rice, beans, and salad. She liked the clean taste.\n\nThe service was great; our waitress constantly checked in to see if we needed anything. The noise level was loud because there were constantly people coming in and out of the restaurant, but that signifies just how many people are fans of this restaurant. Also, for anyone who's curious, there are TVs (might be good for game-days).\n\nAt the end of our meal, we got a free coconut cake by checking in to Yelp, and the cream on the cake was delicious; the icing tasted like a sweeter version of coconut ice cream. When we were finished, we were way too stuffed. Dad said that we should come back again with the aunts - that's one of the rare times I've ever heard him say, \"let's come back again\". \n\nHighly recommended!

It was delicious and had a fresh crispy taste to it  My boss went with the fish tacos, which he really enjoyed and loved, while I stuck with my good to meal.  The Molcajete, which is a fried fish.  It's probably my favorite dish that they have there.  It comes with corn tortillas, beans and rice.  Everything was on point and the food was outstanding.\n\nThey have great ambiance in the restaurant and the service was impeccable.  For all my yelpers, please give this place a try.

Although they were not super busy they were running around like chickens with their heads cut off... BTW... Today's special.... Chicken! ... NOT! \n\nIn reading previous reviews... The biggest complaint is the service... Or lack of it!  Boy oh boy... They were not kidding!  Why o why do they not have ample employees?  Or at least experienced ones? \n\nHEY OWNER... Do yourself a favor... HIRE SOME EMPLOYEES!!\n\nMoving right along... The place is small so you can imagine it would be loud... Which it was... but that's ok.. Made it feel more festive!\n\nIt took forever to just get water and for 10 people they gave only 2 bowls of chips and tiny saucers of hot sauce... Water glasses and drink refills RARELY happened!\n\nWe tried many item between all of us.\n\nThe larger whole fish was moist and delicious! This was the best part of the evening!\n\nThey served their complimentary ceviche which was enjoyable and might I add... A nice touch!\n\nThe shrimp and fish in garlic sauce... Let's talk about that for a sec....\n\nOk, just the other day I cooked some shrimp on the Barbie bathed in butter/garlic. Mine was equally as good if not better because my shrimps were larger.\n\nThey use a medium shrimp that's tasty but nothing the average Joe can't make themselves... The fish part of the dish was a saturated fried piece... \n\nDidn't try the rice simply because it looked unappetizing and did not care for the beans... I related them to baked beans... Like in hot dogs and beans... That's the initial taste.\n\nWe also tried the crab enchiladas ... Again not impressed... It was filled with crab meat but did not care for the taste ... Nor did anyone at the table.\n\nThe tortillas were tortillas nothing special.\n\nBack to the service...I don't want to hear excuses like \" it was very busy\" because according you all those 5 star reviews( which I just don't get) you should expect it to be super busy on a Saturday night!\n\nOne end of the table was almost finished by the time the other end got their food... The servers had absolutely no idea who had what so she pretty much passed the plates and we figured it out ourselves!  \n\nI had to ask for all the dirty dishes to be taken away as nobody came to take them.\n\nOn to dessert...they knew we were there for a Birthday and we had to remind them several times.  For the birthday girl they give a piece of cake and she chose \" tres leche cake\" the cake was unlike any Tres Leche I have had.. Had a raspberry? Filling and did not taste very leche... I am no expert at this but the ones I have tried sit in the leche which absorbs into the cake making it somewhat soggy and delicious... This was different ...  I am sure there are many different kinds but it was not a hit at the table...\n\nSo, they have this other deal... Where they bribe you to YELP a reviews using names of servers and when they confirm it was posted they give you a piece of coconut cake...so one of the kids at the table did it...\n\nI must say...the coconut cake was delish! Very moist and lots of coconut!\n\nGetting the check was another challenge and when we did get it they charged for 3 items of which we only had 2....\n\nReally makes me wonder... Between the REVIEW BRIBES and the mistakes on the check.... How much money they make this way?\n\nSince we live nowhere close the chances of any of us returning are slim ...\n\nOn goes my quest to find some great Mexican food!\n\nI imagine when a restaurant knows they are going to be on TV they make sure everything tastes great and service is great...\n\nBut on any other day you see how it really is... Don't believe everything you see on TV\n\nIt is a cute place and the fish was good... Give it a try... See what you think!\n\nNever base a decision on one persons review... Food is a preference and I am very tough critic!  \n\nBon Appetite'", "business_id": "Cp6JGY5YIRncTV_My9nf9g", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-05-24", "type": "review"}

I have to disagree on that.\n* Service was quick, our food came fast and it was fairly busy at the time.\n* Their menu has an English side for those who are less adept at differing Sopas and Sopes.\n* It's CHEAP!  Two very full people left only spending a total of ten bucks.\n* The salsa was SPICY.  Sometimes it seems to be tough to find places that take the risk of offending people with sensitive taste buds.\n\nThe Meh:\n* Maybe it was just b/c it was Sunday, but our server didn't really seem happy that we, nor she, were in El Nopalito\n* They may have been the smallest tacos I've ever had.  That being said, they were only a buck.\n* El Nopalito is located so close to so many great restaurants that it'll be tough to justify skipping some of those.\n* The chips for the salsa were lackluster at best.\n\nOverall I had a good experience.

I must say this time the sopes were smaller and they did not have much beans on them in fact they didn't put much on them at all. usually they are topped with beans lettuce oinons and shredded cheese this time it was just a small  amount of beans, and just a tiny amount of lettuce. I also orderd chillis torreados with onions. the chillis  are always perfect here they don't over cook them. the onions on the other hand are always very oily and over cooked.

Definitely not a bad experience and the atmosphere inside is a lot more pleasant than you would assume when driving by (think shady area).  Of course, this is the case with many of Phoenix's best Mexican spots.  \n\nThe atmosphere inside was nice, the server was really friendly and helped out almost immediately.  Pozoleria Guerrero is open on Sundays which is nice as well.\n\nThe menu is fairly extensive, including the usual assortment of tacos, tortas, burritos, quesadillas, and of course pozole.  I decided to go with their specialty and got the pozole Rojo.  For those who don't know what pozole is, it's a type of pork stew that has little pieces of hominy blended in.  The spicing is excellent, and it left me with a runny nose.  A normal bowl will run you $7.25.  Other items on the menu were reasonable, with tacos ranging from a buck to $1.25.\n\nThe salsa was interesting and really spicy but good as well, although the chips were thin and left something to be desired.\n\nAll in all Pozoleria Guerrero #1 was a decent spot and I think it comes down to whether you want to get pozole.

This Macayo's location is filthy (bathrooms as well), dirty, dark, and outdated.

Then when we got our food again disappointment as it was not up to par with good food. I decided not to write this place off as maybe this was a one off and the manager replaced our food. \n\nA few weeks later myself and roommate decided to get take out. We both got the steak  fajitas. Might I say we spent $18.00 and it was just gross . The meat was not cooked the other food was over cooked . At this point I called the manager to advise of these bad expirences. He apologized and that was it ! No offer to remake it and come back in . No offer of a refund for disappointment , nothing . \n\nI have now decided to share this with everyone to know this location is beyond bad and to not go here . If I could give it no star I would ! I will never return to this location or any other location again . If this place is not boycotted they will continue to make poor food and make money .

Generally speaking, the service might be called good service (\"...except for the owner who is...\").\n\nBe prepared to wait and no matter what, the wait to get your food is always slow no matter how empty or packed--ESPECIALLY if you order take out and ask how long before pick up will be ready. On a recent occasion, I placed a take out order and asked the owner on the phone how long it would take and he told me 20 min.  I waited 15 min before leaving the house and it took 5 min to get there. When I arrived and asked for my order, I was courteously advised by the cashier that it was \"not yet finished.\" I watched the kitchen staff as they initiated preparing my order from the beginning. As I observed this process I asked the clerk why she said my order was already in process and she responded that \"...it was.\"\n\nWhen I had first inquired about my order (having been told it was 'nearly ready') I asked whether chips had been included and the owner advised me that I would have had to have ordered chip and paid for them.  While I waited AT the restaurant for my order for 20 min (that is in addition to the 20 min I waited before leaving my home) I would have thought management would have been courteous enough to offer me chips while I waited. They did not. So, instead of apologizing for the inconvenience of waiting on them or making my wait pleasant, I left a very dissatisfied customer.\n\nWhen I got home with my order, I had to endure my companion's complaints that the Albondigas was skimpy on the meatballs. Same said companion used to frequent Juan's extensively several years ago when he worked closer. He now challenges me each time I indicate intent to go there and refreshes my memory on past disappointments.\n\nThe burritos are indeed well made and are pretty much the highlight of the menu. The tosdadas shell are not freshly fried (you can see them sitting on a shelf above the grill), yet, my tostada was still soft. The prices are cheap $7-8 combos.

Go because it is a consistent suck, and the suck you know is better than the suck you don't.\nYou may end up pleasantly surprised.  Happens to me all the time.\n\n(If you don't expect it to taste like a PIZZA at all, a Totino's frozen cracker with sauce and toppings can actaully be a little tasty.)\n\nPancho's has all that I love in a cheapo boofay.  There's a lot of variety to choose from, and of course, as much as you can stuff in your gullet.  They even have the added benefit of a server to bring you your seconds and beyond.  I just wish the food was more consistent.\nIf you go on a day that the cooks know what they're doing with the fryer, it makes all the difference in the world.  There are a lot of items that are cooked that way - chicken taquitos, turkey flautas, tortilla chips, sopaipillas, etc - that are so good when they achieve the proper consistency on the delicate \"Crispy~Greasy Spectrum\", but so nasty when they are not.\nThe salsas are actually pretty good.  They have a few from which to choose, from mild and tomatoey to a chunky&HOT roasted number.  They used to have one of the better tomatillo salsa verdes I've had, but I don't think they make it anymore.\n\nYour best bet seems to be to avoid the busiest times with the most children.  Lunch or late weeknights should be okay.  Unless you're bringing a group of kids, who should LOVE IT here.\n\nOn bad days, it's easily a 1, but on good days it can be a 3.5, so I'm going with a rating of 3, as long as you go knowing what to expect.\n\nTo a realist, the glass is always full - half with water, half with air.  \nI eat at crappy places and enjoy it.\nStone me.", "business_id": "od49_DFUJY9louGx80My-A", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-05-29", "type": "review"}

Very tourist trap'esk.\n\nMy first experience here was probably 7 years ago. Went out to dinner with some friends. This was recommended by a buddy who had bused here back in high school. Suffering from testosterone poisoning all chow'ed into the hatch chili cheese crisp and pretended it wasn't as hot as it was. Later this turned into a weekend ritual for my Dad and I to catch up, have a cheese crisp, and some delicious pork chile verde. Ahh the old fat and happy days.\n\nOnto the food:\n\nChips:\nThinking back on all my Mexican food experiences I've had a bad chip experience once or twice at every place excluding this one. The chips have always been fresh, evenly salted, never burnt, and have never suffered from an oil slick.\n\nSalsa/Dips:\nMild: Tasty standard senoran style salsa. Stewed tomatoes, green onion, green chili, cilantro, onion, garlic. Nice bright clean flavor.\nHot: I really love this stuff and I wish they gave you larger sides by default. This is a super garlicky \"taco\" style sauce but with more texture then the pureed cousin. Very heavy on the garlic and red pepper flakes. Crave this stuff.\nBean Dip: Delicious fatty creamy refried bean dip.\n\n\nQueso Fundido:\nA spicy, cheesy, melty happy place. Its brought to the table with some type of alcohol burning off. The chorizo, jalapeno, onion, tomato, and jack cheese are a perfectly melted and ready to burn through some baskets of chips. This will do wonders for your girlish figure.\n\nHatch Chile Cheese Crisp:\nOften a little overly done for my liking. It will snap into a million pieces on  your if you aren't careful. The cheese blend is tasty. These Chile's are HOT! I'm a spicy person and they warm me up. They will burn... twice ;) What is it with 50% of all Mexican places failing miserably at fully slicing their cheese crisps? Good luck pulling off a clean slice. Cover this in the hot sauce for and extra happy mouth.\n\nPork Chile Verde:\nI don't consider Arribas to be a true chain since it is local. That being said it still pains me when my favorite variation of a dish comes from a chain-like but it's the case here. This is the best pork green chile I've sampled in the valley. The chile flavor, the tender pork chunks, the liquefied pork fat mixed with the chile juice. Making myself drool over here. Ask for sans the jalapenos or on the side, it just takes away from the flavor.\n\nRibs:\nWHAT?!?! ribs at a Mexican place? Yeah that's right and they are actually tasty. I often have to try and fit multiple food cravings into a single restaurant. I don't believe all locations offer these but camelback does. They are likely parboiled then grilled off which is a strike in my book. However, the sauce is the right combo of sweet and spicy, very tender, not insanely fatty, and I think I can safely say they are the best ribs you will have at a Mexican restaurant ;)\n\nGuacamole:\nNot my favorite. This stuff is so packed full of tomatoes and onion filler that it's a terrible rip off. It is fresh and it does have a decent flavor but it leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nRice:\nNice and fluffy here but a tad on the greasy side. It also tends to be a little al dente which isn't a bad thing.\n\nBeans:\nI really love the charro beans. Ranch style whole beans but in a salsa base with a smoky meat flavor. I would go for these over the refried any day.\n\nI've never had a bad service experience here. It can be a little slower at times but the staff is always nice and attentive.", "business_id": "ib-y5nsfn3unE0lLY1vfAw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-04-19", "type": "review"}

In my humble opinion it's a tad better than Garcia's, and FAR better than Macayo's.\n\nThe only thing keeping me from giving them 5 stars is that the restaurant itself is starting to show its age around the edges and you can see the wear and tear in the decor itself.

This is exactly what a great cozy martini/wine bar should feel like - the dented copper bar, the iPod music, the big TV with sports that is somewhat incongruous but at the same time fits so well. The fireplace.\n\nThe service rocks, most of the time. I think I've had a few sullen servers at times - and some that aren't so knowledgeable about the menu - but for the most part, the bartenders rock.\n\nThe apps are why you should come here, especially during happy hour. Almost every one of them is phenomenal. The crab on the tostadas is my favorite, followed by the tenderloin toasts. The scallops are great, also.\n\nThe bad: The actual meals. I shouldn't say *bad*, but I've always been less than impressed by my meals here. I had a fish with mango salsa dish once that was borderline terrible. The Osso Buco is meh, and the steaks are good but not great.\n\nThe prices. Bring your best plastic cuz yer gonna drop at least a bill for two people - probably more like two bills. Martinis and glasses of wine run 12-14, and meals are 25-30ish. All the prices really seem amped up a notch compared to the actual quality of the food/drink you're getting; I suppose you pay for the atmosphere.\n\nConclusion - come here for happy hour drinks and appetizers. Skip coming here for a meal, and head down the street to the Barrio. If you're gonna spend a fortune, might as well enjoy it.", "business_id": "5kRug3bEienrpovtPRVVwg", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-03-09", "type": "review"}

This was one of my favorite places to visit, to introduce newcomers to, treat family and friends, and for a time I'd visit once every two months or so. My previous three visits have not gone so well; I'll relate my latest visit which took place just over a week ago. A friend attempted to make reservations for two on a Thursday. He was told that due to a policy change by  Richardson, a reservation for two on a Thursday could no longer be taken, as there was disappointment that their business for tables of 4 or more were suffering. Okay, I can understand, business decisions have to be made, but cut your nose off to spite your face? However, the woman that answered the phone let us know there should be no problem getting a table. I was seated shortly before my friend arrived so I had a chance to look over the menu. To my surprise, some changes have been made. First, a salad choice (and they're all very typically very yummy), anyway, a choice is no longer offered. Instead, the house salad is offered at $4 with the entree purchase. Next, a statement is now printed across the top of the menu letting the patron know \"you order it, you bought it\"...is this REALLY necessary? While the server and busboy were friendly and helpful (my water glass was never empty), my $4 house salad arrived about 90 seconds before our entrees did. Oh, the accompanying bread was hard as stone and arrived with my salad, while an attentive server should have brought it along just after our drinks were served, as my dinner partner hadn't ordered a salad. Oh, my friend, he's typically a big fan of the Steak Rokerij, and absolutely loves the crab/hollandaise sauce mixture. As normal, he asked for more sauce. On this visit, we found $10 added to the check for that request. We found that unusual for Rokerij. Things have certainly changed. I was willing to overlook these changes, after all, the economy is poor these days. I excused myself to use the men's room. After all, we did have Chimay (Rokerij has never had a wide beer selection). I found the towel basket to be so PACKED with paper-towels, I couldn't get one out of the basket, which is on a vanity so small, when you turn the water on, the towels become soaked. This explains the stained, linen towel basket liner...the stains were grays and greens. Overall, I feel that these things add up to failing to pay attention to detail. It's a shame really. I really hope the best for Richardson and hope Rokerij can return to it's former self.", "business_id": "5kRug3bEienrpovtPRVVwg", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-05-02", "type": "review"}

I've been going there since literally before it opened (the dry run) and have always had good food and service that ranges from acceptable to great with one notable exception. On that occasion I called and complained just to make the manger aware and she made it right and made it impossible to complain any further. This is an insider place that I tell and take out of town business guests to as well. Although I liked it more before the remodel when it was a bit more formal and different from Richardson's. Now the menus are much more similar but Rokerij has tapas items, I think they call small plates almost all of which are awesome, especially the Brie Toasts with Steak. I remember when they first changed the menu we went in and someone said, \"Wait a minute, this is the same as the damn Richardson's menu\", we looked at each other and said, \"Sweet\" and enjoyed our meals anyway. My cork-dork friends like the wine list and I like the cocktails. The atmosphere is nice but casual, dark wood, big booths, fireplace and etc. they have a decent bar downstairs (and one upstairs as well) where you can also eat if you want to sit in a line at the bar (also three booths and another fireplace with couch and club chairs) but it makes me a bit claustrophobic to be locked in there.

The tiny restaurant is housed in, literally, a cool old stone house. I hadn't been for a year or so and ventured over last weekend to visit their bar, which, it should be noted, is actually underneath the restaurant (read: basement bar; yes, I know finding a basement in Arizona is rare). The atmosphere couldn't be more charming - picture dark and cozy, a long bar, several couches, and a crackling fireplace with leather armchairs. \n\nNow to the best part - half off wine bottles on Sundays. For all of you wine lovers out there, you know that scoring a bottle for half price is a treat. To make things even better, there wasn't a bottle on the basic wine list over $50, meaning that you can buy a great bottle for less than the cost of a cheap pair of heels. Let's consider the options here - a pair of cheap shoes that will inevitably hurt and be worn twice, or a bottle of wine? Clearly the wine is the best choice. It should also be noted that the half off applies to the reserve wine list, another unusual perk of this hidden treasure.\n\nThe fabulous wine discounts are made even better by the Rokerij's $5 small plates. These are slightly larger than standard tapas, and you'll find everything from sweet and sour short ribs and bacon wrapped scallops to my favorite, king crab tostada bites. Order a few to share - you're sure to find something on their rather extensive menu of choices. \n\nThe bartenders were friendly and knowledgeable, making a few recommendations and chatting as appropriate, but not excessively. This is truly a great local hang out. I made a note to myself, upon leaving, that I needed to head back sooner rather than later.

Chile Relleno made with pork (even though I wanted duck), Ceviche and the  Beef Tenderloin toasts.  The chile relleno and toasts were to die for! The pork inside the relleno was smoky and tender and flavorful. So darn good! As were the toasts. I could have eaten two orders all by myself. The meat was so tender and tore apart with the toast without tugging. The cheese was creamy and just the right amount topping off a buttery toast. YUM!!  The ceviche was good, but nothing out of the ordinary. I will for sure order the toasts again and try the garlic plate. A couple next to us ordered it and it looked delicious. \n\n\nThe staff and chef there were very nice and took great care of us! I canNOT wait to go back. I have been craving it since I left.

The bar fills up quickly and you can only get the specials at the bar. I have to say that this is one of my new favorite HH spots! I went on a Tuesday night and they have half off bottles of wine, all night. Good thing since I needed something to wash down the delectable bacon wrapped scallops. \n\nThe small plates deals during HH are great and such a great departure from the usual HH bites... I don't know about you but I'm tired of fried things and bruschetta. How much bruschetta can Phoenix handle?!\nYet, I digress. The small plates, from $9 to $5 a plate... such a good deal. We had the scallops I mentioned, really good scallops- worth the regular price of $9. We also had the Beef Tenderloin/Brie toasts, a little heavy on the brie, but the barkeep raved that they were the best thing he's ever had... (Maybe he should try Postino's toast?) Stuffed mushrooms were good, the taco combo plate- Great Mexico City style tacos, and I'm a huge critic of Mexican food and these were actually very good. Except 1, 1 was a wee bit too spicy for me. And I LOVE spicy. Maybe it was the wine bringing out the tingling on my tongue? We also got the oysters rokerij, similar to Green Mussels you would get at a sushi place... Very yummy. \n\nThere were 3 in our party and we walked out of the place full and pleasantly toasty for $60 total- this isn't your Chili's HH but I'm more than willing to spend $20 for the atmosphere, the drink, and the food.

I am a fan of Richardson's so I thought we should check this place out.  Stopped in on a Friday night around 8pm without reservations just to see how long the wait would be.  Great host at the door greeted us and was really friendly.  He said there was over an hour wait upstairs but we could try our chances downstairs where it was all open seating.  We headed downstairs, grabbed a couple glasses of wine and waited for seats to open up.  We waited quite a long time for a table and multiple groups were able to grab seats before us, so we saw a couple ladies paying their  tab and asked if we could get their seats when they were ready to leave.  We ended up talking to them for a while before they left.  When we went to sit down, a very unfriendly brunette bartender said this other couple had been waiting longer and were next on \"the list\".  The other couple was already sitting!  She gave them our seats  at the bar and someone else who had just walked in grabbed their chairs.  I'll never be back.  If there's a list, tell the door guy and offer people to put their names on it when they arrive.  And if that couple needed to sit at the bar so bad, I would have been fine with the table.

When they set down the steaming hot plates the food was cooked to nuclear levels because there  was a one inch crust around the plate and the beans were so dried out it was comical. Now mind you, these are $16 and $18 dollar plates of food. That is borderline fine dinning pricing and should come out looking as such. We promptly sent the food back and the manager came out and apologized which was appreciated. He stated that \"it was inexcusable the way the food came out (which our server didn't monitor) and that his cook is obviously more interested in cleaning and getting out of here, then preparing the food.\" They offered to remake the food but it was literally too late around 10:45 and we didn't want to wait. They then took the food off but left the other stuff on. The bill came out to around 42 dollars. Which seemed unreasonable after only having a beer, a cocktail, two appetizers and a totally ruined dinning experience. We didn't mention the cockroach or the fact that it was my 30th birthday to the manager but it boils down to this: after that kind of experience he could of saved our business by comping the meal. The fact that we had TWO ruined entrees and walked out of their still hungry AND paying 40 dollars is bullshit. There are too many other quality options in this town with exceptional service. I wont ever go back to Rokerij.", "business_id": "5kRug3bEienrpovtPRVVwg", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-03-04", "type": "review"}

We saw that Rokerij had 1/2 off wine on Mondays....perfect.  We have had bad luck with new places lately so when we walked in and the place was so dark it looked like a basement, we got nervous.  Only negative about our entire experience is that we wanted to sit on the patio, and we couldn't bc technically the patio is only for their sister restaurant 'Richardsons'.  \n\nAfter our initial reservations, our experience quickly became one of our favs.  We ordered from the small plates, 3 apps for $25.  Everything was seriously amazing.  We did order a 4th app which again didn't disappoint.  Service was amazing.  Our server was really passionate about the food, saying he himself only got a job after eating here and loving it so much.  He also pointed out that happy hour at the bar includes every app for $5 and wine for $5....seriously?!  These apps are not your standard bar apps.  They include, salmon, oysters and more.

I really want to like this place but they have given me no reason to, unfortunate, I know.  I am actually shocked they have such a good rating on yelp.\n\nFirst of all, one main problem they have is that there is no place to wait. There is no real hostess stand, so you must stand there awkwardly waiting for your table to be ready.  You are always in the way and the staff is not shy about letting you know that.  Thinkng about it, there are 4 seats by the fireplace, but you are again, awkwardly squished in between 4 booths and simply in the way. \n\nOn at least four of the visits we made reservations at least a week in advance.  Everytime our table is not ready.  The shortest amount of time we waited was 30 minutes- WITH a reservation.  The worst time we waited almost 2 hours on a weeknight.  The \"manager\" offered us a round of drinks when we told him we were going to leave and took our order.  When dinner was over and the bill finally came my glass of wine was on the bill.  I questioned him about it and he said that since my order was more expensive than the others in the group I would have to pay for it.  I don't think he expected me, a 25 year old female, to fight him on it but I did.  I reminded him that he said round of drinks without a specification of type.  If there was a price limit I would have made a different choice.  After looking at me like he wanted to fight me some more he walked away and brought back a revised bill.  Without saying a word then disappearing turns out he gave a credit to the bill for the price of a beer.  REALLY? Great customer service. The price difference was only $1.50. He shouldn't be considered a manager.  \n\nThe next time we were there, while still enjoying our cocktails and drinks, a new manager asked us if they could relocate us to the patio very abruptly.  Mind you the place was almost empty and it was about 10:30pm.  They claimed a new party was coming in and they needed our table.  So, feeling kicked out we reluctantly said yes and he said they would set us up by a heater (it was December) and send over a complimentary bottle of wine.  We got outside, the booth was cement and the heater was out of propane. We were freezing and then a waiter came over for drink orders.  We were all so confused we explained the situation and then he disappeared never to come back.  We promptly finished our drinks from dinner and opted to leave in lieu of freezing while we waited for that complementary bottle of wine to appear.\n\nMy real issue is with the food.  I like my meat cooked medium well, I am weird about the temperature of my meat because I have gotten sick before.  Any time I order my burgers medium well they come out medium or medium rare.  It is so frustrating so I stopped ordering beef there altogether.  \n\nOn a whim, I went here on a Saturday afternoon with my boyfriend.  I knew better than to order meat, so I opted for enchiladas, but my boyfriend chose a burger.  The place was empty and there were only 5 other people there so I figured he was safe and I didn't say anything.  He ordered his burger medium rare (he typically enjoys red meat very red and isn't picky like me), big mistake.  After 30 minutes of waiting our food came.  He cut into his burger where it was revealed to be completely raw.  I mean RAW.  Not even cooked rare, this thing was still mooing, even he was grossed out.  We called over the waiter and explained the issue, he said they would throw it back on the grill because making a new one would take too long.  Ummm ok, strike one.  The kitchen is open to the restaurant and the waiter took the burger to the chef and the chef yelled, that's medium rare, what the hell is the problem? We saw the whole thing.  He threw, literally threw, the burger on the grill and then just stared at us.  Strike two.  The waiter came back and said that's what the chef considers medium rare.  We told him it was ice cold in the middle and if my boyfriend would have eaten it he would have gotten ill. He said oh no, that wouldn't make him sick, it's very good quality. Uhhh strike three.  Stunned, I said if that burger was medium rare, tell the chef he wants it medium well (hoping it would then be medium rare).  When it arrived, it was charred so badly you could barely cut into it, clearly the chef was making a statement, strike four.  The waiter noticed that the burger was now inedible and didn't say anything, just cleared our plates and brought over the check.  No apologies, no discounts, no comped meal, nothing. Strike 5, they forfeited the game.  \n\nAfter we left, I decided I would never go back.  I was literally in shock as to what just happened.  My advice is to steer clear of this place, the food, even the New Mexican specialties, are mediocre at best.  I can't think of anything that would make me want to go back.

It also came highly recommended by my Dad, and knowing how picky he is, I knew I had to check this place out. \n\nAppetizers/Small Plates:\n\nBacon-Wrapped Scallops- I saw this as one of the review highlights and knew I had to have it. The BWS were huge, cooked perfectly and they are served with four amazing sauces that are the Chef's choice for the night. On this night they were 2 kinds of Green Salsa, Red Salsa and a Hollandaise sauce. My clear favorites were the Hollandaise and the Red Salsa but they were all good. 5*\n\nPan-Seared Salmon- Small bite-sized pieces of Salmon with a Chipotle-Mayo. The Salmon itself could've used some seasoning but the Chipotle-Mayo was excellent. 4*\n\nSanta Fe Trail:\n\nCarne Adovada- Smoked Pork shoulder that's simmered in a Red Chile sauce and served with Rice and Beans. The Rice and Beans were pretty standard, but the Pork itself was excellent. It literally seemed to get better and better as the meal went on but it also got progressively hotter and hotter as the meal went on; I was sweating like Britney Spears on Jeopardy by the time I was done eating. 4.5*\n\nChile Potato- Apparently this is one of the dishes that Rokerij is famous for. It's a fire-roasted green Hatch Chile that's stuffed with a mashed potato mixture. I'm not sure if I had it on an off-night, or what, but it just didn't do it for me. I mean everything was there for a stupendous dish but there just wasn't any flavor. I had my sis and Bro-in-law try some just to verify it wasn't me and they agreed it was a fail. 2*\n\nBeverages- Rokerij has a really impressive wine selection -which I'm not really into- and a mediocre beer selection; I was not impressed with their draft selection. They also have an \u00fcber-cool underground (literally and figuratively!) bar that is separate from the restaurant itself; I can imagine the shenanigans that ensue there! 4*\n\nService & Ambiance- Our waitress was very friendly and extremely knowledgeable about the menu because my sister always has questions (Oy gevalt...) and she answered them all quickly and to her satisfaction. Rokerij is very dark; has a nice wood and brick interior; and even has a fireplace going at all times--which is kinda odd seeing that it's in Arizona. The ambiance is definitely set for a date night kinda mood: very romantic and sexy--not the place you wanna bring a precocious 3-year-old (Whoops!). 4.75*\n\nValue- Pretty good value for a really nice place like this. I'd say the avg entr\u00e9e runs anywhere from $15-30; which is pretty good for high quality food. 4*\n\nIf you're looking for a great restaurant to impress a special someone; a place to celebrate a special event; or even something as casual as a date night then this is the place for you. I wouldn't recommend bringing kids with you as it's just not a kid friendly place and that's ok, too.

Chocolate Flan with a 1/2 shot of Grand Marnier completed the trifecta.\n\nReally love the way they layer the flavors. The atmosphere of this place and friendly servers are also a delight. We arrived early and were able to get a large table by their cozy rustic fireplace.\n\nPlace gets really busy quick. Try and go before the crowd and you will enjoy everything that much more. When we were leaving it was starting to get crazy. DRINKS ON ME EVERYONE!\n\n5 STARS", "business_id": "5kRug3bEienrpovtPRVVwg", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-04-08", "type": "review"}

And while the vibe is cool and the cuisine is pretty darn good, the glaring red flag for me about this place is the high prices.\n\nMy date had not been here before so I happily brought her by.  It had been about 9 months since my last trip here and I faintly remembered the food being on the pricey side, but not to the extent that I would shy away from here.  This place is pretty popular during happy hour as the upstairs bar was packed right as we arrived.  We suspected the same was true of their basement bar as well so we stuck around the main dining area.  If you've been to Richardson's and/or Dick's Hideaway just a stones throw away, then some of the menu will look familiar.  Rokerij however also has a lot of dishes you'd expect to find at a steakhouse or a cafe that often have no New Mexican influence at all.  Such items include oysters, rib eyes, porterhouses, and (oddly) pizzas.  The New Mexican dishes that both Rokerij and Richardson's serve are pretty reasonably priced around $15 each.  But most of the other items run around $30 and up.  Even the appetizers are around $15 a piece.\n\nNot wanting to break the bank, I got a pair of their tapas plates.  I got their prime rib sliders as well as their Carne Adovada sliders.  For $10 a plate you get three sliders each.  I'm pretty convinced the tapas menu is the way to go here.  The portions weren't huge, but large enough to leave me satisfied and you can get a little taste of multiple items.  The Carne Adovada pork mixed with red chile is tender and not too spicy.  The prime rib sliders had just the right amount of horseradish sauce on them, though there wasn't as much meat on those sliders as I expected.  I would love to try some of their blackboard menu items sometime as some of those looked great, but again, pricey.\n\nPerhaps I should've been more prepared to pay the asking price of this place.  The setup of the restaurant is really cool and I like the unique New Mexican twists they put on the everyday grub.  The food has been good both times I've been here, but is it good enough to drop $30/entree?  I'll leave that up to you.  I'd certainly come back here for a special occasion, but this wouldn't be an everyday stop for me.  Too much of a shock to my bank account.", "business_id": "5kRug3bEienrpovtPRVVwg", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-04-15", "type": "review"}

First off, since they are side by side and have the same owner, I am giving both restaurants three and one-half stars.   I have had pan-seared salmon and the beef tenderloin skewers off of the \"small plates\" menu.    Both are cooked and flavored to perfection.   Yummm!!   Last night for dinner I had the carne adovada, and my companion had the chimayo chicken.    I tasted his chicken, and, yes, it was good but nothing outstanding.   I liked my meal much better.   His side dish of the potato on the poblano was typical mashed potato with a chili flavor.     I guess that would make sense since it was sitting on the chili.   I asked our server how hot the red sauce was for the pork.   She stated that if it wasn't quite hot enough, she could bring a hotter sauce, which she did.   The pork was flavorful, but it could have used more sauce.   The rice and beans and flour tortilla were average, typical I guess one could say.    I ordered a glass of their red wine.    Sorry.    I can't remember the name of it, and the wine list isn't posted so I can't access it.    It was $15/glass, and it was heavy bodied, just the way I like it.    I would go back, especially since it is conveniently located.    Is it outstanding?    No.    I wouldn't say so.", "business_id": "5kRug3bEienrpovtPRVVwg", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-04-28", "type": "review"}

This is a trendy spot, and like so many trendy places, the flash in the pan goes away with the crowd to the next trendy place. Let's start with the name, our waitress explained that Rokerij is a word that the Swiss use for smoke house. There is virtually nothing on this restaurants menu that has anything to do with a Swedish Smoke House. Please be warned... NOTHING TO DO WITH SMOKE HOUSE COOKING!\n\nThe menu blends the food from Richardson's (New Mexican cusine) which adjoins this place with a spiced version of American Classics.\n\nOK here is the blow by blow...\n\nIt is my Daughters birthday dinner, she asked if we could have it at the Rokerij as she and her sister had tried to get in on a Friday or Saturday and the wait was about 3 hours. She was excited that this would be something special. It's Monday and the 5 of us arrive in stages. Jo and I were first, the parking seems to be shared with Richardson's it appears to be limited and Valet only.... It says complimentary, however it is just rude not to tip a valet.  The valet took the car and pointed us to the outer stairs to the lower level. This is a bar and it was full of puppy yuppies... OK it is a lame reference back in time but it fits.\n\nWe asked about the reservation that my daughter placed, they pointed us back up and around an interior staircase. Up above we were met by the young gal at reception and again we asked about the reservation that they looked up and did not find. There were plenty of empty tables so they did seat us right away. Good for starters... ***Here is another tip Monday nights many of the bottles of wine on the list are half priced*** We ordered a Malbec it was passable. If I was paying the full $30 for the bottle it would have been disappointing.\n\nMy birthday girl arrived so we ordered the Mushroom Toast appetizer, it was not bad or outstanding in anyway. But good drink and conversation was the key to the moment. My youngest soon arrived and the decisions as to what to eat began in earnest. One steak, two salads, the creme brulee, and relleno platter with one beef and one pork...\n\nDid I mention that the menu was printed on place-mats? That there are no smoke house items on the menu... That the menu has Schnitzel, Mexican, Duck with Orange Chipolte, and a miss mash of other cuisines... I think the Chef or Mr Richardson lost track of what they were trying to do. You can see the menu online, but I for one can't figure out what the essence of this place is. \n\nI am so sorry that the expectation was so much more than the meal. I really don't like to dis an establishment. It is a beautiful location in the place that Timothy's Jazz Club was once. But nothing came out that was exceptional except the creme brulee. The rest was simply not great. Not worth the cost... and you will not be sorry if you take a pass on this place.\n\nOne last sorry note, the waitress knew that it was my Daughter's birthday and did absolutely nothing to acknowledge that. No dessert... no nothing... If you are reading this Mr Richardson... you should be ashamed\n...", "business_id": "5kRug3bEienrpovtPRVVwg", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-05-05", "type": "review"}

But we did not leave satisfied with the service or with that normal food high ( Damn that was delicious I want more, right now) as I have in the past 5 years we have been patrons, which is a bummer. \n\nOver the last 2 or so years I feel like we've seen their best servers and bartenders all leave! Makes you wonder. Anyway, Service was one of the things we initially loved about Rokerij's intimate setting and it really sucked tonight. \n\nWe sat downstairs at the bar top like we usually do. There were 5 other people as guests downstairs. It wasn't busy although it happened to be during the late night happy hour. The bartender( name on our bill says Phil)  seemed immediately annoyed. Cheer up Phil. \n\nI won't bore you with what we ordered, but it was the bartenders attitude and rude demeanor that were extremely off putting. \n\nYou couldn't even call the 5 people seated downstairs a crowd, I shouldn't have to flag you down to put in 2 appetizers! I want to eat, and spend money! \n\nHey, I know everyone has rough days. I actually had a tough day at work and came here thinking I could relax and unwind! We came with the full intent of ordering entrees( and both did)  but his assumption that we were just in it for the 5$ apps was an amateur move and rude. He rolled his eyes when I asked if we could put in our order for entrees. That should have been my cue to just stick with the apps since that seemed to be as much as this dude could handle. \n\nMind you, it was only 1030 and the kitchen closes at midnight so it's not like we were super last minute.\n\nHe never once asked us how any of the food was because it was apparent he didn't care. Shame. One app came out cold ( luckily I am a slave to sloppy joes and was starving so I quickly gobbled it up anyway) and my burger was dry and not cooked to order. Which has never happened to me when previously ordering here. \n\nAs soon as our entrees arrived , shortly after 11pm, he was already starting to clean up the bar (which is open til 1 am). Suddenly beside me he is slamming down overgrown tulips in bud vases and blown out votive candles from all the surrounding tables. Ex-nay ambiance. As well as the salt n pepper shakers. Coulda used that for my entree, ha! \n\nI also had to ask for the bill twice. What gives? I bet Richardson (the owner) doesn't stress out about yelp reviews but as repeat loyal guests we felt unwelcome and disappointed by the serious lack of service, which is important to us. \n\nI'm not so dramatic that I'll say we're never going back, because I live down the street and this has been one of our fave places.. just disappointed that I have to *hope* it's going to be better next time.

Either I don't care for their \"southwestern\" food, or it's just not that good, but this time I tried the beef tenderloin served over pasta.    YUMMMM!! is all I have to say for the meat.    It was tender and flavorful.    Tender in that it did not have that strange consistency of beef that was of lower quality and tough, therefore, \"tenderized\" with I-have-no-idea what, which makes me wonder what it would do to my insides after I ate it.  Anyway, back to the review.   The pasta was not of the white, bleached to near non edible that most pasta is now days.    And it was cooked to oh, so slightly al dente.     Of course, the flavoring for the pasta was just about perfect as well.     I topped it off with a couple of glasses of their zinfandel.    I don't remember the vineyard.    I just remember it was #27 on the wine list.    My companion had some sort of chicken skewers with beans and rice.    I've had the chicken skewers before.   And beans and rice on the side is not something I'd write home about.   So I didn't taste it.

However this time was the worst and I will not ever be returning, and neither will anyone with me. This is in regards to their kitchen, hopefully the health department is aware of this as well. My boyfriend and I went to the Rokerij on A Sunday we opted for the downstairs bar seating as i've always liked the ambiance and it best! :) We walked down and it was empty, we asked if we could sit in a booth and we were told they were all reserved and we could sit at the bar.  We didn't mind and just sat at the bar, I never mind sitting there.  We just wanted a little more privacy for his birthday but no biggie.  We were given menus, we ordered the Artichoke Dip appetizer and both ordered the Porkchop-both sounding delicious.  The appetizer came out fairly quick and was however soupy and possibly one of the worst i've had.  Our entrees were the concerning issue, however.  After waiting 20 minutes after our appetizer was done, our entree came out.  We both were hungry and dug in, to find both pork chops raw as all heck.  We waved down the bartender and told him, he told us to put them on separate plates, then just took our plates back.  He explained to us that he asked them to cook them medium rare because they come out dry a lot if you don't.  First of all, I appreciate trying to think ahead, but maybe don't serve something that comes out bad all the time?  I don't appreciate that the kitchen would send out ANY sort of poultry not cooked, raw, especially when it wasn't requested in the first place.  This is disgusting.  We never even received an apology, smile, nothing.  They came back out 10 minutes later, the same plates, and the bartender asked us to cut in and make sure they were cooked.  Why is that our job? The bartender also ignored the birthday situation, which I didn't exactly push but made known, just kind of lame.  Too add, only one couple came in during the hour and a half we were there, and were given explanations to the specials and menu in detail, while we were apparently a bother.  I get reservations, but... All in all, possibly the worst dining experience i've had in a while, and definitely won't return to any and I don't recommend Perry the bartender and his rude attitude. \nTo add, I emailed to let the owners know and received NO reply.

We also enjoyed the Roasted Garlic Plate which you should not order if you don't like garlic or peppers.  For dinner we both selected from the specials board.  I had the Blackened Tuna with a Strawberry Champagne sauce, an interesting combination of savory, spice, and sweetness.  My friend had the Sea Bass and felt it was just ho-hum.  \n\nOverall the evening was lovely.  We met several friendly people and enjoyed delightful food and service.  However, the $180 bill came as a bit of a shock.  Because of the price, this restaurant will be reserved for special occasions only.", "business_id": "5kRug3bEienrpovtPRVVwg", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-04-04", "type": "review"}

The food is top notch and prepared exactly as it should.

I recommend getting drinks early at the bar then coming up out of there to eat. Makes for a good night. \nMy only recommendation would be to expand the beer list. They have a limited selection of drafts and bottle. Albeit very good ones. But given atmosphere in the basement, which makes me harken back to days at some great Belgian beer bars, I bet they would attract an even bigger patron base by making it more of a craft beer haven.

I called back, and the very curt and impolite receptionist informed me that the restaurant doesn't take reservations for groups smaller than four! I thought this had to be an error, this is supposed to be a romantic establishment! I called back and talked to Mario, an equally curt and impolite Manager, who re - affirmed the \"no reservations for groups smaller than four\" policy.

I called the Stockyards, and they were more than happy to take my reservation for a romantic anniversary dinner table for two. \nIf you are a couple looking for a nice dinner experience,  the Rokerij isn't worth your trouble.

We opted for the downstairs bar; fortunately the four of us were able to find seating in a booth; it's rather intimate and tiny down there.  The ambiance downstairs was very dark and quiet with candlelit tables (not in a creepy way; it was just very serene).  Our group had just finished an outing at Moon Valley Golf and we were famished.  Thankfully, the portions here are hefty.  Brittney was our lovely server; just a spectacular woman in every facet.  We had the cheese tray, which was superb.  I especially loved the liverwurst that accompanied.  You don't see that around town as much.  Also, the fresh artichoke dip was one of the best I've ever had.  I think she mentioned it was made with fresh artichokes rather than the canned hearts.  If that's the case, then BRAVO.  It really made a difference - noticeably more flavorful than many I've had in town.  I and another in our party had the Niman burger (Niman is a very cared-for brand of beef, and it's worth every penny).  It was cooked perfectly with the flavor I expect when ordering Niman beef - I mean SO good.  Ms. Brittney obliged my request for extra mushrooms and caramelized onions.  I know my friend's impression of the burger was the same.  I can honestly say the fries could be better.  I realize I'm splitting hairs here; it's just that they seemed very basic.  However, probably not a ton of french fries being served at this finer restaurant.  My boss had the salmon special; he doesn't talk much, but I can tell he enjoyed it thoroughly.  Brittney also alerted us to a special appetizer - the white asparagus.  It was delicious - white asparagus has less of a \"grassy\" taste - milder in flavor yet just as nutritious.  Her selling point was amusing:  \"c'mon guys, it's healthy.\"  :)  Yeah, healthy - yet served with Hollandaise sauce and diced bacon! lol.   Finally, our last member of the party had the prime rib sandwich - which after seeing I wanted!  Looked to be an ample portion of beef.  \n\nTo recap:\nambiance = dark and relaxing.  Cell service is nil downstairs, so enjoy your time interacting with your group!  \nseating = not ample, don't bring a huge group downstairs.  Extraordinarily comfortable booth.\nfood = grade A \nBrittney = A+  :) - even though she teased me because I was having trouble finishing my HUGE burger.  \n\nThank you for an thoroughly enjoyable post golf dining experience.\n\nChris G.", "business_id": "5kRug3bEienrpovtPRVVwg", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-04-27", "type": "review"}

Have you ever heard those Del Taco commercials when they are talking about 'The Beast'?  Well, my beast could beat up that beast's dad.  One day when my beast reared it ugly head during a conference call with Florida, I knew what had to be done.\n\nI was actually on my way to my regular beast quenching local, Filibertos (on Indian School and 2xth St) when I stumbled upon a shack that looked strikingly similar to the familiar Yellow sign of Fili B's. LOS BETOS?!?! I decided to venture forth and give it a shot.  It is a shack of a place (aren't they all?) but it had a drive-thru and thats all I cared about. The first thing I noticed was that they had Mr. Pibb on Tap!  I like to order Dr. Pepper at places that have Mr. Pibb just to see what they say (sometimes they try to pawn it off without telling me its not Dr. pepper).  This older man was honest and relayed to me it wasn't Dr. P, but Mr. P..  I was content.  I ordered the typical gringo plate with the Carne Asada burrito with beans and rice.  When I got back to the office, everyone was jealous (my favorite part).  The burrito was so excellent, that I pronounced it excellente, and I didn't get sick off of the beans!

If these chips weren't refried over 10 times, i would be very surprised.  The taste of the oil was disgusting.  As if they hadn't changed it for a week.  The toppings were just that. Toppings.  They didn't go passed the first layer of nylon tortilla chips and they weren't very tasty.  Although they WERE more tasty than the chips (but then, so is a pencil)...

What did you expect? Everybody knows that take-out nachos are gonna taste like rubber...even if their in the bag for a few minutes. \n\nGiving two stars and disregarding a cardinal rule seems illogical.\n\nAn example of integrity-----------------------------------------\n\nPerhaps it's from experiences in SE Asia where I grew accustomed to  watching my food being cooked at the local stands...it's something I enjoy watching and has become somewhat comforting knowing how my food was cooked.

I love that they give you two kinds, tastes great to mix them. *Awesome* crispy cheese crisps--I highly suggest getting one with green chilis & green onions on top, delicious beans, etc. If I were rating on food alone, they'd get 5 stars, hands down. \nHowever, although the service is typically good, tonight my experience with that was initially very poor. I asked to sit on the patio, which was recently remodeled (pretty nice albeit too brightly lit & really loud being right on Indian School). One of the two hostesses sat me at a table of my choice, and brought silverware, a plate, and placemat right away. Chips & salsa arrived shortly thereafter, which are SO GOOD. Hot chips, best salsa (I drove 10 miles from my house just for it)! Here's where my experience drastically went south: I sat for ten solid minutes with no acknowledgment. I *finished* my chips & salsa (quite voraciously & happily), and still had not been greeted, still had *no water,* etc. I was one of three tables outside. Servers/bussers/food runners went to the other 2 tables multiple times, and still I was ignored. Do not misunderstand: I do not believe anyone was doing this intentionally; rather it was that \"someone else probably went there already\" type situation. Bottom line, it was all due to a break down in communication. Neither hostess had told any servers that I was a new table. But the boy who brought my chips could have been proactive & alerted someone, just as the food runner could have, and the server. I finally had to go to the bar inside and ask politely if someone could come outside & bring me water, etc. Right away a server nearby offered to help & followed me outside. He was very kind and apologetic, wrote down my order, & brought my water right after that. **Melvin** is his name, and he turned my experience around! Thank you, Melvin. \nNow, for margaritas: *worst* mix I have ever tasted. It made me think of the smell of a diaper pail or sewage, no joke. So I ordered the same marg, with Corralejo Blanco, & asked for just agave/simple syrup and straight line juice (basically coin style). DRASTICALLY better.

I liked it so much I ordered two! The flavor was huge, but the size a bit small for the retail price. I ate one Ono Taco in a few bites. Rubios has definitely ramped it up since I was in last. For those who don't know, when in Hawaii, \"ono\" is the word for scrumptious when describing food. Ono char siu pork was the order of the day when I was a kid visiting my friend there. I also ordered two fish especial tacos. Delicious with the avocado. The winning accents came from the salsa bar! The two dark salsas were COMPLETE FLAVOR WIN. Smokey chile sauces will always win me over, so glad they had those and not some boring jar-like salsa. I was hoping for some pico salsa, but they didn't have any there. Anyway with four tacos I left full. Maybe you're thinking \"You SHOULD be full after four, you pig!\" Yeah. Indulge yourself when possible and practical, I say!\nRetail price for all 4 including tax was over $15! Ouchies! Flavor explosion, but pricey. That's OK, I don't expect that for cheap, but if I were to make a $10 choice I might choose Chipotle or Qdoba ($8 for a full-on deluxe burrito) or Pei Wei. Glad this was a free lunch. I would say go to Rubios if you have a coupon, don't pay full-on retail. Looks like a previous reviewer says there's a Tuesday deal?

I am not nearly as conscious as I should be about what I eat.   Knowing there is an option to support a business that is helping even in the smallest way would definitely change my mind about where I might fulfill my fast food urges.  They are not using 100% organic and cruelty free but they are doing a whole lot more than most fast food places.  (the pork is 100% humanely raised and they contracted with Tyson to get chickens raised specifically for them with a better diet and more room to move around.)

The time to get my burrito isn't what bothers me. I know if I go there during lunch I'm going to have to wait in a line, that's no problem. What I hate is being rushed through the process of making my burrito. I only get three ingredients, so you think it would be hard to mess that up. They've ripped the tortilla before and expected me to be happy with them just wrapping another tortilla around it. One time the employee put sour cream on when I clearly didn't ask for it and asked if I would \"just eat it?\" Not to mention the inconsistency. Even if I get less ingredients then my boyfriend my burrito shouldn't be literally half the size of his. We're paying the same amount, so I want a size-able burrito! I've worked in food service before. I know lunch rushes suck, but when the quality starts slipping you need to take a deep breath and remember you're getting paid to make the burrito I'm paying almost eight dollars for. I shouldn't be able to tell that you hate your job. \n\nIt hasn't always been like this. There was some new employees hired a couple months ago, and I gave them a break.

My email confirmation said that my food would be ready at 2:45. We arrived at 2:45 on the dot, ready to pick up our food. Upon telling the cashier that we ordered online, she argued with me saying there was no online order in her system. I then told her I had an email confirmation. She then \"went to the back\" and appeared with none other than my order sheet that had not been fulfilled. She then handed it to the person at the beginning of the assembly line to start making it and asked me if I was ready to pay, after I had already told her I had paid for it online. \n\nThe person making our order made the first thing wrong and we asked him to correct it, that was actually the least of my concerns, that happens, I get that. So then we just asked him if it would be easier for us to just tell him what we ordered. They then went through the line to make our order but for some reason were moving at the slowest pace I have ever seen at any Chiptole location, there was no sense of urgency and I had placed my order over a half hour before arriving, mind you, there was no line, which is rare for any Chiptole, so it really made no sense that our service was this poor. \n\nWe asked the girl at the cashier what we could do differently so that this wouldn't happen again and her response was that sometimes their system doesn't link up to whatever system is in the back and that was why our order wasn't ready. We left at 3:07. \n\nSo an order I placed at 2:20, was supposed to be ready at 2:45, and we left at 3:07.

It shut down after 40-plus years in December of '07. The second thing you need to know is that Don Jose was the greatest Mexican Food restaurant on God's green earth. Oh, you could quibble with me about our definitions--what constitutes true Mexican food, etc, etc. Don Jose was, by most standards, a dive--a simple, no-frills, insanely inexpensive dining experience in a 60-year old former IHOP. The style of Mexican food they served was what we rare Arizona natives call \"Sonoran\", but what some others call \"gringo\"--cheese crisps instead of \"quesidillas\", hard-shell tacos and tostadas, etc, etc. There were no sprouts or carrots or squid or catfish or organic cage-free okra on the menu; the burritos contained shredded beef or beans, lots of cheese, and they had a side menu of American favorites--burgers, grilled cheese, fries, the works. The interior was decorated on a $10 budget circa 1964 and it stayed that way until they closed the joint; the red rotary phone still hangs behind the huge 1940s cash register. \n\nIt didn't matter what you ordered. It was all staggeringly good. There was no single item on the menu more than $4. The salsa was a mind-altering trip to an altered dimension where everything was made of delicious. The week they closed, they had lines around the block and wait times pushing three hours. I ate 36 cheese tacos in the space of 12 days. And 12 cheese crisps. And 8 burritos. And 20 bowls of chips. I'm still on the treadmill working it off, my arteries may never recover and I don't care. When they closed I felt like somebody in my family had died. Sadly, the owner decided to retire to spend more time with his family. What am I, chopped liver? I ate there for 25 years! I AM family, dammit!\n\nI swiped a menu. Sometimes, late at night, I clutch it to my chest and sob. Maybe I can find a therapist who serves cheese tacos.\n\nYour only other alternative for truly spectacular Mexican food in the Phoenix area is La Perla in Glendale--another classic family-owned place that opened in the 40s (and honestly, far more authentic and flavorful--but for me, not quite \"home\".)

I use to stop by fairly regularly due to convenience and due to the nice folks there, but I was never passionate about the food. I was in the area today and was curious if a change in ownership had materially changed the restaurant.\n\nThe good news for fans of Don Jose is that the restaurant continues to have a very positive vibe. The servers are amazingly attentive, refilling drinks, replenishing chips... before you have a chance to realize you're in need. My server was surprised when I needed a moment to look at the menu, a reflection, I think, of the number of regulars the establishment attracts.\n\nUnfortunately, the food still seems uninspired to me. I like Mexican food that is hot and spicy. I want to have to wipe the sweat off my brow when I've finished my meal. Don Jose has never been such a restaurant. On this visit, I single handedly consumed more than one mini pitcher of their \"hot\" sauce. It's a fine sauce, a nice complement for the chips, but it could definitely carry a little more heat for my taste. Since no complimentary mild salsa is served, I suspect more heat in the sauce is not a practical expectation. My feelings are the same regarding the enchilada sauce. Fine, but bland.\n\nEnding on a positive note, I do plan to return. Don Jose is not a destination restaurant for me, although I always appreciate creative use of a former IHOP location. The people who work here are amazingly efficient and just plain nice, strong reasons for a return visit.

We'd get off our crappy little jobs, and gladly wait for a table to relish huge portions of \"Mexican food\" dripping with cheese.  This was the 80's and we thought it was pretty wonderful.  \n\nA great deal has changed in twenty years. I've gotten older and crabbier. William Shatner is cool again. And the local restaurant scene has exploded with dazzling variety and quality.    \n\nWhen I escorted my mom here on a recent rainy day, a rush of distant memories streamed back from young adulthood. Nothing had changed here in two decades. The restaurant interior looked exactly as I had remembered. Young diners off work, more absorbed in office politics than in their massive taco salads and chimichangas - just like we used to be.  And my food looked and tasted remarkably like it did eons ago. \n\nNone of this, dear reader, is a good thing. \n\nCarlos O'Brien's, apparently stupified by its lucrative formula of white people phoning in bland Mexican food dripping with Monterey Jack, is stuck in a 1980's fern bar masking an even broader, unholier time warp.   The restaurant world has evolved, raised the bar, and it's abundantly clear nobody here gives a shit.  \n\nTo wit, I ordered fish tacos, which arrived, inexplicably, with no sauce or condiments of any kind. Just fish and dry cabbage in a tortilla?  To her credit, our waitress, who was perfectly pleasant, asked if I wanted any \"sauce\".  Um, yeah. This high maintenance fussbudget also likes milk on his cornflakes and syrup on his goddam waffles; please go to the trouble of fetching me this delightful \"sauce\" of yours.  \n \nWell it would be, if it resembled any fish taco sauce I've encountered since the Carter administration. Instead, our server cheerfully lugs back a ramekin brimming with industrial strength tarter sauce which, on this drizzly day, could have doubled as roof patch. \n\nI know what you're thinking. New waitress. I'm overreacting. Please bear with me. First,  she's not a new waitress. I overheard her gabbing with another table (friends of hers, I guess) about serving them on previous visits, so she's not new. This isnt about the waitress. \n\nSecond, I've never been served a dry fish taco in my life. No slaw dressing, not even a lime. Isnt this rather standard  preparation the kitchen's responsibility? \n\nThird, this is one of the half dozen lunch combos CB's been slinging in their sleep every weekday for thirty years. Could've been an oversight, but there's no misunderstanding about some off the wall request. \n\nFourth, why would our waitress immediately ask if I wanted \"sauce\" unless she customarily served it  knowing the kitchen puts no sauce on the tacos? This isnt an oversight, it's business as usual.  \n\nI want to re-emphasize that our waitress was not difficult at all. I'm not panning Carlos because of any personality clash. I'm panning Carlos because they're so out of touch with diners' basic expectations  in 2008. I'm panning them because, on a corporate or management level (not a waitress or cook level), they dont give a crap about what comes out of their kitchen.  \n\nThere was a time when Carlos O'Brien's held Phoenix in the palm of their cheese encrusted hands, but this maturing culinary burg has passed them by.", "business_id": "ieYiA4L5gk7S3kZYK0l_dg", "stars": 2, "date": "2008-03-13", "type": "review"}

It had a wide range of ingredients in it and was  tasty.  The spicy salsa was indeed spicy but there was nothing about it to make it stand out from other Mexican restaurant salsas.  The chips were unusual.  Some had the consistency of a deep fried pie crust.  In other words, they were very flaky.  Yet others were like chips found in other restaurants.\n\nFor my drink, I ordered a frozen mango margarita with salt.  The mango flavoring was faint and there was very little salt on the glass.\n\nFor dinner, I had a combo plate --- one chile relleno and one chicken enchilada.    The dish came with refried beans and \"fideos\" (noodles with a meat sauce).  The chile relleno was the worst one I've ever had.  It held together very poorly.  For example, when I was less than halfway through it, I cut off a piece with my fork and out came the entire remaining chile!  What was left was the batter and the jack cheese!  The chicken enchilada was generous with the chicken portion but pretty forgettable.  The fideos were certainly a unique touch and pleasantly flavored.\n\nThe restaurant was very good when it came to accomodating those in our group who were vegetarians.

We stopped in for brunch last Saturday when we were feeling in an adventurous mood and looking to deviate from our tried and true brunch spots.  It was a beautiful day so we asked to be seated outside and as the hostess lead us to our table, it became apparent that there was NOWHERE on the patio and perhaps the entire restaurant that would offer us any solace from the excessive number of running, screaming, sticky fingered children who had apparently consumed too much sugar at the chocolate fountain.\n\nNow, I understand that when sitting outside in the Phoenix area, tables and chairs aren't always spotless due to the dust factor, but one would have expected that our plastic tablecloth would have at least been wiped down sufficiently to remove the layers of food that had accumulated over what I'm guessing was at least the past few months.  After a significant wait, a server (not ours) showed up with some water that was served in glasses designed to hold enough liquid to quench a toddler's thirst (although, given the number of toddlers present, perhaps this was intentional) and some chips, salsa, and hot sauce.  The chips were of both the flour and corn tortilla varieties and were rather heavy on the grease.  The salsa was so mild, the only real flavor that it had was that of the sliced black olives in it, which is not necessarily a quality one seeks in a salsa.  The \"hot\" sauce was actually just as mild as the salsa and was served in a glass bottle that was so filthy and had so much food stuck to the outside of it that my hands were actually sticky from touching it.  At long last, our waiter finally showed up to take our drink order: a mimosa for me and a bloody mary for my husband.  After another ten minutes, he finally reappeared with the drinks and had I not been quick to cover my white shorts with my napkin, we would have been heading home for me to change since he'd spilled the bloody mary while carrying it and cluelessly reached across me with it to set the drink in front of my husband, causing a stream of spilled tomato juice to run down the plastic tablecloth and onto my legs.\n\nThe only redeeming factor that pulled this place up to three stars was actually the food.  I ordered a two item combo with a cheese enchilada and a bean & guacamole tostada and when the food finally arrived, it was clear a one item combo would have been more than enough as both items were huge.  All of the tostada ingredients were fresh and tasty and the cheese enchilada was flavorful too.  My husband had the huevos rancheros which he also thought were quite good.  This place is definitely a good value for the price as it's very inexpensive, but having heard that they actually host wedding receptions here, I would have expected a lot more in terms of the atmosphere and service.  It's a place that we won't hurry back to, but won't cross off the list as I've definitely had far worse food and overall dining experiences at other Mexican restaurants in the Valley.", "business_id": "G9LwkTSdKOyOGqd5BbuIkA", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-05-04", "type": "review"}

Did you know that long before Arizona was even a state, this establishment used to be a brothel? Yes, a brothel! Well now, it's of course the furthest thing from a brothel but you can still feel the history living in the walls and parts of the restaurant feel like stepping into a different decade all together.\n\nSecond of all, the environment. If there's a restaurant that screams party, this is it and I'm talking about a party for all ages. Whether you're visiting with family and looking for a lively establishment with plenty of patio seating, fun games and hearty food, or you're out with friends eager to share some laughs over margaritas, live music and trivia night, this restaurant's got your covered. This is the ideal restaurant for large parties, private parties and more. They have two very large patios with two outdoor bars, a huge indoor bar area, a spacious main dining room and a more private dining room in the back (that happens to be the original building that housed the brothel!) \n\nThird, let's talk about the activities. This restaurant knows how to keep their guests entertained! They have live music, trivia nights, bocce ball tournaments, chocolate fountains on Sundays, and special events including a fiesta bash on Cinco de Mayo...just to name a few. \n\nFourth and finally, the food. The food is solid Americanized Mexican food. The Nachos are hefty, the pollo Fundido is cheesy & creamy and the quesadillas are a good greasy (the kind you want when eating a quesadilla). This food is exactly what I would expect and hope for when visiting Aunt Chilada's. It's the perfect type of food for this family-friendly, fiesta inspired establishment. \n\nPS - did you know that these fine folks also happen to own Rustlers Rooste...that awesome cowboy establishment in Tempe complete with a live bull, slide and two stepping?

Worst restaurant experience I've ever had in my 50 years of existence. Here's the experience went\n\n1. Right out of the gate...Our hostess who seated us told us the fruit and chocolate fountain were included with the meal. My girlfriend grabbed two pieces of melon and two strawberries.When our waitress did finally decide to show up 10 minutes later we both ordered a cup of Albondigas soup without rice. She made a snotty remark that we should get the bowl of soup because the cups were small. She then barked at us that if we don't order an entree that we would have to pay $8 for the four pieces of fruit. I said whoa, hold on. We are ordering entrees. She replied that a lot of people come in just for soup. All of this is going on while my girlfriend and I are still reading the menu to decide what we wanted. I want to know what other people just ordering soup has to do with us.\n\n2. After 30 minutes the entrees arrived. I complained that it took way too long and the waitress said they had a large party and that is why the food took so long. Mind you I ordered 2 enchiladas and my girlfriend ordered a gound beef tostada and it took 30 minutes...no shit. How hard is that to make? I told her that we are just important as any other customer in the restaurant. She sent the manager over and he said the same thing. Large party sorry. I told him I don't care about the large party. Not our problem. That was it...he walked away. I looked around and the place was practically empty.\n\n3. I ordered beans and rice with my meal. The waitress didn't even have enough courtesy to listen to me. She brought me fideo (mexican pasta) instead of rice.She also brought fideo and beans for my girlfriend who ordered her tostada ala carte.and charged us for it. When my girlfriend ordered just the tostada the snotty bitch complained that my girlfriend wasn't ordering more.\n\n4. After trying to eat what was very poorly made food (we couldn't eat it because it was horrible) we went to pay the bill and noticed extra charges. We complained again. This time the manager did not come to talk to us. He told her to tell us the meal was comped. Since we couldn't eat that crap, that was fine with me. My girlfriend was going to taste my enchiladas and without asking one of the bussers took my plate away.\n\n5. Finally I asked to speak with the manager and a waiter called him (Marty) and the manager turned around and yelled across the bar that he was too busy. He LITERALLY yelled it. Then he noticed me standing there and said Oh, I'm sorry. I replied no I'm sorry that you are too busy. I told him I would never return. That was the last straw.\n\nThe waitress was a snotty bitch and never checked on us once except to give us the check. We had to ask other wait staff to get our waitress more than twice. If you are smart you will not waste your time or money at Aunt Chiladas. Over rated and over priced. This place should be out of business.\n\nOh and the Chocolate fountain is disgusting.

I got to meet a new group of people and eat at a new restaurant, and I was extremely happy with both!\n\nFor starters, I got here at 10 am sharp, and realized that this place is closer to my house then I thought. I know they have a couple locations around the valley, but I think they have one in Tempe aside from this location as well.\n\nWhen I arrived, the place was colorfully decorated and there were people slowly streaming in. I found my group, and we all sat on the patio.  Our server was super attentive, and I realized when she handed me the menu, that they had a weekend breakfast deal with healthy good looking food.  Yes, you can order from the main menu, but they have a great separate menu for their breakfast stuff on Saturday mornings.  \n\nThe server informed us of the complimentary chocolate fountain with fruit inside as part of the Saturday morning breakfast thing.  After we placed our orders, I went inside and grabbed some fruit and dipped it all in chocolate.  They had strawberries, cantaloupe, marshmallows and a few other items to choose from.  So tasty!\n\nI reviewed the menu and decided to go with the fruit bowl with granola and a $3 Mimosa.  One of the other girls with me ordered the same thing as well, and the others got some good looking dishes as well.\n\nThe fruit bowl came out and it was so good looking!  Holy cow! I really enjoyed the whole thing and overall, the prices and the food were awesome.  Service was great too, and I will gladly be back in the future for more.

We all sat out on the patio, which was nice. They gave us chips and salsa...the salsa was a little odd (had olives in it) and the hot salsa was not hot, tasted like slightly spiced tomato sauce or something. The chips were really good though, they were fried flour tortilla chips, not the typical corn. They also give you a free trip to the chocolate fountain, which was pretty good. The fruit was fresh and the chocolate was....chocolate...seriously, can't go wrong there. With breakfast, I got a mimosa which was only 3$, so that was pretty good. It was nothing special tasting, but it was cheap and alcohol. For breakfast I got the benedict with chicken. This is where they kind of went wrong. The chicken was dry and did not seem to be cooked fresh, or if it was, it was overcooked. The eggs were messy, the person poaching them let the whites go all over so it wasn't one cohesive egg and the eggs had slid off of the chicken by the time it got to me. The hollandaise was ok, but nothing special...it is supposed to be jalapeno hollandaise and just had maybe a slight spicy taste. The plate came with some dry looking beans that I did not eat and some potatoes that were nothing special. The BF got the pancakes, which were dry and tasted like they came from a package. I wouldn't say 'no' if I were invited back here, but I wouldn't come back here for breakfast on my own. I would like to come here for drinks one night as their patio is nice and they have a bocce ball court (which is awesome!), but I probably would pass on the food.", "business_id": "G9LwkTSdKOyOGqd5BbuIkA", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-05-13", "type": "review"}

She took our drink orders and once everyone was seated and ready our food orders. I settled on the Chorizo con Huevos with the eggs over easy.\nMy food was very good. According to the menu the dish contained Jesus's homemade chorizo which was \"heavenly\", wacka wacka. I have never had this before but the eggs with the meat was very good. It was all stacked on a crispy blue corn tortilla. It came with a side of re-fried beans which had a little bit of a skin on them but once I stirred them up they were fine. The entire meal was delicious.\nThey do include a chocolate fountain with all breakfasts but I am not that into fruit so just had a few chocolate covered marshmallows.\nI will say that the service was a little slow but with all of the great conversations going on it was a little hard to notice. Plus it did take a little while to get our checks and get them paid but the waitress did split them up for us which they don't usually do for a group as big as ours.

I wasn't expecting much other than a breakfast burrito, but when it came out I was shocked, it was a huge burrito, and had home styled potatoes, refried beans and the burrito was covered in melted cheese. I was in heaven!  I topped the burrito with salsa and cut into it! Omg it was delish! The jalapenos were fresh and perfect! This was a good breakfast burrito!\n\nIf you hadn't thought of Anut Chiladas for breakfast, you should and go give them a try! The Farm Fresh Menu has plenty to choose from.

The place looks old and outdated, especially for a hotel type restaurant.  We were seated out on a back side patio which was fine until BIG winged bugs arrived after we ate.  Anyway, the frozen margaritas were good and I ordered the Street Tacos, which were okay but the beef in them could not have been cooked anymore as it was tough and not very tasty.  Chips and salsa are pretty good.  Our group of 7 all ordered different things and no one had had rave reviews or bad comments about their dishes. We ordered flan, fried ice cream and sopapias (sp?) for dessert, which were all polished off.  I live in the Valley and given the multitudes of very good to great Mexican places we have, I don't need to return to Aunt's.", "business_id": "G9LwkTSdKOyOGqd5BbuIkA", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-04-27", "type": "review"}

Service and food was great back then.  My how things go bad so quickly!  First thing that set me off was nothing has changed in 10 years and it looks like a few things need repaired.  The wait was about a half hour.  My son almost fell after sitting in a broken chair.  Finally we were seated.  The homemade chips were good but the bottom ones were store bought.  The old put the store bought chips on the bottom trick.  I should have walked then but everyone was tired of waiting and hungry.  My son is a picky eater to say least.  I ordered a cheese quesadilla for my kid.  I specifically told the waitress, NO ONIONS, NO TOMATOES, and NOTHING BUT CHEESE.  I even told her if he finds one it will cause an incident.  She seemed to understand. The food I ordered was OK.  I had to use my salsa to make it a little hotter.  I can eat fire so this is no surprise.  My son's cheese quesadilla had tomatoes in it.  At first I told him it was just one and I picked it off.  Then he kept finding them in every slice.  I called the waitress over and explained.   She apologized and took the plate back.  A few min. went by and the waitress had the NERVE to come out and ask if it was just one.  I had already told her it had tomatoes all over in it.  At this time I felt humiliated by her actions and told her just bring a cheese crisp and I'll pay the difference.  It took a while for that to get to our table but all was OK.  While we ate a waiter dropped a napkin bringing food to another table.  When he came back I thought he'd pick it up after almost tripping on it himself.  Nope, he left it there so someone else could trip on it.  He came back a few minutes later so I flagged him down and let him know about the napkin.  Instead of saying \"oh I'll pick it up right away.\"  The waiter boomed in a very loud voice how sorry he was and it would never happen again.  He was loud enough for everyone to hear in the room.  Again, I felt humiliated.  I guess not wanting the restaurant to get sued because some waiter won't pick up a napkin was asking too much.  The waitress did comp my sons food.  I will never go back.  At one time that area had some very nice places.  The area had CLASS.  That's not the case anymore.  5/10/14", "business_id": "G9LwkTSdKOyOGqd5BbuIkA", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-05-24", "type": "review"}

Either our tastes have changed, or this place has really gone downhill. \n\nThe history of this place harkens back many years & is included on the menu - fun to read. The place has a kitschy atmosphere, and a nice outside area to dine. Located in shadow of the Pointe Hilton Hotel at Squaw Peak, the restaurant still draws many visitors. The night we were there, there were many large tables of guests that appeared to be from out of the area. I know, I'm jumping to conclusions, but locals know how to pronounce \"chimichanga\", \"quesadilla\", \"machaca\" and \"chipotle\"!\n\nThe carnitas tacos were boring and generic and the chicken burritio flavorless. Meh.. Margaritas nothing special. They claim to be \"always\" voted Best Margarita by a local magazine, but I find that hard to believe. The upside: the salsa is very flavorful. Not a fan of the flour tortilla chips, though.\n\nYears ago we used to come here for the awesome happy hour on their outside patio, which they still advertise. Reduced appetizers during the week, free buffet on Fridays.\n \nI doubt we'll be back. The Valley has lots and lots of places to get authentic Mexican fare.

This strip mall consists of a small convenient store, a laundromat and the taco shop. When you look at the outside of the taco shop, a plain white building with a simple blue sign, It doesn't seem like much. It's a small spot that fits the kitchen that practically opens up to a single picnic bench inside. Outside are a couple more picnic tables and a makeshift condiment table. The menu is simple, but has the spanish to english translation of it's items. They have tacos, burritos, tortas and soups. I decided on 2 carne asada tacos. They have two sizes, small and large. I get the small. When they come out the meat is sizzling and you can smell the corn tortilla. The sizzling morsels of meat look delicious and are mounds on my plate on top of the four corn tortillas. They give you a plate of cilantro, onions, radish and some limes all freshly cut and smell amazing! I take one of the corn tortillas put some meat on it. I start to layer the cilantro, onions, and radish and the colors of the layers look beautiful. I squeeze a bit of lime to top it off. Now for the bite! All the flavors send my mouth on a trip! It's so fresh, refreshing, and tatses great! Definitely the closest to a taco shop in mexico I have ever had! The two small carne asada tacos actually had enough for four. they give you a good amount of meat that is enough for the four corn tortillas they also give you. The same goes for the large tacos.The price to portion ratio is really good. Also, they have two types of salsa, red and green. Unfortunately my stomach can't handle spicy foods and I didn't wanna ruin my story so I waited to put it in the end :) The service is great and usually it's the same 2 cooks.They do speak broken english, but definitely try to use what little they know.

The chicken green corn tamale is just as everyone said said, a unique flavor that really satisfies.  If you can get one or two unique things out of a Mexican restaurant then you've done well, and this was it.\n\nA close second was the ground beef flour taco.  I usually don't spend much time ordering tacos at restaurants but this one had a shell that was hard enough to hold it's form but soft enough to bend a little when you took a bite.  The bottom of the shell mixed with the juices from the beef and created a texture that I'd not had in a taco before.  Delicious.\n\nOne disappointment was the shredded beef flauta. Nothing to write home about and without a knife I ended up stabbing it and taking bites off of it.\n\nOne other disappointment was the salsa and hot sauce, but I chalk this up to personal preference so I don't really downgrade restaurants because of it. The salsa had chunks of fresh veggies but the flavor wasn't to my liking, and it had quite a bit of juice in it.  You ended up getting some veggies on top and then juice which ran off of the chip.  The hot sauce has an earthy flavor to it that just didn't do it for me, but others seem to enjoy it so to each his own.\n\nLast point, the rice and beans were excellent.  Some places try to do too much or too little, but El Bravo found the perfect balance of spices and natural flavor.  Really enjoyed it.\n\nAs for the extras, the restaurant is easy to find and there is plenty of parking.  The wait staff was very friendly and the food came fast.

They really need to fix the lil speaker you order through, I can never understand what they're saying! Any way, I ordered a quesadilla & a #8 for my hubby, which is carne asada tacos w/rice & beans, & myself a carne asada burrito w/rice & beans added inside of it. When I pull up to pay I notice a sign w/all their dessert choices. The tres leche cake looks yummy so I order 1 of those & pay w/cash since I already paid for our dinner w/my card. After I paid, the girl working the window informs me the only dessert they have left is cheesecake. I really don't want it but I already paid so I say it's fine. I am waiting almost 10 minutes for my food, which is a tad annoying, but honestly at least it's fresh. My burrito was good & not too big of a portion like some places. Hubby enjoyed his quesadilla, tacos & rice & beans as well, definitely made 2 meals out of it. The cheesecake was not very good & I only ate about half & tossed the rest. Not sure how soon I will be back b/c they are way overpriced for what it is, I spent over $21!", "business_id": "JqAI4UA2xXPYxvlhzG-i9A", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-03-30", "type": "review"}

If it was a kid's meal I may have understood, but it was $4.99! The chimichanga was pathetic, too. I think the guy working there must have given us a kid's chimi on accident, because i can't imagine anyone spending money at this place on a regular basis for a chimi so small. It was literally 2\" wide by 6\" long by 1\" tall. That's for a $6.99 chimi. Macayo's charges a few bucks more for a chimi that's more than twice the size. I guess the only decent thing was the free chips and salsa, although the chips had enough salt on them to decrease my cardiac health by about 50%.

I have NEVER seen them put a styrofoam container in the microwave (as one poster stated) and can't imagine why they would (or would need to). \n\nThis is not a fancy place. The atmosphere is just adequate. Go to Chili's for that.

It is close to my house and on the way to pickup my granddaughter. She is so much fun.\n\nLocated in the same complex as Good Will and right next to a popular donut chain. This little restaurant serves up a good variety of the more popular Mexican dishes.\n\nInside is very small with several tables and chairs to enjoy your meal. The menu has a good selection of photos so that you can just point at what you want to eat. They even have a nice complimentary chip and salsa bar to get you started.\n\nOrdered the Green Chili Pork Burrito Combo plate and helped myself to both the mild and hot salsas. The burrito tasted OK and seemed to be filled mainly with beans and green chili gravy. The cubed pork seemed to be hiding and required a bit of searching to find the rather small pieces. \n\nThis place more or less cranks out some very typical Tex-Mex style food with not a whole lot of flavor. Even the salsas were pretty bland and I had to add a large amount of hot sauce to kick things up a notch.\n\nService was friendly and the place was pretty busy. I would not call this authentic Mexican food unless you are just used to the Americanized versions of this cuisine. The prices are reasonable and the food in general falls into my  A-OK category.\n\nGive them a try and see what you think. Everyone has a different opinion of what they enjoy when it comes to Mexican food.

Truth be told, no honest person does.  It's fast food.  If we wanted a lot, we would just make it ourselves.  What I do expect, and what most people expect is reliability.  That's it... reliability.\n\nThat is something that this particular location of Taco Bell sorely lacks.  I have been there at 10:30, and they're open.  I have been there at 11:55, and they're open.  I even asked the hours once.  I was told that Sunday-Thursday, this location is open until 12:00AM, and on the weekends, they are open until 1:00AM.  Yet... they are unreliable...I wonder if the owner knows their staff closes early?\n\nOut of the last six times I have been to this location - on a weeknight - between 11:00 and 11:30 - they have been closed.  Sometimes they are open... sometimes they are closed.  You never know with this place.  If the owner were to check the power bill by the hour and see when the bill dropped off, they would be aware because the signs are off, the exterior lights are off, and the interior lights are off.  Don't advertise you are open if you're not going to be open.\n\nI went by tonight at 11:10PM and everything was off.  I work in a restaurant and don't want to go home and cook for myself on the nights that I work because I spend 8 hours cooking for other people while I'm at work.  I really wanted Taco Bell tonight, but because of the unreliability of this location, I spent my money elsewhere.  \n\nI really just hope the owner of this location gets a handle on the hours of their store.  Inconsistency is not okay.  If the employees want to close at 11:00 like they apparently did tonight (like I said, the sign-lights were off, the drive thru lights were off, the interior lights were off... on the whole, the place screamed, \"Don't spend your money here!\"), then that is fine... just be open about it.  Don't promise the public hours and don't deliver.\n\nI know this is a long review for Taco Bell, but I kept pulling for this place to get it together.  After four months of never knowing what the hours were going to be at this location, I finally convinced myself to write a review.  In a simple phrase... \"This location lacks on the most important function of customer service: Consistency.  There is none.\"", "business_id": "l8v1GHaB4CsryK6MioZ21A", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-05-08", "type": "review"}

And by that, I mean giving a Taco Bell a poor rating on Yelp. But there are just some things that need to be brought to attention. \n\nThis Taco Bell is extremely close to my house, which makes it an easy stop for a quick lunch or dinner or even snack. Two separate times I've been here come to mind. \n\nOne was late on a Tuesday night, and my boyfriend and I decided to order at the counter and eat in the dining area. In our order, we asked for two sides of their nacho cheese. The young kid at the counter (who was polite) told us that there wasn't any nacho cheese, no big deal. He told us to hold on a minute, went into the back and asked his manager (we could hear him) where she told him just to tell us that we were out. Kind of suspicious..? Just tell them we're out? Huh. Okay. So we sat down, and about two minutes later the kid comes out and says that now they do have nacho cheese. Wow. Miracles do happen. Or, the management staff just made and employee lie to customers. It's called business ethics, people. She could have told him to say \"It'll be ready soon\" or \"Sure we're just making it right now\" but no, he was told to lie. Which is not his fault at all, but is the fault of the management staff. Food that day was nothing to get excited about. It's all Taco Bell and honestly you can't expect much. \n\nThe second time we came here, we went to the drive through and in our order ordered 2 orders of cinnamon twists. We got home, luckily not far away, to find out that the cinnamon twists were shorted from our order. We drove back, and the same kid was at the drive through. He was nice enough to toss in a free cinnamon twist bag. However, when we got home my boyfriend nearly broke a tooth on one of the \"cinnamon twists\" that was actually an uncooked rotini-style pasta noodle covered in the cinnamon sugar. This was the part of the meal that really upset me. Taco Bell does not carry anything remotely close to pasta, meaning that the noodle had to have been placed in there on purpose or by some extremely odd and rare accident... It could have resulted in something extremely dangerous (breaking a tooth), but we were lucky enough that his pain was just temporary. Pictures of the noodle will be posted shortly.", "business_id": "l8v1GHaB4CsryK6MioZ21A", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-05-29", "type": "review"}

Once again, not the very best margarita ever, but as good as many in very respected high concept Mexican restaurants around the US- and frankly a little better balance than a few of those. Certainly way better drinks than Los Dos Molinos' and I still love that place anyway.\n\nOur server was great, and she accommodated all our whims, so thats rare.\n\nThree of us walked out stuffed, tipsy, and very satisfied for about $70.", "business_id": "oqZPXoenkQvAKQJ2pDCo0A", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-04-11", "type": "review"}

They renamed it because they added more cream cheese, so calling it Diablo would give it that extra edge.  Apparently this burro wasn't enough of an artery clogger just yet.  I didn't know what to get so I decided to get what the Yelp review highlights recommended.  Unfortunately it is not always clear if those highlights are for a positive or negative review of the dish. My quick scan indicated that Pollo Magnifico/Diablo was a good thing, so I went with that.  \n\nPollo Diablo is a deep-fried chicken burro drowning in jalapeno cream and cheese, served with a side of beans and rice.  I took one look at the thing and felt myself getting full and bloated already.  The fried touch made it not quite crispy, just a little greasy.  The inside was tender but hard to really pay attention to with all of the jalapeno cream and cheddar cheese everywhere. I was overwhelmed and ate less than half the entree.  Nothing worth taking with me, either.\n\nThe worst part about eating here is that we all just got tired from eating.  They are big, heavy portions.  I looked over at my cousin and his head was propped up in his hands, his eyes drooping.  My sister's tamale was basically a hunk of really heavy and dry cornbread and she was exhausted from eating, too.  This was heavy stuff.\n\nI'm not from the Southwest so maybe I just don't know any better, but for this California girl, I would much rather  eat Mexican food in a dirty hole in the wall in San Jose than to come back here.", "business_id": "oqZPXoenkQvAKQJ2pDCo0A", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-03-11", "type": "review"}

Your tortilla chips are very tasty but they are far to small to use for dipping, etc.  Keep the same recipe but have them made larger.

The strip mall location across from the un-hip PV mall doesn't bely the fantastic experience inside. \n\nI've eaten there many times throughout the years and it never disappoints. Since leaving PHX, its been a couple of years since I stopped through, but this experience felt like a homecoming. Why do I bother with other \"trendy\" locations when my old friend stays consistently great?\n\nThe tortilla soup is EXACTLY what it is supposed to be. If you get it, don't skimp on the sour cream and avocado because the extra calories are well worth it. The broth itself is flavorful if simple, the tortilla strips are toasted THEN added to the soup and its just too good for words.  I also had the fish tacos on this trip - I usually don't eat fish tacos, there is nothing worse than a place that messes up such a simple dish, but La Parilla didn't disappoint. The tortillas are soft and pliable, the fish was remarkably good and the batter wasn't too over powering. They don't heap 12lbs of junk on it, they just let it shine. They keep the fresh chips coming and the \"green\" salsa is so good, I usually ask for additional to take home.  I have had the Parilla Suiza that other Yelpers love and I concur with their assessments too. \n\nAnd on our last trip, during a fairly busy lunch, we are greeted with warmth immediately both at the door and by Hector our waiter. He practically TRIPPED over himself to give us great service. Never rushing, just making sure everything was great. He made recommendations and honestly, made me feel like I was in the large home of a great cook. \n\nI just think the food here is underrated, its simple, fresh and well done. The service is always warm and prompt..and I now that my green salsa is gone, I guess I will have to wait until I am in PHX again for anything even remotely so good. \n\nIf you haven't been, you should. Prices are reasonable, the staff is great and the cooks are confident enough to let the food stand on its own without layers of junk.

And then give the check without clearing the table.\n\nBad- the FOOD !! tortilla soup was okay, really nothing special, I would not order it again. I guess when I think of tortilla soup, I expect cilantro, onion, chips, chicken but it was just broth and chips and cheese.\n\n We ordered the cheese and mushroom appetizer since my coworkers recommended it. We had a few bites of thick cheese and we were not impressed. tasted like canned mushrooms and bad cheese. We ate about 1/3 before just letting it sit there.  Main courses arrived and while they looked pretty, my swiss enchiladas with red sauce were GROSS. I took one bite and made a face. The sauce tasted very ketchup like and the chicken had no flavor. Beans were floating in broth and tasteless... like watered down bbq beans. I got about 3 bites into my 3 enchiladas and just gave up. My bf's shrimp tacos were better and had a few bites of his.\n\n\nOverall, 40 dollars for us to eat and the only thing that were good were the chips.

This is the style of Mexican food that I grew up eating, and although I love the whole spectrum, this type is my favorite due to its greasy-ness, inclination to corn tortillas, and beef ... lots n lots of beef.\n\nCarolina's is certainly the bare-minimum of establishments.  There is an order-counter, almost soup-nazi-esque as far as the intimidation factor goes, but the staff is extremely friendly and will help you customize your order.  You then have to wait for your number to be called as you stare at your oozing tiny dixie cups of salsa in anticipation.\n\nI always get the machaca burrito (holy smokes, my mouth is literally craving it now -- dammit, why did I write this so close to lunchtime?)  with sides of rice and beans.  I'm a bitchy critic when it comes to the latter, as the entire female familial line of P.'s can work out some magical rice and beans, yo ... and these compare favorably.  I wish Carolina was in my family.\n\nOh, and they rock red Fanta as a soda option because they F'ING KNOW that the Mexis love their strawberry bubblegum flavored drinks.  I can never pass up this option no matter how hard I want Dr Pepper or Sprite instead.

The line is sometimes out the door on weekday lunch hour.  It is actually better to pre-call your order in, although the pick-up line can also pretty long at the lunch hour.  \n\nThe only reason I am giving the restaurant 4 stars is due to the location and building's interior/exterior.

I tried a combination plate with enchilada, taco, beans and rice.  The taco was great, with a homemade shell and very good shredded meat (which seems to have been formed into a patty) inside.  The beans had a good flavor, and the rice was fluffy.  While the enchilada tasted fine, I prefer my sauce to be a bit more orange (this was blood red), and less bitter.  My husband had a footlong chorizo and bean burro, which he said was very good.  Now, about these supposed \"best tortillas in Arizona\".  That title is still held (in my opinion), by St. Mary's Mexican food in Tucson, but these were very good.

I had to try the famous tortillas right? So, I ordered up a cheese quesadilla and a red machaca burrito. How does it end up that Arizona and Nevada have completly different ideas of what machaca is. It is supposed to be dry beef grilled with onions, peppers, tomatoes and eggs. But in Phoenix, it is basically shredded wet beef doused in red or green sauce. Regardless, the Carolina's version was miserable. It was mushy and tasteless and since the thin tortillas could not hold all that beef inside, it turned into a knife and fork thing. I barely ate three bites of the mess and some fat was also discovered lurking in that meat.  Not good.\nSame thing with the quesadilla. Due to the tortilla being so thin, the cheese overwhelmed the item turning it into a cheese wafer.

Once we ordered though there was a huge line that was forming.  I order a beef tamale and a machaca hard taco for under 5 dollars.  Even though they say soft only for the machaca taco, they will do a hard taco for you. I ate the taco at work and I brought home my tamale and decided to give it to my husband and he ate it seriously in 2 mins. What a fatty!\n\nYes, the place is a hole in the wall.  The place may look shady. However, I must say I would make the trip down here any day of the week so I can eat their food. I used to eat here 2 times a week when I worked down the street. Tip: When you want to go during lunch, make sure to call ahead and place an order because you might be waiting for a while or if you go after 1:30 it calms down more so you can find a seat and enjoy your food.

($6.75) i went for the chiles rellenos with rice and beans. ($9.25)\n\nwe ate some average tortilla chips with some super spicy red chili salsa and though our meals were out in record time we got a free refill of the chips when we drained the first bowl. \n\nmy chiles rellenos were excellent.  dark green chiles lightly breaded, filled to the brim with white cheese and smothered in a spicy green sauce with some extra cheese on top. rice tasted like it had been cooked in beef broth and the beans were definitely cooked with a ham bone.  i'm a vegetarian so i had to skip those but there were two big chiles and i got hot fluffy corn tortillas so i didn't need the sides anyway. (but $9.25 is a little steep for what i was able to eat) \n\nKate started to dig into her plated burrito when she realized that it was not a 'green chile burrito' but a pork burrito with green chile sauce.  she's not a vegetarian, and is literally the calmest and nicest person i've ever met, but she was pissed. she didn't send it back under the pretenses of false advertising, which she probably should have, but she was really annoyed and even as we were leaving she commented that she would never go back to a place that doesn't label their menu items correctly. \n\nso on the one hand i would go back there in a heartbeat, quick service, good food and for the most part decent prices, kate would list it on a top ten places to avoid list. i would say if you're on baseline and you want something that doesn't pander to gringo's head over to el mesquite and give it a try.", "business_id": "gw-V13MyfzFaCTbALfnn2Q", "stars": 3, "date": "2007-05-20", "type": "review"}

If you like authentic food, warm service and spicy tasty salsa, then grab a table, and tell your taste buds to buckle up.\n\nI first went to El Mesquite years ago when I worked downtown. I fell head over heals for their unique chips and addictive spicy salsa. Warning, it is hot, but it's not hot just to be hot, like other places (cough cough, Los Dos...).\n\nBeing that this is a Mexican restaurant, beloved by locals- you will hear Spanish, laughter, English, and sometimes a combo of  the three. I really do love El Mesquite, they put up with my crap Spanish, and you do not need to speak Spanish to be comfy at El Mesquite. \n\nAs others have said, when you arrive, you seat yourself, drinks, chips & salsa will be right behind you. Food is great here, and the price point is very good for the value and amount of food you get. I highly recommend the carne asada burro. I know right now America's Taco shop is reigning supreme, but if El Mesquite was near America's, there would be an epic battle because El Mesquite easily beats their carne asada. No bull!$%@.\n\nAlso amazing is their guacamole, unlike many places, El Mesquite doesn't put a bunch of filler ingredients to make the guac go farther.

I also want to recommend getting a quesadilla, they are really tasty and cooked to perfection.\n\nEnjoy your trip to El Mesquite, you will not be disappointed, and if you are like me, this place will be in your rotation for 'go to' places!", "business_id": "gw-V13MyfzFaCTbALfnn2Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-05-02", "type": "review"}

It's one of those neighborhood standbys that you love having around. We've eaten takeout several times and been thrilled with the carne asada, carnitas, and more. And while we've tried it several times already, I'll add that it could easily have been twice as many or more. But their hours are a frequent source of frustration. How does a restaurant surrounded by a mostly residential area close every night at 7:00 and have otherwise seemingly arbitrary hours?

They remember when it was a walk-up window take out place. Infact, when my father picked my mother and I up from the hospital after I was born, the FIRST stop they made on the way back to the rez was Poncho's! \n\nOne of the co-owners likes to laugh and say that she saw me before most of my family did! I went from being in a car seat gurgling as my relatives chomped on the best chips in town served with some awesome hot sauce that hasn't really changed since I was young. To being a little girl who always ordered the deep friend tortilla wrapped hot dogs with crinkle cut french fries and the BEST coldest ketchup I ever had!! To being a young woman who brought every single close friend I met while being away at school or through the native pageant circuit to enjoy the wonders that is \"The Works\". \n\nMy FAVORITE meal there is the cheese crisp as an appetizer, Combination #18 which is two tacos (i always order beef!), rice & beans. They have the best beans EVER!! And the rice is awesome too! I've had all the desserts on their menu and nothing really jumps out at me. I guess I still love the family tradition of going to the water & ice cream shop for thrifty ice cream before heading home! \n\nI have had many experiences at this resturant. I've held my high school graduation party there; this resturant was the place where I signed a contract that made me the goodwill ambassador of my people for nearly a year; it was from their bar that I had my first LEGAL margarita on my 21st birthday, it was also the place where my then boyfriend got on one knee and asked me to marry him, and it was their waitresses who said \"to HELL with him!!\" when we ended our engagement. \n\nIt's a wonderful place to me, I like that I can go in and say \"Hi Marty!\" to their one time waitress who now manages the resturant. and have her yell, \"HI CHERYL!!\" Yes... that's right!! That's how long she has known me!! She can call me Cheryl and get away with it!! I also love the other long time co-owners/managers. There is one that always wants to buy a certain piece of jewelry off of me. And another who always laughes when I bring someone new in. \n\nPoncho's is a place of regulars... LONG time regulars. and i think this is what every great restuant needs. Local, long time regulars who grow with the restuant. Who bring in new friends to enjoy the huge wonderful chimichangas or the Presidential Special and laugh over delicious enchiladas while a secret service agent (who kinda looks like leslie nealson if u ask me) painted on the wall watches on. While a bustling resturant does what it does best: offer homestyled, friendly, affordable and great food to it's old time regulars and it's about-to-become regulars.", "business_id": "14NSxaXBNspIVnsrMYJZVw", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-03-04", "type": "review"}

She slapped the receipt on our table and ran off. Didn't ask us if we needed anything else or if it was all on one bill.

LOL So i'll try.....this was the first time i've ever gotten up and walked out of a restaurant. My wife wanted to stay and complain, but we were both pretty hungry already and didnt really want to wait around to talk to some 'Joe Shmoe' Manager, who obviously doesn't give a crap about service and hospitality.\n\nWe walked in at about 8:15-8:20pm lastnight, no hostess, nobody there to greet us. Stood there for about 4-5min, finally a girl walks by and asks, \"oh do you need a table?\"\n\nSo at this point, a little annoyed, but oh well they must have cut the hostess early that night? Start looking at the menu, a couple minutes go by, still no server. We see a couple different servers walk by our table and glance at us but just ignored us. So i guess those servers were all cut? or it wasnt their turn? \n\nWe both knew that they didnt have the full staff of servers on still, but you'd think somebody would eventually greet us.\n\nSo we finish looking at the menu, sat there for another couple minutes. Saw another 2 different servers walk by us and talk to the two booths on both sides of us to ask how things were, and both walked away without talking to us.\n\nI could understand maybe miscommunication, or if we had beverage napkins down already, or if we had walked over from the bar and already had drinks, maybe everyone who walked by us just assumed we had already been helped....\nbut NO!! nothing! we had nothing infront of us, other than 2 folded up menus that we both had read over almost 4 times!! LOL\n\nThen there was one busser that walked by and kind of glanced at us after we had been there for 5 mintues and he could tell something was up. But still nothing.\n\nThen i turned to my wife and said, \"ok lets just go, this is garbage.\" we were both kind of hesitant about walking about, because we had never done it, but this was a joke! she asked are you sure? should we say something? i said, \"to who? nobody is stopping at our table to greet us, just get up, follow me, lets go.\"\n\nSo as we were sliding out of the booth, we left the menus on the table, nobody tried to stop us or ask us what was wrong, obviously nobody cared. Headed to the exit, right past the host stand. Noticed there were 3 girl servers just hanging out kind of off to the side of the host stand, but still in front for everyone to see. Just chatting with themselves, all of them messing with their phones, one girl had her purse on so she must have been leaving soon. All 3 girls were oblivious and watched us walk out.\n\nNow i've been going to Macayo's since i was 12, back when there was only one location over in mesa, then the one in downtown tempe, and been coming to this location since it opened back when i was in high school. Now the tempe location is great, still go there, the patio is cool, never had a problem there. \n\nBut here, this garbage ahwatukee location, yea its gotten to that point now, garbage. It started off good when it first opened about 10 years ago. But over the years this location has reeeeaaallly dropped off. Not so much the food, dont get me wrong the food has still been consistantly good, but the service over the years! BLEH!!! just like the 17 different times they've re-painted the outside of the restaurant!!!  LOL\n I know management and staffs change over the years, but you can really tell that they dont care anymore.\n\nSo anyone in the ahwatukee area if you're in the mood for mexican food dont even consider Macayo's on 48th & Warner.

My waiter was awesome, took our order, got the drinks out and brought us the chips and salsa. The chips were fresh but what in the hell happened to the salsa?!?  \n\nThe salsa looked and tasted like it was 90% tomato paste, 5% chopped veggies, 5% liquid.  The salsa was absolutely gross and tasteless. I inquired about the flavor and texture and he mentioned they recently changed the recipe. He asked if we'd like to try the spicier salsa, said it might be better. \n\nThe spicier salsa was brought out and it wasn't much better. Instead of tomato paste it tasted like a chipotle BBQ sauce. \n\nThe food was super quick coming out which was awesome, however the awesome ended there.  The chicken tortilla soup was more like a salty stew, the trio enchilada plate looked good but the rice was mushy and flavorless, the cheese in top if the Baja sauce was dried out and the pork was chewy and included pieces of fat and tendon. About the best thing in that plate was the black beans \n\nThe carnitas chimmy was so so, the meat was flavorless like it was boiled. \n\nThe chicken in the chicken cilantro lime Caesar salad tasted like it was boiled then lightly grilled.  The lettuce and dressing were pretty good though. \n\nThe tamale bites tasted like deep fried Mac and cheese bite with green chili in them. \n\nWe have our waiter out feedback and again he mentioned the kitchen changed the menu and recipes. We asked for the manager and Maria came out and we gave her the same feedback. She too said there were some changes to the menu and recipes. She apologized for the quality and taste if the food and comp'd half if the meals. \n\nI understand adding new things to the menu to stay current but why change recipes?  \n\nThe 1 star given was only because of the great service and attitude of our waiter and manager.  Can't say I'll be back again, at least not until they fix the recipes and go back to using quality ingredients and improve in their food qualities.", "business_id": "aACW1qAdOfgcU8yX61dOFw", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-04-22", "type": "review"}

But... Tonight was a different story! We took our kids for dinner.. It started with me going to get our own menus... Waitress passed us 5 times we sat there waiting for someone to stop 10 mins later our waitress came over put salas on our table and said sorry no chips right now.... Finally 10 mins later she came back to take our drink order... Time goes by and still no drinks no chips no waitress. Grrrr! Finally she comes back, she sets out drinks down with all the time we waiting I asked her to just take our order.... We got our chips... Our food was brought out 20 mins later. My was okay kids were just Mac and cheese can't mess that up too much my husbands meal was ice cold. When the waitress finally came back I asked her if we could get a hot dish she looked at me and asked ok so you want me to re heat it for you? I said no I would like a new hot one, not microwaved. She rolled her eyes and took the plate from me. She came back and told us that one someone took the plate that was ours. My kids and I were all done eating when she came out and told us that my husbands would be out soon. My husband said forget it! She said whelp it's too late I will have them box it up for you to eat at home. If we waited to eat at home we would have ordered pizza. She said she was taking it off the bill. When we got the bill she charged us twice for the same plate and yes did take one off but charged us an extra one! Unbelievable!! The waitress did not even bring us our ticket! \n\nKim and the bartender were amazing and made a bad experience a positive experience!

I mean a bowl full that you'd actually get at a table if you ate in.  Plus salsa (which was med spicy) The chicken enchilada was tasty and creamy.  The fish taco was also a good portion and filled with cabbage.  It didn't come with lime wedges but it was soo good and filling that I didn't even finish the 2nd taco.  I think it was also because I finished the refried beans.  I only took a bite of the rice/corn, which was good but I was already full.  So all of this was in my to go bag and all for $12 and some change.  Wow, so much food in comparison to Rubios' prices.  I've got leftovers for tomorrows lunch! I can't wait to try their margaritas next time I eat in.", "business_id": "fsxBliRs4rwxRXkZUVy62A", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-04-23", "type": "review"}

Jeanine was our favorite server until she moved to the Mesa location and now we have \nChristine who is always on top of her game!  A couple of  suggestions: Easy on the salt! you can always add salt to the chips. I assume most people like salty chips but If you decide to stop adding salt to the chips, announce it as part of a \"healthier decision\". The second suggestion is to have a mild salsa if your only salsa is going to be this hot. (I always put a sugar packet to make it milder). Your new additions to the menu are tasty and well made. Keep up the good work!", "business_id": "fsxBliRs4rwxRXkZUVy62A", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-05-04", "type": "review"}
