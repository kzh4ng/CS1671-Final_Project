They charged me $200 and we waited to be seen. Our regular doctor, Dr. Chris was unavailable and Dr. Dino was busy, so we were forced to see Dr. Kristen Spratt. Anybody who has has ever used Dr. Kristen Spratt would understand when I say she is incompetent. I guess these days anyone can become a doctor since a letter score of C in medical school is considered to be passing. That's not my point anyway. So Dr. Kristen Spratt checked my friend, if that's what you want to call it, and said that even though you have a high temperature and are very sick I cannot give you any medicine and you will have to wait and if you are still sick by the end of the week come back Monday. I explained to this genius doctor that my friend is very sick and can't wait and needs medicine and cannot come back because he does not have health insurance and can't afford to come back. So she got very emotional and denied giving him medicine. I asked to speak to Dr. Dino regarding this matter and he refused to see me. After my friend and I left, I recieved a call from the office saying that I am no longer welcomed at their office and I was in effect kicked out. Not to mention my family and I have been patients of theirs for a long time and we have brought Dr. Dino a lot of business over the past years.  I am a very sick man and need doctor care and it is very bad for Dr. Dino to refuse to see me.

For the main entrance, parking is decent, but not particularly close.  Luckily, I scored a ride from some guy in a golf cart.  I am lucky that he did not seem to be a fan of Movie Macabre.  At least, if he is, he was working, and did not have time to 'cart' me to the woods.  Had he done so, I was at least close by - and how far can a golf cart really get before it dies from lack of juice?\n\nOnce inside, the main entrance has been redone.  Completely.  It is really quite impressive.  Unfortunately, they have to pay for all of that, and what should be a really simple process of sticking you becomes a rather tedious check-in (including a wristband), a journey to another floor, and waiting, waiting and waiting some more.\n\nFinally I give just two tiny vials of blood and get to leave, without so much as the courtesy of a reach around (or even a ride back to the car via the golf cart).  Then I get the bill.  Lovely.  No wonder they could afford all that remodeling.", "business_id": "JeZRokQJYf6sV_TF7lm9_Q", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-01-18", "type": "review"}

I met her on her first day at work there at MMG Uptown office.  She was young and full of energy.  That has never charged.  She has helped me through minor ailments and major chronic diseases that I have experienced.  She is very smart, energetic, caring, compassionate and professional.  I left out one important fact.  She is extremely bright and keeps abreast of all the new information and procedures that become available on human physical and mental health issues.  She volunteers every year to help the needy and works several times a year in the hospitals to keep informed on the regular procedures and problems that arise there.\n\nOne of the things I like most about her is she is a Christian.  She prays for her patients regularly and cares about their families and how things are going at home and at work.  In my opinion,  you will not find a better doctor here in Charlotte,  North Carolina.  She is a Family Practitioner / Internist and has been rated one of the Best Doctors In America year after year.  That speaks volumes.\n\nI think it is important to recognize Doctor's who are making a difference in the world and Doctor Robinson is one of those Doctors.  I feel lucky to call her my Doctor.\n\nNew Comment. (UPDATE)\nI have been with MMG for about 20 years now.  When I call in to get an appointment now days my Primary Doctor, Dr. Robinson has No appointments available for sometimes 6-8 weeks.  The staff encourages me to go to her Nurse Practitioner or another available doctor.  I say no I want to see my doctor.  I guess when you get your quota of patients you are assigned a Nurse Practitioner.  I don't know?  You build up a familiarity  with your doctor and a history of all of your tests, past issues, current issues and then you can't see your own doctor it doesn't suit well with me.  Maybe a small, more family style of doctor/practice is the best way to go. They would perhaps be more available to the patients they see. It seems like in a large practice like MMG, you seem  to get thrown around a lot over the years. I truly feel bad for leading the readers of YELP to possibly be unable to get an appointment with her, their new recommended, doctor and then be unhappy with the service.   What bothers me the most is if you can't get an appointment with your doctor they will suggest that you see another available doctor.  When you are late for an appointment if it is more than 15 minutes late you may as well turn around and go home. If you go up to see your doctor after being 15 minutes late, they don't offer any options.   No one will care why you're late,  what happened to you on the way, or anything.  They just put you down on the books as a no show.  This happened to me recently and I had a broken ankle was using a new cane to get around,  had to walk a long way in the parking deck and I was walking very slowly. When I got up to the receptionist no one cared if I was in a tragic accident on the way to the appointment, if I got pulled over for some reason, if my child got sick at school and I had to pick him up on the way which put me behind some, or if I was sick as a dog and had to pull over in order to vomit several times, or couldn't find a close enough parking space and had to ride around looking and looking for a handicap space to park. No excuses mattered that was obvious because they didn't care why I was late.  All I got was reschedule. No one knew or cared the hell that may have happened to me on the way to the doctor that day.", "business_id": "iYlGqyRNH5UYQABKsDuuDg", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-01-05", "type": "review"}

The Pilates, Yoga, Cardio Dance and Cycle instructors are all quite helpful and make you feel comfortable whether you're a first-timer or partake in a class every day.

Normally I'm a regular at the south Charlotte Y's (Morrison, Harris & Siskey) but since it's a new year, I figured I'd try my hand at visiting this Y after work, since it's only about 1.5 miles from my office. The reviews here helped to convince me to give it a try, so I figured I'd write my own review as well to add to the information.\n\nI showed up around 4:45 and managed to find a spot. As soon as I walked through the turnstile I went to the guest relations desk and asked the woman behind the counter if she could direct me to the women's locker rooms. She offered right there to give me a full tour, so I took her up on the offer.\n\nThe facility is large, and as others have remarked, bustling. There were multiple basketball courts, two sets of lap lanes in the swimming pool (one warm, one cold), and all the other features you'd expect at a gym: spin room, tons of cardio machines just about everywhere you turned, machined weights and free weights. They had several stretch assisting machines and devices throughout the main gym area as well.\n\nThe women's locker room is indeed huge, and it's overwhelming at first. Lockers abound (I think there are almost too many, there's no way these fill up at 100%). I only found two toilet stalls in the women's locker room, but I'm pretty sure I must have missed another set somewhere. \n\nOne thing to note: You need a full-sized padlock for these lockers. I have used a small luggage style combo lock at the Harris for a long time, but it doesn't fit the lockers at the Dowd. Fortunately, they'll let you borrow a keyed lock with a driver's license.\n\nThere are a limited number of machines (perhaps a dozen or two, treadmills, ellipticals, stair steppers, recumbent bikes and rowing machines) and free weights in the women's locker room, and most of them were in use. I opted to climb onto one of the stair stepping machines for 20 minutes to start. After that I wandered the rest of the gym and hopped on a treadmill for a few more minutes. The stair stepper action (it's been awhile since I've used a stair stepper) caused my calf to tighten up uncomfortably, so I only spent another 20 minutes on the treadmill. It's January and as you can imagine, the place is packed to the gills.\n\nI decided to ease off and hit the steam room, which let's face it, is the real reason I go to the Y (well, this one and Harris, at least). I just force myself to exercise before I get to the \"reward\".\n\nAnd this is where the Dowd Y fell short for me. The steam room was the driest steam room I've used, and the full, bright lighting made it  less relaxing than the one at the Harris. It's not serene and quiet, people chat and talk loudly in this steam room. \n\nBoth the Dowd & the Harris Y have spray bottles of eucalyptus from a \"Club Aroma\" spa supply place. The eucalyptus bottle at the Harris Y is occasionally running on empty, but when it's filled it is good stuff. The \"eucalyptus\" at the Dowd was non-existent. They're cutting it so much with water (I presume) that it smells like nothing. The eucalyptus not only helps with opening nasal passages, it also makes the steam rooms smell nice, and this one - since there's no real eucalyptus to spray - smelled decidedly NOT nice.\n\nFinally, there's something else others have touched on a bit: the rampant nudity in the locker rooms. Here's the thing - I'm a bit of a prude about nakedness, being as I was raised in the south and taught the naked human form was an evil tool of the devil and all. But in a locker room, I realize that's mostly MY problem, and that the occasional flash of full frontal or a butt is the price you pay for dressing and undressing around other women. \n\nThere's a difference between flashes of nudity, and the women walking around the Dowd Y locker room for two hours, acting like they're in a nudist colony. Seriously, not a stitch on one particular older woman for two hours, as she stretched, dried her hair, lounged in chairs, and rubbed lotion on her face. I'm real glad for her that she's comfortable with the body she's got, but *I'M* not comfortable with it, and seeing her with her legs kicked up on the chair outside the steam room every time I entered it, just letting it all hang out, was disturbing. And it's not just about looks, I don't care how aesthetically pleasing your naked form might be, at least show a little courtesy and a slight amount of modesty.\n\nI didn't find the steam room or the locker room relaxing after my workout at all last night. I saw things no human should have to see, frankly. I appreciate it's close to my office, but I've heard Childress-Klein is too, and a little better about these sorts of things. I'd recommend the Dowd Y, but only to people who really honestly don't care about having strange women exhibitionists waving stuff around in their faces while in the locker room. As for me - I care - probably too much to return.", "business_id": "b3u-GK6_xj2fJkinzLk_jQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-01-04", "type": "review"}

Try to avoid the sqeeky treadmill in the middle. The crowding is pretty intense during peak times, so unless you can clear 2-3pm in your day, good luck. The lap pool is also a struggle to get a clear lane.\nThe ugly:\nThe folks that work here friendly, but I have to downgrade the stars due to my experience with Personal Training. It took a week for a call back from the scheduler the first time around and then another week for the first appointment. Also, if you are looking for motivation and a kick in the pants to get going, I highly recommend avoiding the late afternoon time slot, not much being offered with the current scheduled trainer there.

First, I met with Dr. Moore in July 2011 and she was great. She was friendly, knowledgeable. I liked her a lot. I don't think it's appropriate to get into detail, but it was the least painful woman check up ever. If you're local and plan to stay local, I highly recommend. \n\nHowever, in December of 2012 my parents got a certified letter saying I failed to keep my follow up appointment (which I never made) to check on my diagnosis of dysplasia. Uhm WHAT? I assumed my results were normal since I heard nothing for a year and a half. When I called to figure out what on earth happened, I found out that my results were abnormal. When I didn't come back in July of 2012 (because I moved to Boston) it flagged them to follow up with me. I guess that took 6 months because the letter came when I was home for Christmas. \n\nSo not only was the letter misleading (it insinuated I was pre-cancerous when I was not) and my results were not communicated with me, but on top of that the nurse I spoke to was outrageously rude to me. She seemed annoyed with me for being worked up about the letter and tried to intimate that it was my fault for not coming back in July 2012. She didn't seem to understand that I had no knowledge of the abnormal results or why I would be upset about a certified letter saying I could get cancer if I continue to ignore this diagnosis. \n\nNow my blood tests are exhibiting discrepancies consistent with some leukemias and I remembered this. I called the office again to ask about my medical records (the receptionist was very helpful and great!) and to have someone call me back to refresh my memory on my abnormal results. Once again, the nurse's attitude was inexcusable. She started interrogating me on my follow up care, asking why I hadn't been back since 2011 and why I thought I had two, normal results consecutively if I didn't. I had to once again explain that her office didn't notify me until DECEMBER 2012 and my last pap was in JULY 2012. \n\nLast, and this is the best part, she started questioning my current sexual information (Do you have a boyfriend? Do you use condoms?). I felt it was highly inappropriate, not least of all because I don't know actually who I'm speaking with. I'm still not entirely clear on how someone can be so rude to a scared patient, and I don't understand their follow up policies at all.

There is usually a steady entering of people coming to discuss your procedure and answer questions so write them down before you get here, because if you are like me it quickly escapes your memory when they ask if you have any questions. \n\nThe waiting room is very large and has regular size chairs as well as a few small benches. If you have other small children accompanying you then this bench is great for sleepy children. \n\nthe lounge area has 2 tables with chairs if you would want a table for eating or computer. also one table has a few electrical outlets for recharging your cell battery or computer laptop.  They have a free machine that can make different kinds of coffee, hot tea and even hot chocolate. There is also a TV in this area.\n\nThe bathrooms are very large but are single file type so gotta wait if in use.\n\nthe cafeteria downstairs is renovated and I am sorry that I cant tell you about the food there because it closes at 2pm! after lunch SO if your procedure is scheduled around lunch time then people who are allowed to eat should keep this in mind!\n\nALSO keep in mind parents that if you are being admitted to HEMBY you may want to move your car from the orthopedic hospital parking deck to the main hospital during the time your child is in surgery. I get lost trying to maze my way through the hospital so I have to walk around the outside. And if you are by yourself at the hospital then you will be walking with your child to their room.\n\nthe recovery room is typical, except that the pediatric \"cubbies\" are right next to the automatic door which is very loud when people come in and out.\n\nNOW onto the main hospital:\nWe have usually always been admitted to HEMBY, which has its own elevator near the parking garage entrance to the hospital, take note that the entrance to the cafeteria is also near here.\n\nHemby is a very nice place, there is a lot for your kids to do if able, playroom, birds to look at in there little glass houses. the rooms are typically adorned with a DVD player and movies are available to borrow. a fridge and microwave in some rooms too. which is great if you have a small one you cant leave.\n\nNow on this visit we were actually in the NEW Hemby overflow which is accessed by the B elevator located directly behind receptionist in main lobby. These rooms are large and have the sleeper sofa, but down fall is no fridge or microwave. but there is a TV of course with a vcr/dvd player. \n\nThe food service person will visit you on the next food serving time and get your order for the next meals. The menu they give you is the one you will be making choices from for you stay. There is a lot to choose from. and as a parent I enjoyed that I didn't have to leave my child to go hunt food.\n\nthe nurses have been awesome and respectful of listening to my instructions for how to care for my son. They are helpful to make sure his pain is under control and get whatever I need. \n\nFOOD Room served: not so bad! let me say that condiments help a great deal and this hospital uses mainly Kraft products (BBQ sauce, dressings, mayo) in the cafeteria you can get hot sauce, tartar sauce, creamers (flavored). of course salt and pepper.\nthe mac and cheese is surprisingly great! just a little salt and pepper! The salads are filling. the chicken fingers remind me of Arby's breading. The flank steak with baked potato was edible, a little dry on the meat but hey it was free. The baked herbed chicken breast was also a little dry but very good. Breakfast was the best I think, I had eggs, bacon, sausage and grits. \n\nCafeteria- salad bar is paid for by WEIGHT so keep that in mind. they now have sushi available, fruits, pastries and the hot section is per item unless you get the special. (like bacon is 49 cents a slice!). burgers are OK, i usually hit it with some of the seasoning salt used for the fries. which are great when first made. They have pizza, soups and sandwiches and this place opens late hours also. \n\nGift shop has a lot to offer, snacks, headache meds, stomach meds, chap-stick. perfume, flowers, nice gifts, books, magazines. and extremely helpful staff.\n\nATM is located on the first floor but the cafeteria and gift shop do take credit/debit cards so if your card is NOT signed be prepared to show ID, it is their policy! \n\nSo if you should be admitted to the children's sections of the hospital I hope you a speeding recovery and a pleasant experience like I have received many times.", "business_id": "Vmw4amlubvfDnIpkegvKKw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-12-17", "type": "review"}

I saw a dentist out in a rural area, who told me I had an impacted wisdom tooth, but said he didn't feel comfortable extracting it. After toughing it out for about a week, I couldn't stand it any longer and started calling every oral surgeon in the Charlotte area to see who could take me within 24 hours. Dr. Marashi's office got me in for a consultation the same day, I believe, and scheduled the removal for the next morning. I opted for full sedation, even though it wasn't going to be covered by my insurance, because I just wanted to get it over with in the easiest possible way. \n\nThe day of the visit, everything went great. He and his staff were calm, professional and welcoming. He handled the IV sedation himself, and I didn't feel a thing. One minute, I was lying in the chair in excruciating pain, and the next, I was in the recovery room, and it was all over. He sent me home with detailed instructions, some prescription pain medication, and an antibiotic. I used the pain medication the first night, and then was able to switch to Advil the next day. I had some tenderness in the area, but absolutely no facial swelling or bruising. \n\nSo why not five stars? Because Dr. Marashi was supposed to call and check on me that night, and he didn't. He also didn't return my call when I left him a message about a concern I was having (which turned out to be nothing). Is that a huge deal? No, but it made me feel like I received a lower standard of postoperative care because I was a one-time patient from out of town. \n\nAnother reason for the four star review: when I got back to Chicago, I started experiencing pain around the area where the wisdom tooth had been removed.  I assumed it was a dry socket issue, but my dentist discovered that I had an infection and significant bone loss in the molar adjacent to the site of the wisdom tooth removal. He thought it was possible that the pain I had been experiencing in North Carolina had been caused by these issues, and not by the wisdom tooth. After battling several infections in the molar, and months of pain, I ultimately had to have that tooth removed, as well. Maybe Dr. Marashi was aware of these issues, but he didn't think they needed to be addressed right away. Or maybe he didn't notice it at all.  To be fair, I told him that I had an impacted wisdom tooth when I came in for the consultation, so he was probably just focused on that. \n\nThose frustrations aside, I would go back to his office in a heartbeat if I ever needed oral surgery in the Charlotte area again. Dr. Marashi has a very calm and professional demeanor, which means a lot when you're in pain and you just want someone to take care of you. His staff was also very kind and comforting. And after all the horror stories I had read about wisdom tooth extraction, I was truly shocked that I had no swelling and such minimal pain. So, all around, a good experience.", "business_id": "juZpQGOPbhc03TEyIA89nw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-01-07", "type": "review"}

They allow us to ask all the questions we have until we feel we have the answers and have been adequately informed.

I give this place one star because the doctor who performed the exam (a young female) was very knowledgeable and thorough.  The rest of my experience of buying the glasses was completely downhill and I would give no star for what I went through.\n\nTheir frames selection is very limited in terms of economic pricing.  Most of the frames were name brand super expensive.  As a student, I could care less about the brand and more about saving money.  I looked at a bunch of different frames, from the cheaper ones to brand names.  The lady helping me pick out frames seemed to keep pushing the Kate Spades ones on me and saying how much better they looked on me than all of the other ones.  So I ended up getting them even though they were $100 more expensive than the no-brand ones that I also liked.  \n\nIn terms of the lenses, I expressed to her that I wanted to wear these glasses for a long time because the frames were so expensive and because I have a strong prescription, I was willing to pay more for thin, light lenses.  She charged me an extra $50 for that.  After I received my glasses, I didn't feel like they were any thinner than my previous pair and took them to another store.  After just looking at them, the guy at the store told me that there were thinner and lighter options.  I felt completely lied to and robbed.\n\nFinally, to rub salt into the wound, when I received my glasses, they lady did not spend any time adjusting then on my face.  Pretty much handed them to me and told me to come back if I needed adjustments.  It turns out that they were way too tight on me and gave me a headache and left marks on the sides of my face.  So I go back to get it adjusted.  My frames were blue-colored metal and I saw her take pliers and yank at them.  After I left, I noticed that there were scratch marks on the metal!  I could not believe that they would treat my brand new name brand glasses like that.  The glasses still didn't fit right but I was too afraid to go back again.  I went to another store and they adjusted my glasses by warming them up.  Did Illini Eye not have the capabilities to do that??\n\nI felt like they just wanted my money and after I paid, they completely ignored me and my needs.  Overall, I feel like I overpaid for these name brand glasses with lenses that are still too heavy and thick.  I've been wearing the glasses for 7 months now and they are uncomfortable and heavy on my face.

I could not wait to go to Dr. Johnstone's office to tell her the news & talk with her about the prenatal care that was to come.  Unfortunately, due to the fact that it's a 45 minute to a 1 hour drive to Dr. Johnstone's office, my husband asked if I could please find a doctor closer to our home in North Scottsdale to go to for the prenatal care as he did not see any sense in driving so far south to frequent appointments when there were perfectly capable doctors much closer to home.\n\nHesitantly, I agreed to switch doctors.  I asked my primary care physician at Mayo Clinic Thunderbird who she would recommend and she gave me the name of an OBGYN only about 15 minutes from my home.  My husband and I visited them for several appointments.  The doctor and the office staff were courteous and nice.  They seemed to know what they were doing/talking about.  However, this doctor WAS NOT Dr. Johnstone.  I missed her, her patience with my questions, her terrific way of explaining things to me in a way I could understand, etc.  \n\nAfter I cried and cried to my husband to PLEASE let me switch back, I returned to Dr. Johnstone late in my 2nd trimester for the remainder of my pregnancy.  My baby is due Feb 7th 2013 & I couldn't be happier I made this decision.  I could not imagine anyone other than doctor Johnstone delivering this baby.  \n\nI have read the reviews others have posted regarding not being pleased with the front desk/office staff.  I have not had that experience.  They are running a business and sometimes they are very busy and down to business, but I find that if you greet them with a positive attitude, a smile, and your respect, they will be equally respectful to you.  \n\nI would definitely recommend Dr. Johnstone and her practice to anyone.  It is true sometimes they run behind and you need to wait to be taken back for your appointment a little late.  I am not put off by this as I worked for Social Security for approximately 8 years and I understand what it's like to fall behind when giving your full time and attention to each individual as they deserve.  Also, I would imagine it would be reasonable to think some patients may be a little late for their appointments causing the whole office to fall a little bit behind.  It does not turn me off at all, and I will gladly continue driving the distance for this high quality of care (& genuine caring) in the future.", "business_id": "1acmBPmmFDovVSHHzMrJ9A", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-01-30", "type": "review"}

I have had to see them twice (at the North Phoenix location - haven't been to the Central Phoenix location).  Once for a jacked up rotator cuff and the second time was for bursitis that I developed in BOTH hips.  \n\nThe first time I went in I was assessed and then given a range of exercises that I could do on my own.  I followed the plan as given and was able to rehab my shoulder without multiple visits.  Of course, if I couldn't have done it on my own I would have gone back but I was diligent in my own treatment.  I went from not being able to lift my arm wash my hair or take off my bra without odd contortions (yeah, picture that for a minute) to good as new within about two months of diligent work.  Had I not gone it when I did, I very well could have done more damage and may have had to have surgery.\n\nThe second time, with the bursitis, took more work and multiple sessions for treatment and exercises.  When I went in I could barely walk and ANY impact (such as getting out of a truck) would about put me on the ground.  As an avid fitness instructor and runner, this obviously wasn't good.  I felt as if both hips had been struck with a hammer!  No joke...the bones themselves felt bruised.  I didn't want to make a separate appointment for a regular physical who was likely only going to prescribe me PT, so I made an appointment.  I went in for an assessment, where it was determined that I likely had bursitis, and was started on a range of treatments.  I'm not going to say that the manipulation was comfortable.  It wasn't...and some days I wanted to come off the bench BUT it was needed and I firmly believed that it contributed to my healing and rehabilitation process.  I had multiple sessions and I was taught exercises and stretches that I could incorporate into my workouts and do at home to help my rehabilitation process.  And, it worked!  I didn't have to go in for injections or surgery.  I firmly believe that had I not got in, I would have ended up a lot worse and would have had to endure far more painful experiences than a little manipulation to stretch the muscles.\n\nLong story short:  I found the team at ASPT very knowledge and helpful to me not once, but twice, and BOTH times they mixed me right up.  I even recommend my boyfriend go there for a knee problem and they were able to help him out too.  Since then I have recommended many other friends and family and they have reported positive results as well.

Dr. Drewitz  (and a few others) got pretty awesome reviews elsewhere online and was a peer-voted TOP DOC in the Phoenix Magazine. While that's not the patients voting, Yelpers, I suggest you do your own research. \n\nNote: I will update my review if I need to go back.\n\nNow to my experience. I called with digestive stress thinking it was a pretty serious episode that I was having. They got me in quickly but with a young doctor that hadn't received very good online reviews. They were quick to assign this one to me and although i was leery, I decided to just give this guy the benefit of the doubt.\n\nAs another Yelper just before me mentioned, although I don't know if we had the same doc, the bedside manner was virtually non-existent. While he may just have a laid back personality, professionally, I prefer my docs to act like they give a shit.\n\nSo then after asking me a few perfunctory questions about my current symptoms, he does the \"stethoscope to the heart and back\" routine and sends me to a kind woman to schedule my CT scan at a local Imaging place. Again, they got me in pretty quickly.\n\nHere's where it went awry for me. I went in for the scan on a Friday and the CT techs said the drs. office would receive results in 2 to 3 bus. days. I called Digestive Health Center - Coronado in 4. They had the results but the dr. had to sign off so someone could tell me my results and hadn't. Meanwhile, I'm beginning to panic cause NO NEWS IS BAD NEWS when you're a patient with a condition.\n\nEIGHT BUSINESS DAYS LATER, I call back like WTF? The assistant was apologetic but noted he STILL hadn't signed off on my results. Now remember , that this is simply so they can tell me something IS or ISNT wrong with me. Jeez!!!!!\n\nSo I said I need another doctor then. An hour or two later another doctor calls back to tell me all is fine. For this frustrating episode, I receive a dang near $200 bill (after insurance pays their part and note how quickly THAT arrived vs. how slow the follow up was) and after paying $350 out of pocket for a CT scan. So $550 of my hard-earned- and- not- easily- come- by savings later, I am ok but seriously do not feel the service I received was worth it!", "business_id": "QC3osgPdEl_TEZA2CtNeQw", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-12-01", "type": "review"}

I noticed that in Pod D the DAY nurses are a little less attentive and slower to respond to the remote control caller button than the night Pod D nurses were.  \n\nPod C nurses were nicer than Pod D nurses overall, and many of them are friends with each other and attend the same church and even quietly sung some of their church songs together on the night shift, which was very comforting in my opinion.  Pod C nurses were very attentive, quick to respond, were very \"real\" when speaking with me and answering questions, and knew all the ins and outs of getting you the best care from the doctors.  They visited with each other while at the nurses station, that's true, but they rarely got to sit down for more than a few minutes at a time because it was always time for some patient to get some type of attention and it NEVER, EVER ENDS.  \n\nSTOP WHAT YOU ARE DOING RIGHT NOW AND REALIZE THAT NO MATTER WHAT TIME OF NIGHT IT IS -- THE NURSES AT BANNER GOOD SAM ARE GETTING OUT OF THEIR CHAIRS CONSTANTLY TO ATTEND TO SOMETHING A PATIENT NEEDS AND MONITORING THEIR CARE FROM THEIR COMPUTER PROGRAMS AND ARE IN CONSTANT TOUCH WITH THE DOCTORS BY PHONE, GIVING THEM UPDATES.  I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY CAN KEEP ALL THE CHANGING DATA IN THEIR HEADS FROM ALL THE CHANGES WITH EACH PATIENT.  It truly is a constant thing around the clock and I know because I was a day sleeper while I was there and I was awake at all hours of the night, getting my ice chps and walking with my walker for exercise and I saw those nurses constantly attending to the patients at 1:00 a.m., 3:00 a.m., 4:00 a.m.  IT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW.\n\nI agree there is a neverending string of visitors wanting blood, taking blood pressure, dispensing your meds, asking you questions, etc. that starts about 3:00 a.m. and goes thru to about 7:00 a.m.  I almost felt I should \"hold a meeting or press conference\" and have them all appear in my room at once and answer their questions and allow them to poke and prod simultaneously and get it over with so I could go back to sleep.\n\nThere could be better housekeeping efforts in the private bathrooms by the cleaning staff.\n\nIf you find yourself staying at Banner Good Sam for 1 or more nights and are in need of any kind of pain medication (other than the morphine self-pumper - limited of course), then take a tip from me and self-monitor the timing of your doses so that if you are supposed to get your pain pill(s) every four (4) hours, START getting the nurses going on dispensing your meds about 20-40 minutes before that four (4) hours is UP, because it takes them that long to go through all the administrative medical hoops to actually hand you the pills.  If you WAIT until your four (4) hours is UP to ask the nurses for your next round of pain meds, it can take them 20-40 minutes to get it to you by the time they make all the phone calls they need to make, and by then you could be in trouble with PAIN.  I'm surprised that the nurses don't realize this themselves and start getting your next round ready 20-40 minutes BEFORE your four (4) hour interval is up -- but, alas this seems to be up to the patient.  Pod C was better about this than Pod D was BTW.\n\nI only met one Nurse Ratchet, and she was sort of a Semi-Nurse-Ratchet on Pod D -- can't remember her name, but she had that familiar cold stare.\n\nI like the layout of the pods with their circular nurse stations -- they can really keep an eye on the patients that way and they are always at hand, and when you need to do some walking with your walker or IV pole, you can go in circles and still be close to the nurses.  They know which patients haven't done any walking yet, and they congratulate and encourage you when they see you finally up and about!  Also, the ice chip machine is a great find and it dispenses FILTERED water and ice chips -- a Godsend when you are on ice chips and no food for days.  I think the nurses have a running joke about \"Whack-a-Mole\" which describes their constant interruptions during their shift from their patients that surround them in the circular pod.  Being in the center of the pod, the nurses in their nurse station have nowhere to hide from patients!  Those nurses really deserve all our respect and adoration for the CONSTANT care and interruptions they endure with such grace.  \n\nI intend to go back to visit them and thank the ones I remember in person with gifts very soon and I WILL NOT FAIL TO DO THIS AS GOD IS MY WITNESS.  I feel so much better now they may not even recognize me from the pained, dizzy, bloated, hospital-robed, frizzy haired, no-make-up lady they took such good care of for a few days.  I will waltz in there with my hair and makeup done, wearing nice clothes and bearing gifts and hugs very soon!

After only a couple of days, she showed rapid deterioration of her faculties.  Even her manner of speech changed.  She became a different person and looked sickly and yellowish in color.  They gave her someone else's clothes that were about 40 sizes too big and appeared to be from the late 1960's.  They were so old they were moth-eaten.  She had her own clothes there, but the attendant told me they would  not permit her to wear them for some unknown reason.\n\nWhile I was visiting her one evening, my sister had to use the restroom.  The attendant told her she could only leave the room once, and if she did again, we had to terminate our visit.  As my sister had an upset stomach because of the food she had eaten, she felt the need to go again after a few minutes.  The attendant told us to say goodbye, and I was not permitted to see her again that night..\n\nWhile in the waiting room, I could hear other patients on the inside screaming, throwing things, banging and kicking on walls and doors, cussing,  etc.  There was general pandemonium going on for the entire duration of the visit.  One patient who was also in the waiting room with us visiting with relatives cried loudly and incessantly the entire time I was there.  There was no privacy, which made for a most distressing visit.\n\nEven though we weren't permitted in patient quarters, it sounded just like an insane asylum.  This was unit 5.\n\nAvoid this place if you can help it.  Believe me, it's frightful.", "business_id": "r1sLMV2DfDfJZ8HJMzKhow", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-12-08", "type": "review"}

The office staff in the pre-op section of the clinic was abrupt and unfriendly much like the reception I received from Dr. Sweeten.  When Dr. Sweeten entered the exam room for my consultation visit, she didn't introduce herself, opting to jump immediately into taking medical history notes.  She was dressed in decorative scrubs, so I just assumed that she was another office staff member.  Dr. Sweeten pulled out a couple of diagrams of the female reproductive organs and began to chicken scratch on them as she described the procedures she intended to perform based on my symptoms.   My inner voice questioned if I was making the right decision, but I was under the gun as the end of my medical plan year ended, so I decided to schedule additional procedures.  As I spoke with the office assistant in charge of scheduling, I mentioned that Dr. Sweeten might want to upgrade her systems in place to describe the procedures to patients.  I politely suggested that the office might want to consider updating their handouts such that Dr. Sweeten doesn't have to write upside-down on the handouts from how the diagrams are oriented, adding that printed information about the procedure would be nice.   The receptionist in the out-patient clinic section of the facility was a little more courteous.  The clinic scheduling system was a nightmare.  I had to wait for more than an hour for both of my procedures as at least ten to fifteen other people waited in the waiting room for either their appointments or to pick patients up.  Once I got back to the exam room to change into a gown, I saw lint balls on the floor and a black handprint on the exam room table.  The clinic staff handed me a plastic milk crate IN which my hospital gown was placed and directed me to place my shoes and clothes.  The clinic staff appeared annoyed that I asked for a different gown that had not been in a crate that others' had already used to place their shoes.  Dr. Sweeten met me in the pre-op waiting area prior to my first proceedure.  In reference to the suggestions I made about her pre-op consultation, she curtly and sarcastically stated, \"I hear that you didn't like my drawings,\" to which I politely responded, \"No I didn't.  I think that you could put together something in Microsoft Word that would look much more professional.\"  I didn't get a response.  The short version of the story is that my period and vaginal discharge continued without interruption for approximately 5 weeks, as the doctor advised.  I then had a \"period\" for one day that included minimal spotting of which I was also advised was possible.  Three months after the procedure, I'm back to having a painful full period with clotting just I had prior to my procedures.  I knew that the return of my period was possible as stated by Dr. Sweeten, but something in the back of my mind wonders...  wonders about a lot of things...", "business_id": "kOT8AO8e1e3J9pUBJ2C7Iw", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-02-01", "type": "review"}

She was kind, down-to-earth, smart and a good listener. However, in the end it was the doctor and one of the front office staff members who are the reasons why I won't return to this practice. As a 30-year-old married woman who moved to Scottsdale from CA, I was hoping to establish a relationship with an OBGYN here in the Valley so that I already have a trusting relationship with a doctor when my husband and I decide to have a baby. I was a happy patient of my last doctor for 12 years.  I scheduled my first appointment at this practice as a new patient and was seen by Whitney Padgett. It has always been my understanding that standards of care require doctors to actually see a patient if it is his or her first time going to a specialist. I was a bit shocked that I was seen only by Whitney and never a doctor at all, even though I was new to the practice. This aside, I returned for a second appointment and this time I saw Dr. Carol Hahn. I came to my appointment with Dr. Hahn for a problem and not the usual annual appointment, so naturally I was a bit worried. From the moment she walked in, Dr. Hahn was curt and condescending. She spoke to me as if I were below her. (I'm a professional working women who is married to a doctor) She typed notes on her keyboard with little eye contact. And, at one point corrected me as I was speaking about my health and at another point she made an unprofessional joke while performing my exam. However, the real shock to me came when she tilted her head down and asked me in a tone as if I was a teenage girl, \"Are you sexually active?\" I know this is a standard question, but my chart indicates that I am a married woman and that I take oral birth control for pregnancy prevention. Do you think she could have read my chart?? Or perhaps glanced at the clinical notes from my first visit to the practice? As I left this appointment, I was paying my co-pay and getting ready to head to work, I was told that I could not leave without paying the bill from my previous appointment. I explained that I had just received the bill two days prior for my previous appointment and had it at work with a stamp in my outgoing mail. I was told that I could not leave the building without paying that bill in person right then and there. When I explained that I'm still within the due date and that I have it ready to go in the mail, the lady told me that I would need to wait for a manager to approve it before I could leave. I told her that I needed to get to work and that I did not have the time to discuss this. I put the charge on my credit card to appease them and finally walked out the door. I can tell you that I will never return to this practice again.

Our pediatrician gave us a list of orthopedic surgeons to consult and although Dr. Shindell was at the top of the list, we actually went to the second name -- one of the largest orthopedic groups in the valley -- first. When we met with that first surgeon, he said he could help our son but given the size and placement of the cyst and the risk of it breaking, he recommended that we go to someone who handles these type of cases more often. We asked who he would recommend if it were his son, and he said Dr. Shindell.\n\nWhen we called Dr. Shindell's office, they were able to get us in for an appointment the next day. Needless to say, we were extremely anxious, but Dr. Shindell's calm demeanor and extensive experience helped us worry less. He explained all the options (including a brand new procedure that just finished clinical trials) and possible long-term effects. There was absolutely no pressure to take any one option over the others, and he was willing to give us the weekend to think over our options.\n\nIt took us about 20-minutes to decide what to do. Dr. Shindell immediately set up the surgery date and called Hanger Orthotics to squeezed us in for a fitting even though it was the end of day on a Friday.\n\nThe following week, our son had his surgery (would have been sooner, but we had to wait for his custom brace to be made). Dr. Shindell met us at the hospital to explain the details of the surgery ahead of time. After the surgery, he met us in the waiting room and explained the recovery plan and what to expect. Shindell again checked on our son the following day to see how he was recovering. Every time, he explained everything fully so that we could understand what was going on.\n\nWe still see Dr. Shindell regularly to check on the progress of our son's bone graft.

When I called she let me know that all of the patient paperwork was available online to fill out and print to bring with you and save time, something I'm always a big fan of.\n\nWhen I arrived the ladies at the front were very friendly and gave me one more form to fill out that wasn't available online so it wasn't something I'd missed, but it was short and didn't take long to fill out.  After a little bit someone came out and took me back to do the pre-exam tests with all the fun eye machines that look like arcade games.  After that it was into the exam room to wait for the doctor.  All the tests looked good and then it was onto the fun part, trying on different colors of colored contacts!\n\nThey were really patient and helpful with me, I tried a ton of different colors and I never felt rushed or like he was trying to get rid of me.  In fact he was suggesting more for me to try!  At the end of the appointment when I went to check out I was a bit taken aback by the total, I knew that I had a $15 copay so that's what I was expecting to pay but she quoted me $65.  Apparently there's a $50 fee for the exam for contact lenses, not a huge deal but I still wish they would have told me that ahead of time when they'd asked if I was interested in contacts or not.

From the minute you walk in the door, you are made to feel comfortable and welcome. I'm 34 now, and have been wearing glasses since I was 9. I've been through my share of eye doctors, and there are some doozies out there. When you're that up-close and personal with a doctor (they're inches from your face during the exam), you need to feel comfortable. I have never felt anything BUT comfortable with this place.\n\nI always see Dr. Frank and really enjoy not only his professionalism but just the small-talk (some people can be so uncomfortable and uneasy to talk with, but not Dr. Frank). The last time I went to see the crew, my insurance was about to expire and I needed to get in ASAP; they fit me with Dr. Ben, and again I have nothing but good to say. From the minute you walk in the door to the minute you leave, you feel welcome and valued.\n\nI typically get very ill (headaches, nausea, and vomiting) from being dilated, and they are very compassionate towards me. Previously, they would use a diluted mydriatic. But now, they offer the option of a special camera that sees the majority of the retina without having to dilate you (well worth the extra money!). This has saved me 2 days in bed with the blinds pulled and the blankets over my head.\n\nI am NOT a guy who likes to shop. So when having to pick out glasses, it can be very trying. The opticians at the office basically ask you what you're looking for, and they bring a few pair of frames over that suit your tastes and complement appearance. Usually, they bring four pair over that are a perfect match, and I then have the difficult decision of choosing one. But they really do take the pain out the decision-making process and make the entire visit, dare I say it, enjoyable.\n\nAll-in-all, I can't tell you how highly I recommend this group.

I bought an affordable Groupon for a Invisalign treatment. When I first walked into the office over a year ago now, I was impressed right away. I had been to consultations and those doctors(who spoke very highly of themselves) didn't have the latest technology. They wanted to do molds to get the trays. This office(which is like a day spa) has access to scanning technology which goes straight to Invisalign. I got my trays within 3 weeks. They made sure I was comfortable when I picked them up and even were able to show me 3D images would showed the advancement of my treatment. This turned out to be very helpful as there was a period of time that my teeth looked horrible. I was able to plan meetings around it(and of course it didn't look as horrible as I thought) but it was worth it and got me to were I am today. \n\nMy smile is beautiful. For the first time in my life I love to smile-and people seem to really enjoy being smiled at! When I came into my appointment today I was very please with my smile(my buttons were already removed but I hadn't been able to see the dentist due to some travel on my end). When I walked out today I was so happy I was in tears. Dr. Price did extra fixes and adjustments that made such a difference. She didn't have to. She could have charged me. But she just cared about her work. She wanted to be proud of the service she provided.  Even the staff upon leaving greeted me a congratulated me and we had a little celebration in the lobby. I felt that they really enjoy what they do. I've never seen such happiness as a dentist office.  Even the front desk staff are fantastic. I wouldn't call them receptionist because they aren't. They are very educated and fantastic caring people. \n\n\nWhen you do Invisalign, or if you get cavities often, you have to get your teeth cleaned every 3 months-it's the only extra money you need to really be aware of(that and the need for a retainer down the road after your last tray gets to old). This is a must and anyone treating your invisalign will tell you this. They do affordable cleanings there. My insurance covered my other cleanings. \n\nI was also able to do the propel treatment-it speeds up the invasalign process by letting you change your tray every week instead of every 2 weeks. There is a cost for this but it was worth it to me. It's not required but my treatment was very long. \n\nDr. Price and her staff are amazing. I've never been to a dentist who cares so much about her work and wants you as happy as possible.  I knew, since the day I went into my consult that I was going to be writing a five star review. I've just been waiting for my final appointment that I had this morning so I could write this. And I am glad I did. Even today they still amazed me. \n\nThank you everyone who helped me throughout my treatment. Thank you Dr. Ginger Price for this amazing experience-who can say that about their dentist?

I was told almost instantly that I needed a crown replacement. I went ahead with it, but afterwards the tooth she replaced was in pain and it felt as if the crown didn't fit properly.  Dr. Price replaced the new crown and it solved the problem; I was happy with this outcome.  A few years later I was told that another tooth needed a crown.  The same thing happened, the tooth felt like it was not fitting properly, I was in pain and could not chew normally on the tooth. I expressed my concern and told the hygienist that I thought it was a similar situation as to what happened before. This time, without looking at it first or even trying to adjust it, I was referred to go see a specialist (of her choosing) to discuss a root canal. I had no previous problems with this tooth and again had experienced this once before with a similar procedure she had performed.  I expressed my displeasure with this solution.  There was no root canal needed.  In the meantime, I was on vacation in NYC and the crown fell completely off; it was only one year old. I had to take an entire day of my vacation to get the tooth re-cemented. Not to mention the whole day before I was in pain due to tooth sensitivity.  Once I returned home I had another dentist xray and examine the tooth.  It was determined that the fit was not ideal and that it was leaking, thus causing a bad taste in my mouth as well as the sensitivity.  Because it has been under 5 years since this crown has been placed, my insurance company will not pay for a replacement.  I have written three formal letters to Dr. Price since September of 2014 requesting a refund on this tooth so that I may have it replaced.  I have received not so much as a phone call from them. When I called last week I was told by the receptionist that this more or less was my fault and should I take formal action against them, \"not to worry, they have good records\". That sounds like a threat to me. All I want is a new tooth so that I can eat without being in pain for the first time in three years.

When I came to BDP I knew my search was over. Everyone was so friendly, very informative, and didn't try to pressure me like I experienced at other places. The pricing was very similar to other places too (a little cheaper even). Also, at another place I was told I wasn't a Lasik candidate and would have to do PRK. However, BDP explained why I was a good candidate for Lasik and made me feel very comfortable with doing it. I was a little nervous about the surgery, but Dr. Perkins was great and when I met him that all went away. It was a quick procedure and he talked me though every step.

As a patient myself, I would like to help out fellow patients with a little insight I received during my shopping experience.\n\nMy consult resulted in a 'prescription' for PRK - one eye was too unstable for LASIK, according to BDPEC. However, I shopped around and a competitor said I was a great candidate for LASIK. I questioned this, as BDPEC said this was not the case - but the actual surgeon I met with said I would be fine. Ultimately I chose the competitor for LASIK.\n\nAfter much digging and personal research, I found that there are many things that can disqualify you for LASIK at BDPEC. They have a tighter set of qualifications. This can be great for people who actually qualify for LASIK there because 1) they are so conservative with risk that your surgery will probably go completely hitch-free and 2) their price for LASIK is actually pretty great. The problem comes in if you DON'T qualify for LASIK. They won't volunteer the information that their guidelines for 'prescribing' surgery are strict - they'll just tell you that you don't qualify. And if you don't shop around or if it's the first place you go, you'll probably just believe it! It was only after I went to the competitor and started asking more pointed questions (such as, 'What exactly is it about my cornea that disqualified me?' and How did you arrive at that conclusion?') that I was given the answers I needed in order to make the best decision for myself.\n\nI am now three days post-surgery from LASIK with the competitor. I did have a complication in the eye (the same eye that was flagged at BDPEC, which may or may not have actually been what they were actually concerned about. BDPEC had said I was at more risk for halos and starbursts, while the complication was that my eye dried out during my post-surgery nap and I dislocated the flap when I opened my eye - which turns out is frightening and not terribly comfortable, but also not the end of the world, at least not for me). However, the complication was easily solved during my next-day follow up when my surgeon just re-wet the corneal flap, laid it flat again and put a contact over top for me to wear through the weekend. It was removed today and I am quite pleased. Instead of having both eyes in discomfort and blurred with temporary contacts through tomorrow (as would have been the case with PRK) and the slower-to-realize results of PRK had I gone to BDPEC, I am now the happy, comfortable owner of great vision - on my own terms. I also think I will be getting a better ultimate result in vision from my procedure, as I had Custom LASIK instead of PRK (custom LASIK uses a laser that corrects more finite errors in refraction than the laser used in PRK or regular LASIK. I liken this to the difference between Zeiss eyeglass lenses and regular eyeglass lenses...when I was in eyeglasses, the step up in vision to Zeiss lenses was incredible and worth the extra cost).\n\nAs I said at the start of this review, I give BDPEC three stars because I am certain they provide fantastic results to the folks who qualify for LASIK. I am even certain that their PRK results would be great. However, I take issue with the fact that they will disqualify you from LASIK very easily - and won't be particularly transparent about why and won't tell you that other places might be able to treat you with the surgery you want. I suggest going to BDPEC and listen to what they have to say. You won't be meeting with the surgeon, but you'll meet with an optometrist and your surgery plan will be reviewed by a surgeon prior to your surgery date. If the optometrist says you can have LASIK, you'll probably be very happy - I am confident that they won't treat you unless your surgery will be an easy one (but do your own research on LASIK vs Custom LASIK, because they just have regular LASIK). However, if you don't qualify, make sure you ask why so you can shop around and see if other docs are capable of accommodating you. They will not offer this information voluntarily - you need to ask, and you need to ask very specifically. I just hate to think of myself having gone through PRK because that's all my eye could supposedly handle, and later find out I could have had the surgery I really wanted if I had been more informed and shopped around a bit. A friend of a friend just had PRK done (not sure where) and is still in pain two weeks later and 'wouldn't recommend it to anyone'...supposedly her eyes were 'too bad' for LASIK and I can't help but wonder if she could have had LASIK if she had just gone somewhere else. Thus, I feel I must share my experience and insight for the sake of other patients.\n\nBest wishes to all in the quest for great vision!

The best thing about the old location was that if you needed blood work or an xray, you just had to walk down a hall.  As of last time I was there, you had to go downstairs for blood work, but I was told they are looking to soon have both in their same office again soon.  You have to love one stop shopping - even in a Dr.\n\nAll of the Dr's at the office have been great.

Based on the great reviews, I chose this spot. I was really happy when they were able to schedule me a consultation on a Saturday. \n\nAlthough the area is a little rundown, the office/facility was very nice and I was pleasantly surprised. The waiting room was modern and comfortable, employees friendly. They ran a few tests on my vision, gave me an update on next steps, then dialated my eyes, sent me to wait in the waiting room, and then they called me back to give me my estimate. It was going to be $850 per eye (based on my prescription) and she gave me an extra 10% off with my Aetna insurance. I scheduled my appt for 2 weeks later. \n\nThey estimated 3-4 hours for the process. After I checked in for the surgery, I waited about a half hour, got called back to pay for the procedure, and then went back to the waiting room. They called me back for the surgery (with someone else) and then we waited in that room for almost 45 minutes. The whole time we could hear the employees laughing, telling stories and shooting the breeze. It was really annoying. When I finally went in, the procedure took approx 5 minutes per eye and they did a great job talking you through it the whole time. It was painless. They also provided sunglasses and goggles to sleep in. From start to finish, I was out in 2 hours. My husband was a little pissed because he was prepared to pick me up in more like 3.5 hours, not 2. Big difference. \n\nOn my day after, I didn't need glasses. At my check-up, I was almost 20/20 and was at 20/20 by my 2 week check-up. I am incredibly pleased with the results. Okay, okay, I am ecstatic. I took away a star for the long wait times, going back and forth between waiting and examination rooms, and the misquote with how long the procedure would be. \n\nOne nice thing they did was call me before my 2 week appt to ask if I wanted to reschedule.

I was not initially impressed, as the office smells like it used to be a vet's office or something (smells like wet dog and urine). Additionally, when we went in for his 1st appointment, the front office staff were all on their cellphones and gossiping and trash-talking, which I found extremely off-putting!\nMy husband didn't notice the smell, didn't have to sit and watch the staff act unprofessionally, and he was happy with Dr. Pema and their formulated plan (mainly because he was getting rid of the painful tooth), however, he had to go to another dentist for a root canal?  I wasn't too sure of seeing Dr. Pema for myself, so  I opted for Dr. Patel and set my appointment. She examined me and recommended the plan of action. At the beginning of June 2014, I went in for my first appointment in my plan and Dr. Pema performed the treatment.  I am not a good patient, but this was atrocious!  I was not numb enough, so I was given more Novocaine and left to sit for at least 1/2 hour, getting more and more anxious.  I finally told them they had better get Dr. Patel, or I was getting up out of the chair and leaving.  Then Pema came back and was condescending towards me.  He completed the work and I left. My temporary partial did not fit properly, so Pema broke it and then fit it in my mouth, with it missing some of the teeth. \nI contacted the corporate office and complained that I had scheduled my treatment with Patel and that I did not care for Dr. Pema; their response was to basically blow me off. \nMy next appointment was a cleaning and while they did it, they dislodged a particle that is stuck between 2 teeth; it can not be removed now and they tried to tell me that it had occurred prior to my appointments with them.  I had never had an issue between those 2 teeth until after this appointment.  \nMy permanent came in and it did not fit comfortably; Dr. Pema told me that \"it would take some getting used to\" and sent me on my way. After this episode, I demanded not to be treated by Pema and was told that there are no other doctors at the office at this time.  \nI was back in November for another deep cleaning (part of my treatment plan); I advised them that the partial still did not fit well and I have not been able to wear it.  My concerns/complaint was not acted upon.  I had another doctor, who was serving her last week at the office.  She did not speak to me, talking only to the hygienist and never asked how my denture or partial was fitting. Nothing was done about my complaint that the partial wasn't fitting.\nI went in for a re-line of the denture in December and Alma did the work.  She has been fabulous, but I have not always been able to have her help me, EVEN when I have scheduled for her to work with me!  \nI have been making my payments as I am supposed to, and according to my agreement, a payment is not late until it is 3 days past due.  I have explained to them that I make my first payment based upon my payday and, on a couple of occasions, received calls on day 2 after my due date.  The person calling is always pushy and demanding that I take care of the payment that day, over the phone.  I have decided that I will then take it to the office, which I have done.  I have not received my billing the first few months and upon calling corporate, they told me that they had gotten returned mail from my address.  Funny, the billing for my husband's plan was coming to me at the same address! I asked for a copy of my bills to be sent to me, and was told that I had \"signed the contract\" and was required to pay whether I had a bill or not.  I advised that I have a right to receive my billing notices per HIPPA.  \nSurprisingly, for my husband's last payment, we did not receive a bill, so he didn't make the payment. They DID NOT call until he was 3 weeks late, yet I receive a call if I don't pay exact date?!!!?? So now, of course, he made the payment, but has been hit with late fee!!!\nNow, over 6 months later, I am getting some assistance from ALMA, which I am taking until I can find another dentist that will take me, due to my limited insurance plan; but I still don't have a partial that fits well! I am still having a ton of issues in trying to get it to fit properly, having to go back at least twice a week since December 20, 2014.  \nI would not recommend this office or the dental corporation (check with BBB, I wish I would have!)!", "business_id": "sxw6uoNBIEo4QctMWx_jgw", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-01-05", "type": "review"}

I love our old one, but he's a little far from our house...so, I started by getting recommendations from my area parenting board (the best board EVER). From there I narrowed it down to 3 offices and despite my broken arm, took Truman in his Service Dog vest off to check them out in person. I had a fairly dreadful experience at Dr. Michael Zacher's office. For those of you that don't know, I am a disabled person with a service dog. He is a hypoallergenic poodle and extremely well behaved. I was instructed by Dr. Zacher's Office Manager Rhonda that my dog was not welcome in their office (which by the way is beautiful with tv's, comfy leather sofas and a children's play room). I explained to her that under federal law, a Service Animal cannot be denied access to a facility. And, that I have NEVER in all my time with him (going on 3 years) been asked to leave. I can assure you that I am a very pleasant, nice (even fun) person. Truman was nestled near my feet having a snooze while this happened. He was not in any way disruptive. She told me that she would ask Dr. Zacher. About 15 minutes later Rhonda called back and told me the 'there was not a good fit', and that I could not use Dr. Zacher for my dental needs. I am very upset at being treated in this manner. After all if I had come in with a cane, would I have been denied access? The only recourse I have is to report back to you here and ask you to consider this when making your choices.", "business_id": "SeSmcvfWQxj3PKiizxkdQg", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-01-22", "type": "review"}

I was placed on a small cot in room and left there alone for some time. A young man who said his name was Chris came in and said he was going to start the IV. He used my left arm and then said 'oops, blew a valve...have to wait for it to bleed out' or some such venacular. He another man entered who Chris called 'Richard', whose name was on a white board as my nurse, though he never introduced himself or smiled my way or really acknowledged me in any way until after he listened to Chris laughing about how he blew a valve in my left arm and would need to get the right arm. He did not clean up the wound he made or bandage it but left it bleeding out onto my arm and went to my left arm while 'Richard' watched. He finally got the IV in my right arm and i had to ask 'Richard' to put a bandaid on my right arm as I was concenred about infection. He used what appeard to be scotch tape and put a piece of guaze on it which came loose within minutes and did not appreciate my having asked for it. . I was covered in burning itching hiives and could have used an encouraging word or smile. I began to feel much more frightened after having met my 'care givers' and I use that word very loosely. \nA long time later a physican came in asked if I had eaten anything unusual even though I told the others at the front desk about the new medications such as antibiotics I was recently taking for an infected root canal and that I had not eaten anything new. He looked at my chest area, and back and said \"Oh yes, you are having an allergic reaction or 'medication reaction' and wrote something down and left. Again a long time and forgive me for not having specific timelines but I was left alone, unmonitored for long periods of time and the IV cuff or Nurse call buttons were not operating and I could not call anyone. The entire time I am left alone, I hear what sounds like a holiday party down the hall and the place seems deserted in regard to healthcare services. Richard is down the hall because he has a deep voice which is distinguishable from the others. \nFinally he comes in and hooks up an IV bag with some medications inserted like benedryl and other meds, which he did not bother to  explain to me until I asked. In fact, he did not talk to me at all other than to call me \"Nancy' on the two occassions he came back to check on me. The bag of IV solution was cold and it dripped into my body within 10 minutes or less and I began shivering so badley I was freezing so much I could not stop shaking and I had no blankets. He came in and gave me 2 blankets and left again. Because the IV solution had been dumped into me so quickly I had to urinate immediately and could not get out of the bed because both sides of the rails were up and no one came and the call button was not working. I was not being monitored. He put heart monitor electrodes on me but most of the night they were not connected to the machine so I WAS NOT MONITORED. I managed to yell and catch a doctor who was walking by and told him I was going to pee on myself if I could not get out of that bed. He ran in and pulled the rail down on the bedside and jerked the monitor wires lose and my IV from the drip and said the restroom is down the hall to the left; another left, then another left - and he LEFT..I walked by by the nursing station and \"Richard' and 'Chris' were sitting there talking and neither acknowledged my presence as I walked by nor came to check on me later. I went back to my room and had to go to the restroom 2 or 3 more times before a new tech entered about 3 a.m, one whose name I never got came and told me I was in a closed section of the ER and they were moving me to another room. He would answer no questions, never really spoke to me other than to say 'I don't answer questions. I'm just a tech'. \nI was in this first room until about 3 am without any assistance or monitoring. If I had had a bad reaction to the medications, no one would have known. I mean, really I was in there for some type of serious allergic reaction, I am shot up with some type of benadryl and left alone unmonitored for hours. \nI was basically placed in a section of the ER that later I was informed 'had been closed'. No more than a few minutes in the new room than yet a different female nurse came in to say we are sending you home. Sign here , here, here and these are your medications and here's a list of 24 hr pharmacies and she left. I put on my blouse and asked for directions to the exit. Not one muscle of facial emotion ever showed on her or compassion was inflected in her voice. A robot w/o an emotion chip!. I was shown the door about 3:30ish a.m Friday morning - in the dark &cold w/o a 'bye your leave'.I bet they have my name correctly documented in the billing dept.

But I found myself in the ER recently. The facility is clean and bare. Not much there to spread germs that's for certain. No magazines, children books, newspapers laying around. The wait was forever long, I guess my pain was not an emergency in their eyes so I got pushed to the back over and over. I choose JCL North Mountain because It is my intention to volunteer here. They give a lot back to the community and they are rated as one of the best places to work (that also has a low stress factor- how that can be in hospital amazes me). \n\nThings are pretty laid back here in the ER. You sign/write your issue down instead of verbalizing it to the entire wait room. I like that sense of privacy. You aren't openly asked a bunch of billing and payment questions before all else. This amazed me. And they seem to have two waiting areas once your vitals are taken. One for the injured and one for the sick that keeps you from becoming ill if you are just injured. Or at least that was the best I could figure from the way separated me and another injured person. If this is the case that is very wise planning. \n\nMy wait was 4.5 hours! With that said I was disappointed because I was in pain. I placed my pain at 8 on their 1 to 10 pain scale with 10 being the highest. Maybe I should have cried and screamed out in pain? Then maybe I would have been taken more serious? I don't know. Maybe they are understaffed? Well with that wait I saw a Doctor's assistant for all of 10 minutes and was told that what I was doing was all that could be done! Gee can I get a job here too then?! \n\nReferred to an outside source for a dental emergency and released.

I miss Dr Grover dearly.  He was probably the best Chiropractor I've ever worked with.\n\nIt had been quite some time since I threw my back out last.  At the start of every visit, Dr Grover always \"took inventory\" of my situation through questions and testing so he knew exactly what was out, which way it was out, and made a plan for the adjustments he needed to make.  The adjustments he made were very specific to my current misalignment, and varied through the treatment term based on how things were moving back into place..  This typically fixed me up within a week or so.   But Dr Grover had retired so I figured I'd try Dr. Reichow. I was happy that they were able to squeeze me in the same day as I know the sooner adjustments are made, the less severe the whole experience will be.\n\nHis approach is much different than Dr Grover's. The initial visit had questions and testing similar to Dr Grover, but the adjustment was clearly different.  I wasn't very happy with it (mostly because it wasn't the same as Dr. Grover's approach, which I knew was proven to work in the past), but I figured I'd go with it since I'm not a Dr and he is.  But subsequent visits got even worse. I was not really showing much improvement and I felt the Dr's interest in my recovery did not seem as important as getting me in for the next appointment.  \n\nI finally had enough when I arrived for my 3rd or 4th visit, and the Dr  just does an adjustment (basically a general lower back crack, as well as an upper back crack, even though I have no upper back problems) as soon as I walked in.  He didn't ask me how I was doing, if anything changed, and did no testing to see what was still out.  *After* the adjustment he asked if anything had changed.  In my opinion, he is just looking to do adjustments and collect the (albeit reasonable) fee.\n\nWith that said, the front desk was pleasant, and they have a massage therapist that, for a very reasonable fee, can give you a massage to loosen you up before the adjustment (Though Dr Grover used to do this himself using massagers as part of the adjustment).  His name escapes me, but the massage was very good, he was pleasant to talk to as well as very informative and knowledgeable. I think I learned more about how to deal with my injury from him than the Dr.\n\nIn any case, I decided Moon Valley Chiropractic is no longer for me.", "business_id": "j43AVGhTlo0daQi_r4_8iQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-01-19", "type": "review"}

This office has been very difficult since I started going there last month for my pregnancy.  I was referred by a friend to Dr O'Sullivan and because of an emergency I was only able to get in with Dr De Santo.  I have had about 3 about in a 6 week time.  The three appointments I had made were made to my convenience, around my work schedule.  I was called three times, once for each appointment to reschedule.  These reschedules had nothing to do with the doc running to the hospital to deliver a baby, they were simple errors made at the front desk.. on three different occasions.  Very frustrating to say the least.  I had to reschedule all three of my appointments and miss work each time.  Every time they called to reschedule, I would still get a reminder call for the appt they had just cancelled (which was automated and after hours).  Not only was that annoying, but I worried I would be charge a no show fee (with their own fault) and would call them first thing in the morning to point out their fault and to make sure I didn't have an appt.  They never sounded surprised that I was telling them that THEY had rescheduled me and that I didn't'  have an appt.  One day, I had to stop by in the morning, first thing to give blood.   I was told that they open at 8--and that was great because I wouldn't be missing work (I just started a new job and really don't want to be coming in late all the time or using PTO), when I arrived at 8 for blood work (along with 2 other women also there for blood work), the front desk informed us that the lab technician is not in to take blood until 8:30am, another break in communication from the front desk.  I would not recommend this office and as soon as I am done with my follow-ups I am out of here!  The doc himself is very knowledgeable but is not moving along with treatment for my miscarriage, and does not listen to mine or my husband's concerns.  He is also not very personable and doesn't take the time to explain things--rather he beats around the bush.   I also enjoyed how at every appt they would ask when your last period was, \"hello, I'm pregnant!

I wasn't there, but my husband felt very good about Dr. Bailey, who seems to be a good doctor. However, the follow-up and communication from this office are absolutely horrible and unprofessional. First, we had to transfer my son's medical records from another office. Then, we waited to hear back from Entegrity to know if my son would be a good candidate for sublingual drops treatment. We waited several weeks and I had to finally call twice to learn that, yes, indeed, my son was a good candidate and that I could order the $200+ treatment for 3 months (not covered by insurance) and pay with my credit card over the phone. I did call back (at least twice) to order the treatment and was told I would get another call to pick-up the treatment. My credit card was promptly charged, and after 10 days, I was still waiting for a call back. I called myself (again) to be told I could come pick-up the treatment at any time without an appointment. I came with my husband and son on a Monday morning, and was just handed a case and 2 forms to sign (including a waiver of liability). No word about the treatment. I asked to talk to someone before signing anything, and then was told that I didn't have an appointment, so I would have to wait! We ended up spending a good hour at the office to finally see someone who answered our questions about the treatment. I was told that in the notes it said the doctor had called us to go over the details (neither my husband not I ever got a call from anyone). Dr. Bailey might be good, and the treatment worth it, but the communication (or lack thereof) is appalling.

This review is for my 2/25/15 visit at the north scottsdale office off of Scottdale road and 101. I asked the office staff if there was another location and this is the only Entegrity ENT in Scottsdale, so here goes. \n\nI was here last year as a new patient and my experience has been positive, so i have returned this year for another condition i was suffering from.  \n\nI saw Dr. Samuel Bailey both times and he has great bedside manners with positive energy and always smiling.  I hate grouchy doctors :P\nHe answered all of my questions and i didn't feel like i was being rushed. Most doctors offices usually have their PA or NPs do all the work and doctors will only see you for 5 minutes tops but Dr. Bailey gave me his full attention and was super friendly,  and kind.  He explained things easy and thoroughly enough for a child to understand AND still had time for my questions. \n\nI have not seen other doctors here, so i can't speak for them but Dr. Bailey has been one of the kindest, caring and considerate physician I've dealt with and i highly recommend him for all your ear/nose/throat needs. \n\nAs for the office staff,  they must have new staff because nobody at this office treated me bad like some of the things that were mentioned in other negative reviews.\n\nMany doctors offices want the patients to pay up front if you haven't met your annual deductible but Entegrity will file a claim with your insurance first before they bill you,  so i don't agree with some of the reviews complaining about the office only wanting money.  \n\nBottom line;  if you need to see an ENT specialist and want to see a doctor that will actually listen and pay attention to you explaining your symptoms who is very kind and caring, then schedule your appointment with Dr. Bailey. You won't like him if you're one of those people who don't like nice and friendly doctor (trust me,  i know some people who prefer their doctors to be a$$holes).", "business_id": "e0B-vLvKxGiGV_pTT7vwcg", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-02-25", "type": "review"}

I have no qualms with him. However, my first visit, Jessica, was quite rude and remained so with every visit.

I asked if Dr. Sobel was being over booked or this is how late he runs all the time. They said, \"It's Dr. Sobel\". \"He spends a lot of time with his patient's\". Although that may be a good thing, it should not be at the expense of the next patient.  it is my professional opinion, that if he spends a lot of time with his patient's, then they should schedule accordingly to allow room for that time, instead of making patient's wait an hour and a half to be seen. \n\nThis kind of management is totally unprofessional and unacceptable. Of note, Dr. Larry Sobel overheard my questioning, and while visiting with another patient, and said...\"You can leave if you want\". I left and will not be back again.\n\nThe courtesy from his staff up front should've been, Dr. Larry is running an hour behind...and allow me the option to reschedule.", "business_id": "Dqr1eP7wpo0BnWdMp4ViNg", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-02-20", "type": "review"}

I told the girl at the front desk that $99 was all i could afford.  I had $120 and that was it.  when i got done with the exam, my bill was $200, and of course I couldn't pay it, because I only had $120.  I guess they didn't hear me when I said I only had $120.   apparently, i got more than just a contact lens exam, even though I SPECIFICALLY STATED that I wanted ONLY the CL exam . When I couldn't pay, i told them i would pay the rest at a later date.  i did go back a few months later and paid the remaining balance and bought some contact lenses, which were fine.  today, i stopped in there because i really need new glasses.  my current pair was about 7 years old.  i informed the girl at the desk of this and i informed her that  i was unwilling to pay for a new eye exam after i was informed that the 18 month old script was expired. she seemed annoyed that i was standing up for myself and she said she would see what the doctor would say and i looked at frames.  i picked out a $150 frame and brought it to the counter.  now it's a different lady at the front.   she looks me up in the computer and says that i don't have a glasses prescription on file. Why don't I have an EYEGLASSES SCRIPT on file?  WHY??  i guess the $200 dollar eye exam didn't include an eyeglasses script.  IS THAT CORRECT? she said she would ask the doctor if it was okay for me to buy these glasses, but i didn't want to wait around for them to ask permission from the doctor if it's okay for me to spend my $$$ in their store, so i left.  can't say what he would have done, but my guess is that he'd wanna charge me another $200 to tell me that \"everything is fine and your script hasn't changed\".  my script has changed VERY LITTLE since early 90s.  If it has gotten worse, it's not by much, as I can still wear the glasses I received in the US Army in 1992 and they work fine (though I would not wear them in public :) i don't have insurance and need to pay cash and i just needed some glasses. I DID NOT NEED ANOTHER EXAM,   I'm tired of this highway robbery.  this place seems to really like the money grab so beware.   Most people with insurance don't question extra charges because they know their insurance will cover it.  \n\nIn response to Dr. Rios' angered reply.  I lied?  how come I paid $99 on my first visit and then returned at a later date to pay the remaining balance?  I combined your two charges of $98 and $99 respectively, and called it $200.  Deal with it.  Why doen't $200 cover for a glasses script?  What lobbyist out there wanted a STATE LAW to renew eyeglass scripts annually?  Can you say \"Special Interests\"???  Blackmail?  Where do you see blackmail? That statement about blackmail alone makes me think you are wacko.  I got my lenses duplicated and that is perfectly within the law of the State of Arizona to do so.  I am completely satisfied with my new glasses and I see great.  Thanks for your concern about the health of my eyes, though!  How would he know if my script was the same since the 90s?  He only saw me once and I brought no previous records with me.   Disrupt your office?  I may have debated briefly with the counter girl, but I made no scene or raised my voice or anything like that.  I do have an exuberant personality, I don't deny that.   Dr, Rios, do you think you are insulting me by saying I should seek charity if I cannot afford eye care?  I was told on the phone before driving down to the office that the exam would cost $99.  When I got the the counter it was twice that amount.  I could afford it,  but it wasn't the amount I was told I would pay. I specifically told them on the phone before I came down, that all I had was $100.  That's why I had to return at a later date to pay the remaining balance because I was unable to pay the full amount.  As far as my previous contacts not working, Dr. Rios specifically told me that certain cleaning solutions on the market were ruining the disposable contacts making them unwearable.  He mentioned that the \"Eye Care Community\"  had recently discovered this information.  I went back to using the peroxide cleaning solution,  same solution I used in the late 1980s and I haven't had any more problems with disposable contact lenses.  Why did I come back to the office to get glasses when my first experience was bad?  BECAUSE I didn't think that after 18 months, my script would be expired.  I was wrong.  Since BOTH of my visits involved money grabs, I decided to write this review.   Inaccurate and malicious?  I don't think so,  I'm just stating my experience, and of course my opinion.

It was the basic drill. Check in, paperwork, wait, pee in a cup, wait, see the nurse for vitals, undress, wait, see doc, dress, blood work, pay, reschedule. Clearly, those are a lot of steps with different people in different rooms of the office. The problem is that no one bothers to tell you where to go or what to do next. If you are brand new to the office, you better buck up and figure it out yourself. Don't bother asking for help. Asking questions only irritates the staff and they aren't shy to show you that they think you are stupid for not knowing their exact urine sample procedures. Grrrr!\n\nSo the doctor was nice enough...no complaints on that front.  The girls in the blood lab were really the only people with any personality, compassion or care at all.   I ended up getting a follow up call on the blood work that turned out to be nothing thankfully. However, I was appalled at the process. They left and abrupt, alarming and very vague voice mail. When I called back, I got lost in their automated system and then put on hold for an eternity. They finally asked me who had called me...needed the name of the nurse. I was like...\"I don't know. Can't you look me up?  Don't you have a computer?\". After much haggling  I finally spoke to someone who could tell me what was wrong with me. Well, that's an overstatement.  I asked a couple of elementary questions and the lady couldn't answer a thing and recommended that  I go to WebMD to get answers. Really? \n\nSo, I came back for a follow up visit, hoping the experience would be more pleasant. It wasn't as bad, but certainly substandard.  Coming to the lady-doctor isn't my favorite thing to do. It's not comfortable or enjoyable. A good practice in my opinion would compensate with outstanding customer service.

I've NEVER been in the hospital for anything so even this \"minor\" procedure (which does require general anesthesia, however), is a big deal for me.\n\nRachel couldn't have been nicer.  At first she was talking a mile a minute (being professional and efficient, that's all) but when I told her my situation and asked her to slow down she did immediately.  She remained professional and appropriate at all times but I really felt as if I was speaking with a trusted friend or family member as she briefly walked me through the process I'd be encountering at the hospital. \n\nI can't really put in words how important it is to me that she took the time to really hear me, to listen to my concerns and questions.  And that she addressed them, not in a perfunctory way, but with warmth, compassion and reassurance. \n\nAs I was wrapping this up, Rachel called back to refine some of the details.  She'd already gotten to Dr Pelopeda to confirm the timing of the appointment and she was calling at Dr Pelopeda's direction to reschedule my \"pre-op\" consultation so that the Dr could spend a little more time with me.\n\nI consider that outstanding service from both women and I'm so grateful for their care!\n\nQUICK UPDATE:\nI wanted to be able to provide reviews of my experiences with Dr Pelopeda and other aspects of the practice separately -- and it's been virtually all good so far -- but apparently Yelp only allows one review?  Since I may be receiving ongoing care for at least a couple more months, I'll come back and do updates accordingly.\n\nI also wanted to add a word of recognition for Dr Pelopeda herself.  To date she has been extremely professional and still so patient and compassionate.  I have  a strong case of \"white coat\" anxiety and it's worse when hospitals are involved!  She is clearly accomplished and knowledgeable and at the same time she's been very accommodating and considerate.  Her physician's assistant (right term?) Lourdes is very competent -- they work extremely well together.\n\nA few weeks ago, I had an ultrasound performed by Lynn and once again, this was a first for me so I was a bit anxious.

I was referred to Dr Pepka for my children and have been taking my children there for the last 4 years without an issue.   This time however, I was really disappointed.  My 6 month old daughter had an upper respitory infection and was starting to have a hard time breathing.  The office was closed and the voicemail said to call back to schedule an appointment.  We were really worried so my husband and I went in first thing when they opened.  \nI could not believe the way I was treated.  I had personally been in there with all 4 of my children more times than I could count.  We have good insurance and have never had a problem when they needed to move appointments.  All in all I would say that we were good clients.  Anyway, the receptionist yelled at us \"NEVER JUST COME IN.  YOU NEED TO LEAVE A MESSAGE AND WE WILL CALL YOU BACK TO SCHEDULE\".  I explained that we did not intend to get seen right away.  We were willing to wait but hoped that a nurse could just tell us if we needed to head straight to the hospital. She made us an appointment and we came back an hour later.\nAfter our appointment, we did feel a bit better but Dr Pepka told us that if her breathing got any more labored that we would have to take her to the ER.  Within the hour we decided to take her.  We were in the emergency room for about 8 hours before they admitted us.  During this time, no word from our doctor.  Hmmm....  So we ended up at Scottsdale Shea around 10pm.  The next morning (around 10am), our nurses and the respitory specialist told us that once they got ahold of our doctor he would likely come to see our daughter and release us. We got a phone call from him around 11am and he said that he would be there in the afternoon.  He showed up around 4pm and released us.

I have a clean dental history, and am just looking for a professional dental office simply for my family's cleanings, but this place does not seem to achieve these fairly modest standards. \n\nScheduling fails: Just got a call today-Tuesday that they are canceling my Friday appointment as they are unexpectedly and suddenly closed that day. (Cancellation call was 26 minutes after receiving an email confirmation to that same appointment no less).  This is not the first, second, or third time they have called or emailed to change dates or times.  I pressed for a reason, and was only given a vague \"equipment maintenance.\" They tried to reschedule for a different day of the week, but my vacation week has been booked for months. It seems getting to an appointment with them always has always had an unacceptable level of drama and flexibility on the patient's end involved, as each appointment involves several phone calls to change when they can see you, if not Kokopelli closing their office at the last minute and canceling the visit outright.\n\nBilling fail: The one time we successfully went to them, we gave them our insurance card upon arrival, and before going back said \"make sure our insurance covers this, or else we'll make other arrangements,\" and ... SURPRISE, get a bill for hundreds a month later stating our insurance didn't cover our appointment.\n\nAlthough the office organization seems to be lacking, the staff up front is very friendly, and ancillary dental assistants are very friendly as well. The office seems clean and I personally found the care adequate, thus the slightly greater than minimal score. My pregnant wife tells me they gave her a local anesthetic she's not supposed to receive, after she specifically instructed them not to give her this and a few other specific meds (she gave them a pamphlet of what to avoid).  On my visit Dr. Block seemed just ok, that might be due to a slight personality clash more than anything.\n\nNot a fan of writing these negative reviews, and have no major issue with a business dropping the ball once or twice, but have to push back and put my opinion here when there is such little respect for one's time.  We gave this place many chances, we live right down the street and would love to support a local business and take our kids to such a convenient place for years to come, but this place is too high maintenance and unpredictable. We'll drive a little further for a simple teeth cleaning without the drama.\n\nNow excuse me while I floss the associated stress out of my system, & swish and spit this experience from my memory.", "business_id": "-5U-BYTx-RqcM8GZnYKYxg", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-12-02", "type": "review"}

He is far from knowledgable and definitely not phone-service oriented. After much back and forth, I just wanted an appt so I scheduled it. After doing so, I asked about getting my records to go elsewhere and he said I needed to submit a \"release form\" even to get a copy of my own prescription. This is something I never had to do before. After my appt was made, I was contacted later in the evening by a female worker to confirm my appt the following day. When I started voicing my concerns about this \"Blake\" guy and that I wanted to cancel my appt, she told me to hold a second and what did she do? She brought him back on the line. He immediately started saying something about my release form (not confirming it was received) and then went on to say my prescription which I had got for glasses, was no longer valid and I couldn't have a copy of it. Not wanting to argue with his ignorant self, I simply said- \"you don't hear to re-explain anything. That's nonsense my prescription is now invalid, and reiterated I wanted my appt cancelled\". He was careless in his responses And his personality/work behavior has forever steered me away from Dr Rubeis' office. I recommend this place for the effectiveness of the exams I was given and the attention to detail that Dr Rubeis provides but as far as front office etiquette, their care, or even their SERVICE, I now give his office TWO THUMBS DOWN.", "business_id": "Er5cvsO0iZR_aPmoHElN7A", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-12-17", "type": "review"}

He has given me injections, one in my shoulder which got rid of the pain for over a year!  Mostly I get injections in my neck and lower back.  Sometimes they last months, sometimes I need repeated ones in the same area. They definitely helped with my chronic pain.   I used to get sedation that was great, I didn't feel anything.

TERRIBLE!\nI am requesting State authorities to investigate this office.  They provide no relief, they do not follow simple insurance protocols, their office staff is greatly misinformed, and they charge exorbitant fees.  They recently sent me a bill for almost 2 thousand dollars for service they say they performed one year ago.  I am beginning to believe they are running some sort of SCAM.  For some reason, they failed to bill my insurance, probably because they would not pay their ridiculous cost, even though I am covered by two insurance companies.  You would think their mission is to inflict pain rather than resolve it.", "business_id": "qENSItlPXTT0rguV83q-ng", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-01-20", "type": "review"}
