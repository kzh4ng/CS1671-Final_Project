With all the big chain gyms you can expect the following:  heavy handed sales tactics, ridiculous arbitrary fees, lots of tattooed meat-heads walking around, loud obnoxious top-40 music, a general look of disdain from the staff, and you're treated like a number not a person.  This gym has none of that.  The pricing is transparent and competitive, the staff is genuinely friendly and you feel like they really appreciate your business.  There was no sales pitch whatsoever.  No loud music, and everyone there seems happy.  There is zero pretentious vibe happening here.  Plus they have great group classes, and the equipment is current and in good working order.  This place is fully stocked for just about any kind of workout you could ever need.  It even has a lap pool, a jacuzzi, a cold-plunge pool, and a sauna and steam room.  Plus they even have spare workout clothes if you forget yours, and they provide free day-use locks for the locker room.  This place blows away anywhere else I have ever worked out.  If I had anything bad to say about it, I would say that the decor (but not the machines) is a little dated, and it's located in a basement, so the ceilings are kind of low and it doesn't have a big open airy feel to it.

That was easy enough...there was enough room for me and the ride was smooth and fun (though I can't say it was relaxing)...Any ways. After the game was quite an experience! The tram ride home was a little more crowed now that the game had let out. There were two die hard fans in our car from the two teams who started talking trash to each other...well one of them had a little too much to drink and one thing lead to another and they were soon yelling threats at each other. Right before the drunker one took a swing (in a very crowded car) an older man stood up and shut them both up before someone got hurt...the tension in the air was thick the whole way back to Tempe where the Cub fan got off and punched the window.

It was again a fun ride, but I couldn't say that it was a relaxing ride...there was this bum who was asking people for money and I think it would be better with some music playing in the background...any ways the ride home wasn't as eventful as the baseball game crowd, but again, there was another bum asking for money...can people just ride in peace?\n\nI like the light rail - I really do...it's always an interesting experience, but I just don't feel safe on it. I used to take the metro bus from Gilbert to Mesa every day for a while and I felt safer on that then I do on the light rail and the bums who ride the bus don't ask me for money either.", "business_id": "1eWZa9FxbVPpd6jyyKy3iw", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-08-13", "type": "review"}

At least, not to anyone I liked...\n\n\nThe Expectation:  Her Dad wanted to take the two of us out for dinner, and his wife had suggested 'The Old Spaghetti Factory'. I had never been to the place before, but I know a few of my family have went there on separate occasions with nothing but good things to say. So, I figured we'd try it, I'd say I was even eager to do so.\n\n\nThe Wait:  We arrived for dinner, roughly about 6pm on a weeknight. We were told by the hostess that it would be about \"ten or fifteen minutes\" to seat our table of four. At first, I thought that was a little weird, seing it didn't appear ridiculously busy from the lobby or by the amount of cars parked outside, and it wasn't like we were an abnormally large group. But it was cool, they had what seemed like several waiting rooms with different types of chairs and sofas to sit on, and some cool, old \"stuff\" to look at.\n\n...Twenty minutes later.\nIt seemed like there were at least three different, larger groups of people that came in after us, and were seated before us. I wasn't really sure how that worked, but, just as I was just about to approach the hostess podium to inquire about our wait, the hostess called our party's name and began to walk us to our table.\n\n\nThe Service:  Our hostess sat us at a four top table, located in one of the corners of the main dinning room. She apologized for the wait, noting that the area we' were sitting in was supposed to be closed, but they were making room in order to seat us, she also mentioned that our waitress should be by in a minute or so. It didn't take long for our waitress to come by to tell us she'd be right with us, but then it took forever for her to return and take our drink order.\n\nOne of the least pleasant particulars of the evening was our waitress being super short with us at every encounter. It was like we had done something wrong by sitting in her section. By the time she returned with our drinks, I think we all knew exactly what we were ordering; which seemed to somehow catch her off guard, as if she was stressed to take our order.\n\n\nThe Meal:  I had the Chicken Marsala which came with Mizithra Cheese & Browned Butter, and my girlfriend had the Spinach & Cheese Ravioli. Both entrees included bread for the table, and the choice of soup or salad. I had a Caesar (upgraded at an additional cost.) and she had a side salad with vinaigrette.\n\nThe salads were alright, iceberg lettuce, which was 'meh' and the Caesar came with tomatoes, which I scoffed at, just a little. My entree wasn't horrible, although, it did seem like a pretty measly serving for the price. It tasted just mediocre, - I could've swore the tomatoes/sauce on the Raviolis was canned, whatever it was, it was pretty bitter. \n\nI'm usually not one to complain about the waiting staff allowing you to enjoy your meal in peace, but that was not the case in this instance. The waitress rarely came by the table to check on us, at all. She came by and asked us if we enjoyed our meal, (laughable,) if there was anything more she could get for us, or if we needed to-go boxes, while taking our dishes away. She left us, again, for an eternity. Returning with our check and some small boxes.\n\n\nThe Outcome:  I tried to keep the group positive while we sat, as others around us seemed to be enjoying themselves. But without another, much improved dinning experience, I would probably go elsewhere. Honestly, I don't love/hate/mind Olive Garden, but this place wasn't even that good.\n\nI walked my girlfriend back to our car with a disappointed stomach, and a sad little to-go box, both half-full of mediocre food. - Maybe we can go somewhere good on Friday night...", "business_id": "DlCtdbceo4YNSI53cCL2lg", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-07-04", "type": "review"}

Lucky for us, there were 3 empty seats at the bar. The service was quick for how busy it was and when we told the bartender to \"surprise us\" with the three-cheese plate...he did an amazing job. My absolute favorite was a brie called \"Green Hill\".

I am vegan.  I had a lunch reservation for Coronado Cafe, but decided to call ahead of time to work out any kinks in the preparation (e.g., no butter, no refined sugar, no smuggled in eggs or milk or cheese).  When I called, I thought I was lucky to have reached the owner.  I was quickly disabused.  She quipped that I should have taken the time to look up their menu online.  (By the way, of course I had, but they don't label!)  When I told her that the menu doesn't tell me everything I need to know for my diet (e.g., the butter or sugar issue), she got really exasperated and whined, \"I'm trying to help you.\"  I said that was great and I'd like the help.  She then said that they have several vegetarian items, which again I explained might not be vegan (a vegan diet is more restrictive, so just because it's vegetarian does not necessarily mean it's vegan).  I asked her, for example, to ask the chef if the veggie burger was vegan, and she said,  \"I'm the owner and I know everything about the menu.\"  So I asked her if the veggie burger was vegan and she said, \"I don't know.  Is a veggie burger vegan?\"  I said, \"Some are; some aren't.\"  She said, \"I don't think this is a place for you.  Don't come.\"  I didn't.  And I won't ever.  \n\nTo sum up:  The owner is rude, unhelpful, unknowledgeable about food -- and to top it all off, she refuses to talk to the chef (who could easily answer food prep questions).

How can an ice cream shop be so hot?  Looking around I don't see any air condition vents.  Don't tell me they have none?  It got a little better as I sat at the bar with fans aimed at me, but I am still in wonder at how they have lasted this long while being that hot inside!\n\nThankfully I'm just getting a root beer float.  I was offered water before it arrived.  The float's glass was nicely chilled, and I appreciated the tiny little chilled metal pitcher of extra root beer to top it off.  Ezra The ice cream had a nice strong vanilla extract flavor but was unfortunately icy (ice chunks within it).  Several of the wait staff asked me how it was as I consumed it, so I would say service is good here.\n\nI am not a fan of the big blazingly hot non-air conditioned room of clutter when you walk in.  All but two of the booths were filled, and one of those was not bussed (dirty glasses on it), so the space could definitely be reconfigured to be more profitable by putting in more seating.  I sat at the bar, the furthest away from the broiling area surrounding the windows, but ended up sitting in front of the employees' hand washing sink.  The bar top itself is some type of weird old plastic material that is fades in many areas and cracked at the edges.\n\nOverall it was a very decent float that was undoubtedly a step above Dairy Queen or A&W's soft serve version in quality.

In my mind, the question formed quite clearly:  \"What kind of a botanical garden can they possibly have in the middle of the desert?\"  As a Missouri native, I still have a great deal to learn...and this experience was most informative.  \n\nJust as with so many other delightful surprises, I found that Arizona can (and does) host gardens every bit as captivating as those in other states.  Despite great variance, they are beautiful in their own way.  This was a very novel encounter for me, as I found myself immersed in a land of cacti and thick islands of stalwart plantings yielding flowers of unexpected beauty.  Tiny creatures (lizards and geckos) darted here and there beneath some of the plantings, offering amusement to visitors.  Birds fluttered amid the trees, and butterflies came to sample the sweet nectar of the desert blooms.\n\nThis was both a beautiful experience and an educational moment that I've continued to build on.  My knowledge of gardens had been far more limited that I realized, and even after exploring tropical and \"classical\" botanical gardens across the Eastern United States and the West Coast, I still have a LOT to learn about what a successful garden can actually consist of.  \n\nYet even for those who wish to simply relax and drink in the peace and serenity of this magical wonderland, this will prove an ideal venue for quiet reflection and enjoyment.  Children also were enjoying the cacti and the lizards, and there was plenty of room for a diverse assembling of visitors to use the gardens in their own way, at whatever pace they found best.

This will be year 3 living at Palazzo Townhomes.\n\nI'll start with the positives:\n- Garage! Very hard to find an apartment, town home, or even house with a garage in phoenix.\n- Fake wood floors\n- Fairly spacious, however there are multiple floor plans. \n- Kinda quiet at times, as long as the mariachi music from the guetto behind us isn't raging on the highest possible setting.\n- Close to the airport, eateries, and job locations. I actually love how close it is to places I go.\n\nFloorplan for where I'm staying:\n1st level is the garage. Very narrow stairs going up with 3 or 4 leagues on the right for pictures or nicknacks. There are like 20 steps! pffu that sucks with a large set of groceries. Anymore than one person in the entry way is way too crowded. 2nd level is the kitchen which divides the living room with a high long counter. The entire 2nd level is fake wood. Patio which fits 3 people comfortably, coming in single file is the only way. Another set of huge narrow stairs going up to the 3rd level. This level has the bathroom (basic one sink, toilet, and shower) also a little it bit closet with a mini 1 inch knob, washer and dryer located in its own closet? Has fold out doors, one shelf above. Also the water heater in its own closet, good luck storing anything in there. And finally the bedroom with the smallest possible walk in closet (ours came with broken shelves).\n\nNow let's talk about the negatives:\nThe biggest problem I have with this place is the management. If you read the negative reviews on yelp or Google almost all of them in my experience are honest and realistic as to what people have unfortunately gone through. Management has changed 3 times since I've been here. The ONLY person who was worth anything here was Alecia (not sure if I spelled that right) she was the manager who we originally signed our lease with. As much as I wish she were still here, good for her for finding a better job. \n\nThis place is a total joke. Denise replaced her, who yes was cold hearted. She is the rudest woman who has ever worked here other than the short haired lady named Emily. Neither of them gave a two cents about anything, not your mail (which they grunted to get for you every time, not to mentioned they lost my packages multiple times and lost my neighbors christmas presents for like 4 months they didn't get them till about April when their lease was fortunately up). I hated Denise and Emily. Trying to get rid of my first major ant problem was a complete nightmare! Clickers for the gate have to be directed right next to the code box, but the office people won't tell you that. The new manager Carlie has hasnt been here very long buts its the same story, noone knows anything about what's going on.\n\nThe pool is always closed because noone understands how to use the chemicals so it become an insect infested highlighter green mess! Yuck won't ever go in there! Gym has the basics, very small....there always seems to be a group a over confident guys blasting rap, slamming and cracking weights\u00a0 (not to mention the gym mirrors, that's why there's a camera in there now-also the remote is always is sing for the tvs. There is a movie theater apparently that has never been open, haven't even seen it before. 24 hours maintenence lie. The maintenence men don't really know what they're doing and have barely any of there own tools. They ask to use ours. The dumpster is overflowing onto the surrounding areas all the time and many residents are lazy and leave leaking bags filled with who knows what all over the ground. They've even hired a special cleaner to come by and spray chemicals to clean off the copper stone near it because of how unsafe the left overs were that stained. A couple apartments were being finished when we first moved in from a recent fire that took place, probably was a good sign that we shouldn't have signed a lease here.\n\nIn all honesty if it weren't for the horrid management, this place could actually be luxury living. The place itself minus some of the cheap aspects is pretty great and has soo much potential. \n\nThe office staff has needed and still completely needs to go.\n\nI don't mean to offend anyone with this review however this is my personal opinion about my experience here, I'm sure there have been other people who have had a great experience, it was for me too in the beginning...things have clearly changed since then.", "business_id": "tbV2PnTuo7xo1O0RVFzhdg", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-06-23", "type": "review"}

The ramen is Hakata style, made with a pork broth & may be heavy/oily for some people, so why not please everybody? Be sure to ask for \"Cha Shu Ramen\" to get a few more pieces of pork.

So there are French pastries, German beer, Italian pasta, and Indian curries. Save the banana bread for dessert if you can, or get one of their pastries. I've never have enough room.\n\nIf you like good WHITE bread, buy one of the Pullman loaves on the table by the front door. My first extra 20 pounds in Japan came from the good bread!

Skip the tantan-men, which is billed as a spicy soup and tastes like little more than that:  spice in soup.  As for rice dishes, the katsu is decent, but avoid most of the appetizers:  shrimp shumai were mushy and flavorless, the Korean spicy rib lacked the spice, richness, and tenderness you'd want from a dish with that title, and the gyoza are less than noteworthy.\n\nThe lunch special is another great reason to come here:  for under $10, you can get a filling combination, like your choice of noodle soup with inari or a California roll.

In all of the years i have been coming here I can't think of a bad show. Oh sure there were bad times, fighting with my spouse, car issues, drank too much/not enough but the bands have ALWAYS been solid. You can count on the Music, great service from Lynsay and the place to be a dump. Love it. Free parking. Couple of tips. Sometimes you will find a food truck there. Check the web site before you come down if you are hungry. Sit in front of the little wall/bar and the acoustics are much much better.", "business_id": "JZJqJadk9pSoCGT7VTwBvg", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-07-09", "type": "review"}
