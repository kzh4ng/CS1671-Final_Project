Why do you have to be so unaccommodating?\n\nFirst of all, finding Fate takes some work.  When we turned off the main road we wondered if we were completely lost since it didn't look like the kind of neighborhood you would find a restaurant, it was very residential.  As we drove by it my husband actually thought it was an abandoned building.  There is a small parking lot off to the left that fits about 5 cars or so. The inside of the restaurant is pretty cool, with exposed brick and local funky artwork.\n\nWe went with a rather large group of 12.  One of the girls made a reservation ahead of time and they nicely set up a long table for the 12 of us.  (Note: long table not conducive to talking when in a large group)  About 8 of us arrived all at the same time but were told that we needed the whole party to be seated.  It's a small place and the 8 of us just standing in the door next to the table was a little awkward to say the least; especially considering there was only one other party dining at the time.  We stood and waited around until finally they told us we could sit down.\n\nThe food price is very reasonable and the selection is Pan-Asian, leaning heavily towards Thai.  We each placed our orders and one of the members of our party asked to have half of her entree boxed up before it even got to the table.  They couldn't do that.  They gave her a take out box and she had to do it herself.  How hard is it for them to just put half of it aside?  The food was pretty good, however, and I enjoyed my Thai coconut curry.\n\nAll in all the whole experience was unremarkable, bordering on frustrating.  The food wasn't nearly good enough to justify the poor service- although our waitress suddenly became very accommodating and friendly when we handed her cash + 4 credit cards and told her we were giving her a $50 tip on a $200 check.

She had claimed these are the best wings ever and I was a bit skeptical.  I had ordered the Honey-Hot and my friend got Medium.  Upon first bite, it was pure bliss!  The wings were deep-fried perfectly and the sauce had me burning up with a sweet after-taste.  I also like how there's not too much vinegar in the sauce.  Food is brought to your table by a super friendly staff and then once you're done, you get to throw your trash into a giant hippo statue.  What?!\n\nIt's a bit small, definitely more hole-in-the-wall but not dumpy.  It's cluttered with lots of cool stuff to look at both inside and out.  Take your time and wander the premise!  Do try to avoid the bathrooms though.\n\nThis is by far the best place for wings!  If only they'd kick out annoying high school brats and the old creepers that gets too friendly...

They also have great chicken wings.  Other dishes that we like include the walnut shrimp and the salt and pepper pork.", "business_id": "UxMnY3Dxafucv5cXHyfBSA", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-05-14", "type": "review"}

Lunch specials are around $6.95 & dinner is about $12.50. Granted the dinner portions are likely to be larger. From the outside of the restaurant it doesn't look like much. Inside awaits a friendly and professional staff, with a dimly lit atmosphere. I ordered the general chicken, lightly fried, very tasty. The egg drop soup is average. Ice water and hot herbal tea are a nice touch. The food doesn't seem \"healthy,\" everything seems either fried or sauced, but is a nice treat every now and then.
