My fiance, a friend and I were trying pizza from three different places and Luigi's was one of them.  I have driven by Luigi's many times before and for some reason had never stopped in but that did allow it to come to mind whenever I was looking for a pizza place I had not yet tried in the Bellevue area.  Whenever I called to place my order I was told that my pizza would be ready in about 15 minutes.  I arrived closer to 30 minutes later and was immediately confused whenever I walked into the restaurant.  You see there was a large dining room on the left that was full of people and I didn't immediately see the are where I would get my pizza from.  Finally after a few steps into the restaurant I noticed that the whole back area of the restaurant was where I needed to be and I made my way back there.  My pizza was ready for me and I quickly paid and was leaving whenever the cashier told me \"Stay out of trouble\".  I really hope that was a friendly sentiment and not one that was based upon my appearance or anything else.  The pizza itself had a medium thick crust with a bland sauce which is weird since I could see a ton of green herbs in it.  The cheese was just ok and nothing special while the pizza itself had a slightly sour taste to it which I did not enjoy.  Out of the three different pizzas we ate that night this one was overwhelmingly our least favorite which was evidenced by the fact that 3/4 of it was left after the evening.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I will probably not head back to Luigi's in the future.  I just don't see myself making a trip to Luigi's between the weird experience (although not bad) that I had in the restaurant and the fact that there are much better pizza places nearby.", "business_id": "eOv0Dbq2E8sd0CKMAqTImw", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-09-05", "type": "review"}

The pastas, according to my wife and niece, were good. The sangria was real nice also. I'm more of a scotch and beer person and never acquired a taste for wine or wine products, so this is high praise coming from me. \n\nWhat made this place stand out was the service. Very rarely do you find a place as friendly as this. They made a real effort to help us keep our two-year old happy, bringing out some dough with a tiny little rolling pin for him to play with. They also gave us some cheesy garlic bread on the house, which we all loved. We also got the usual complementary bread and oil, of course, which was also good. \n\nAll in all this is a really nice little place. Highly, highly recommended over chains like Olive Garden. We'll probably continue to order our carry-out from Vincent's, but when we're in the mood to go out for Italian food, Bell' Italia will be high on our list.", "business_id": "hgb1RihLYRSpFBjBhn8rZw", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-10-23", "type": "review"}

Shells were cooked to perfection! Pizza was thin and tasty. We've been coming here for years and love the people who work there.

They used to be very good and very close to New York Pizza , now the pizza is horrible . It's either under cooked or burnt . I wouldn't recommend a Sicilian pie , they have no clue . The chicken parm hero is soggy ..  I had to wait over an hour and a half for my pizza bc it was either burnt or they gave it away .

For starters, they have live music regularly, and they always have an annual show with Melt Banana from Japan, which is always a blast! Sound is awesome, and the cover is reasonable. Drink selection is amazing, and they have a signature drink menu as well. They have a full kitchen, and even offer breakfast starting at 6am! Perfect for those working the graveyard shift. Prices are good and drinks are strong. The decor is awesome, a good mix of pulps and movie posters and the like.

What a dissapointment. The prices went way up, the food way down, and the attitude has not changed. NOW, I can say I will never return. Ate 1 bite of lasagne and did not like it, TOO too much acid. Server said \"just take it home and eat it tomorrow\". If that was the case, I would have. For 30.00, I could have went to Olive Garden and really enjoyed it.

We check out the menu online and I am in LOVE with all of their ingredient choices! I'm a woman of variety and Nellos has it. We ordered 3 small pizzas and created two of our own and also tried the Bianca pesto Pizza as well. Everything was absolutely heavenly!!! The thin crust what eggplant/artichoke one we created was my fav.... you will never get eggplant at Pizza Hut people but Nellos is def worth the splurge! I picked up our pizzas about 25 minutes later and when I arrived pizza was ready and I was in and out in no time to get back to our Sunday evening of Guitar Hero. Cute spot inside and we well def be back to check out the bar and try out happy hour!", "business_id": "69c7z9ySnlqV87tITDGENA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-11-21", "type": "review"}
