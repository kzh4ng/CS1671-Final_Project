I try to do a good bit of my own work to save on the repair bill and to avoid unscrupulous mechanics. \n\nI called a handful of shops to get a quote to replace an exhaust manifold gasket and bolts on my 05 Grand Cherokee. Alan (owner) quoted me $250 per side (I have the 5.7 V8, so there are 2 sides) to fix it. Sure enough, it was $250 out the door. Alan is a great guy that knows his stuff. If it doesn't need to be fixed, he'll tell you it doesn't need to be fixed. BUT, if it does need to be fixed, it really does need fixing. He even checked on a couple of other things and made some recommendations for other specialty shops for projects I plan on doing on this Jeep, which he didn't have to do. \n\nI chose to give Master a shot after my normal go-to shop in Monroeville didn't return my call seeking a quote for the exhaust manifold. Some of the reviews on Google for Master are unfair, with the chief complaint being a misunderstanding of personalities. If you want to question what the mechanic tells you needs to be done, fine. Just make sure you know what you're talking about. If you have zero mechanical knowledge, don't tell the mechanic how to do their job. Alan won't blow smoke up your dress and hold your hand. If you want your car fixed, take it to Master. \n\nThanks again, Alan, for giving me the opportunity to boast on the Jeep forums about only paying $250 for a repair that many have shelled out $1K+ to fix! You're my new go-to shop for our vehicles. \n\n(If you're curious as to their hours, I was there a little after 7AM. They are first come, first serve.) Don't be an idiot and expect your car to be fixed 5 minutes after pulling into the lot.

But after owning a BMW for 3 years and having constant wheel alignment/tire issues (ie. when a tire warning signal lights up, it usually means my tire's about to blow out!!), I freaked out and frantically drove my Infiniti to the first 3 auto shops on Baum Blvd. I waited at the first stop for 5-10 minutes and the guy did not get off the phone.

Now everybody makes mistakes but back at the tire shop I worked at if the technician made a mistake and caused any kind of damage he would inform the customer. This was not the case at Tread Quarters Pineville. When I went back to Treadquarters to show them the damage, the same young man as mentioned in \"(Aaren H)\" negative review told me that there is no way that this was the cause of the damage and that I probably curbed my wheel.

Easily five stars - the staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and a pleasure to work with. \n\nBut... having had the car for a few months now and having dealt with the Service department, I have to drop my rating. Service is a 1/1.5... Sigh. \n\nSpecifics: \n- When we purchased the car, it was mentioned that the first year/two oil changes would be free. In my naiviete, I didn't think to check for something in writing to confirm that. We took the car in for the first change and explained to the attendant that we'd just purchased it and this was the first oil change, which should be free. The attendant asked if we had any paperwork on that (which we didn't, so tough to argue it) and that it was no problem and he'd look it up for us. Naturally, there was nothing in their system for it so we ended up paying 70 bucks for an oil change I could have done myself at my house for 30 bucks. Oh, false promises...\n- Moreover, it took the service center more than TWO HOURS to change the oil. I'm a not a patient person; I understand that. But really? Two hours? A job that takes, at most, 10 minutes? Urrrgg. \n- More false promises: my girlfriend bought a car; I then bought a car. We were told that she would get a $100 check for the \"referral\", since technically she brought me in. Hey, I don't really care about the hundred bucks, but that was really cool of them. Except that we never actually received any check. I'm not sure why they even mentioned that if they weren't going to follow through with it? Odd. \n- Last Straw: It took forever to get my license plate from the purchase. Two and a half months went by during which time I contacted the dealership multiple times (only of half of which they actually replied to). So, finally I decided to just show up and say, \"Hey, what's the deal?\" I was told I had to bring the car in and get it inspected (why I would need to do this, I can't fathom. Should the brand-new car I just bought not have already been inspected? And why would it only be on the fifth time I asked about it that they would mention this? Hrrrm...) Anyways, I consented. I made an appointment to bring the car in at 8am on a Saturday. I got there at 7:55. Around 8:10 I was greeted by an admittedly friendly chap named Larry. I then milled around for 90 MINUTES... An hour and a half for an inspection (that should have been done before they sold me the car...)? Unhappy, that made me. Combined with the two-hour oil changes from a couple weeks prior, I was pretty well done with this place by then. Then when I went to \"check out\", they tried to charge me for it. I explained the situation and they asked if I had a coupon? Why would I have/need a coupon? Fortunately, my seething rage was enough to convince them to relent and just let me leave in peace. A few days later I got a call that my plate was in and I could \"come pick it up\". I was like, \"Um... no. Mail that thing to me.\" Long story short, I'm pretty sure they just forgot to file it. \n\nSo, in the end, my recommendation is to confidently buy a car from Folger Subaru, but make sure to follow up on your title/tag/registration, get any \"promises\" they make in writing (which is really just car-buying 101, my bad), and then never go back there again.", "business_id": "gdaFZvWpmWIDri1Fv9PEHA", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-09-25", "type": "review"}

Throughout the process, Clarence was on it!  He clearly explained all of the numbers without the expected song-and-dance of the stereotypical car sales guy.

We went in on Monday morning and asked them to tow it to their location from the South Towne shopping center. They did so ($60 for the tow), and had our car fixed by Wednesday morning. The price was high, but not higher than anywhere else, but not the best deal, either. So, reasonable.\n\nHowever, as I was driving the two blocks home, one tire went flat. I walked back, told them what had happened, and let him know we had previously had no issues with our tires. I asked if he could tow it back or if it would be safe to limp, and he said he couldn't tow it as their tow truck requires inflated tires (cue my suspicion of how my tire went flat in the first place), but they would also charge me for the tow. So I decided to limp the car back. At this point, my opinion of them was pretty low.\n\nHowever, as I got back to my car, the service man drove up in the tow truck and said that he wasn't sure if it was safe to limp. He checked out the tire, figured out that he could try to patch the bead, so he just took the wheel back to the shop and patched the bead. Only charged me $10 for that whole fiasco, so after that I had  a pretty good impression of Seversin's\n\nOur second encounter was more recent. We hit a deer with a glancing blow. We were pretty sure that the car was mechanically fine, but we wanted to get it checked. In addition, one headlight assembly was toast, so we requested that they replace that and realign the other headlight.\n\nIt took almost a week to get our car back from that, and when we did, it was making a new sound -- bubbling. After a bit of research, it seems this can be from low coolant. We refilled our coolant, and as of right now things are okay, but I am really disappointed that they didn't address that issue, or at least tell us -- especially as the body damage was near the coolant reservoir and radiator.\n\nHowever, their customer service is pretty good, and they're convenient. They also look to be good for regular maintenance.", "business_id": "IFzagko8Y344ajAhWOxnUw", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-11-15", "type": "review"}

I'll stand-by my previous review for the parts folks. Read on for my experience with the service department.\n\nVehicle: 2000 Nissan Maxima SE 3.0L V6, Automatic, 156,000 miles. Current owner obtained it in 2005 and put on 100,000+ miles. No major issues, ever, aside from \"regular\" stuff. To say the owner knows the car inside out would be an understatement. \n\nSituation: Recently, when the car was in-gear (drive/reverse) and the ambient temperature was below 45F *and* the car was cold (like when trying to start it first thing in the morning), the car would bog down, load-up, and stall. The car would always immediately restart; however, as soon as you put it back into gear, the car would bog/stall/restart until it was fully warmed-up. Once the car was warmed-up (or if the ambient temperature was above 45F), the car ran *strong* - no issues at all. None. \n\nBackground: I am an ex-ASE-certified Master Technician with 10+ years of working on cars, fabricating cars, helping racing teams, and was also an automotive magazine editor for 3+ years. I know cars pretty well, still have 100% of my tools, and enjoy working on cars.\n\n+ We tried several things to resolve the bog/stall when in gear and cold problem. I cleaned the throttle body and idle air control valve, replaced the air filter, thoroughly cleaned the fuel injectors (using a pressure cleaner; didn't just dump STP in the gas tank), checked the TPS voltages (Throttle Position Sensor) and cleaned the Mass Air Flow Sensor. None of this helped when the car was *cold* or when the outside temps were below 45F. It still stalled until warm.\n\n+ I researched various message boards and repair forums, and found a Nissan TSB that said the computer may need a software update to resolve the issue. I don't have the appropriate hardware for this work, so I called Zimbrick Nissan Service. \n\n+ I provided *extremely detailed* information about the issue and the attempted repairs/history. The car was dropped-off on 11/3/15. They provided a free loaner car, which was a great gesture.\n\n- Over the course of 10-days, Zimbrick Nissan essentially guessed at what the root of the problem was. They shared the following as diagnosis (over a 10-day period; it changed almost daily): worn-out timing chain, worn-out exhaust, faulty computer, faulty Mass Air Flow Sensor, some undefined \"mystery repair\" (that they tried, and turned-out to not work), and finally, on 11/12/15, they called to say the car had \"weak ignition coils\" and that the spark plugs were \"gas soaked, fouled, and beyond saving.\" Cost to replace the \"weak coils\" and spark plugs? $859.\n\nI knew that coils do not grow weak, and if they do, they will set a check engine light. The car never had a check engine light with the current problem. There were zero codes and no lights. When I asked for more information, the service writer said they were \"out of ideas\" and \"had exhausted all possibilities\" for fixing the car. Pay the $860 for coils and plugs and then hope this fixed the problem was the only option.\n\nI declined the repair, and asked to have the car returned to its original state. To Zimbrick's credit, they did not charge for the 10-days of guesswork. They held to the original $230 estimate for diagnosis.\n\nBUT... when we went to pick-up the car, we immediately discovered it would not stay running, no matter what we did. It would immediately and repeatedly stall, and, it was back-firing, and running very, very poorly. Much worse than when we brought it in. It would stall and die and belch, even after it was warmed-up. \n\nWe pointed this out to the service writer, who said he'd have someone take a look at it. After 30-minutes, no one looked at the car. We went back in and were told that all of the technicians had gone home for the day, but that there was \"no possible way Zimbrick did anything to make the car run worse.\" He went on to say that because we had \"declined the recommended repair, it was unlikely Zimbrick could do anything to assist us.\" \n\nHe also reminded us that Zimbrick went \"above and beyond to help\" and that we declined the diagnosis for spark plugs and ignition coils. We limped the car home, and I took a look at it the next day. \n\nWhat I found were: four (4) disconnected vacuum lines and throttle cables that were lying loose and not secured in their brackets. This would explain why it was running so poorly upon pick-up. After reconnecting the lines and cables, the car immediately ran normally. \n\nI then did some more Google searching, and discovered that the issue was likely due to a cracked intake manifold gasket. I replaced the $17 gasket, and the car has been running *perfectly* under all conditions. Worse yet, while replacing the gasket, I inspected the spark plugs - they were perfect. Ugh. \n\nI e-mailed Zimbrick, and they seem to feel they did all they could... very disappointing. $860 worth of plugs/coils would've been 100% unnecessary.", "business_id": "AJOejrnO0z4lzp_GHO6wUQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-11-19", "type": "review"}

I had purchased tires here a year prior to my most recent visit. After one year, my tires with a 75K mile warranty needed replaced. I came in to have them replaced and the girl, Chelsea, at the tire desk was rude and unprofessional. While my tires were being inspected, I looked up to see her sitting in the passenger seat of my car going through the glove box. Obviously upset, I asked what she was doing and she said I told her to go through it to find some documentation. No idea where that idea came from and I asked to speak with a manager. She called for one and I spoke with someone who said he was the manager and he said that there was a miscommunication and what she did was acceptable. I don't see under any circumstances why a receptionist would need to remove everything and go through a customer's personal belongings. I called back later and requested to speak with the manager and I was transferred to Michael Jackson. I explained the story to him and he informed me the gentleman Chelsea called over for me to speak with was in fact NOT a manager. I asked him some questions about my tire warranty after he was very apologetic and he said he'd call me back. Never heard back even though I followed up twice. \n\nDo not bring your vehicle to Farm & Fleet.", "business_id": "vA8ed8BFvQxz4HFt8cHd9Q", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-09-11", "type": "review"}

For once, I was ready to go bright and early so that we could make the six-hour drive before the holiday weekend traffic got to be too terrible. My car, unfortunately, had other plans.  The battery, which I had purchased less than a month prior, decided it didn't want to work.  We suspected it was a bad connection to the terminal but couldn't be sure. Instead of driving to Checker Auto, I decided to take the car a couple blocks away to Virginia Auto.  I have a few friends who regularly take their vehicles here for service, so even though I had never utilized their serviced, I felt confident about taking my car in.\n\nAt 8am, their small lot was already packed, and I snagged the only available spot.  We walked in and were helped right away.  The very nice lady at the desk asked if I'd made an appointment ahead of time and I explained our situation.  She said they had quite a few other cars in with appointments but she would see what she could do.  We sat inside the small lobby and chatted for a while before she came back in.  My brand new battery was dead.  It had been completely drained!  She said they could put the battery back in and we could go back to Checker to have it replaced or they could install a new battery for me.  Not wanting to take a chance on another bad battery, I decided to have them take care of it for me.  Not more than 20 minutes later, they had finished!  I wasn't thrilled about having to pay more than I wanted to, but it was worth every penny.  After we got to Texas that afternoon, my very car-savvy Dad looked at the  car and said the battery had been installed very well - it was in securely and everything had been cleaned up really well.\n\nI need some serious maintenance done on the car, and I will absolutely be taking it in to Virginia Auto.

Before leaving, the Pep Boys employee who handled my payment verbally told me that my car was in good shape and had no other recommendations for maintenance, which seemed reasonable, as it was showing no signs of problems. Following the oil change, I drove home (approximately 3 miles), where the car sat for approximately one hour. I then drove from my home approximately 7 miles where the car engine was stopped for 15-20 minutes. \n\nShortly after starting my vehicle and driving less than 2 more miles, the engine temperature gauge spiked to the maximum and the engine began chugging. I immediately turned the car off and pulled to the side of the road, in an effort to avoid any further damage to my car. Then my car was towed to a more trusted shop across town.

After all that, they even gave me 10% off my bill and signed me up for Rewards so I could get additional discounts.  It took almost double the time they estimated which is the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5.  I've had bad experiences with Pep Boys in the past (Technicians doing work that wasn't necessary/authorized and then the Manager refusing to take it off the bill) but I feel comfortable dealing with Teresa and Ramiro.  I'll definitely come back!", "business_id": "9a-MZdxZ28o4j1pXI22btw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-10-18", "type": "review"}

If I could, I would give this place 0 stars.  The severe lack of service and communication I received and am still receiving from this excuse for a mechanic is unfathomable.  \n\nI took my car in a couple weeks ago for an oil change.  I knew there could be some additional things that need done so I was completely prepared for that.  Lo and behold the manager calls me and tells me I need new tires, plugs, coils, thermostat, and fuel system cleaned.  After quoting me a ridiculously high price I asked that they ONLY complete the plugs, coil, and oil change.  Of course, they added on the thermostat as well.  This tells me they either did not listen to me or did not care.  Either way, strike 1 of many.\n\nWhen I dropped my car off I expressed to them it MUST be done that day as I needed it for work.  Well they close at 8 so I figured no problem since I dropped it off at 11am.  No phone call from them after the initial assessment at 2pm.  When I called them at 6pm for status I was told they were waiting on 1 part for the thermostat (which I did not request) and that once it was received it would be 5 minutes and done.  Fast forward to 7:45pm and no call.  I call them back and was told the part did not arrive and it would not be done.  I expressed my frustration with the process thus far and was told it WILL be done by 8am when I had to leave for work.  SURPRISE....it was not done.  I had to get a ride to work and was told my car would be delivered to me at work.  Against my better judgment I agreed to this.  This part that should take 5 minutes once received took over 5 hours.  Once again I call for status and was told they were on their way.  fast forward 2 more hours and they have not arrived.  I work in tempe, not far.  Come to find out the mechanic drove my car to another shop to do who knows what and pick up someone then deliver my car to me.  Not happy about that at all and then I get in my car and they leave their empty pop cans/garbage in my car.  By this time I'm fuming.  \n\nLater that night the manager blows up my phone to get paid of course.  He keeps asking for my CC info to pay him but never bothers to tell me the total or breakdown or how I'm going to get a receipt.  He also states he is going to talk to his District manager regarding the experience I had and get back with me the next day regarding some sort of compensation (shockingly this was never done and I never received a call).  Finally I get the total from him and reluctantly pay it with the promise he will email me a receipt.  Here we are over a week later, 3 phone calls to the store, and 3 emails to corporate and still have no receipt!  \n\nNext step is to visit the store, yet again, for a receipt and I believe additional recourse is in order.  I honestly have NEVER received such terrible service in my life.  The sad part is I have taken my car here before when the old manager was there and received phenomenal service.

It's a rare to find piece in used market. In my search on Autotrader, Coulter cadillac, Phoenix, AZ showed up. Initially they were not willing to give it for the price I offered. When Glen Heiser from Internet sales got back to me, I bumped up my offer price, for which he agreed. He gave me the final out of the door price, I again asked him to reduce the price by $700, so that the price can be rounded off to lowest thousand amount. He got back to me stating that the price is reduced. Remember, all this was happening over the phone. I neither looked at the car nor test drove it. Finally I asked him if there is any body work that needs to be taken care of, he said there are minor things and he offered to take car of them, which he did. \n\nI got my loan processed, sent them the check and they shipped me the vehicle. I loved the first look of the vehicle but I had my own doubts. I test drove it, took it for a car wash and it looked amazing. I found that the Dust protectors around front brakes were deformed, I though this happend while shipping and asked Glenn to send me the pictures they posted on their web site before sale. Glenn was curtious to send me the pcitures and the deformation was in the pictures as well. I took my Audi to an Audi mechanic. He looked at it, test drove the car and asked me to be at ease and be at peace. He said I got a very good deal. \n\nSo over all, the price was $1000 more than what I initially asked for, vehicle is in perfect condition. The customer service and peace of mind that Glenn offered was top notch. His pre sale and post sale customer service were excellent. Coulter cadillac is a trust worthy place to go if you are looking for a new or used vehcile.

Two hours pass, three, four, five - and *boom* it's already 4pm. So they kept my car all day with no warning.

We've spoken to an attorney about the case. I noticed the dealership remodeled this year, so I find it impossible to believe any claim that they couldn't cover this expense. They cannot legally require us to use their service department, but that's where the bulk of their money is made. Had we used that they would've probably covered this because they would just be giving us our money back for overpriced and unnecessary service.\nThe next step would be a Class Action Case.\n\nIF YOU CAME TO THIS PAGE YOU ARE SMART ENOUGH TO WANT TO KNOW IF YOU SHOULD BY A GM MADE VEHICLE. \nCommon sense would say that if you wouldn't run into a burning building then it probably isn't a SAFE choice to by a GM car. The following story could happen to you.  For the record, they seem to have an airtight loophole so they NEVER have to cover lemon defects!!!!  Be smart and steer clear unless you've got money to burn....\n\nLook below to see the final decision offered to us by GM. What I find interesting is their complete omission of the most important facts.\n*All service records are available that show that ALL services were done on time. They have declined these. It is illegal to require that the dealership service departments be used, however that element has been stated several times as part of the decision factors. \n*This four year old vehicle had to have an engine replacement at 75k miles approximately for defective lifters. This was covered under our warranty because it was a defect. That was at approximately the two year mark.\n*We are now needing the same defective lifters dealt with in the REPLACEMENT ENGINE supplied by GM at about 75k miles from the time of that replacement. We are now at about the two year mark again.\n\nThe response below is presenting the cars data now of 143k miles and 4 years as if the engine wasn't replaced in the middle. Our vehicle is past our warranty for mileage and age BUT they are not offering ANY WARRANTY on the replacement engine. Typically there is a 3 year warranty, which is now down to 1 year(so said in the last conversation but prior to that it was stated as 3 years) and neither includes mileage. This basically means that they could put in a new engine with a defect and not be legally bound to cover that for any amount of time. They have referred to our issue as \"unexpected\" engine problems. Apparently this is a problem that MANY of this year and model have had. That's not unexpected then on the part of GM. This information is readily available, so feel free to check it out. It's only unexpected from the consumer position!\n\nSince the \"resolution\" seems to be final I really hope that other consumers will read this and take it into account when purchasing a GM vehicle. They own four brands...\n\nGood morning Sarah, \n\nWe understand that this was not the outcome you were hoping for and we truly apologize for any frustration this has caused. You have the right to expect long-term reliable performance from your vehicle and every effort has been made to assure excellent quality for our customers. We handle customer's concerns on a case by case basis and thoroughly look into various factors before delivering the resolution. Such factors are, age of the vehicle, mileage on the vehicle and warranty parameters. \n\nBased on the factors we mentioned, your vehicle does not meet the criteria and we are unable to assist with your engine replacement request. As your Yukon XL Denali has over 140,000 miles on it, it is out of Bumper to Bumper Warranty by age and mileage and out of Powertrain Warranty by mileage. We rely on our dealerships to be our eyes and ears in the field, as they investigate each vehicle and take these factors into consideration before determining the resolution. \n\nAt this time, the resolution stands and if you have any additional questions regarding the details of your case, please direct those to your agent. I will certainly document our conversation within our system and notify your agent accordingly. \n\nSincerely, \n\nSamantha N\nGM Customer Care", "business_id": "E3sONi8kCTBL96OjzpgBsA", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-11-06", "type": "review"}

The dealership assured me the entire fuel tank had to be replaced at a cost of over $3,500.00.  I authorized some other work at the dealership regarding an issue with my trunk not opening and closing reliably and decided to seek a second opinion about the fuel smell.  Fortunately, I was talking to a co-worker whose parents had been taking their cars to Atwood for years with nothing but satisfying results.  I took my car there and after inspecting the vehicle, Andrew and his team determined that in fact, my fuel tank was fine and that my fuel pump was leaking and needed to be replaced - a $280 part - and that repair immediately (and permanently) solved the problem.\n\nSix months later, I was still having problems with the trunk from the dealer's so-called repair and was due for routine service anyway, so I took the car back to Atwood.  I ended up needing full rear brakes and front pads as well, which I expected as I was starting to hear the usual warning sounds when pads are worn.  Andrew and team were able to determine that the issue with my trunk was actually a problem with wires in the wiring harness that were damaged due to wear (a design issue with this car) and instead of recommending replacing the entire harness, they repaired the section that was damaged, saving me hundreds in parts and much more in labor.\n\nA year later, I had a front suspension strut beginning to fail and I took the car to Atwood.  Andrew was able to replace the strut with a part carrying a lifetime warranty (something a dealer can't/won't do), and he even refunded a day of my car rental due to timing issues with when he could get the car repaired.\n\nLast year, I had a complete transmission failure while on a trip in Sedona (on a holiday, no less) and consulted with Andrew after leaving my car at another small independent shop in Sedona (Redrock Precision Motors - I highly recommend them as well).  I ended up having them replace the transmission with a rebuild carrying an unlimited mileage warranty.\n\nMost recently, my other front strut failed as I was leaving for a trip to Flagstaff to visit my daughter at college.  This time, it was a more dramatic failure, requiring towing to the shop.  When we arrived at the shop late on a Friday afternoon, Andrew's lot was nearly full - inside and out - telling me that business is good, but also signaling that it might take a while to get my car done.  One of his crew drove me to the car rental place so that I could get a car to continue my slightly delayed weekend.  They didn't have to do this, but offered to because they knew the car rental shop was slammed and would take a while to come get me.  When I came back to town on Monday, I checked in with Atwood's answering service a couple times and was not terribly surprised not to hear back right away, knowing how busy they were.  As it turns out, their internet and phones were down on Monday and Andrew spent most of the night there with the service provider getting back online.  He called me back on Tuesday morning after getting all his messages and, much to my surprise told me that my car would be ready that afternoon if I approved the detailed estimate he gave me.  I arrived at the shop and everything was to my satisfaction - the work was done promptly and within the estimate we discussed by phone that morning.\n\nI've gone a long way here to demonstrate a pattern - a pattern of dependable and honest service that I've received from Atwood.  I know cars very well - I have several (and have owned many more) and work on many of them myself and am not someone who could be easily deceived or swayed by a shyster.  Andrew and his crew have always been up-front and straightforward about all the repairs and service I've had done there - often going beyond the call of duty to save me time and money - and I will continue to be a customer for as long as I continue to own european brands.", "business_id": "5CgGQRXx_3TA8WQiKEmhhA", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-10-01", "type": "review"}

I should have known better, since there were only 3 reviews, and my friend was new to Phoenix and went here because it was close to her home.\n\nAnyways, I have an older car and the check engine light came on.  I made an appointment, and when I show up, these guys wanted to charge me $98 to just diagnose the problem!!  I mean, most other shops do it for $20 or for free.  At that point, I didn't have much choice because I had already made elaborate arrangements for a friend to pick me up and I was getting worried about the check engine light.\n\nLong story short, they wanted to charge me a total of $750+ for repairs, labor, and parts.  I think their labor costs are way overpriced because I looked at what they wanted to charge for parts and it seemed more or less reasonable.  I buckled at the amount (mostly because I didn't have the cash) and because I wanted to get a second opinion after I learned that the check engine light costs $98 to check out. (I've since been to a Midas by my house who diagnosed the Check Engine light for FREE. And I've seen other places that do it for $20...still a chunk of cash compared to FREE but measly change compared to $98). \n\nNot knowing where to find a reliable mechanic for a second opinion, I took it to the dealership. I know that dealers usually charge higher prices that shops, so I was prepared for the worst.  But at least I wanted to know if the repairs suggested by Kelly Clark were legitimately needed.  Well, it turns out the repairs were really needed, but the shocker came when they quoted me a price of $550 for repair, parts, and labor.   That's a $200 price difference!!!!!

I came away with a good experience and a well running car.  \n\nA few months later I had my brakes changed at a Just Brakes who told me my brakes were going to fail and that I needed to do an extra $350 worth of repair to be safe.  I called Central Car Care, explained the situation, and told them I was nervous about the safety of my car but thought I was getting scammed.\n\nThey told me to bring my car down and they inspected it for free.  They told me my car was safe and didn't need the work that was suggested.  I offered to pay for their time, but they told me to just bring in my car when it needed repairs and my continued business would be thanks enough.\n\nI don't think I've ever been to a mechanic before that said I didn't need suggested work done.

Most recently, I brought my car in because it was having problems starting. Sun Devil Auto said I had a bad starter and needed a new serpentine belt along with it. A $500.00 repair. George told me the truth. It was a dying battery and my serpentine belt still had several months left on it. I left happily in less than an hour and only spent about $100.00.
