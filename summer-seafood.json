The bread they served with the apps was fresh baked (I believe sourdough) and it was quite tasty along with the whipped butter. Our entrees came with house salads - had great elements, but I felt I couldn't enjoy mine because the dressing given was a poppyseed vinagrette and I can't handle too much acidity in my food these days. My fiance however cleaned his salad plate (not a sentence I utter often).\nENTREES: I had one of the specials, Grilled Shrimp and Scallops with roasted summer vegetables and tomato vinagrette (which I asked for on the side). The seafood part was great - the vegetables were so-so. My fiance had the special of Cod stuffed with Lobster (and some other seafood) with asparagus and a lemony sauce - I had a taste of his and it was really yummy, I'll def order that next time! We both finished our plates, which wasn't too challenging b/c the portions were moderate (I got 3  srhimp and 3 scallops for example) but still filling.\nDESSERT: Didn't order any\nSERVICE: Friendly, though a little sparse. After we finished our meals we felt like we were waiting around for awhile before we could ask for our check.

Combination of a few fresher tasting pieces, some rubbery pieces, and some dry pieces that literally could have been any fish. I skipped the fries, which didn't look all that great on hubby's plate and there was the tiniest container of coleslaw ever as a side that was actually pretty good.

I mean it, the best clam chowder by far I have ever had! So at this point we were confused. So I got an Italian style pizza with spicy sausage which, I have to say wasn't bad. The sausage had a kick and it was a crispy crust. The sauce lacked a little, prob just tomatoes. My husband got their famous hot lobster roll and, just like everything else, was enormous and it was pretty good.

The service was fine although we had to ask for food menus. Maybe the bartender figured that if we wanted food we would have gotten a table.  I got the lobster roll and was really disappointed. It looked good and was on a huge hunk of Mancini's bread cut about ninety percent of the way through to make a roll, but the lobster itself was tough, rubbery, and overcooked. All I could taste was the garlic butter. Granted I'm a little spoiled because I once lived in New England, but a seafood restaurant should know how to cook lobster so that it isn't flavorless and chewy.

But, 7 servers were all standing at the entrance talking because almost all of the tables were empty.\n\nWe moved to a different section in the shade...still no offer for drinks so we had to get them from the bar.  Their only happy hour special was the 5 Miller Lites for $15 and other domestics started at $4.50 per bottle.\n\nWe got the pound of eat and peel shrimp as an appetizer to share - the shrimp was good and had some type of seasoning on it.\n\nService was slow and inattentive all night.  The server was polite and made recommendations from the menu for us, but he was not around very much.\n\nFood-Wise, we tried a lot of things from menu.\n\nI started with the Redfin Bisque.  Described as having crab, lobster and shrimp.  The flavor was not bad, but it was just broth with 1 tiny shrimp.  No crab or lobster.\n\nSeared Ahi Tuna Sandwich - 2 people in our group got this.  It is supposed to be served rare - both were completely overcooked at medium-well.  \n\nShrimp and Crab Pizza - 1 couple shared this (for $21) and left half of it there.  It was completely soggy to where the crust just tore off from the rest of the slice.\n\nFish Tacos - 2 people in our party got these.  Good portion sizes, but it was served with a 'lime' sauce that was overpoweringly sweet - it was compared to the flavor of icing from a cake.  The flavors on different dishes just clashed instead of complimenting each other.\n\nLong story short, we won't be back.  Overpriced beer and overpriced, bad food.

We were downtown early for a dance lesson and were looking to kill some time eating dinner.  After entering Market Square we looked at our choices and chose the Oyster House after noting its shaded outdoor seating.  With our decision made, we walked into the Oyster House to get some menus.  The inside of the place consists of a large bar on one side and a line of tables on the other side.  Each table already has on it some hot sauce as well as some vinegar with hot peppers soaking in it.  Soon after we entered we asked the bartender if we could sit outside.  She said yes while giving us some menus and letting us know that the closer we sat to the door, the better service we would have.  With that we headed out the door and sat down in the only shady spot further away from the door.  I did notice that there were two different servers waiting on people outside and figure that was what the bartender was referring to.\n\nAfter a little bit longer of a wait than I would have liked (and wishing we were sitting closer to the door), we were waited on and I ended up ordering the titanic platter while my fiance went with the crab cakes.  My titanic platter consisted of the monster fish sandwich and 2 sides for which I chose the Pittsburgh cut ribbon taters and then I upgraded my second one to the New England clam chowder.  After only a short time both of the clam chowders came out of the kitchen.  It ended up being surprisingly good with a nice creaminess to it and what I think was fish in addition to the clams.  My fish sandwich was also pretty good as the two filets had a nicely cooked thin coating that was crunchy.  The Pittsburgh cut ribbon taters were also a slight disappointment as they were merely potato chips.  I guess I probably should have asked about them instead of just ordering them.  Finally I was also able to taste my fiances Maryland style crab cakes which I did not  think were good at all.  There was not a hint of old bay in them and it had a distinct mayonnaise taste to it.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I might be back here in the future.  It's never going to be my fish pick of a restaurant in Market Square but I did really enjoy the fried fish and see myself eating here from time to time.", "business_id": "-KQ283hJkBO12u8XOrlCcQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-08-31", "type": "review"}

Can we get extra onions with that?\n\nWe decided to give the lunch buffet a try, and arrived around 11:30 am. Sign on the door said hours were 11 am to whatever, but we got there to find the doors still locked.  I walked around the corner to see a studly guy standing outside the back door smoking, and asked if they were open. He looked at me surprised, and said he'd be right there. He came and unlocked the front doors, and in we went, past the muscle man with the cool brown eyes.\n\nWe were the first to arrive, and as I looked around the room(s) and I have to say it was kind of charming in that 1970's Soprano's kind of way. Like a mom and pop Italian place you'd expect to find somewhere in Jersey.  This is kind of living proof that Pittsburgh is indeed stuck in 1979, but in this case, in a GOOD way. There's even a baby grand piano just inside the front doors.\n\nWe did not order from the menu, as I said, we went to try the lunch buffet and I have to say, we were impressed.\n\nIt is not a large buffet, quite small in fact, but ample for only $7.95.  It basically contains a chafing dish of appetizers (this day had Clams Casino, some kind of fried mashed potato balls and fried zucchini), another with a pasta dish (tomato vodka today with fresh basil - VERY delicious), two meats (something like a beef brisket in one and the other a chicken cacciatore - the beef was excellent, as was the chicken), a small selection of salads (pasta, tossed, slaw and a bowl of beets), a tray of bread and rolls, and two different cakes for dessert.\n\nNow, even though we were the first to arrive, meaning early and the food was fresh, the chef and his trainee kept attending to the hot foods, showing sincere concern that it all stay fresh...and it did the entire time we were there. \n\nThe waitress was a very pretty 'woman' as opposed to the usual college student, and was extremely nice and helpful. The muscle man was apparently the bartender - ok - you can stand there and look pretty as long as you like.\n\nThey carried Pepsi products, so we ordered fresh brewed tea instead, and it was fine.\n\nTotal bill for two for a very satisfying lunch buffet was $20 and some change, very pleasant service AND eye candy, and a quaint trip down 'Scenes From An Italian Restaurant' meets 'Soprano's' memory lane.  \n\nI can't speak for dinner (yet) but if the food is as good, skip the pretentious Bistroids, and barking manager of Del's, and the potential gunfire from Pleasure Bar...and give them a shot. And DEFINITELY drop by for a super inexpensive and pleasant lunch if you happen to find yourself in the Bloomfield neighborhood.", "business_id": "YTqSkgOiiI9HG3hNH7ovfg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-07-11", "type": "review"}

Actually getting to the restaurant was difficult, at least for me, and I am pretty familiar with Uptown Charlotte.  Every turn that I needed to take was forbidden by either \"no left turn\" or \"no right turn\" signs.  I had to end up going several blocks out of my way and ultimately doing an illegal turn to get to the restaurant.\n\nFinding parking is sort of difficult, as well.  From what I understand, Valet parking does not start until 6:00pm and I got to the restaurant at about 5:30pm.  I would recommend parking in the garage for the office building next door to the restaurant.  Capital Grille will validate your parking if you park there.\n\nThe food is very good, but also fairly expensive.  I had 8 people in my group and our total bill was right at $1,100.00 including tip.  This did include two bottles of mid-priced wine, though.  I had the 10 oz. Filet Mignon and it was very good.  As far as sides, I would recommend the Lobster Macaroni and Cheese and Au Gratin Potatoes.  We also got the seafood appetizer platter and it was decent, but nothing to write home about.

It was our first time at Capital Grille and I was so impressed with the ambiance of the restuarant. It looked like there were enough \"suits\" in the place to write a check to clear the federal deficit, but I liked that. The decor had an old world feel blended with a wall street vigor. The hostess was gracious and we were seated immediately and noticed the restaurant was quite busy for a Wednesday night. \n\nAlissa explained the chef features for the night and we agreed to try it. We received complimentary champagne and I ordered the smoked salmon as an appetizer. It was a good portion and was served with aioli, capers, chopped onions, and crisp pita triangles. I enjoyed it immensely as smoked salmon is one of my favorites. The hubs ordered a salad, and we ordered the lobster mac-n-cheese and truffle fries for our son, the Gabe-meister (I kept theifing the lobster out of the mac-n-cheese it was soooo good) and the truffle fries were amazing, it had this parmasen flavor to it. I do not eat red meat regularly but wanted to try the feature 4 oz filet medallion at medium with a fennel based sauce. The hubs opted for the 12 oz. filet mignon at medium rare with crab (out of the shell) in butter sauce. Needless to say we enjoyed the meal and left completely satisfied and impressed with Capital Grille. The food was great but it was the service that really impressed, two managers came by and wished me a happy birthday and checked on us to see if everything was ok. VERY NICE TOUCH! :-)\n\nFor dessert, we brought our favorite cheesecake creme  iced cake from Harris Teeter, and yes the restaurant was fine with it. We shared cake with Alissa and she enjoyed it as well.\n\nAll-in-all, the Capital Grille has managed to produce quality, flavourful food and white glove service as a chain restaurant.

Your dining room is very nice and your staff so very polite and accommodating as saints.\n\nI'll echo what Adam R. said and say that steakhouses are not usually my dining preference when choosing a place to eat at but I had really enjoyed the good eats at the Capital Grille Generous Pour event recently I decided to give it a shot. Warmly greeted at the door and reservations confirmed even though we had arrived a bit earlier than expected, their hospitality is as good as ever. The problem is I didn't exactly enjoy my meal as much as I would have hoped even though I still had a good time surrounded by friends and family.\n\nAppetizers came out in a very timely manner once menu choices were made. I chose clam chowder based on a recommendation. Well it wasn't amazing but it wasn't bad either, a well made clam chowder is one of my favorite things to eat so this was a bit of a let down. My entree a Kona crusted dry aged sirloin was perfectly cooked and served with a nice composite shallot butter how old school! The only problem is that they didn't cook all the steaks as well as mine. One person had ordered a medium steak and it came out well done and extremely charred (It was comped when she mentioned it and the waiter and manager were very sorry and concerned about this so I'll have to thumbs up them for handling a situation so graciously). The shallot butter though didn't really add anything to the dish for me and the steak wasn't so flavorful that it could stand on it's own. The best part of the meal? Dessert! But not my dessert, I was talked up on the ice cream and decided to order it instead of creme brulee. Well that was a major mistake on my part. My whole meal had been heavy and if I had went with sorbet I might have been able to finish it, but I decided on ice cream. Peanut butter, chocolate, and vanilla ice cream was just too much to handle for me and I called it quits after a spoonful of each. The creme brulee was still as addictive as ever from what I tried on someone's plate though!\n\nI would go back here just for the service alone.

Reposting here...\n\nEvery once in a while, you have an experience at a restaurant that's so lovely, you know you'll remember it for years. The meal we ate at the Capital Grille this week doubtlessly falls into this category.\n\nI know that Capital Grille is a chain, and an expensive chain as well. I'm not usually super excited about corporate steakhouses (Ruth's Chris: meh), and I usually wouldn't have chosen one for a Restaurant Week outing. However, Capital Grille treated us so well during the Yelp Generous Pour event, we decided to return. I'm glad we did: the food and the service were both amazing.\n\nI'll talk about the food first. Their Restaurant Week menu is not very varied: they offer three steak entrees and one salmon dish. However, I don't see that as a downside, since if you're looking for something lighter and/or vegetarian, you're not going to go to a steakhouse, anyways. For my entree, I ordered the Kona-encrusted sirloin with shallot butter.. oh my. This was a good steak, folks: tremendous flavor and perfectly cooked. I've learned that this steak is on their regular menu as well. This could be bad for my credit card. The appetizer of clam chowder was good, if not exceptional. My dessert of creme brulee was delicious. Nevertheless, it was all overshadowed by that steak.\n\nOk, now let's talk about the service. Yes, my steak was amazing, but you can get an amazing steak at other venues. What really set this night apart was the level of service we received. Even though it was Restaurant week, and even though we had nibbled and sipped for free the weekend before, we were treated as well as they could have treated any bank executive or local politician. Our waiter, James, was unobtrusively attentive and poured us multiple glasses of wine on the house. The manager checked in on us and shook our hands on the way out. I've never been treated better in a restaurant, especially when eating a meal at such a considerable discount.\n\nIn case you can't tell from the above, we really had a fantastic evening.

It's rare I feel like I've been \"wowed\" when I go out, but The Captial Grille had that effect and they did so in a way that seemed effortless and second-nature.\n\nWe were lured in after the recent Elite event (and actually made our dinner reservations within an hour of the event). The ambiance is exquisite without being extravagant, with many formal-looking portraits, iron, and a wealth of masculine darkly-stained wood.\n\nThe kitchen was spot-on during our visit - not a single thing came to the table that wasn't outstanding. We both started with the bacon clam chowder - smokey and rich. My entree was the filet Mignon, a timeless classic (and a personal favorite). I ordered mine medium rare: my first experience in Charlotte where my steak was brought to me a true medium rare. It's a tender cut that the chefs worked wonders with. A had the dry-aged Kona crusted sirloin - his was equally amazing with explosive flavors. Dessert brought chocolate espresso flour-less cake. Exceptionally rich and decadent - the perfect end to the meal.\n\nAs an experienced oenophile, I am in heaven at The Capital Grille. The wine selection has no comparison in the area - many, many phenomenal producers represented from around the globe, a survey of the best-of-the-best in wine. We mentioned we had attended for the summer Generous Pour event earlier and paid for it again tonight. This time, though, the server turned it into a guessing game: we'd order one, he'd bring two, seeing if we could identify the mystery wine from the list he recommended with our food. \n\nSpeaking of the service, TCG is in a league of their own in the area. The staff, who had or reservation, greeted us by name at the door and at our table. The manager recognized us from the week before and made it a point to stop by and welcome us and to wish us well at the end of the evening. Down to the very smallest detail of folding your napkin if you need to leave the table during your meal, this team embodies every stellar trait of the service industry.\n\nWhile The Captial Grille is not in the budget for a regular meal (yet), they are now my first choice for a venue to celebrate and to show off everything Charlotte has to offer.", "business_id": "CChwRoYVXA3QZulS8a6xOQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-08-08", "type": "review"}

I thought is would be a very nice meal and someplace I had not taken them before.  Eating in the best restaurants in town and when we travel is not unusual.  The food was very hit-and-miss and so was the service.  \n\nLet's start with the food.  We ordered two appetizers for the table that were not part of restaurant week.  The Calamari and the Mozzarella wrapped cheese.  The calamari was excellent and cooked perfectly.  The Mozzarella was good but not the tastiest or smoothest mozzarella I have eaten.  Both were worthy.  For the first course, my oldest son had the clam chowder which he enjoyed.  The rest of us ordered the mixed field greens salad which was awful.  I have had a better side salad at Wendy's.  It was totally tasteless and un-inspired.  None of us even finished half the portion.  When the waiters helper asked if we were done, we told him to please take them away and how horrible they were.  The three men had the filet for our main course.  It was a very middle of the road filet.  I am not sure if they lowered their quality for restaurant week but it tasted no better than an Outback Steak.  Even my 15 year old recognized the poor quality of meat.  My wife had the Salmon which was better than the filet but nothing exciting.  She only ate half the portion and it was not worth packing up to take home.  The mashed potato side was amazing and the creamed spinach side was average.  The creme brulee and flourless chocolate cake for desert were both amazing.  I would recommend just hitting the bar for these late night after a show.  \n\nThe service was also only marginal.  A big let down compared to the service received at lunch.  The waiter reached across the table versus walking around, and he plated the food close but not just right so you had to re-arrange the positioning of every dish before eating it.  The atmosphere is beautiful.  I would return for a business lunch but don't waste your time or money on dinner or taking someone you want to impress.", "business_id": "CChwRoYVXA3QZulS8a6xOQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-07-29", "type": "review"}

The service here is impeccable and done mostly with a smile. My waiter was a bit too serious for his own good but everyone else was lovely.  \n\nFood wise, oh my, my, MY! Yum! I had the 14 oz. Bone-In Kona Crusted Dry Aged Sirloin - with shallot butter, which was far more steak then I'd normally ever have in one sitting but wow! It was so good I couldn't even leave a bite left on my plate. Cooked to perfection the meat with sharper taste of the shallot butter just melted in my mouth. It cames with the Sam's Mashed Potatoes & Fresh Creamed Spinach.  The potatoes were really tasty but the spinach I could've done without. This is easily enough food for two!\n\nOrdered a Stoli Doli to go with my meal. It's the signature drink at Capital Grille and definitely worth having more than once. \n\nAnd the Flourless Chocolate Espresso Cake! Oh the cake... If people could live without sex by eating this cake, they'd be fat on flavor and taste of this amazing cake. By far one of the best flourless cakes I've ever had, rich in flavor, with the consistency of fudge.", "business_id": "CChwRoYVXA3QZulS8a6xOQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-08-17", "type": "review"}

They chose a very romantic table setting and the service was terrific.  The waiter was a little overly friendly and was a bit uncomfortable toward the end of the meal.\nThe setting, environment, and welcoming staff were the highlights.  For the price I felt the food could have been better.  For starters we ordered mozzarella and tomato salad and the Caesar.  The salads were both chilled, crisp, and the vinegar and spice balance for the mozzarella was very good.\nFor the entrees we got the salmon and the special bleu cheese encrusted fillet with grilled shrimp.  The salmon was cooked perfectly, but lacking on seasoning.  Where they were short on flavor on the salmon they made up for on the shrimp.  They definitely weren't shy with the seasoning which left something to be desired for the surf of the turf.  The steak was cooked to perfection and was extremely tender.  The waiter had sold the bleu cheese as a cream base infused with pepper and garlic.  Unfortunately it was just a few morsels of blue cheese pressed into the top of the meat.  Still, a VERY good cut of steak.\nThe meal and a bottle of wine ran me $150 which for the service and ambience I believe is fair.

I had the chicken breast that  once i got to the bone it blood and under cook.  and to finish the even off they were out of the cheesecake, and some of the guest  got the flourless coco cake which had molded rasphberry on her plate. yikes . it almost went in her mouth.

However, I am pretty sure everything switched once we said we were there for Queens Feast.  The server had been so polite and accomidating up until the point of our decision to order from the Queen's Feast.  After that moment I don't think we saw him the rest of the night, not even to bring us our food.  Seriously!  You may think I am kidding but I'm not!\n\nHe brought us bread with literally only 2 small rolls in the basket.  We had bread envy because we could see all the other tables with with bountiful bread baskets!  We figured it was because there was only two of us but the other tables only had two people as well but they had way more!  Well, we ended up asking for more bread and he never brought it.  We asked the other gentleman that was supposed to be assisting with our table as well and he brought it about 15 minutes later.  \n\nOur glasses of water were empty the majority of our time there.\nWe both ordered Filet Mignon which was very tasty.  It was warm, not hot when it came out but still very tender and nicely flavored.  We both ordered it medium rare and it was cooked perfectly.  Two sides came with our meal and I think they were supposed to be family style but they were really what you would see if they were served on an individual plate.  The mashed potatoes were sticky/gummy and lukewarm.  They were served in the smallest family style portion I have ever seen.  Unless it was a small family of ants, I would say we got screwed on the potatoes.  The string beans were cold and hard (undercooked) and inedible.  Didn't touch them.\n\nThe desserts were decent.  The flourless chocolate cake was so rich it was unbearable.  It was the dark bitter chocolate flavor that just wasn't very good.  The small bite of cheesecake was good though.  Just....small.\n\nOverall, I would say this experience was subpar, especially for the reputation of the restaurant.  Why does service and quality AND quantity have to suffer because it is restaurant week?  They did all seem overly busy so I understand that everything isn't going to be perfect but we didn't even see our waiter the rest of the evening until he flung our check at us.

All the wines are on a tablet, which was really neat cause you could easily scroll through the bottles and filter. We ended up settling on a Zin/Shiraz blend. It was absolutely delish....I wish I got the name of it!\n\nSince we were dining for restaurant week ($35 per person), the menu was limited. However, I would love to return cause I heard their lobster mac was fantastic! I decided on the clam chowder, 8oz filet mignon, and chocolate flourless espresso cake. My husband picked the wedge salad, ribeye (i think it was crazy big like 14 oz) and chocolate flourless cake. \n\nUnfortunately, the clam chowder wasn't anything special. I have a huge love for chowders and this one simply didnt do anythign for me. I took a bite of my husbands salad and it was very good. Our steaks came out next. They were cooked absolutely perfectly! The filet mignon literally melted in my mouth. My husbands steak was seasoned so well. This is definitely where Capital Grille shined! The shared potatoes that came with it were perfect. Additionally, the meal came with shared green beans. I thought the green beans weren't cooked enough, but that is just a personal preference. The taste was excellent though. Lastly, the desserts. Oh my gosh, rasberries, cream, and the fudge like cake. Perfection. That dessert was spot on!\n\nThere was one small incident that I wasn't super thrilled with how it was handled. The waiter brought over our steaks and sides. In the few seconds it took me to grab my fork and knife and almost cut into my steak, my husband (and at the same time, the waiter) realized he brought over the wrong steaks. Like, our entire order was for a different table. Literally, not a big deal at all. Misstakes happen. However, without even an apology he grabbed all the plates, including the veggie sides (that come with all restaurant week meals!) and cleared our table. It was just awkward cause he made something that wasnt a big deal into a scene. Our neighbors sitting beside us literally leaned over and said they couldnt believe he did that and took the sides off the table too. Additionally, I would never complain about this, but the new steak I got was definitely not as nice looking or as large of a cut (not that it completely mattered cause I didnt even eat all my steak anyways) as the one that was accidentally served to me. Felt like I got the reject one! However, it was delicious and we just moved on.", "business_id": "CChwRoYVXA3QZulS8a6xOQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-07-28", "type": "review"}

I ordered a wedge salad with bleu cheese and Bacon (delish) after toying with the idea of lobster bisque. Although I intended to eat steak, the seafood options on the menu looked amazing. I convinced my husband to order blackened mahi mahi and I ordered a petit filet with the intent of creating our own surf and turf plate. We also ordered mushrooms as a side. Wow. Highly recommend. I must say that the only part of the meal that was less than spectacular was the steak! It was not seasoned at all. Nothing special. Next time I am craving a steak I will certainly head to Del Friscos.  Overall a nice experience but I'm not sure I'll be heading back anytime soon.", "business_id": "1gKBusJMk66ypwEKF0vOAA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-08-29", "type": "review"}

I think I'm sold that Palm is my favorite Steakhouse in Charlotte.  Basically, I like most all of the high end joints so, it's a close race but after my second Palm visit, I have to give it up to them.  \n\nMy wife and I took her parents and her sister there last night as one of her dad's birthday presents.  Everyone was very happy with all they ate.  Detail wise, I'll stick to just my meal for this review.  Took advantage of one of the summer specials and went with the Filet and Lobster tail.  This also came with a choice of a starter and a side and yes, of course I super-sized the steak and tail once I found out I could!\n\nFor the starter I had the lobster bisque which was poured table side.  It was hot, creamy and delicious although it did require the addition of a tad bit of salt at the table.  The steak came cooked to a perfect medium-rare with a great crust on it and the lobster tail was as big as my head and very moist and flavorful.  Had the three cheese potatoes au gratin for the side.  It was cheesy and good though it also benefited from a wee bit of table-side salt.\n\nService was once again friendly and impeccable and they are very accommodating to various special requests.\n\nCan't wait to go back next time!", "business_id": "1gKBusJMk66ypwEKF0vOAA", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-08-08", "type": "review"}

Their pricing was average for a steakhouse but a little bit high for the environment and service. \n\nTip: the last reservation/seating they take is 8 pm.

Palm is the kind of place where that deal is worth it. The service was fine, although our server was a bit of the anxious type. I started with the mixed green salad, which was completely unmemorable. I say this because I literally had to go to the restaurant's website to figure out what the heck I ate for the first course. Apparently the mixed green salad. I vaguely remember the baby tomatoes.\n\nHowever, we also had some sides as appetizers, which were truly phenomenal. The green beens were all oiled up with chunks of bacon in them. Wow. And the mashed potatoes were garlicky and very delicious.\n\nFor my second course, I had filet mignon medallions, which were also very good. I ordered them medium rare, and although the meat didn't quite \"melt\" with my knife like I wanted it to (perhaps due to the smaller size of the medallions), they were still quite tasty.\n\nApparently the Palm is known for its cheesecake, and I ordered that for dessert. Quite frankly, I'm used to every steak house having some sort of cheesecake, and they are all more or less good. But no. The Palm's cheesecake truly takes the cheesecake. It's HUGE and LOADED with sugar and a bunch of sweet fruit sauces are DUMPED ALL OVER IT. It was the best cheesecake I've eaten in years, possibly ever. I can't say for sure it was the best every, since clearly my memory is suspect, due to the fact that my memory of that mixed greens salad remains a little hazy...\n\nEverything was washed down with two \"Strawberry Fields\" a sweet rum drink.

I went for Summer Queen's Feast and I highly recommend it.\n\nMy plan all along was to have an All-American steak house meal. I started with the Caesar salad, which is not something I normally order, but I was pleased with the result. The romaine was crisp and sturdy, which showed that The Palm was not skimping on freshness or flavor just because it was restaurant week. There was a generous amount of cheese and croutons, which I am a huge fan of, and the Caesar dressing was creamy and slightly acidic and didn't drown my lettuce.\n\nFor my main I went with the obvious choice and ordered the twin tenderloin filet medallions. My steak hit the spot; it was perfectly rare in the middle, and had shallot butter generously melted on top (with some crispy onions as well). I love it when chefs have an in depth knowledge of meat temperatures (just talking about it is getting me excited) and whoever cooked my steak at The Palm definitely knew what they were doing. \n\nThe one downside about the restaurant week menu was that it did not include a side dish with our main courses; but for only $3 a person, we ordered a family style side of Brussels sprouts, which were almost as amazing as my steak. The Brussels sprouts were bathed in a delicious lemon brown butter; and the tanginess of the lemon, coupled with richness of the brown butter, perfectly offset the Brussels sprouts natural funkiness (or should we say bitterness? Sour taste?). I would eat those over and over again.\n\nTo complete my three course meal, I ended with the classic New York cheesecake (but stole a taste of my friend's Key Lime Pie, because I was having such a hard time deciding). The cheesecake was good; it was creamy, light (sometimes cheesecakes can turn dense), and not too sweet. But after a sort of heavy, on heavy, on heavy meal, I wasn't able to finish it all (it still made a great snack the next afternoon).\n\nRead the full review here: http://offtheeatenpathblog.com/2013/08/15/the-palm/", "business_id": "1gKBusJMk66ypwEKF0vOAA", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-08-25", "type": "review"}

But to my associates, apparently it was great considering they didn't say two words during this course. \n\nOn to our mains - as a west coaster, generally 4pm is not my dinnertime so I went light: the Gazpacho was slightly spicy, flavorful and the dollop of creme freche was the perfect topper. Unfortunately my second course, a melon salad with some sort of duck bacon didn't make the grade. Boring, blech, nothing impressive.

We had a table in the middle of the dining room.  I love the look and decor of Upstream (especially the ceiling!) so this felt very cozy.  The only disturbing thing about it was the noise level.  There's no wall between the cozy dimly lit dining room and the loud blaring kitchen.  I understand (and enjoy!) the concept of \"open kitchen\" dining, but I think that should be reserved for different types of restaurants.  The open kitchen didn't feel right for an upscale seafood restaurant that can/should be used for special occasions and dates.  \n\nAnyway, we had fantastic service.  Just be prepared to enjoy an hour and a half relaxing meal.  To start, we tried the bento box appetizer, which was a combination of different things (sashimi, sushi, beef, eggroll), but I think next time I would go with just a couple of sushi rolls.  We also splurged and added the flash-fried calamari as it sounded so good when our server was describing it to us.  And she was right.  It was very tasty and not at all chewy. It also didn't include the baby squids with attached tentacles that you might normally find in calamari dishes.  The only disappointing thing was the portion size.  Good thing we got the bento box, too!\n\nI ordered the sea scallops for my entree and chose the Japanese ponzu sauce (there are 5 choices!) to go with it.  The three tennis ball-sized scallops had a LOT of flavor to them and the fingerling potatoes on the side were tasty, too.  Again, though, the portion was pretty small, but with all things added up, we were full by the end of our meal.  \n\nAll in all, we had a very enjoyable experience, but I can't say that when thinking of places to go in the future, I'd return anytime soon.  There are so many other options out there and Upstream didn't \"wow\" us enough to return time and time again.", "business_id": "BOp3jcpYy31M85H1DLnEEw", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-08-24", "type": "review"}

I was disappointed.  While the fish was good, the rolls and how they were prepared was sloppy and generally, didn't really add anything to the experience.  It's expensive to boot!

At the time, and several times after that, Upstream was on my top 5 list.  Now, I'm not so sure I want to pay the money for their inconsistencies. \n\nHere are my notes. \n\n1. Bento Box is the way to go because the preparations are always different and feature a nice variety of creative, well executed dishes.  It comes in a wooden 4 square box.  Items like a jasmine rice with shitake mushrooms, lemongrass scented jasmine rice, or seared tuna with sesame seeds and an Asian slaw. Cucumber salad.  The only warning: when the bento is on the menu at night for dinner, there is no price.  ASK THE PRICE FIRST! Don't quote me, but I'm pretty sure my bento one night was pushing $30 if not $40. \n\n2. The salads are nicely composed.  During the fall, there's a yummy bibb and pear salad with dried cherries I adored, and this summer there is this mixed greens with toasted pistachios and blueberries and poppy seed dressing. I HIGHLY recommend getting either salad with the fried oysters.  But here is where consistency starts to slip. I've had salad here probably 5 or 6 times.  Half of those times, the fried oysters have been under fried, and the batter is a bit pale and the oysters feel limp and taste a bit batter-like.  Once the salad was DRENCHED with dressing, so I ask for it on the side. \n\n3. The mussels are OK. They're not particularly plump.  (They're like the one's at George's Brasserie, not very memorable.) \n\n4. Sushi.  I think sushi is best had at a Japanese restaurant, or where sushi is the star. That's all.  Not standout, and a bit too rice-y. \n\n5. The dessert is downright terrible. I know dessert/pastry is a whole other animal, but honestly, if you have a nice a restaurant as Upstream, get a pastry chef to match. (*Totally agree with reviewer Stephanie in that they may not even HAVE a pastry chef.) \n\nMy friends and I had the trio of sorbets/gelato.  They were all icy in consistency and not smooth at all.  The blueberry tart (or I think it was a blueberry tart) featured a HARD crust/shell exterior.  It was bland, and I believe the dough must have been over kneaded.  We brought this to the attention of our server who looked dumbfounded, and answered \"Really?\".  Yes, really.  I'm willing to bet anyone who tries these desserts wouldn't like them.  As a result, these were taken off our bill. \n\nIn the end, I do think it's a nicely presented restaurant, with very good service for the most part.  If the food can be prepared the same way every time, and the desserts be brought up to a level that matches the upscale food, I'd be more inclined to bring back another 2 stars.  But unfortunately, instead of suggesting it as a place for my friends and I to have dinner, there are plenty of other restaurants we pick first.", "business_id": "BOp3jcpYy31M85H1DLnEEw", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-08-14", "type": "review"}

When we arrived, there were plenty of open tables and no one waiting. We were seated right away...and then waited for at least 5 minutes with servers constantly walking by before anyone stopped to take our drink order. Then, after the first server came by and explained the concept, four or five servers came over and tried to do the same. This was really the only misstep for us. \n\nWe ordered several items off the brunch tapas menu - egg benedict, steak & egg, waffle, pecan crusted trout, and the french toast. They were all good. Then we made our way to the buffet area. The highlights for me where the shrimp and grits, macaroni & cheese, cod, sushi, fruit/cheese, and mussels & clams.

And our server was great, he flawlessly waited on our party of seven's need with just the right balance of attentiveness and subtlety.\n\nFor our group, our server suggested two \"tower\" appetizers: (4) spicy shrimp lettuce wraps, sweet and sour fried calamari, and 3 crab cakes. We also ordered a variety of local beers and a dozen raw oysters (half east coast, half west coast). I don't care much for beer or oysters to judge (I suck), but the rest of the party raved about both. However, the \"tower\" appetizers were fantastic! Although the calamari wasn't my favorite, I LOVED the wraps, reminiscent of bang bang shrimp in perfect little iceberg lettuce boats and topped with a deliciously sweet-spicy fruit salsa (I ate two, everyone else only got one). The calamari was okay, but the crab cakes were wonderful - very little if any fillers, I just tasted pure, delicate crab with a light, barely-there crispy crust.\n\nOur entrees varied. Most of the selections have an Asian fusion, which isn't bad but I might have liked to seen a little more flavor diversity. I was craving scallops and ordered the Pan Seared Scallops. The three  scallops were some of the plumpest, most succulent and perfectly cooked that I have ever had. However, at the risk of sounding like a complete country bumpkin, the rest of the dish was a complete and disappointing disaster that utterly failed the perfect scallops. Weird, twiggy rijad's mushrooms and way too many of them (TWO piles of those things, posed at opposite ends of the plate like mini pyres waiting to be lit). They were freaky, weird, dry and wholly unappetizing. I didn't like any of the sides or accoutrement (English peas, white asparagus, beet vinaigrette or fennel pur\u00e9e) - they seemed almost a tongue-in-cheek mockery of fancy foods...except the dish was meant to be taken in all seriousness. So, despite the fabulous scallops, so not worth the price.\n\nThe rest of the group loved their entrees, varying from huge and flavorful sushi rolls (I sampled a few and they were delicious; I wish I would have ordered sushi instead), to buttery, saucy whitefish dinners. We were too stuffed for dessert, but I and another guy had cappuccinos, which were delicious and speckled with freshly grated nutmeg.\n\nThe final bill was high (trust this country bumpkin when she says this place ain't cheap), but not unreasonable for most of what we ordered, and the service was impeccable. However, if I ever make it this way again to Charlotte, I would definitely get a sushi roll and an appetizer, which would make a very reasonable-priced and filling dinner.", "business_id": "BOp3jcpYy31M85H1DLnEEw", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-06-12", "type": "review"}

And I am torn about how many stars I should give. Here is the thing, the service wasn't great, but as crazy as it sounds, it was the best bad service I ever had.\n\nRSVP for 2 at 7:45pm, my friend and I arrived on time (gasp!). Hostess said there's a booth for us, but then she changed her observation (to no booth). We offered to wait in the bar area if that's easier, but she pretty much told us they've been behind on schedule and best for us to not miss a table when one is available. We stood around for a few minutes awkwardly (my friend was desperately needing a drink apparently), and finally we got sat in the 1st side room on the left, at a 4-top (with only 2 chairs) toward the back, next to a party of 10.\n\nWater person (what's the PC term for water boy?) came and filled our glasses. And that was as much action as we received for 10+ minutes. It's starting to bring back the memory of my Fahrenheit nightmare. Ironically I'm with the same friend! I think he and I and fine dining just don't belong together. Meanwhile the 2 waiters assigned to tables around us just came and gone and never even batted an eye at us. I finally waved down the water person and softly asked him \"who's our waiter?\" \n\nMy simple question led to an array of apologies. Manager showed up and offered us drinks and brought us menu. We got assigned a waiter, we placed an order of the chef's choice half dozen oysters and the night slowly proceeded. By slowly, I meant we didn't finally leave the restaurant until 10 to 10pm. Thank goodness the 2 of us have known each other for years, and had plenty to chat about. It would have killed any potential if it was a 1st date situation. Imagine the silence...\n\nFood wise the RW menu was solid. There are plenty of options (and not just salad). Essentially the entire menu was up for grab, some involves up-charge. I personally was perfectly fine with my seafood soup (it's not very curry, don't let the name scares you), my 1-lb lobster (split in half, and amazingly they left all the brainy gooey goodness for me to tear into, though some may argue the meat itself was a little overcooked) and creme brulee. It definitely worths the $30. My friend had the NC shrimp salad (huge portion, not sure if I liked the dressing, but it's whole shrimps on greens), seared tuna over rice cake (definitely digging the rice cake), and flourless chocolate tart and ice cream. Tuna has a small up-charge (I'm thinking $6).\n\nAt the end, they pretty much comp everything but our dinner. 2 managers have repeatedly apologized for the service. I couldn't even be mad at anyone. I guess if I'm to have bad service, it's best when they owe up to it and try hard to make up for it without me even having to ask. We didn't expect them to comp ALL the drinks (I only had 2 glasses of wine, but my friend went all out on his double vodka tonic). We made it up on tip because it's not our server's fault.\n\nSo at the end, it was a good night and a great dinner. I decided that 4-star is deserving given the circumstance. \n\nFood - 4\nValue - 5 (for Restaurant Week)\nService - 2\nAfford - 5 (lol)", "business_id": "BOp3jcpYy31M85H1DLnEEw", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-07-25", "type": "review"}

I understood that tail and claw meat was good, but I was unsure of what to eat in the middle. She told me that a real New Englander would eat the green stuff, which are eggs apparently. I tried them, but got a little too squeamish. I would have preferred to crack my own claws or at least get the claw-cracking utensil, as one of my claws couldn't be opened the rest of the way with my hands, but whatever. The lobster was okay.

The menu is seafood heavy and we wound up ordering calamari and mussels to share. The tomato sauce for the mussels was some of the best that I have had in a long time. The calamari was good too, but nothing to get too excited about as it  was pretty standard calamari.\n\nFor entrees, we all chose a different fish option from tuna, bass, halibut and black grouper. I had the grouper and it was a great dish. The menu describes it as \"Tim Griner's Line caught NC Black Grouper\" and the fish was definitely fresh and cooked to perfection. It was accompanied with local field peas, sweet corn, wood oven roasted tomatoes, bacon and a ramp vinaigrette. I would definitely order this plate again, unless one of the other fish or specials was calling my name. Service was good and certainly better than I have had in the past here.

I absolutely love this place and everything on the menu.  When I was a kid the best times were when my father would take an afternoon delivery to the east side and swing by NOTO on the way back.  It was always such a great surprise when my sister and I would be called in for dinner, and right away you could smell those spices!  Those are some of my favorite memories, and to this day I get a rush of excitement just walking in to the place when I get that first waft...  It really is the best outside of the Gulf.\n\nI really can't even start on what my favorites are because every time I pick something off the menu it becomes my new favorite.  The po' boys are without exception great.  The roast beef was my first love, and I keep coming back to this one.  The French bread is perfect - crisp and the perfect texture for the sandwich.  It took me a while to try the fried oyster po' boy - I was not so adventurous as a kid - but after trying this I see why this is my mother's favorite.  The Gulf shrimp and the fried chicken are incredible.  This place is a 5 star easily on the strength of the po' boys alone, but the rest of the menu is not to be skipped.  The jambalaya is great for those that can't take too much heat, and even better with a bit of Tabasco for those that can.  The shrimp creole - HOO BOY!  Spicy but not excessive, it has enough heat to get you sweating and the flavors are spot on.  Same for the shrimp etouffee.  The red beans & rice with double sausage is my all-time favorite comfort food.  Most of the time I can't make up my mind, so I hit up the Mardi Gras combo, which gives you all three.  Perfection!  And it all comes with a piece of cornbread to finish it all off.  \n\nI've only been to the Fordem location, though there is another on Monroe Street.  I'm certain that had I not graduated prior to this location opening I would have made it a regular destination.  As it is, I love coming down Sherman then Fordem, and you're suddenly right there looking at the mural on the side of the building.  I call ahead whenever I plan to stop, but about half the time it is straight up impulse that brings me there.  No matter whatever else happens that day, it's always a good day if you've been to New Orleans Take Out.", "business_id": "cpGv6ES2hzPCtCUQgipwXw", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-06-27", "type": "review"}

I am (was) a huge fan of their Salmon New Orleans. It came with wild rice, broccoli, broiled salmon and shrimp covered in a tabasco butter sauce. I always got the sauce on the side because again, the add too much butter/oil. Since the dish is super easy to make, I decided to make it on my own with less butter. Viola!

Good lemonade (not too sweet) (2) and a can of soda (1.50) rounded out a filling and gratifying meal.

What can I write about Bahia San Carlos... well, let's start with it is \"off the hook\" delicious! I tell everyone I know that if they are going to Phoenix this should be the first stop. I order the Marinated Filet - their house specialty. Why? Well, because it is their house specialty! \n\nThe flavors in this dish are incredible. It is spicy (don't be a hater if you can't handle the heat) and is served on a bed of super hot french fries. I asked why once and was told that the french fries keep the fish hot while you eat it... they are right because it is wonderful. Rice and beans are top notch. Fresh tortillas (you choose corn or flour). Amazing. \n\nThe have incredible cerviche. All of their \"cocktail\" related items are delicious (not the \"sippy\" kind, the \"shrimpy\" kind) \n\nSomething to drink? It wasn't until I went with a friend that speaks Spanish at dinner time that I learned they serve Michelados. They basically pour the cerveza of your choice into a spicy, wonderful mixture of wonderfulness. When I took my first sip I remained tentative but then fell in love. Just when I thought it couldn't get any better! \n\nService is exceptional. They remember me even when I come back after a year. And, they always ask about a coworker who I used to come in with a few years ago. \n\nI don't say this about a lot of places but San Carlos Bay is on my top 10 spots in the world. Yes, it is a darn good piece of fish! DO NOT be fooled by the location or the look of this place. Just park behind and go on in.

Although he had eaten other things from their menu, he absolutely raved about the fried snapper whenever he had it. \n\nWell, last week I was in the area, with time to kill before a meeting downtown, and a pretty good appetite. I decided it was the perfect time to try San Carlos Bay's snapper for myself.\n\nI was welcomed to sit anywhere I pleased, and was very shortly brought chips, salsa, water and a menu. The salsa was on the hot side, but delicious with the fresh taco chips. I ordered the whole (head included) fried red snapper (small - you have a choice of small, medium or large) which came with refried beans, rice, and a lime.\n\nMy food arrived in a reasonable amount of time and looked wonderful. The fish was still piping hot, and had been scored on both sides to ensure even cooking. What I loved about the preparation was that I ended up with so much nice crispy fish! It came away from the bone easily and I only had to be careful about the tiny bones along the fins. \n\nMy fish was un-breaded, nicely seasoned, and perfectly cooked. The \"small\" fish was the perfect size for me, and left me completely full. I didn't add any hot sauce or salt, but enjoyed eating the hot salsa with it, along with juice from the lime. The refried beans were good too. I've never been a fan of that red Mexican rice. I tasted it, but left it alone after that.\n\nI completely enjoyed my meal, and also thought that it was appropriately priced.

The chips come with two different types of salsa.  A red salsa with a little bit of a bite and a green avocado salsa that is mild with just the right hint of avocado. \n\nI ordered the shrimp in garlic sauce and the dish was sublime.  The shrimp were sauteed with red bell peppers and onions.  The vegetables were cooked perfectly - not too soft and not too crunchy.  The garlic sauce was wonderfully sweet and garlicky.  I couldn't get enough of it.\n\nMy dining companions both ordered the Camarones Culichi.  This dish is freaking amazing!  It consists of shrimp cooked in a green tomatillo sauce and loaded with melted Manchego cheese.  The sauce is divine and words cannot describe it properly.  \n\nThe perfect accompaniments to these dishes were Mexican Coca-Colas (Yay!), creamy beans topped with cheese, and white rice with vegetables.

This place did not disappoint. \nThe decor inside MPH is colorful and welcoming. Nothing to special, but nice. We were sat immediately and our drink orders taken. The reviews of the chips and salsa have not been exaggerated. The chips are thicker, almost softer and deliciously warm and salty. The red salsa has a nice rich, spicy flavor, but the green salsa, oh, the green salsa. The green salsa is avocado and cilantro based. It has a wonderful fresh, almost tangy flavor that is complimented well by the creaminess the avocado brings to the dish. When our drinks arrived my husband was delighted by the icy mexican coca-cola, as was I. Our waiter also brought out a fish ceviche tostada. Though it was a surprising treat the ceviche was not a flavorful as we had hoped. \n\nWhile we enjoyed the chips and salsa we could hear and smell our entree being freshly prepared. With out waiter suggestion we ordered the Molcajete. Which is essentially a sampler of grilled sea bass, shrimp, chicken, beef and octopus all swimming and sizzling in a tasty tomatillo based sauce. All the meats were fresh, tender and very flavorful. The rich green sauce was delightful. The bubbling cauldron of flavor was accompanied by flour tortillas that were tasty, but most importantly had a great texture for sopping up all the sauce, yum. Also included were some decent creamy pinto beans and fluffly white rice with what seemed to be veg-all mixed in. Mu husband loved the rice, I was less impressed and opted to fill up on everything else. \nI can not leave this review with out mentioning the amazing guacamole. Freshly made, and the perfect amount of chunkiness.

The Diablo sauce is very hot and spicy but also very tasty and I found myself adding it everything I ate. Over all I thought it was good and fun to share. It cost $22.00 and feeds at least two people. It also comes with rice , beans and tortillas. If you get the Molcajete you should eat the shrimp first because they get over cooked just sitting on the hot Molcajete as ours did. I'm not a beef person but I thought the beef came out prepared the best in this dish.\n\nI do note you should view the photo of the building so you know what the outside looks like before you give this place a try.", "business_id": "Cp6JGY5YIRncTV_My9nf9g", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-06-02", "type": "review"}

HAVE YOU?!\n\nThis is THE place to have that experience. I say \"experience\" because molcajete is more like a witch's bubbling brew than a meal. Mariscos is a cozy little restaurant in an area a lot of people won't flock to, but it stays busy. All the good stuff applies here... friendly service, great food, Mexican beers, Mariachis (on Fridays, I believe). It's just a great place. And, now that the formalities are out of the way, I can talk about the molcajete. \n\nMolcajete is actually the name of the stone bowl that is used more traditionally as a mortar for salsas and such. As a dish though, it's a beautiful mixture of spicy/tangy sauce, grilled meats, grilled veggies, and cheese. It's one of my favorite Mexican dishes, period. Mariscos serves theirs with tons of fixins (beans, tortillas, salsas, etc.) that could probably fill two people up on their own, but their generous serving is much appreciated when ordering this dish for a small group. It's definitely one of those meals that'll impress people when it gets served. Order one for the table, and you're going to have a good time.\n\nI could spout on all day about molcajete... But, would ya look at that, I have a decent size review already, and I haven't even talked about the restaurant's specialty, seafood. Well, I'll let you read some other reviews for that. I'll just say that I love their tostadas de ceviche de camaron! \n\nGo to Mariscos Playa Hermosa, and enjoy!", "business_id": "Cp6JGY5YIRncTV_My9nf9g", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-06-18", "type": "review"}

This is no easy badge to earn, because, unlike most other cities, there aren't good neighborhood separated from bad ones:  Phoenix is one of the few cities I've ever been to, where you can have a million dollar home and two doors down from it is a crack house.  Bizarre, but true.  Having said that, I personally would not want to come here when the sun is down, but when we arrived at 6pm, it was quiet and I didn't feel uneasy about the surroundings.\n\nPARKING LOT:  The entrance to the restaurant is off of Garfield and not 16th Street, which you'll be taking to get here.  This is important, because you'd think it would have an entrance to the parking lot from the main road; it doesn't.  The parking lot, like the restaurant, is small and they share it with a barber shop, which threatens to tow if you park in their spots.  Obviously, this is no problem after they close; but during business hours, I imagine it can be hard to find spots which \"belong\" to the restaurant.\n\nTHE RESTAURANT:  And, like the parking lot, the restaurant is small inside.  There aren't a lot of tables, so it wouldn't take much to fill up the place.  The decor is typical \"Mexican\":  lots of colors, nature motifs, sombreros, etc.  It may be jarring for some conservative Anglo types, but they more than likely wouldn't come here anyway.  The pinks, blues, greens, yellows and other colors so typical of the Mexican Pacific seem to blend nicely and don't seem garrish at all.  Now, as I said, the place is small.  So, for example, someone sitting at the table behind me actually had to pass next to my table to get to their seat.  Not a big deal and she politely excused herself twice.  This might be unacceptable in a 3 or 4 star restaurant or even something simply \"formal\".  But the atmosphere in this place is far from formal.  It's friendly, loud, noisy and familiar.  If you don't like people and if you're uptight about someone walking past you while you're eating, you won't like this place.  If you're there to enjoy the food, have a good time with friends, or don't mind a lively atmosphere, you'll do fine here.  That being said, I believe, I read somewhere that they have live Mariachi music on Fridays.  I'm not a fan of the genre, but even if I were, as small as that place is, I have a strong feeling it would be very LOUD while the music was being performed.  There are two TVs in the place, which, typical for this kind of venue, were playing soccer.  They were not loud and did not intrude on personal conversations.  The place also seems to have a full bar and a number of beer specials.\n\nTHE FOOD:  Being older and having to bring in my reading glasses, one of the things I very much appreciated about the menu was each item being listed in Spanish and English, with Spanish written in blue and English in yellow ink.  This made it much easier to separate the two and quickly see what was what.  I ordered a fish combo which was supposed to come with octopus and shrimp and with a creamy mushroom sauce.  It was not a \"combo\" in the sense that most Americans would be used to.  I expected there to be some fish filet, some shrimp and some octopus.  What came was a fish filet covered in mushroom sauce with some shrimp and very tiny pieces of octopus mixed in.  My companion had a less expensive fish filet with garlic sauce.  Outside of the different price and the cream sauce, they looked exactly the same.  Nevertheless, while this might sound negative, I was not at all disappointed with my plate.  My companion thought his fish greasy; I think it was the garlic sauce.  My fish was not at all greasy and tasted wonderful.  The food was served hot, but not so hot as to burn you.  The rice served with the fish was plain and nothing exciting; and yet, it complimented the fish perfectly.  The portions look huge and they are; but I didn't feel stuffed when I was done; just contented.  It was just the right amount of food.  I had oysters as an appetizer.  If you like oysters, they were good with the lime juice I squeezed on them.  If you don't, well, then it doesn't matter, does it?  The ceviche was okay; a lot of reviewers made a big deal about them in their reviews.  There was nothing bad about them; just nothing special.  Overall, we were both VERY happy with the food, the portion size, the temperature they were served at, and the taste ... and my partner usually complains about everything!  So this is a BIG endorsement!\n\nTHE SERVICE:  *sigh* ... Not everything can be perfect and this was the pebble amidst the pearls in the evening.  The service staff is friendly.  But the place is too small, has too many people  (on a Thursday night, no less ... can you imagine it on a Friday?!?); and not enough servers to be as attentive as they have to be.  Food and drinks were served promptly.  But when it came time to pay, I had to track them down.", "business_id": "Cp6JGY5YIRncTV_My9nf9g", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-06-27", "type": "review"}

Took my in-laws yesterday because they were willing to be adventurous, they were very impressed.  The place is always packed, it's noisy but so welcoming.  As soon as you sit down, a waiter comes to take your drinks order and then come the green and red salsa with chips.  The green salsa is delicious.  A few minutes later, your server brings you a ceviche tostada which is complimentary, what a great way to make a customer feel welcomed and wanting to come back for more.  We have tried several dishes and none have disappointed so far.  My husband usually has the \"mojarra frita\" it is absolutely delicious.  Their \"seven seas\" soups is excellent.  Wonderful staff, very friendly and they continuously check on us without being annoying.  Even though some feel it's not located in a nice area, we have always felt safe.

That said, there's a few things that have been amiss at this place pretty much every time I come here.  The food has been average at best and the atmosphere isn't quite my thing.  Tonight exemplified this feeling for me during a dinner with family members.\n\nFor starters, this restaurant has been around forever.  Even many of the staff members have been here forever (our waiter had worked there for decades).  Between the long time staff and the decor, the feeling of this place is old school all the way.  It has some of the feel of an old school italian restaurant, though not so fancy that you have to be super dressy here.  In fact much of the clientele here is quite casual.  The customer crowd here has also typically been much older as I suspect many of their customers have been coming here for years.  I rarely see anyone younger than their forties or fifties in there, so interpret that however you want.\n\nThe food is old school classic italian from the pastas, the seafood dishes, the chicken and veal plates, and the steaks.  Tonight I went with the chicken francese.  Essentially a breaded chicken covered in a lemon butter sauce and topped with mushrooms.  First off, I'm not a mushroom guy so thats my fault.  But the chicken and breaded tasted pretty bland even with the sauce (which was way more butter than lemon by the way).  It was edible, but not that great.  I've had similar experiences with a couple of their pasta and veal dishes as well.  Each dish gets soup and a salad to start.  As usual both were okay, but again nothing special.  The prices are actually pretty reasonable so even if the flavors don't impress you, you can count on leaving full.\n\nIt may well be that I'm not the target audience of this restaurant.  Its an old school restaurant with old school grub, so maybe they're just looking to appeal to the old school crowd.  I'm not opposed to old world recipes as long as they're done well.  From my multiple visits here I find their cuisine adequate, but not much better than that.  There's plenty of italian joints in the Phoenix area.

My girlfriend looked up and our gazes met; this was going to be 4 star expensive.  Alas we were wrong, the entire meal was around that you would pay at a low-end chain restaurant.  Now the food, the reason for the establishment's existence: unforgettable.   I ordered the Zingarela.  No words describe but delicious.  \n\nWord was spread quickly.  I brought my dad to lunch for Father's Day.  I've never heard him praise food like he did that day.  I'm pretty sure he annoyed the waitress my constantly pulling her aside to tell her of his amazement.\n\nAs a whole, don't let the restaurant's atmosphere dismay you.

I could go without the uninspired main menu and the fairly stuffy after-work crowd, but I plan to return as much as possible for the amazing margaritas and ridiculously cheap happy hour food!\n\nI first learned about the restaurant when I posted a thread in the Yelp Phoenix talk forums - I was trying to find out where I could go in Phoenix to get a really good margarita (that is, made with freshly squeezed juices and hand-mixed). A few people (thank you, Jim K. and Natalie G.!) suggested McCormick's, which surprised me because old-school seafood places don't tend to specialize in much besides wine, beer, and old-fashioned drinks like martinis and Manhattans. Anyway, I was thrilled to discover that they were right - that is one perfect margarita!  It was refreshing, strong, and the perfect combination of sweet and sour. When we complimented the bartender (who was really nice and helpful) on the margarita, he explained that they use only freshly squeezed lime and lemon juices, sugar cubes or simple syrup, and tequila. Yum. \n\nOn to the happy hour part (happy hour is M-F from 3:30 to 6:30, btw). When we arrived and took a seat at the bar, there were paper menus that featured the list of happy hour appetizers. There were five appetizers that were $1.95 (this time, the choices were: the 1/2 pound burger with fries, blackened fish tacos, fried clam strips, steamed mussels, and a seafood tostada) and several that were $4.95 (pulled pork sandwich, shrimp cocktail, and one or two others that I can't remember). We had the pulled pork sandwich, which was actually surprisingly flavorful, the fried clam strips (crispy and not too fishy), the burger (decent but a little overcooked and dry), and the seafood tostada (just ok). A whole dinner's worth of food for around $11! Even though the food wasn't outstanding, it was definitely solid and along with the margaritas, made for an enjoyable and satisfying happy hour.", "business_id": "MU3i2uEyUBntebU6pEyMbw", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-06-22", "type": "review"}

We selected the Spinach and Artichoke Dip with Crostinis that was really very good - rich and creamy with large pieces of spinach (I hate when they are all diced). I ordered 4 oysters on teh half shell. Kelly brought them to the table and pointed and explained each oyster and wher it was originated: malpeque Oyster, Blue Point Oyster, Hama Hama Toyer, Gold Creek oyster. My favorite was the Blue Point. They were served with cocktail sauce and horseradish traditionally; however, it also came with if I can recall correctly was a Chardonnay infused oil or something that was outstanding to pare with the oysters. \n\nMy wife has Chicken Alfredo pasta - yea she did. A bountiful splendor of  treasures form the grotto of the sea and she orders chicken. Each there own I guess but I'm not going to expand on her selection - it was chicken. \n\nThis menu was so thick with things for me to order I just couldn't decide so I asked my server Kelly to choose for me and she hit it right on the mark with the Albacore Tuna sesame crusted with a Thai Chiki sauce. Outstanding hunk of fish and cooked absolutely perfectly - BRAVO! It was served with a nice Juliane of vegetables. My only issue here was the unsuspected slice of ginger hidden in there that I unsuspected ate and really hate. \n\nGreat experience and outstanding service - top notch and remarkably affordable. There was so much to choose from and our server also explained that the menu changes TWICE a day - yes TWICE a day. Only thing I was out of the ordinary was a \"10 UNDER $10 SPECIALS\" list I guess for the penny pinching pamelas in the crowd - really seems your selling yourselves short there at the price point with  this quality, location, product and ambiance.", "business_id": "MU3i2uEyUBntebU6pEyMbw", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-07-07", "type": "review"}

Having said that, I was so pleased with the value here! We decided to skip Valentine's Day, and went for a \"flashy\" dinner on a Tuesday evening. I had a 20% off coupon, so we felt comfortable going all out. We started with oysters on the half shell, they had a mix platter so you could sample all 6 of the various types of oyster they had in house that day. Delish! Next, we ordered lobster bisque and wedge salads, two of my favorites and they were amazing. Next, came our main courses: surf and turf for me and shrimp scampi for him. Both were amazing. My filet was cooked to perfection - I asked for medium-rare and, what a concept, they served it medium-rare!

Capital Grille was my second choice -- my first choice was closed for the holiday weekend. And am I ever so glad it was.\n\nWhen making a reservation I dropped that it was a birthday dinner. Upon checking in, the hostess immediately wished him a happy birthday by name and took us to a table adorned with a tasteful amount of birthday confetti and a card signed by the staff. Nice!\n\nFrom there on out the service, food and ambiance was outstanding. It far exceeded my expectations from all the wonderful reviews I had read previously. Our waiter, Chad, was very helpful in helping us select items as we were a little overwhelmed by all the good reviews on yelp and the things people have told us personally. Drinks - a gin and tonic for him and a Stoli Doli for me. Appetizer was calamari, which was delicious. He got the 24 ounce porterhouse, which he ate every bit of. I had the bone-in kona crusted sirloin - AMAZING. A cup of lobster bisque is mandatory. The Lobster Mac and Cheese was an interesting grown-up take on the kid friendly dish. Not as creamy as the microwavable stuff, a little on the soupy side but it was definitely working. We got a creme brulee for dessert, which I discovered upon receiving the check that they comped it for the birthday.\n\nThe service is very well worth noting. I'm not big on fluff and getting my rear kissed as a customer, and the service exceeded standard customer service with genuine sincerity without flirting with that rear-kissing fakeness. Although I suspect if you are of that type that appreciates that, they'll do that too. The type of place that folds your napkin whenever you leave the table to use the restroom, but doesn't over-sir or over-madam you.

Camelback Road\n\n(602) 952-8900\n\nWe arrived for our reservation at 4:30 and were promptly seated. Our waitress was friendly and attentive. We began with cocktails - a Chocolate Martini made without Godiva Liquor and a Mai Tai. The chocolate martini was sent back and was promptly replaced with a correct one made with Godiva Chocolate.\n\nWe quickly dove into the appetizers. Steak Tartare and Lobster Bisque. The Steak Tartare was arguably the finest I have ever eaten, and I have eaten this dish perhaps 40 or 50 times. The texture and seasoning were complete perfection. Were I to return to this restaurant with the ability to order only one thing off the menu, this would be it. Perfectly balanced with capers that weren't too salty, and some wonderful greens with a drizzle of what appeared to be and tested like an aged balsamic. Companion had good comments about the Lobster Bisque, especially the fact that there was more than one piece of lobster in the dish. The bisque is brought to the table with a serving of sherry which is ceremoniously poured into the dish. Personally, I prefer the sherry added at the end of the cooking so that the flavor remains, but the alcohol does not.\n\nThe menu at The Capital Grill is similar to other high end restaurants, in that all main courses are a la carte. Be warned, portions are huge, and unless you are a dyed in the wool carnivore, you will bring home a doggy bag.\n\nAfter perusing the menu and changing our minds a dozen times, we settled on the Steak au Poivre and the Delmonico Steak. I asked for the Steak au Poivre to be cooked rare, and that is exactly what I got. Perfectly cooked with a Courvoisier cr\u00e8me sauce. The sauce was nothing to rave about, in that it added nothing to the flavor of the steak. The steak though, was perfect and huge. I will make at least one more meal out of it.\n\nAs a side dish I ordered Roasted Seasoned Mushrooms, perhaps the only poor selection on the menu. The mushrooms were without any seasoning at all - not even a pinch of fleur de sel or a touch of garlic or even some chopped shallots. Our waitress told us that they had been taken off our check, but looking at it after we left, we found that we had still been charged for them.\n\nCompanion had the Delmonico Steak (rib steak for those not in the know, and usually considered one of the most flavorful cuts of beef) served medium rare. If nothing else, the chef cooks meat to perfection. A huge cut of prime beef, tender and juicy. It's hard to go wrong with this recipe for success. Companion also ordered Cottage Fries and Onion Strings. A table of four would have had trouble finishing a portion the size of what was brought to the table. As with almost everything else, beautifully done.\n\nWe saved room for dessert, and I for one am glad I did. While companion had a scoop of Vanilla Ice Cream, which was nice and tasty and served with a tuile cookie (Pirouine perhaps), I chose the Fresh Berries in Vanilla Cr\u00e8me Sauce. Lush, succulent raspberries, blueberries and strawberries swimming in a nice cr\u00e8me anglais with a sprig of fresh mint on top. What could have been better? A perfect end to our meal.\n\nDings? A few - The mushrooms were terrible. I didn't finish eating them even though I love mushrooms. Some of them weren't even cooked properly. The music is terrible - not only is it way out of style for the restaurant, but also way too loud. Many times it intruded into the conversation, making it all but unintelligible.\n\nCudos? First and foremost for our waitress, who helped make the meal so enjoyable. Definitely for the meat and how it was cooked. Absolutely for the Steak Tartare, which I am going to be dreaming about. And strangely enough, for the immaculately clean restroom, which is something that is too often neglected.\n\nOverall: A top restaurant that I will definitely return to if only to have the steak tartare.", "business_id": "QdbZyl-LWFS54u93Vjd5SA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-07-19", "type": "review"}

You will never be disappointed when going here, whether it's for a special occasion or just for dinner. You can't go wrong when you go here. It doesn't matter if you like steak or not, this place will make it your favorite food. Their impressive menu of nationally renowned dry aged steaks and the freshest of seafood will ignite your culinary imagination as their award-winning wine list of more than 5,000 bottles awakens your inner sommelier. I can never think about steaks the same again after eating here, the best by far is the Kona crusted sirloin. I have never heard of it before but wow was it amazing. Great cut of meat and the sauce was to die for. The French onion soup was great, very light. The soup didn't really grab my attention until I got home and was craving it. Every side dish I had was also great, the mashed potatoes were by far the best; they were hot, cheesy, and just wonderful. I never even though about putting salt or pepper on anything. Everything was perfectly seasoned and amazing. I never have really liked coconut cream pie but I enjoyed this one, so moist and creamy. The cr\u00e8me brulee was a little rich but the fresh fruit they put on top made it much better. Dinner ran about 60 dollars a person not including the wine. It was by far one of the most expensive meals that I have had but it was well worth it and I will most likely be going back. The service is customarily outstanding and the staff's wine and food knowledge is exceedingly above board. The waiters were well dressed and were well spoken. It was great not to have some ditsy waitress for once! No matter what questions you have regarding the restaurant they know it all. The decor is just what I expect from an old school traditional steakhouse, dark wood, cigar humidor, and oil paintings. It not overwhelming and it has this sort of calming effect. It is so much quieter than other restaurants, people talk in a low voice so you can actually hear what your waiter is saying. Everything was very clean; I don't think I could find a piece of old food anywhere if I tried. I would definitely dress a little nicer than you would at other restaurants. They don't care if you just show up in jeans and a tee-shirt but you will definitely stand out. When I went it was a surprise and wow was I underdressed. I felt so out of place and like I didn't belong. I wouldn't recommend this place to bring your children, so I would get a babysitter. You don't want your fantastic meal ruined by screaming children. For larger parties, they have a conference room in a secluded, closed off area. Whether you are having a business meeting or just a party, it is perfect for any occasion. Reservations are not need except for Friday and Saturday nights; don't expect to even see a table on these days without one. On a crowded night parking is a nightmare, I would recommend that you either make reservations really early, really late, or use the valet that they have. I wouldn't recommend going here if it is last minute because you will be waiting for a long time. The American Culinary Federation recently bestowed upon The Capital Grille the \"Achievement of Excellence Award.\" The Arizona Republic said the dry-aged steaks are, \"gloriously beefy and juicy, lightly seasoned and utterly delicious.\" You cant get a review like that if you are just any restaurant, they earned that award for sure. The only part that wasn't one hundred percent to my liking was the temperature that my steak came out. It was perfectly cooked but it wasn't that warm when I got it. It seemed like they had it out on the counter waiting for the other part of the meal, but that was the only thing that didn't meet my standards which is very good for a restaurant. I would highly recommend The Capital Grille to anyone wishing a special dining experience. The place is a little pricy but great places like this should be and believe me, it is money well spent. Best steaks, appetizers, soups, and desserts. Why go anywhere else?", "business_id": "QdbZyl-LWFS54u93Vjd5SA", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-06-25", "type": "review"}

We set reservations using OpenTable, for 7:00 P.M. Once we arrived right at 7:00 they had our table ready for us and sat us within a few moments. It was a pretty busy Saturday night, so I am glad that we set reservations. Once we were seated we were immediately greeted by our waiter, who was dynamite! My glass was never half empty, our orders were 100% correct, and they have a special Mascato Di Asti that is only available to Prime Restaurants and Resorts. I loved the wine and asked him where I could buy a bottle, he explained that it is rare and usually snagged up by restaurants and top resorts first, which happens with limited selections. Without asking, he went and asked the Restaurant Director, who then brought us over a bottle at a discounted price to take home. Amazing service!\n\nFor an appetizer we ordered the Fresh Oysters, yummy! Excellent quality, cleaned, and great pairings. I am an avid steak guy and prefer my steaks either Blue Rare, Rare, Twice Seared, etc. So I ordered the Filet Oscar, Blue Rare and my steak was perfect! My wife ordered their Seared Tuna with Ginger Rice, which was excellent! You have to try their Lobster Mac and Cheese! WOWZA!!! We also ordered their Truffle French fries which were dynamite!\n\nFor dessert we had the Coconut Cream Pie and the Cheesecake.

I don't mean to be harsh, but I expect A LOT more out of restaurants that charge this much for their food. My mom, brother, boyfriend and I visited Capital Grille, mid-May, for an early birthday dinner for myself. We have never dined at a Capital Grille, but have been to the Palm several times, as well as BLT Steak restaurant group. This was our first experience and last one. We wasted almost $500 on this horrendous dining experience. Number one, we ordered a bottle of wine, it literally took our server, Ken, around 20 minutes to find the bottle of wine in their cellar. We were seated near the cellar where he was searching for the bottle, and watched him. At one point he became flustered and went to check on another table. Finally, he came to table with the wine. My brother and boyfriend started with the French Onion soup, it was decent, but overpriced for what it is. I started with the Lobster Bisque, which had to be sent back because it was cold and had butchered overcooked lobster floating on top. Ken returned with a proper bisque at the correct temperature, also decent but overpriced. My mom had the Spinach salad, very small portion, and the knife cuts were a joke. Mushrooms sliced at different widths, onions, some sliced thin, some sliced thick. Mediocre at best. We didn't even mention the salad until the end of the meal, when things had just become too much. The excuse we received was that this was the \"corporate recipe\", this is how corporate wants the vegetables sliced, in random different sizes, isn't it about presentation, especially when you pay this much? My brother ordered the Dry Aged Porterhouse, my mom ordered the Kona Crusted Dry Aged Bone In Sirloin, and I ordered the Delmonico. We also ordered their \"signature\" potato gratin, creamed spinach, and the Truffle Fries. Unimpressed in the quality and flavor of meat, I'm not sure if they were even serving Prime that day. Maybe a corporate decision? The gratin was a joke, topped with crushed potato flakes, seriously? Creamed spinach mediocre. The Fries were very good actually, but how can you mess up fries? The most disappointing and shocking moment is when Ken tried to argue with my boyfriend that the steak her ordered, the Dry Aged Steak Au Poivre, which he ordered rare, and came out medium, was rare, until he took to the kitchen and put it under the light. Then comes back to tell us that the salad is on them since we hated it, which my mom only said that it wasn't the best and it wasn't the worst spinach salad she has had. They gave us an on the house coconut cream pie to go. Which I took one bite when I got home and threw it away. Very disappointing when you spend this much money and receive this type of service and quality of food. We might as well set $500 on fire.", "business_id": "QdbZyl-LWFS54u93Vjd5SA", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-08-20", "type": "review"}

I will first start with the wonderful greeting at the door by the hostesses.  I am temporarily in a wheel chair and they just couldn't be quick enough to make sure we were able to get into the door without it being awkward for me.  We had a reservation so we were immediately seated, in a very comfortable spot where my chair wouldn't inconvenience other diners.  That is very important to me, because when I go out to dine, the last thing I want is for my experience to be ruined because of other diners not being considerate. \n\nNext, we were greeted by our server Ken, who by the way happens to be about one of the best servers I think I have ever encountered in this type of establishment.  That isn't to say that our local haunts that we frequent often are not just as good because they are, but this is about this particular experience.  Ken was extremely knowledgeable about their very extensive wine list and very knowledgeable about the specials and how things in the kitchen were prepared.\n\nThe first thing we ordered were the lobster and crab cakes. We asked if they were more meat than breading and he informed us that they were very meaty and he wasn't exaggerating.  I have a very hard time eating much especially if bread is involved.   These were amazing.  I ordered the double bone lamb chops med rare and they came out perfectly, perfectly seasoned and were very good.  My husband ordered the steak delmonico (spelling) and he ordered it med rare also (there is no point in eating it any other way)  Well Ken actually suggested that my husband order this steak medium because of the way the marbling cooked, and so it was ordered medium and he was not steered wrong.  With that we shared the lobster mac & cheese, and wow, just wow.  I am not a lobster lover by any stretch because I've always found it to taste like dirt and be very tough.  I guess the difference here is claw meat rather than a tail. Whatever the difference was, we absolutely loved it.  The only issue of the whole night was SO MUCH FOOD. That isn't a bad thing, we have a teen at home, and how many teens get rack of lamb as a doggy bag?  We did take home some desserts to share with the young one.  \n\nNow to praise the management team.  It isn't all that unusual for managers to come to your table and ask how your meal is, but I have to say that Torri and Bow went out of their way to make sure we were having a wonderful experience, and we noticed that it seemed to be just the way of doing business at the Capital Grille.  It is so nice to be just an average joe and feel like you are a VIP on a night out.  So a personal thank you to both of them for making us feel so special. \n\nIn short, you can't go wrong here.  Excellent service, excellent food that is quite frankly just as simple as it gets, and beautifully done.  A peeve of mine is having a bunch of useless stuff on my plate that just gets thrown away.  Plating can be beautiful without all that, and the Capital Grille has that down.", "business_id": "QdbZyl-LWFS54u93Vjd5SA", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-06-17", "type": "review"}

First of all the service was absolutely horrible. Considering our bill was almost $300.00 for 2 people, you would think the service and food would be good. The waiter, seemingly disappeared during our dinner and I do not believe we saw him more than the initial order and perhaps the bill. Even at that, we had to track him down to get the bill. We left 3/4 of the food on our plates, so obviously it was not good. However, he did not ask us why or inquire about the food. Very bad service overall.\n\nThe food. My husband's was mediocre as he had described it. Mine was horrible. I ordered fish, although I can not recall which type. The meal was so salty I could barely eat it. Not simply from the fish itself, although it was very \"fishy\" but the preparation tasted like 90% salt. Really horrible. I hate to say it, but it reminded me of going to Olive Garden where they pour salt all over your food to mask the lack of quality. This perhaps was even worse than Olive Garden with a steep bill at the end. Horrible. Even their infamous Pineapple Martini was a bust this time. I don't don't what is going on over there but I will NEVER return.

Most places think when you order rare you really want medium rare. They did cook the meat exactly the way I like, a little fleshy in the center. My steak was good but not excellent. A little tough. We ordered the green beans. This was a huge disappointment. I am not sure where this started but green beans need to be mature and cooked, not picked before there is a bean in it and warmed up. Yes I know this seems to be the way you get them everywhere. I was raised where you go into the garden, pick the beans, string the beans, break them into 1 to 1.5 inch pieces. When cooked they are to die for.

This location at Biltmore has always been spot on. Made a reservation for our anniversary here the night before Valentines Day. We arrived about 10 minutes early and our car service was met with awesome valet guys. We sat at the bar and had pre-dinner cocktails. I've always been treated so well at this particular Capital Grille from valet to valet. I love that when your table is ready they take your tab and your drink for you to your table. This night was our anniversary of a year and our table had rose petals scattered all over it. How nice is that?! We started with a seafood tower. It's our one year and hey, relationships these days that last, deserve pomp and treats! Well.. We like bubbles and food! This seafood tower was divine and we aren't large people; as soon as it arrived, I knew we were in over our heads! Oh well, you only live once .. Spend well! Next we both ordered the filet mignons. My go to steak. I know they do it right and perfect it was this night. We opted for the mashed potatoes and a salad, as well. I think we both had two bites and were stuffed! Our waiter was spot on perfect. So friendly, you can see why Capital Grille is one of the top notch steak houses. He suggested the perfect merlot to pair our filet with and even brought us a complimentary vodka Stoli vanilla cream cordial after dinner drink, just because! As if we weren't stuffed enough and had not been spoiled by the staff enough on our special night, out comes a dessert tray with a chocolate cursive writing of, ' Happy Anniversary!', around several small dessert samplings. So wonderful! I love a classy restaurant like this that loves it's customers and shows it this way. It's a splurge and it's worth it, every single time! Oh..

Three words: Coconut Cream Pie. I'm not even a fan of coconut or these types of desserts, but whatever they put in this dessert is addicting. It's the combination of creamy coconut filling, with a flaky yet soft crust and then the very best part is the caramel. I could eat an entire serving on my own. So whatever you do, don't stuff yourself too much on the delicious steak so you miss out on this dessert!\n\nNow on to the rest of the meal. This Capital Grille has a great location, very friendly staff and a great environment...not to mention the amazing food! Not only do they have a large selection of comfortable booths, but they also have a private room in the back that's perfect for hosting a large group. I've been to a luncheon in the private room before and it was very comfortable. \n\nThe steak here is top quality and fresh! It's tender to the touch and better with each bite. I absolutely love their Lobster Mac N Cheese along with their Au Gratin potatoes. Get both and happily roll out of their like I do! My favorite meal consists of a the Capital Grille chopped salad, the Filet Oscar (topped with crab meat), sharing the Lobster Mac and Au Gratin and completing the gluttonous experience with the Coconut Cream Pie. It's worth every calorie and then some. \n\nImportant Notes:\n\n- They serve lunch and often do amazing three course lunch specials. \n\n- During the summer, they do dining after dark which means they offer a special prix fix menu starting after 8 PM that includes an appetizer, two entrees, two drinks and dessert all for $50!\n\n- Make a reservation, especially on weekends and during the busy season. \n\nA special fun fact: \n\n- I learned an amazing piece of information about their giving.

We went here for my birthday dinner and it was one of the worse meals I've had in a long time. I ordered the Chef's special - a steak served with shrimp on top, served scampi style. This came out on a plate with gigantic grilled shrimp on top. The shrimp were actually really good. Which is sad when it's suppose to compliment the steak. The steak, which is drowning in this scampi (greasy buttery sauce) is completely bland and has no taste - like not even seasoned with salt and pepper. Appears as if the Chef thought hey, all this greasy buttery sauce will cover up the need to season this piece of meat! I would expect this from a Denny's restaurant after a night of clubbing while in college - not for a nice sit down restaurant. I think I've had better steak at Outback Steakhouse. My boyfriend had the filet on the bone. It came out looking like a barbaric slab of meat from the stone ages - again the most bland seasoning you've ever experienced with a steak! Thank God this place had A-1 steak sauce to save grace - he drowned his steak in this to give it some flavour. Pretty sad when you have to ask for steak sauce at a fine dining establishment. Typically a good steak, seasoned and cooked well would require NO additional sauces used so that you could enjoy the full flavour - well this is not the case at this restaurant since the steaks have NO flavour at all. We ordered sides of lobster mac and cheese - this was good with big chunks of lobster. The potatoes were bland and unimpressive. The 2 impressive things about this place were the calamari for starters and the free cheesecake birthday dessert. The waitress gave us each one refill of our drink (I had soda and he had ice tea). The cups were literally the size of a kids cup - towards the end, she didn't even stop to ask if we would care for a refill - we must have hit our 2 drink maximum. Overall, a truly disappointing dinner experience for a hefty price tag of over $190 - with no alcoholic beverages. To pay this price for dinner and still walk out hungry is sad. Save your money if you want mediocre steak - go to Texas Roadhouse. If you're willing to spend the big bucks and want a good steak - go to Flemings or Mortons. Wouldn't come back here again...even for a free meal.", "business_id": "QdbZyl-LWFS54u93Vjd5SA", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-07-01", "type": "review"}

We live in the middle of the desert so it's pretty much a given that you aren't going to find a fish and chips place like you would on a coast.  I've tried a handful of places with the two places around the valley that have decent fish are Pete's and Long John Silvers (yes, I know this is sad).  I have just never found a place that is great.  \n\nI've driven by the place a decent number of times and it looks like an old worn out building.  If I was just going by external appearance, I would never try this place because it looks bad and it doesn't help that it's next to two strip clubs (with the one right next door looking very creepy and questionable as to it's legality).  The rest of the neighborhood isn't great but it really isn't that bad either.\n\nI finally decided to give the place a try because I was craving some fish and chips and thought it might be good to try a new place.  The inside of the restaurant isn't much better than the outside.  It looks like an old worn out place you might find along the ocean in California.  I ordered a 3 piece fish and chips.  It took a while to get the order and the fish/fries came out steaming hot.  It was definitely freshly cooked.  The fish pieces were not evenly cut and tasted very fresh.  Contrary to some of the other reviews, I do not think these are your standard frozen fish sticks.  Pete's fish looks much more like a standard frozen piece due to the uniform shape.  The fries were also very good.\n\nI thought the meal was very delicious.  My favorite part about this place is the sauces.  They have all the necessary sauces available and you can get as much or as little as you need.  It was refreshing to get everything and not have to beg the person behind the counter for a larger quantity of anything.  The tartar sauce tasted good and is my favorite of all the valley fish places I've tried.\n\nI've been back to this place twice since my first visit and have brought my co-workers.  They all shared similar feedback and enjoyed their meals.  On the return visits I added a piece of shrimp which was huge and delicious.  I tried the cocktail sauce with it and found that I really enjoyed their sauce.  I usually don't like cocktail sauce so it was a pleasant surprise.  \n\nThis is definitely my favorite fish place in the valley and my co-workers and I have decided this will be a regular stop on our lunch rotation.", "business_id": "YxMnfznT3eYya0YV37tE8w", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-06-27", "type": "review"}

Sakana is thou the worst offender of doing this. My husband and I went the other evening and ordered what we thought were 7 different rolls...nope-they all tasted the same. \nFake \"krab\" minced up and doused in mayo- minced tuna..again doused in mayo-and what didn't have mayo had cream cheese or was deep fried-ick. \n\nEven when asking the waitress what was in the rolls (we like to try different things) she at no time said \"krab salad\"-she just said crab...so when I get rolls that have this stick all minced up with mayo you can certainly understand my frustration. The head chef came over and apologized-however stated that it was their \"style\" and that's how most of the rolls are. \nDinner was atrocious and you leave here with your clothes reeking of oil due to the teppan bar that they have. So money wasted on something I could have done myself with a jar of Hellmans and a package of VandDeKamp Krab and additional money wasted on a dry cleaning bill. \nSave your palette and your money and go elsewhere if you are looking for good, clean, sushi.

Also while visiting Arizona a while back was the first time I've ever had BAD sushi. BUT-how much longer could I have avoided such sushi cravings I've been having since I moved here? I need sushi in my life...\n\nAMBIANCE: \nIts interesting how sushi houses in Phoenix take orders by having a paper menu which the party can mark themselves. (Highly efficient btw.) \nLocated in a random shopping center, Sakana has a comfortable atmosphere with a little more real estate than you would figure this spot to be from the outside. Family & hip(ster-ish) oriented (patrons & servers alike) instead of the familiar K-pop cover ballads they played some 90's pop hits from MJ to Prince. Nothing like your 'HE HEEE'S!' & purple rain while you're scarfing down some good fish. Its casual.\n\nSUSHI & SERVICE: \nI went with a party of 5 on a Sunday with most of the tables occupied. Even so I was surprised we got our drinks & smoked salmon sashimi  within 5 minutes. We sampled 6 different rolls-from baked scallop to the tootsie roll to the fried Californian. All which I should say is pretty LEGIT. Not the straight out the water fresh but the THIS-IS-AS-GOOD-AS-IT-CAN-GET-SUSHI- WISE-OUT-HERE fresh. Which is all I can ask for! Really, it was DELICIOSO. \n-The rolls are your standard size for (Americanized) sushi about 4-6 pieces.\n-If you ever order the baked scallop roll they bless it with an abundance of crab meat/chopped up scallops & topped off with sprinkled fish eggs-no room for dissapointment here. \n\nThough Sakana has 2 other locations in the valley it does not have the flavor of 'chain' sushi. Also they mixed up an order of a massive sushi plater & placed it on our table then had to quickly take it back right when my cousin was about to pinch one with her chopsticks. Well 2 minutes later we were served a plate of another Vegas roll-on the house. To compensate for the possible emotional distress you may have caused taking away  that triple roll platter-compensate you did. NOTED.\n\nBRAVO Sakana for your timely & friendly service, being open on sunday & the complimentary sushi. I shall return to this sushi house in the desert!

I've been going to Sakana since grad school in 2007, when we'd hit up the 59th Ave. location regularly.  When I moved, I was happy to find this location was close to the house and it became my 'take-out' sushi joint.  Probably went there 20 times in the past year - mostly with called in orders, but often dragging the (non-sushi-eating) boyfriend along for a dine in.  Rolls are big and stuffed with fish, esp. for the price, and the quality is pretty good.\n\nSo what happened? 2 terrible experiences in a row.  \n\nIn May, I had a hankerin' for take-out, called in my order, and got the usual \"It'll be ready in 30 minutes.\"  Perfect.  Enough time to drive over, stop at the Safeway and get some beer before picking up the delicious yumminess.  Did that, got the sushi, paid and was halfway home when it occurred to me that there were fewer boxes than usual.  Pulled over, did a check and... sure enough, they forgot my nigiri.  Darn.\n\nCalled them up, told them what happened, and headed over to pick up my food.  (I had been charged for it, I was going to get it.)  Head to the hostess, tell her who I am, \"Oh, ok.  We'll put that order in for you.\" Uh? You didn't already? \"You're going to expedite it, right?\" \"Oh, of course.\"\n\nSo I wait.  And wait.  And wait.  How long does it take to make up 8 rice balls, wasabi them and plop pre-cut fish?! Talk to the hostess... it is coming? My other sushi IS sitting in the car.  \"I'll go check.\"  Ok... so I wait some more.  I've been irritated for a while now, but apparently it is becoming visible.  It has been 30(!!) minutes since my \"expedited\" order was put in (70 minutes since my original order was phoned in).  The manager sees this and comes over, asking what is wrong.  I tell him.  To his credit, he gets the order handled and gives me a $10 coupon to come back.  Still annoyed, but mollified, I head out.\n\nFast forward to last night.  I have my coupon and a hankerin' for sushi, so wrassle up the boy and head back to give Sakana another chance.  I put our name on the list (30 minute wait) and, because it is crowded & noisy, head outside to wait.  There are several other folks out there and, periodically, the hostess comes out calling names.  Once. Twice.  Three times.  She comes out, calling names.  \n\nAfter a while, someone comes out and lights up a cigarette within smelling range (ew!!!), so the boy and I head inside to wait.  Names are called.  New people come in and get their names on the list.  More people are seated.  It can't be long now! Then the hostess goes out and fetches some of the new people, happily taking them to a table.  \n\nWTF?! The boy goes and looks at the list.  We've been crossed off.  WTFF?! Our name hadn't been called - we were in earshot the entire time; why was it crossed off? Forget this - I guess they don't want us to eat here.  So we got up and went across town to my true favorite sushi place.  (If it weren't such a long drive to Scottsdale, we'd always go there.)  Which worked out much better, since the staff recognize us, the fish is better, there is more non-sushi variety for the boy, and it is much less noisy and crowded.\n\nI'll be back to Sakana one more time.  I still have that coupon after all and $10 of sushi is $10 of sushi.  But now I'm on the prowl for a new sushi place close by to become my new \"take out\" place.  It's too bad... I DO like them a lot, but to receive execrable service two times in a row is unacceptable.", "business_id": "0vzZ_Bcb02rJljeMU9XkBw", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-07-13", "type": "review"}

Why is Sakana better than any other affordable sushi option? Quantity, quality, price...amazing service is the cherry on top. Instead of being subjective I'll focus on a more objective view. Here's what I order EVERY time with my girlfriend:\n\nDrinks $14: Large Kirin and sake x2 \nAppetizers $2 ($1 each with Kirin purchase!):\n\nJalaccini (fried zucchini and jalapeno)\nFried mushrooms (best you'll ever have)\nBoth come with \"miso mayo\" the greatest sauce I've ever tasted!\n\nSushi $7.65:\n\nSpicy tuna roll (the biggest roll you will find, bar none. I kid you. not, these things are stuffed full of tuna)\n\nMexican Caliente roll (jalapeno goodness, just as gigantic as the spicy tuna!)\n\nGrand total for 2 sake bombs, 2 apps, and 2 giant rolls:\n \n$23.65 + $5 tip\n\nThis is the best of the best, and for a price that can't be beat. Oh and here's a bonus: they have gluten free soy sauce! \n\nOther tips: ask for the happy hour cocktail menu, they don't have it out, but most of the drinks are incredible and affordable.", "business_id": "0vzZ_Bcb02rJljeMU9XkBw", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-08-19", "type": "review"}

Great value for the happy menu items. The place filled up just a few minutes after opening at 11 am, which is a good sign. Free miso soup upon sitting down and free edamame with a yelp check in.

We had fried calamari with jalape\u00f1os which were great and came with a nice dipping sauce.  We also ordered two rolls off the \"happy hour\" menu. Very nice fish:rice ratio. Some places jipp you with a lot of rice and little fish.  We also ordered the sakana sushi special. Needless to say, we ordered too much food with our hungry eyes.  The sushi fish itself was ok. I felt that it was room temperature instead of cold and straight out of refrigerator. Not fishy yet but just about to go under.  Slices are decent size, but some cuts were a bit sloppy.

Finally came here for dinner to try the teppanyaki and it did NOT disappoint.  While we were waiting for an available chef to finish up on some other tables (sometimes people are so selfish, hogging a chef all to themselves), I couldn't help but notice that one of them was quite animated while the other was kind of...uh, robotronic (?).  After pregaming with some soft shell crab rolls (UH YEAH) and salmon sashimi, I was quite in the mood for some grilled awesomeness.  Luckily, we got the animated chef as our entertainer/cook.  LET THE GOOD TIMES ROLL!\n\nI don't want to spoil the experience for anyone who has not yet been here, but I felt the inner child in me exploding in awe-inspiring wonder and hunger as the chef went through the motions of throwing eggs in the air, skillfully chopping veggies, making DELICIOUS fried rice, and finally the greatest moment ever - frying up the rib eye steak I ordered.  I wanted mine rare and that's exactly how I got it served!  Excellent food and an even more wonderful show to boot.\n\nI'm 100% sure that my buddy and I were at least 8000x more excited about the dinner experience than the lame-ass* kids sitting across from us.

I regret that decision.\n\nThe music was very loud for dining, the galley style dining area in which we were seated was sort of cramped and was the only access to the bathroom so my shoulders were rubbed by people's behinds three times as they passed. The waitstaff started to clean the dining room and flip the chairs as we ate, although there were at least 4 other occupied tables in the restaurant and they did not close until 10:30 (we paid our bill and left at 10:40).\n\nThis brings us to the food; I was extremely disappointed in the sushi quality. We ordered whitetail and unagi to start and the unagi was unusually fishy in flavor and was over cooked. The cut of the whitetail was generous, but not the knife skill I am used to. It was not trimmed on the thin side of the filet and wasn't a consistent thickness all the way through. \n\nAbout this time we were delivered a mug of hot green tea, which was odd because we didn't order any, were told they were bringing us another, then about one minute later a server came by and said sorry and took it from our table. This only seemed odd because when I waited tables I would never think of taking something from a table, even after serving it to the incorrect one. We then had the Roller Coaster roll and found the spicy tuna on top to be mushy and flavorless. \n\nThe best thing about the meal was the tempura calamari. It was crispy and flavorful and not greasy.

One paragraph is simply not enough room for me to describe a restaurant.\n\nWith that said.. I totally forgot that on my Southwest tour I also visited a buffet while I'm in Phoenix...(Peter C. really enjoys my buffet reviews so I'm gonna make sure that I review each and every buffet I go to! Just for you Peter!!!)\n\nSo it's about 8:15pm and we just arrived into Phoenix from Sedona after a 12 hr road trip...  I wanted something to eat but knowing that simple burger was not gonna do it.  So to treat my buddy I've decided to find a high reviewed buffets to indulge on!  (Thanks yelpers!)\n\nThe place closes at 9:00pm so we had to work quick...  It's a typical chinese style buffet that you can find in LA dime a dozen ($14.99 for dinner which is little higher than the buffets here in LA)... The location was very clean, the dining time we went was completely empty....(maybe that made it look cleaner?)  There were 4 stations with about 6-8 hot trays with your typical food fares such as orange chicken, beef with brocolli, lemon salmon, fried wonton, crab rangoon, bbq ribs, prime rib, mayonaise covered mussels, simply steamed clams, string beans, fried noodles, fried rice, fruit salad, salad bar, and a very small selection of sushi bar that had like 3 types of sushi there...(Mongolian BBQ dude was on break or something....Not Available!)\n\nOverall the taste was half decent or was it because we were so hungry and that we had to finish up our meal fast because we still got another hour to go on the road?  Whatever it was the salmon was delicious and the ribs actually tasted really good.  Friend got the noodles with orange chicken, beef brocolli and thought idelicious as well....  I know for a fact that these chinese style buffets can't get any better or worse  (Unless you are Bamboo Garden then there is a great chance you can screw this up!), so as long as the food is not overly salty and has a respectable service, the experience should all be about the same...\n\n( I often wonder if all these chinese buffet chefs came out of a same buffet culinary school?  There's gotta be a hidden buffet university catering just to aspiring chinese buffet chefs!!!!  Seriously, how does buffet in CA taste the same as those in AZ?  or in face WA, OR, etc.?  )\n\nI'm guessing we were just really really hungry that is why it was so good.....Insanely 4 stars reviewed based on this one time visit....  hopefully I'm not too off.....  \n\nGood service though!  (It took us 20 minutes to be in & out of that place!  Call us The Flash of Meals!!!!!)", "business_id": "-Ogv7rpcgUHkFaSy3vD8Sw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-07-12", "type": "review"}

I must say every time I go, my belief that this is the best buffet in the Phoenix area is reaffirmed. Hong Kong is very consistent with their food quality and the service is always been excellent. I do agree with other Yelpers that you can find other buffets that are cheaper but you get what you pay for. My favorite feature is the sushi station. My wife is not a sushi fan so when we go to Hong Kong, I hit this station several times. The only problem is if I fill up on the various rolls and sushi pieces, I don't have room for all of the other wonderful items Hong Kong prepares. The only station I can't comment on is the Mongolian BBQ station. Again, it comes down to a lack of room more than a lack of will to try it. Oh well, maybe with my next visit I will make an effort to try it. \n\nIf you are looking for a great Chinese / Mongolian / Sushi buffet, this place should be number one on your list.", "business_id": "-Ogv7rpcgUHkFaSy3vD8Sw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-06-22", "type": "review"}

Back home there was a killer Chinese Buffet by my house so I was looking for a replacement, plus its right across the street, and had really good reviews so I had to check it out. \n\nWe went around 5:30 on a Wednesday..when we went in only a few other people were there our waitress came over and took our drink orders and off we went to get food. The first thing I ate was an egg roll which was pretty yummy, then I ate a small crab rangoon which was cold. Then when I went to eat my Orange chicken I noticed there was a black hair stuck in the chicken under the breading. Ew. I told our waitress and she apologized profusely, but by that time I had already lost my appetite. My boyfriend wasn't really impressed with his either (most of the food was barely lukewarm) but 'I told him we might as well try the sushi before we leave. At the sushi station you order your sushi and they make it fresh. There was a sign that said, \"Brown rice upon request\", so I asked for a spicy tuna roll with brown rice. The guy making the sushi responded with, \"Maybe we don't have brown rice\", avoiding eye contact with me. Awesome.\n\n So after that we told the waitress we wanted the check  and she could tell we weren't pleased. Since I had only eaten an egg roll and one of their little crab rangoons I asked to have my bill either discounted or to not get charged for my meal. The waitress said she would talk to the manager. They didn't charge me for my meal which was good since I wasn't about to spend $15 on an egg roll. I also wasn't thrilled that the manger didn't come over. Oh well.

And most of the food looked and taste like they been sitting out for hours. The only decent dish we had was the fried rice and beef with broccoli and eggrolls. Everything else was hardly fresh and not good tasting at all. And another disgusting dish that I saw that they served were frog legs. Gross!!! No thanks! I'm sure the same grease that they used to fry them things in is the same one they use to fry everything else.

Don't bring your Meg Ryan-like friend (who's allergic to seafood and nuts) to Roy's.

But on the bright side I had most of the appetizers (sushi, satay and grilled shrimp) to myself.

No matter how much people tell me how great they are, I feel like I'm getting something ordinary.\n\nThis is soooo not true with Roy's.  Each restaurant carries the vibe of the city it's in.  The SF Roy's pulls you in from Mission street with the copper topped bar and two level open dining room.  It pulsates with the City vibe, but has just enough of the Hawaiian undercurrant to remind you where you are eating.  The Phoenix location has FLW influenced touches and feels both contemporary and familiar.\n\nThe same goes with the food.  I've had a half dozen dishes on the menu, and while I hate to say it, everything is good here.  I'm partial to short ribs and their's are the version I compare others against: fork tender with a rich sauce, not fatty or tough and resting on a bed of mashed potatoes that manage to be creamy without being dense.  Seafood is a specialty.  Their seared tuna comes with a wasabi and a mustard sauce and both complement this delicious dish.  For a great value, order off the seasonal Prix fix menu. On my last visit, we ordered one prix fix and two appitizers for my husband and I.  There's was more than enough food and we were able to try a wider variety of dishes.  Oh, and the shrimp risotto app came with two monster shrimps, perfectly cooked, of course.  We also got the seared scallops, divine in a lemongrass cream sauce.\n\nService is a standout here.  No matter what you ask for the staff are attentive without being overbearing.  I always feel like a welcome guest when dining here.  And just to be clear, we are not big spenders, but I feel like a high roller no matter what we order.\nBottom line; Roy's is one of the best chains around.", "business_id": "corPOxxIBRJ7DSpryYvorw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-07-09", "type": "review"}

It wasn't great, but it wasn't bad either.  I left feeling very \"meh.\"\n\nMy husband and I were staying at the JW with a Travelzoo deal, and we had been wanting to try Roy's since we live very close anyway, but never had the chance.  So we figured why not.  We were greeted and seated right on time in a very private booth indoors.  The weather was nice enough to sit outside, but everyone was outside and we wanted a more romantic dinner rather than having to listen to everyone else's conversations and screaming kids.  \n\nOur server was really great - knowledgeable, attentive but not overbearing, and I wish I could remember his name.  We started with our drinks...my husband ordered his typical Jack and Diet and I ordered a glass of wine.  I wasn't impressed with the wine menu, however, as I was trying to decide between two different glasses, our server brought me tastes of both options, which was a really nice touch.  \n\nWe had the lobster potstickers for an appetizer, which I really enjoyed.  However, as others have mentioned, the portions are very small for what you are paying.  I rolled my eyes at those reviews before I dined here, but having experienced it now, I can confirm that really, they are small.  It wouldn't have bothered me if I paid $15 for 3 bites and those bites were the most amazing flavors I've ever tasted, but that was not the case.  \n\nMoving on to dinner - I ordered the Roy's Trio, which included 2.5 oz servings of the salmon, mahi, and butterfish, and some rice.  Again, very small portion.  Although I was satisfied with the amount of food, my husband was not.  I like the butterfish very much and wished I had ordered that as my entree.  The other two were just \"meh\" as far as flavor for me.  My husband had the Ahi and he liked it but didn't love it (story of the evening).\n\nWe finished with the chocolate lava cake.  Great decision.  It was soooo good.  We aren't big chocolate people, but it just sounded good that night and boy are we glad we ordered it.  SO YUMMY.\n\nI would have really liked Roy's if they had been priced just a little lower - I don't think my entree was worth paying more than $25 or so.  I have spent the same amount of money on the same amount of food (appetizer to share, entrees, dessert to share) at much nicer restaurants, which is really what is holding me back from liking Roy's more.

The food, service and atmosphere were all a home-run.  That was the Vegas Roy's, and there, we ate strictly off of the Aloha Menu.  The appetizers were $5 each, and we kept talking about the tasty food for days, even months since our visit.\n\nHere in Phoenix, we decided to try some more food, not from the happy hour special pricing.  I was expecting greater portions, or even sides, but it seems like Roy's is expensive for the sake of being expensive.  One appetizer, one entree, no drinks and our bill was $60.  Let me explain.\n\nWe wanted to try the largest appetizer called \"canoe for two\".  The food was rich in flavor as always, but I was surprised that for $30, you only get ten (10) pieces of food. Two ribs, pieces of chicken, shrimp, potstickers and sushi rolls.  Again, only two of each....as in two ribs with a little bit of meat on them, and two pieces of shrimp!  I'm not a \"cheap\" eater, but for $30, I would sure hope for more food than that.  I mean two pieces of a sushi roll? give me a break!  I know this choice is under \"appetizer\", but in today's food world, that doesn't mean \"miniature\"...especially for the price. (funny they don't mention \"2 of each\" on the menu)\n\nThe main course was a hanger steak that was cooked nicely with..wait for it, four pieces of sweet potato wedges...small wedges.  No veggies, nothing substantial.\n\nI guess what I'm getting to is this:  Why does it seem like Roy's rations food to an apocalyptic portion?  Is the world out of shrimp, rice or chicken?  Has supply and demand multiplied a hundredfold?  Sure seems that way when dining at Roy's!", "business_id": "corPOxxIBRJ7DSpryYvorw", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-06-12", "type": "review"}

Portions are not huge, but again, that's standard for this type of restaurant. I LOVE Roy's. It's a special occasion place for us (though their happy hour seems very enticing). \n\nThe appetizer sampler for 2 is oh-my-freakin-goodness amazing. It really does just leave you wanting more.

I contacted the restaurant's group coordinator (Kaleb) and he was awesome in helping me plan.  Since we were dining on a Monday night, we was able to book on of the private rooms for us with a pretty low F&B guarantee ($900).  I had preordered 4 canoes (appeitizers).  We we arrived, we were quickly escorted to the back room.  At 8pm, the restaurant was about 75% at capacity.  The back room was nice.  There were sliding doors for privacy and we were able to control the thermostat and music easily.  We had multiple waiters and servers there to help us and never had to wait on anything.  Our drink orders were taken right away and the canoes came out.  The highlight of the canoes were the pork ribs and shrimp skewers.  The cocktails were good and better priced than Meritage ($8-12 vs $12-15).  One of the girls didn't like hers and they quickly exchanged it.  We ordered some beet salads and hanger steak loco mocos.  The salad was a hit as well as the loco moco.  Some of them came out with the fried egg overcooked.  The waiter apologized and quickly had them fired up some new ones.  Not a big deal.  The loco mocos were very very good.  I could have probably have eaten that for the entree.\nThe one thing that really impressed me about the restaurant was that they were so willing to make substitute and customize our menu.  Most of us elected for the Surf n' Turf and that (the hanger steak) could have been paired with pretty much anything (lobster tail, butterfish, mahi mahi, shrimp, etc).  I paired mine with the butterfish and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The Hanger steak came out already cut and was tender.  The flavor was just ok.  However, the butterfish was awesome...just melted in your mouth and was very flavorful.  Everyone loved their food.  Only complaint was that the surf portion was small...can't have everything.\nDessert included the pineapple upside down cake and the chocolate souffle.  The pineapple cake was very buttery (a tad too much) and the souffle was great.  We had a great time and really enjoyed dinner.  Roy's is a perfect place for a group.  Very convenient access from the hotel (literally outside the elevator).  \nIf we return to this resort, I will be calling Roy's again.

My chair was the one closest to the booth and I felt not only that I was being intruded upon, but that I was intruding on THEM since my left arm was practically resting on their booth table! The staff couldn't have seated them ANYWHERE else? We were seated before the family was and there was no reason to have us camped next to each other cheek and jowl.

But I will say, we eat at Carrabas probably 10 times a month. It is one of our favorite restaurants. On this visit,  we were ordering. I Ordered my usual salad. Steve asks me if I want to add blue cheese and I say \"Sure\" then I say, \"I have never been asked that before, is that something new?\" To which Steve says, \"no, I always ask everybody if they want blue cheese\" and I said \"Oh\" so I said \"Sure, I will add blue cheese\" then he proceeds with my  husband's salad and asks if he wants blue cheese, my husband said \"no\".  Another wait staff member walks by.. Steve, in a proud like manner says \"Hey! Who adds on the most blue cheese here?\"  The waitress said \"You do Steve\" not missing a beat or a step and just kept walking. So, I said to Steve, \" Why is it such a proud accomplishment to be the highest ranking blue cheese giver at Carrabas, is there an up charge for it or something?\"  To which Steve replied \"Yes, but it's only $2. And you get a nice big chuck of blue cheese\". And then I said \"Well, you didn't mention the $2 up charge Steve.\" And he said  (in a gentlemanly cocky and arrogant way) \"I said would you like to \"ADD\" blue cheese, that's how I do it\" and I said \"You are a rat, I don't want the blue cheese\".   So moral of my story, In MY PROSPECTIVE or PERCEPTION, whatever you wanna call it, Steve is a scammer.  And the only reason he is top blue cheese sales guy is his ability to \"fake\" people into thinking he is just adding a nice chunk of blue cheese on their salad. I guarantee you that if he told customers clearly, up front about the $2 up charge, half of the customers would decline the add on.  Most customers probably don't even realize the up charge on their bill, or if they do, then Steve just says, \"I said \" ADD\" then the customer feels stupid and Stevo wins!!!!! You better believe when our bill came, I looked it over, not for the blue cheese ADD ON, but for anything scammer like.  If he feels proud and like he's the pro at getting people to buy something they are not aware of, I don't trust him as far as I could throw him.... Moral of the story; a chunk  of blue cheese on your salad is $2 out of the pocket.  Just so you know .", "business_id": "k-KhKfLPjBxjSHppWoUyOA", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-06-14", "type": "review"}

We got a tip from my husbands coworker to try this place out. We went the same day because we were very excited to try some fresh seafood. It is in a location that could make some get a little uneasy... I will explain.\nWe walked in & immediately saw that EVERYONE had a large abundance of shrimp on their plates in all different styles. One of the waitresses signaled for us to find a seat. They brought chips & salsa as soon as we sat down. We started off with drinks... my husband had the margarita which was large & tasty, and I had a pina colada which was good. When we looked over the menu we wanted to order everything! They had pictures & it all looked delicious! He ordered a fish plate with rice & salad. It was a large piece of flounder covered with a cream sauce filled with shrimp & octopus... Wow! Very good! I decided on the shrimp salad with avocado. I have this thing with wanting my salads chopped for easier eating & I was happy to see it came chopped!! except the shrimp of course - those were whole, fresh & cooked perfectly. It had what seemed like an endless amount of avocado - impressive! I also got a fish taco a la carte - it was deep fried (all right by me) and then they give you your own squeeze bottles full of sauces to top it off yourself which I thought was ideal. It was all great!\nDid I mention our food came out lightening fast? It was only a matter of minutes- less than 5 for sure!\n\nI don't want to sugar coat the atmosphere... there was a guy who came in to get some relief from the hot concrete he apparently called home. There was a nice patron who bought him a beer & maybe some food - didn't stick around long enough to see that- but that patrons brother got up to stop him because he said the restaurant didn't want him there! It caused a minor scene, but the brother did not win... the guy sat drinking his cold beer - that made us feel good to know there were good people willing to step out & do a good deed!! The situation didn't really bother us at all. Then there was a young (young!) boy who came in that was peddling for money & who you could tell was sadly hooked on serious drugs. He did score a small donation before he was asked to leave & did so without incident. My husband wanted to kidnap him & get him some help because he was very young & it was a hard truth to ignore, but we ended up just hoping the best for him. Very sad. Bottom line- those were minor occurrences in a room full of ordinary people.\nThat is my story about my trip to Restaurant Sinaloa! All in all, we left there saying we can't wait to return!!!

This made for a long time deciding what to get, but I was hungry and had the focus of a lioness on a hunt!\n\nI dictated to the table that we have the lobster pizza for starters!  no one complained out loud but I feel the daggers come out of your eyes! hahaha\n\nI ordered a special dinner called the Hawaiian Isles...four coconut shrimps, salmon with a pineapple teriyaki type sauce, comes with salad, rice, and fries!  Yeah...it's Fat Friday! I also had a Mango Mai Tai that was dangerously delicious! It was gone in a sec...almost got brain freeze.  Our server was the most gracious and attentive server I have had in a chain restaurant, she was wonderful!\n\nMy rec...try out Red Lobster again, the food has improved, just be prepared for the lackluster crowd.", "business_id": "k8q3ypIoIzchdp3RoRUsJw", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-08-23", "type": "review"}

After viewing the Dolly Steamboat Website, we were under the impression that sandwiches or a box lunch would be available on the afternoon tours.  We were wrong.  Therefore, by the end of the 90-minute boat ride, we were hungry.  There were no other restaurants within a couple of miles of the boat, so we decided to eat at Lakeside Restaurant & Cantina, right next door. The exterior of the restaurant looked very appealing. We knew that it had a picturesque view of Canyon Lake.  \n\nWe were, therefore, a little surprised when we entered the restaurant that the d\u00e9cor was so dated.   Let me just say that the interior does not compete with the view of Canyon Lake.    If it were not such a hot day in June with temperatures in the 108-degree range, we would have dined outside on the patio.  The Dolly was not going out for another tour that afternoon, so she stayed docked while we ate our lunch.  \n\nWe were greeted as we entered the restaurant and told to sit wherever we wanted.  We chose a table near a window.  Some diners who we recognized from the boat tour were already seated and drinking tropical drinks.  If you just want a drink, they have a fully stocked bar.  Our very pleasant server brought over menus and took our beverage orders. She was very helpful and answered our questions about menu choices.   We were tempted to order the Canyon Mudslide or the Capsized Cactus Creation but we had more sightseeing to do plus a long ride home so we stayed with water.    \n\nThere were more than 17 choices on the Lunch Menu and the Special of the Day for Wednesday was Swiss Mushroom Burger.  I wished that we had dined on a Saturday because a Reuben Sandwich was the Special that day.  Although I was leaning toward the Philly Cheese Steak, $7.89, I finally settled on the Greek Gyro, $7.49 and my included side was fries.  The rest of my party ordered the Special of the Day and chose various sides.  Our orders took quite awhile to arrive.   Maybe it just seemed that way because we were so hungry.  On the other hand, maybe it was just that everyone from the boat tour arrived around the same time.  My Gyro was good and the others enjoyed their burgers. If you like burgers, there are seven choices not including the Grilled Chicken Burger which will cost you $1 more if you substitute it for the beef.  The Chef Specialties were Cheese Steak and BBQ Pork Ribs.  Soups/Chili, Salads and Seafood dishes round out the Lunch menu.  \n\nThe many (15) Appetizers are all the usual ones plus a few unusual ones.  Prices ranged from a half portion of Buffalo wings, $3.29 up to $8.79 for Nachos Grande.  Many were in the mid range of $14- $16 such as Buffalo Shrimp, Beer Batter Shrimp, Mozzarella or Clam Sticks.  Dinner Entrees range from $12.49 for a Seafood Platter, Fillet of Lemon Tilapia or Blackened Cajun Catfish up to $16.99 for Rib Eye and $20.99, Surf & Turf.  Dinner Entrees come with two sides.   Dine on Fridays for the All-You-Can-Eat Fish Fry.  \n\nAlthough we were tempted by the variety of soft ice cream choices, we decided to wait until we visited Tortilla Flats and have dessert there.  The restrooms for the restaurant are public ones used also by patrons of the Dolly Steamboat.  They were a little messy late in the afternoon but I have been in worse ones.  The restaurant does offer free Wi-Fi.", "business_id": "bpPVn4nF8YR40BjhO6YP1w", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-07-07", "type": "review"}

My mouth waters even now as I think of it!

We ate there approximately 3 weeks ago (we're overdue for another visit!). While we dined, the owners weren't present-we always like to visit with them as they're so hospitable, kind & make you feel so welcome. The food, as usual, was delicious- fresh, hot & homemade. I just read a \"review\" done on 5/18/15 by a \"Christina Y\" & I feel strongly compelled to comment. I happened to see this \"reviewer\" the day we dined @ the restaurant- she was an employee, NOT a restaurant patron. I observed her with her employee uniform on, sitting at a table, not working the whole time we were there. Having said that, her \"review\" that she wrote shortly thereafter was obviously written by a now former disgruntled employee.  My husband & I are appalled by that review as we know this restaurant very well-nothing she said has any truth in it whatsoever. You can view the menu on-line to know the food is not overpriced, you can read all of my reviews I've done over the past 2 years right here- each time I mention how hospitable the owners are & how the food is delicious & home-made. Never have the owners \"told customers off all day long.\" The most striking thing I had to comment on was the lack of knowledge this former disgruntled employee has regarding stringent state health codes & laws governing restaurants! Sewage is never dumped in a lake or in front of a restaurant anywhere...& certainly not within the Tonto National Forest! Lastly, I'm a RN & acutely aware of restaurant hygiene, food safety & public health. Never have I seen \"food with dirt\" @ Lakeside Restaurant & Cantina.

Although it's the only option, it's a pretty good option.\n\nI recommend having Dim Sum here on the weekends.  During Saturday and Sunday, they offer a pretty extensive Dim Sum menu.  I pride myself in being an adventurous eater, and this is the perfect place for people like me.  They have the usual Dim Sum fare, but they also have dishes like jellyfish, tripe soup, chicken feet, etc.. It may seem a little intimidating to a newcomer, so ask a person at the next table for recommendations if you need it.  \n\nThe regular menu is pretty good as well.\n\nI have dined here with my family for years.  This is a perfect place to have a family gathering.  You can have a nice hearty and delicious dinner for 12 people for less than $100, and that includes drinks a bunch of food left over to take home.\n\nMy favorite dishes here are:\n\nBeef Westlake Style Soup.\nSalty Fish and Chicken Fried Rice\nHong Kong Style Pan Fried Noodles\nPeking Duck\nPeking Pork Chops\nFried Flounder w/ Black Bean Sauce\nSpicy Eggplant w/ Tofu\n\nThe staff is always friendly.  As with all Dim Sum style restaurants, don't be afraid to flag down the cart lady, and if that doesn't work, flag down the waitress and tell her what you want.  They always seem willing to help in the event that you get skipped over in the rotation.\n\n\nIn the event that you are in need of banquet service, this is a very viable option.  I had 85+ people come celebrate my wife's birthday a few years ago, and this restaurant did not disappoint.

That is about all this place had to offer. After years of not going to Red Lobster, I decided to try it again for their \"crabfest\" special. Unfortunately, I was reminded of why I quit going here. Upon arriving, we were greeted by a large party with mainly young kids that were screaming and being abnoxious. UNCLE RANDY!!!! God you would think they hadn't seen their uncle, well, ever! Anyways, we were finally seated, unfortunately, not nearly far enough away from the hoards of screaming kids and babies. My husband and I do not have kids nor do we want them. We love to be able to go out to dinner but its gotten to the point where most restaurants are \"family friendly\" which usually entails jerk kids and parents that have learned to tune them out. Quite irritating and inconsiderate actually. \nIn any event, I opted for the crab trio which came with king crab legs, snow crab legs, and crab stuffed shrimp. I ordered the creamy lobster mashed potatoes and a cup of the clam chowder. The hub ordered the shrimp trio which came with two types of shrimp (can't remember what they were but when i asked the hub, he stated \"sh*t, mostly just sh*t.\") and schrimp pasta. He officially hates Red Lobster if you couldnt tell. Both him and I agreed that most of our food tasted as if it was frozen and from a bag. The clam chowder tasted canned. The cheesy sauce on my potatoes along with my shrimp tasted fowl and almost had a chemical taste to it. And most importantly, the biscuits which we had looked forward so much to were overcooked and dry. These used to be the best part of the meal but they have really gone downhill. Actually the restaurant in general has gone downhill. \nThe service was ok but I have one complaint. Although they give you crab crackers, they don't give you the other little gadget that you use to tear the crab so its easier to open. This would have helped alot when I was eating my king crab legs considering that they are thorny and sharp. Not worth cutting up my petite cute little hands to get a little bit of crab meat. Haha.\nTo wrap it up, we will never go back unless we have company and they want to go there. Then I guess we would have to find something to choke down. It sucks because we used to love Red Lobster when they first came out but the quality of, well, everything has gone down throughout the years. The price however, I am fairly certain has gone up. If I am going to pay nearly $40 for a meal, I expect it to be fresh and magnificent, and I expect to not see a misbehaved child in sight.

On this particular night, we decided to go because my boyfriend had a $25 gift card. The gift card helped with the cost, but dinner was still around $30 out of pocket (and that's with their new 4 courses for $14.99) deal and no alcohol. \n\nWe decided to order an appetizer (calamari) and that was the best thing we ate all night! The new england clam chower soup was a joke!! It was really watery and I found myself having to add salt and pepper for more flavor. I didn't even finish it and new england clam chowder is my favorite soup!!\n\nNext was a caesar salad, which was good. For my entree, I had the grilled honey BBQ shrimp. I was really unimpressed and thought it was bland. For dessert, I had the brownie. It was a good portion size for the amount of food I had already eaten and tasted good.\n\nAt this location, I felt uncomortable with our server. He never looked at my boyfriend when he came to our table and was coming over to check on us constantly to see if we needed anything. It was annoying and distracted my boyfriend and I from any conversation we were having at the time. We still tipped him well but both felt uncomfortable.\n\nNeedless to say, I will not be venturing to Red Lobster anytime soon. I feel as though there are much better seafood places for a better or more reasonable price.", "business_id": "txCJurIIrE9ZoHu3gZUvnQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-07-30", "type": "review"}

The onions were sweet from being in the pan caramelizing, and the bacon had that crispy salty taste, salty/sweet combo is one of my favorite things.

So perfect!  \nThen we ordered the Tiramisu and the Dessert Rosa to split. The Tiramisu, was very eye pleasing when the plate was presented to us, but it was just too much for me, it tasted like a very drunk tiramisu, the lady fingers were very soaked in the espresso liqueur, or it could have been the rum in the cake, either way, it was too strong for me, which bummed me out because Tiramisu is one of my favorite desserts.  \nThe Dessert Rosa, which just by reading it, I wasn't very thrilled about it, but my best friend swore it was good when we ordered it.

Do not trust any reviews older than 2 months. \n\nThis used to be one of my wife's and my top 3 favorite restaurants. During the last several months we were noticing cost cutting measures being implemented, such as the olive oil jars being removed from the tables and only portioned out by the staff (I can't stand referring to them as servers, it feels degrading). But the food was always top notch. Then, suddenly, about 2 months ago the management was replaced because apparently the cost cutting measures weren't enough. \n\nNow, this is a completely different experience. Honestly, if I had never eaten here before the food would be good if it was a $14 per person restaurant. But compared to what it used to be and the fact that if you order an appetizer it's at least $25 per person, \"never again\". \n\nI'll start with the calamari appetizer. Once lightly breaded and perfectly tender, it is now over done, bland and artless. The previously chunky, mouth watering marinara dipping sauce was watered down and soupy. My personal favorite Ricardo sauce used to have loads of fresh sliced peppers and tang, now it tasted only of melted butter with a couple of diced veggies on top and left a film in my mouth. \n\nMy wife's salad tasted the same as always, but my sausage lentil soup was suddenly mealy and lacked the flavor I used to crave. \n\nWe ordered the sirloin marsala, and while the taste was similar, the sauce was thin and my steak was noticeably tougher. Also they only had one vegetable selection instead of two or three like always. If you didn't like broccoli that night you were out of luck. \n\nIn short, while decent if it was a cheap Italian dinner on the go, the recent cost-cutting changes to the menu render this $25 per person restaurant a no fly zone.", "business_id": "cKxXBvOithS-Ic5KnhEKrg", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-08-16", "type": "review"}

Right off the bat I noticed the atmosphere was pretty nice, nothing over the top, but enjoyable.  I also noticed that the wait staff knew their shit.  Our waitress explained all the specials and recommended her favorites without hesitation.  The real highlight was before our food came when the manager came over and asked us if it was our first time.  He then brought us a shrimp cocktail on the house to kick off our meal.  \n\nThe second visit was for a friend's birthday.  We ordered a round of chocolate cake shots and the manager showed up to mix them himself and bought us our first round.  He also gave us each recipes to take home with us. \n\nThe food on both occasions was great, I haven't had a good cut of meat like it since I left the midwest.

The first of the last two visits they transposed the order for my wife and I for our steak, when the manager came out to speak with us and rectify this....he did the exact same thing! By the time our steaks arrived after sending them back twice, we were no longer hungry after finishing the baked potato and salad and we were running out of patience. They went good for it and reduced our bill which was nice.\nThis last time my wife's steak came out very rare and as timing would have it,  it was the manager who checked on us just as she was first cutting into it. He took it back and again my wife worked on the baked potato and had no room left for the steak. The waitress also failed to bring out a wedge salad for one of the other guests in our party. She returned with our meals so getting a salad at that point seemed a waste. It also took some time before our drinks arrived as well.\n\nThe management again took my wifes steak off the bill and offered our two other guests a dessert for the salad mistake.  My steak was more rare than medium but I ate it anyway and it just wasn't that good, sad to say, as we really love the location and the outdoor seating. 40 minute travel from the house which we may not make again for quite a while.", "business_id": "xMK01ZbVUYLLoyqoeWAIVw", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-06-16", "type": "review"}

They are less expensive than Durant's/Fleming's but more expensive than Outback/Texas Roadhouse. Likewise their steaks are less tasty than Durant's/Fleming's but more expensive than Outback/Texas Roadhouse.\n\nWith that said, each of the aforementioned places has their positives and negatives. Durants is really pricey but they very well may have the best steak in town to go along with their interesting atmosphere. You can cowboy it up at Texas Roadhouse where throwing peanut shells on the floor is allowed/encouraged. Fleming's is that classy place where you have a whole slew of wines to chose from to have with your supper.\n\nSo to take it all in and get the happy medium I think that is The Keg. The steaks are really good there. I would put them on par with Fleming's but obviously not as expensive. Neither myself or the girlfriend has had a complaint about the steak there. The price isn't too hateful there either. And the atmosphere can be as good or better than Fleming's depending where you are. The only thing Fleming's is going to have over the Keg in service is that at the Keg you will have one server that handles everything. Versus Fleming's where you very well may have three servers - one for drinks, one for orders, and one for food (you may not, but I've had special people come and only pour wine, etc). Fleming's isn't quite at the Delmonico's level (Vegas) as far as service.\n\nReally, for the money I think the Keg is the best. Food is great as is service.
