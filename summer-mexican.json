The tofu tacos minus the bean sprouts.  The California grilled salad.  The chickpea chili and black bean soup, the potato taquitos.  Nachos, chips & salsa, and guacamole are all decent.  Their sides are ridiculously huge and the desserts are all ok (except the sopapillas).  Basically, stick to the least authentic stuff and you should be fine.\n\nAdditionally, some of their entrees are available with your choice of either chicken, steak, shrimp, portobello mushrooms or tofu.  They have tons of vegetarian options.  They have good happy hour deals and good late night margarita deals.  They have raspberry, strawberry, mango, and kiwi margaritas year round, with one or two seasonal flavors per month, plus a full bar, a bunch of tequilas and a huge, varied beer list that tends to focus on local beers.\n\nSo basically: the less you know about Mexican food, the less disappointed you will be.

I personally like my burrito \"con todo,\" except for sour cream.  The hot sauce they put on it? Fantastic.  A burrito from this place is a solid, high-density mass of stomach-filling bliss.\n\nAnother upshot is it's not like any other burrito you're going to get in town.  It's a great combo of fresh and rich flavors.  \n\nThere are only two complaints I have, and there's only one REAL complaint I have.  The real complaint is that the line sometimes gets really long, and it takes a while to get served.  The fake complaint is that it weirds me out a little that they toss the burrito in the microwave for a bit at the end (seems like a Sheetz move to me,) but it really don't affect the quality of the food, so who cares?\n\nAs for the store itself?

I think this Monterrey has been around for a LONG time (since I was in high school and that was back when Hwy 51 was only 2 lanes...).  I was immediately seated when I walked in, but it took a while for my waiter to get to me.  Though once he did, he was attentive and expedient.  As soon as I was seated, a basket of warm, tasty chips; a small saucer of their salsa, which was a deep red, maybe roasted ingredients?, and not loaded down with cilantro, so I was in love; and a little bowl of heaven, which has been described in the other reviews as white dip, which tasted a little like a thin sour cream with taco seasoning in it - YUM!  It was all I could do to not fill myself up on these 3 delicious starters.\n\nMy order:\nQueso with jalapeno dip ($5) - I have to order queso whenever I go to a Mexican resturant - it's an addiction.  A delicious, dairy addiction.  Served in a large dish, it was very good - perfect thickness without being too thick.  The warm chips held up well.\nBeef burrito + beef taco + rice lunch special (less than $6) - the taco was in a shell that held up to my crunching, filled with mostly beef, with a sprinkling of lettuce and a healthy dose of shredded white cheese on top.  The beef burrito was a medium size, filled with the same beef as the taco, covered with red sauce and a sprinkling of cheese.  Served with spanish rice that was on the better side of the rice that I have been served at Mexican restaurants - quite good.\nThey serve Pepsi products, so I had a Mountain Dew, which for some reason was the most delicious Mountain Dew I have ever had.  \n\nThe dip, lunch entree and drink were right around $13 - I was completely stuffed, but not miserable.

After those 10 minutes passed, one of the other girls got up and retrieved a menu from the un-manned hostess stand, and brought it back to me. It was at this moment that a server asked me if I wanted a drink menu. He handed it to me, and left me to pore over it for about 5 more minutes. I finally stopped him to ask him for a glass of water and a sex on the beach. The water came out, and he began to scurry away. At this point, the other two members of my party were receiving their plates, and while he was setting their food down I asked if I could order. I ordered a taco salad. The food came out only about 3 minutes after my drink, which I ordered long before. The service was slow, the plates were dirty, and silverware/straws needed to be requested before you received them. I was overall unhappy with the service and the food at this establishment.

I have been eating at Zapata's since 2002, and like a fine wine, the place gets better with time. \n\nWe arrived around 7pm on a rainy Thursday evening.  (If you've never been to Zapata's in University Area before, it can be kinda tricky to locate.  It is in the back left of the plaza.)  When my date and I walked in, we were greeted by a friendly gentleman host, who gave us the option of sitting upstairs or downstairs.  Since we've seen the place before, we chose to sit upstairs.  \n\nNo sooner were we seated, when warm tortilla chips, and two bowls of fresh pico were placed before us.  Tecate was on special, so I gladly order one, my date ordered a coke that didn't taste quite right. (YOU MIGHT WANT TO STAY AWAY FROM THE SODAS.)  Our drinks, including ice-cold water; were brought to us within minutes.  My drink came in a can, however it was accompanied with a frosted-mug and fresh lime.  \n\nI order the fajitas-burrito, my date ordered the (grilled) shrimp tacos.  Both orders arrived promptly and smoking hot to our table.   On my plate was a giant burrito stuffed with chicken and steak (I always get the mix), beans, cheese, peppers, and onions, etc.  The outside of the massive burrito was smothered in melted cheeses including guacamole and sour-cream which were splattered across the top.  The shrimp-tacos looked just as appealing.  Both entree's were brought to our tables on extremely hot plates. and were surrounded by warm refried-beans and yellow rice - cooked to perfection.  \n\nWe both loved our meals.  We both had plenty to put in a box and take home for a late-night snack or lunch tomorrow.  \n\nThere is much debate amongst life-long UCBers about which is the best Mexican restaurant in the University Area; with the contestants being Monterrey, Los Arcos, or Zapata's.  My nod goes to Zapata's by a smidgen over Monterrey!\n\n\nOur Bill: 1 coke, 1 Tecate, 2 waters, 1 fajitas-burrito, 1 shrimp-taco = $30.00\n\nService:  The service is simply amazing.  I've probably been to Zapata's over 20 times, and even though I've have had a few not so tasty meals, the SERVICE has always been top-notch. \n\nBEWARE OF:  **If you get the shrimp tacos, I recommend them grilled.  **Watch for the pulled-chicken.  It's not so tasty compared to the chicken-breast or steak.  **$2.25 Tecate cans on Thursday nights.  **You can get a steak/chicken mix with the burritos", "business_id": "rg1-6A-8SKXGh_p-Abbyxg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-08-11", "type": "review"}

The restaurant was busy, but there was an empty table right inside the back door. I walked over to the station at the base of the stairs and asked if we needed to wait or if we could just sit at the empty table and was told to go ahead and take a seat.\n\nFast forward a couple of minutes and an employee approaches the table to ask us why we're sitting there. I explained that I was told it was okay, and after a short conversation with the person who told me we could sit there, the employee went about his business. We were given chips and salsa (chips were slightly stale and had no salt on them at all; salsa was AMAZING but served in horribly inconvenient bowls that caused a mess every time you dipped into them) and ordered beers and waters. The beers arrived quickly, but we had to ask not one but TWO more times before we finally got our water.\n\nFood-wise, I ordered the Enchiladas Suizas, which were extremely bland. My friend enjoyed his Pollo Borracho, mostly because of the sauce, but overall the food wasn't impressive. Getting our waitress to come back to our table to refill anything (salsa, chips, drinks) or to bring us our check was next to impossible. Honestly the only reason I'm giving Zapata's two stars instead of just one is because I know they were busy (and obviously that affects the quality of service) and because my friend enjoyed his meal, though I didn't like mine.

We stumbled upon this place on our way back from Rock Hill to Charlotte. We were hungry and hung over and said, \"what the heck\". Oddly, the first thing that I noticed, aside from the cliche feel of everyone Mexican-themed restaurant in the USA decorations, was that NONE of the waitstaff was Hispanic. HAHA! I don't think I'd ever seen that  before.\n\nOur waiter greeted us nearly as soon as we walked through the door. He was very polite and professional if not nearly uncomfortably nervous. But I think that was just his soft-spoken way.\n\nThe place was nearly empty but then again it was noon on a Sunday so most folk in the area were prolly at church or something. Our waiter sat us and even made some suggestions and clarifications about the menu which is always welcomed.\n\nFirst off the chips; they were NOT bad by any stretch of the imagination. But they looked like they came out of a bag instead of made in their kitchen. Albeit, they were nicely hot but they were all the same exact shape and thickness and they just looked overall unnaturally processed. they were pretty standard and tasted like Santitas (the commercially available bag you can get at any grocery store). The salsa, although bland, was surprisingly spicy. I mean, it gave my tongue a nice sear all around. Becky noticed it too. Not much in the way of flavor though.\n\nThe biggest black mark here, which is pretty negligible in the grand scheme of things, is that they brought our plates one at a time. Becky ordered some meat with chile sauce which came first. They put the plate in front of her and I had to wait a few minutes before mine arrived. I ordered an entree with two burritos.\n\nNone of the food was anything to write home about. Just another Mexican-themed restaurant in the seemingly interminable sea of sameness.\n\nAll in all, I had a decent meal at a forgettable establishment that we'll probably not go out of way to revisit... unless we're driving back from Rock Hill to Charlotte really hung over again.", "business_id": "1UQpjv4QuD5l_ZT7O4p6Rw", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-06-21", "type": "review"}

I have never come away unimpressed with either the food or the service.  I can't really speak to authenticity since I wouldn't really know it if I saw it, but for what they do Mi Cocina does it well.  All I do know is that I have gotten my favorites here over and over without ever having any problems.  The staff is always friendly and fast which sets the place apart from several other area restaurants of the genre.  If only for consistency I would rate Mi Cocina a three, and with never having a bad meal I definitely would go with a high 3.5 - 4 stars.\n\nLast time I had the fried tilapia tacos, and I especially enjoyed the spicy cream-based sauce that was served on the side.  It was perfectly seasoned for my taste, though it was a bit hot for my mother.  The tilapia was lightly fried and was still tender.  The accompanying refried beans were decent, and served to allow for the spice from the tacos to dissipate.  I still put the blackened tilapia tacos at Tex Tubbs at the top of my favorites list, but these easily jumped to the #2 position.  On previous trips I've gotten flautas, which were perfectly fried and not too crispy, and the enchiladas sonora, which comes with an excellent spinach and a creamy sauce.  I also really enjoy the cheese and mushroom quesidilla and the fajitas.  My sister, who is lactose-intolerant, had found the menu a bit dairy-laden, but she did end up finding a chicken breast entree that is now her favorite.  The prices are quite reasonable and given the amount of food always a good deal.  Mi Cocina probably won't ever be held up as a paragon of the style, but it has always been reliable and enjoyable and for that I'll keep coming back.", "business_id": "77ESrCo7hQ96VpCWWdvoxg", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-06-16", "type": "review"}

The waiter brought us chips and salsa immediately, and then took our drink orders.  Within a few minutes, our sodas arrived, along with a cheese dip.\n\nWe quickly scarfed down the salsa and cheese dip; the salsa was initially mild but then had a nice little kick to it at the end.  The chips were a thicker cut chip; they weren't the slightest bit greasy.  The queso was excellent - nice and hearty, white cheese, delicious.\n\nWe ordered our entrees and within minutes our food was available.  There was a slight mix-up with my order - I had requested chicken burritos but received beef.  No big deal; the beef burritos were decent - some chunks of potato were an interesting touch.\n\nMy dining partner ordered a sampler plate, which came with a chicken burrito, a chicken enchilada, and a tamale.  It was good as well; the chicken was far better than the ground beef.\n\nService was beyond excellent - very fast, very attentive, and as such, we left a nice tip.  Only complaints?

I say this as someone who is very much a gringo. \n\nTo talk about what was good, I sort of have to cover where there's room for improvement first. It'll make more sense that way.\n\n* The first cup I received for my drink had a huge crack all the way down the side of it that leaked Coca-Cola all over the table. I really don't know how they missed this one, but it was about one firm grasp from giving a guest an unexpected shower. \n\n* The men's room could use some attention. It didn't look like it was dirty, so much as that it needed a bit of maintenance. I have a couple of pictures I plan to upload, but I'm not sure they do the scene justice. The sealant attaching the urinals to the walls has begun to peel and the porcelain itself is discolored. There is a sheet of mirrored stainless steel that has, over the years, become tarnished and hazy by age and presumably some less-than-gentle washings. Covering most of that mirror was a half filled-out world cup bracket (at this point the tournament has been over for more than a month) declaring Mexico the winner (nope). My fianc\u00e9e reported a similar condition in the women's room.\n\n* The service was...Abrupt? Curt? Brusque? You know what I'm trying to say. It's not that  either the hostess, the guy who brought chips, or the server were rude--they weren't--but neither were they particularly hospitable. Requests, questions, etc were--whenever possible--met simply with emotionless, quick, monosyllabic affirmations.\n\n* The food came out disconcertingly quick. I recognize that this is a weird thing to bring up as a negative, but understand that the time from placing our order to the food arriving was probably less than 10 minutes. Being quick is great, but even Applebee's isn't that quick and they just microwave things. In fairness to the restaurant, Mexican food lends itself well to being put in a pot and kept heated, then served out as necesarry and I'm sure that is what happened. Their menu states that their food is made fresh daily, but I've frozen burrito filling I've made at home and gotten the same exact texture as what I was served here so I would question that bit.\n\nThe positive, and there is some:\n\n* For a quick burrito that I suspect was frozen that morning, it was actually pretty good. The flavors were all well blended and the result was something I was happy to eat. I ordered a burrito that was covered in a delicious cheesy, creamy sauce (the Rio something, I don't remember). That cheese has just the right texture and flavor to complement the burrito and I can't recommend it highly enough. It might be a bit heavy if you're not into cheese though. \n\n* The fresh salsa brought to the table had good flavor. It wasn't as hot as I'd like for myself, but when I'm with my better half I'm used to compromising on hotness, so it was okay (even though I'm coming down with a cold and I was hoping to find a food that would clear out my sinuses!).\n\n* The prices were outstanding. I would have expected to pay 1.5x the price of what they charge for any of their dishes at most restaurants. With certain lunch specials you can eat for a little over $5, more if you get a drink. That's just wonderful.\n\nUltimately, I'd recommend this place to friends and family who I know aren't ready for a \"real\" Mexican experience. It is what it is, and the food is tasty enough. 3/5.", "business_id": "S4TWo9X6b3gU6uucj4JN3g", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-08-29", "type": "review"}

And they came out in really good time! \n\nThe only complaint I have is the prices for margaritas - $10 and it didn't taste like a drop of tequila was in it :( other than that we will definitely be coming back, without ordering the margaritas.", "business_id": "S4TWo9X6b3gU6uucj4JN3g", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-08-20", "type": "review"}

This had been my go-to place for beans-and-rice Mexican in Madison for the better part of two decades, and I had converted my wife into a Pedro's fan. I'd had past or present Madison residents take issue with my insistence that Pedro's was a great casual dinner place, but I took that as part and parcel of Madison's legendary disdain for anything that's not edgy/hip/contemporary/iconoclastic/whatever. And old-school American-Mexican food is certainly none of the above, plus it represents one of the the greatest societal faux-pas of our time -- *gasp!* -- cultural appropriation! \n\nUnfortunately, it turns out any snobbery -- incidental or otherwise -- toward Pedro's may be warranted. My wife and I stopped in for the first time in 3 or 4 years and we were both sorely disappointed with our experience. The burrito is smaller than it used to be -- I suppose that's how they've been able to hold the line on prices so the size reduction is probably justified -- but my wife's fajitas were chewy, and both dishes lacked that \"kick\" that they used to have. Our quesadilla appetizer arrived luke-warm and was nearly rock-hard within minutes.\n\nThe premises haven't changed in the nearly 20 years I've been eating there and it's starting to show its age. Service was adequate, no more no less. which would be fine if everything else up to par.  In short, Pedro's lacks that extra spark that used to make it worth a special stop when visiting or passing through town. Not to mention the Mexican cuisine options have exploded in Madison in the last 20 years, so one would think Pedro's would need to step up their game rather than rest on their laurels.

It was never one of my favorite places in Madison, but I did enjoy it occasionally. I'm generally underwhelmed by the Americanized Mexican places that dot maps of most towns.\n\nHaving just returned from a trip to Seattle and wanting to sit down in an air conditioned building and have some okay food, my dad recommended Pedro's. It seemed like a fine option at the time. Not terribly adventurous, but I just had my adventure and I had to accommodate my dad's less-than-thrill-seeking palette.\n\nThe salsa was actually better yesterday than I ever remember it being in the past. It was very thick and tomato-ey, with just a tiny hint of kick. I'd have preferred it to be a bit hotter, myself, but again, being with the parental unit meant keeping to something a bit more tame.\n\nI had the asada burrito, and my dad had the chili burrito. Mine was fine; long strips of pepper and onion mixed in with some cubed steak (actually, I would recommend cutting the veggies to about half their length...they're too easy to pull completely out of the tortilla when you go to get a bite). I had a side of refried beans and rice; these were obviously simple sizes for the cooks because they were clearly just microwaved. It was easy to tell because the rice was pretty dry. The chili burrito was exactly what my dad was hoping for, so there's that.\n\nAll in all, if you know what you're in for it's very standard American-Mexican fare. \n\nAs an aside, the previous time I was here a few years ago they had this fantastically gay waiter named Jimmy.

That was fine, but the bar was a clusterfrak of odd people. But whatever, we were there for margaritas and mediocre tacos. We knew what we were getting ourselves into. \n\nThere was a sign on the wall that said \"Moon Man only $2.00\" and I was super excited. New Glarus Moon Man is my favorite beer, and this was a bargain price! Sadly, the beer I was served was not Moon Man. I asked the bartender lady, \"Is this Moon Man or Blue Moon\" and she promised it was Moon Man. She smiled and said, \"I tried it last night, it's kinda lemony isn't it?\" Moon Man is hoppy and delicious, but not overly lemony. This mystery beer Pedro's is claiming to be Moon Man tastes weirdly of margarita syrup and I was really disappointed. Also, the behind-the-bar area is nasty and needs a good cleaning/gut job.\n\nThe food was worse than I remember it ever being, and my friend's sampler platter featured a god-awful steak quesadilla. As I was eating my chicken taco, I kept thinking how it was so much worse than a shredded chicken taco I had a Taco Bell recently. The problem with that is the fact that the TB taco was $5 cheaper.\n\nAt one point, the bartender went from merely okay to completely unprofessional. I understand that she was the only bartender working on a very busy Thursday, but still. She pretty much yelled at some customers for asking her to ring up their bill. When they said their waitress hadn't checked back on them for a very long time, the bartender still insisted they find their waitress and deal with it. Terrible customer service.\n\nIf you want decent Mexican food, go elsewhere. If you are craving a margarita, go elsewhere.

Being a city girl who has tried about a million Mexican places, granted I was drunk and it was 3am for most of those experiences, I didn't know what to expect from central Illinois.  Thankfully, I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nI cruised the menu for my standby favorites but I spotted a Hawaiian fajita.  It was huge.  Seriously, I ate as much as I could and handed the rest to my boyfriend.  Even after both of us ate a ton, half the entree was still on the plate.  Wowza.  And let me tell you, it tasted great.  Perfect blend of authentic Mexican flavors and textures with a bit of a Hawaiian twist.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\nI'd also like to give them kudos on their guacamole.  It is so refreshing to find a place that doesn't overload the guac with lemon juice to preserve it.  I also appreciated that it wasn't too spicy, something that has been hit or miss lately.\n\nWe were there on a Tuesday night in early August so I wasn't at all surprised that they were pretty slow.

If we ever return for dinner, I will update, but for now, I'll just say this place is really unremarkable and disappointing and that there are *way* better places to go for happy hour. \n\nWe went for happy hour on Friday around 5:45 pm and sat in the bar at one of the high tables. There were only 3-4 other people in the bar area, (and maybe 6-8 in the rest of the restaurant) but it still took the bartender about 5 minutes to come over and take our drink order. I got the Grand Canyon Margarita (featuring cranberry and citrus juices), and my husband got the Cactus Margarita (basically the house margarita). Both were $3. We wanted to order some bar food as well, but again, it took him about 10 minutes to return with our drinks and take our food order, even though the bar was still quite empty. After already being irritable with the slow service (having both worked in restaurants, we are very understanding of how stressful it is to handle a lot of tables or drink orders, but the restaurant was so empty that there was just no excuse), the slow service was not the only bad part of our first experience at Sam's Cafe. \n\nThe next negative was that the margaritas were so sweet and weak, they might as well just have charged us $3 each for juice. Then, it took another 15-20 minutes for us to get our bar food (carnitas cheese crisp, jalapeno poppers, and southwestern bruschetta) and when it finally came, it was all cold! We noticed that no one else in the bar area had gotten food, but all of a sudden, the bartender emerged from the back with an enormous tray of food and served everyone who had been waiting for food at once. Having worked in many restaurants, I know that one of the main rules of good service is that someone should take food out as soon as it's ready so that it doesn't get cold, and that as a server, I was responsible for doing so even if the food wasn't for my table. Either the bartender should have been checking in the back more frequently for food that was ready or someone else (like the manager, who kept wandering around in a daze but never appeared to be doing much) should have done him a favor (if he was really that busy) and brought it out. \n\nThe third negative was that most of the food was not good at all. I know not to expect too much from bar food, especially when it was seriously discounted for happy hour, but two of the things we ordered were just bad. The carnitas cheese crisp was not light and crispy with gooey cheese; instead, it was a heavy and greasy flour tortillas covered in congealed cheese and dry shredded pork. Not good. The jalapeno poppers and boneless chicken wings were also terrible - Jack in the Box has better poppers and the chicken wings were straight out of a Tyson resealable bag. The Southwestern Bruschetta was fine, although it was very oily, and I have a hard time understanding how merely adding a ton of cilantro to a tomato mix makes something \"southwestern.\" None of the food items was more than $5, but I have been to *many* other happy hours where you can get solid, flavorful appetizers for between $2 - $5. Kincaid's and McCormick & Schmick's are two great examples. \n\nThe final kicker of our bad happy hour experience was when we asked the bartender for a check and he tried to pressure us to order more even though we said several times that we were finished. I believe the exact line was, \"Are you sure you don't want anything else? More drinks? More food? Some shots?\" Maybe I'm crazy, but I don't think you should order more to *make* your experience somewhere better; rather, you should order more *because* you're having such a good time. As persuasive as his \"selling techniques\" were, we weren't (having a good time), so we didn't (order more).", "business_id": "e5kc0CQ4R-PCCDgb274gSg", "stars": 2, "date": "2008-06-29", "type": "review"}

The dressing was very good, but the calamari was over-fried and the cucumbers were mushy and disgusting.  \n\nLong story short, for lunch I had lettuce with good dressing and amazing chips and salsa for $15.

That was because I wanted to sit outside and there was a big crowd at the time, sort of a convention that must have all gone to eat at once.  Okay, that was fine. I waited at the bar and ordered iced tea, with no offer of sweetener.  Waited and was seated about 1/2 hour later.  Sat, and the menu looked good.  Ordered enchiladas.  When they came out so quickly I was surprised.  When I saw them, I couldn't help but think they had been sitting in a warming dish and that is why they were prepared so quickly.  Taste was lackluster.  \"Salad\" served with it was more like some chopped lettuce, that I couldn't tell if dressing had been put on it or not.  If there was I couldn't taste it.  Cheese on top was a sort of creamy cheese sauce, nothing to write home about.  Served on rice, it was sort of dry and not really hot...thus my thinking that they were sort of held warm until served.  No cheddar cheese, no guacamole, no beans.  This dish needed help!!!  Started to check in on YELP to rate while I was sitting there and noticed that I got a free dessert with my meal by checking in.  Had the cheesecake which was thick...if that is the word.  Bill was $14, which I thought was fair.  Had better.  If you are really desperate for good TexMex, and don't mind a drive, the Hyatt Gainey Ranch hotel in Scottsdale, yes hotel food, is amazing and a view to die for.

Both started to run and I loved every minute.  When your body reacts, you know you're eating good salsa.  My Pepsi came soon after wards and it was the largest drink I've ever been served save for a liter of beer I had at a German tavern in New York City.\n\nMy food arrived soon after wards and it was served on a scorching hot plate.  Everything was delicious and I think they make their own refried beans.  Possibly the best beans I've had at a Mexican place.\n\nThe dining area is larger than a fast food joint but smaller than your typical restaurant.  Not long after I arrived it started to fill up quickly.  Expect to wait a few minutes at peak times.\n\nSadly this structure was an impenetrable fortress for my phone and I was unable to officially do a Yelp check in but, eh, I cannot hold that against the Comedor.\n\nI'd like to note that quite a few of the patrons were Hispanic and that, to me, is always a good sign when eating at a Mexican joint.\n\nI have been waiting to find a Mexican restaurant that I can officially dub as the best I've had.  I am confident I can dub thee, Comedor Guadalajara, as the best I have had.  Can't wait to take any visitors I have here.", "business_id": "BESmH-lmMm34_EefL8X9fQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-06-09", "type": "review"}

I saw they had Happy Hour deals so i went there a little early to have a drink in their bar or cantina except for they don't have one.  Bummer.  We had 7 people in our party and they don't take reservations so I put our name in ahead of time and just sat in the waiting area.  Another member of our party arrived too with the same thought I had to have a drink in the bar while waiting for the others to arrive.  The owner or manager was in the front at the hostess table and he was nice enough to let us go ahead and get seated while we waited for the rest of our party.  This was smart because my friend and I and ultimately a 3rd guest arrived and we had washed down 5 beers until the rest arrived.  You don't make money with people waiting to be seated.\n\nWe started off with appetizers of a couple of orders of cheese crisps and a side of guacamole.  wow were these good.  I totally recommend these to anybody for starters.  For dinner I ordered the Carne Asada Tampeque\u00f1a.  It was Carne Asada, a cheese enchilada, rice, beans, tortillas and a side garnish of lettuce, tomatoes and guacamole.  Great meal at a great price.  i could barely finish it.  I love horchata and noticed they had it on the menu so I ordered a glass of it and it came in HUGE cup served over ice.  Tastiest horchata I've had in a long time.  For dessert I heard the Churros & Ice Cream was to die for so I tried it.  Holy hell is that good and a great idea.  if I can't have my fried ice cream, this definately ranks right up there.  The churros were hot and crispy and along with the vanilla flavored ice cream I wanted with it, I will be definitely getting that again!\n\nI would give CG 5 stars but I have to take a star off for location.  It is in a dicey part of town but there were security guards watching the parking lot and parking when I left the restaurant at around 8 was a zoo so if you come in during prime dinner time you might have a hard time finding a spot.  While CG is very good unless I'm going to downtown for something, I probably wouldn't go back just for dinner and find something closer to me and in a better location.", "business_id": "BESmH-lmMm34_EefL8X9fQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-08-10", "type": "review"}

We've been back 5-6 times since then and can't get enough of anything they serve. Even the rice and beans are outstanding!.\n\nThe weekend only beef soup is probably my favorite but can only order on the weekends. The chicken soup is so rich and flavorful, I doubt I can ever truly enjoy anyone else's and the 7 mares seafood soup, well, that's in a class all it's own....hell, all of their soups are in a class all their own. One big downfall though, after eating here you're ready to collapse into a food coma....in a good way.\n\nEverything we've tried has been outstanding except the carne asada. The carne was a bit thin and way over cooked. The pork carnitas were very good but a little overcooked also. However, all fish/seafood and chicken dishes have been amazing and have found Comedor Guadalajara definitely the most authentic Mexican restaurant in the Phoenix area. I've tried most of the Mexican Restaurants and this has been the best overall. The typical 30-60 minute average wait during dining high times should give you a clue but look at who's eating here, families. Groups of 8-15+ in a party let alone us couples and smaller parties. When large families gather at a restaurant, you know it's got to be good!\n\nOverall, pricing is very reasonable, and definitely an excellent value for the portion sizes offered.

But I have to say I have a new favorite with the shredded beef burro. Classically simple, chunks of beef with beans and cheese. Whatever they marinate their meat is awesome, and I am generally not a meat fan. Long story short, skip the Fili B's on every corner, and venture into the strip mall. Can't beat the $1.99 margaritas either!", "business_id": "D09yG6Z3gcsh24Qn7Y4gYA", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-08-15", "type": "review"}

They are little half tortillas that are crisp and simple.  The salsa is heavy on the cilantro, but its chunky with good flavor.  I'm all about the big chunks of tomato in my salsa.\n\nMY FAVORITE CHILE RELLENO\nI've been ordering this big beast of a relleno stuffed full of chicken for years.  The chicken inside is simply grilled chicken and its covered in some gooey cheese.  The pepper is a little bit random in heat - sometimes I sweat like a B while shoveling away, and sometimes it's rather mild. The batter they cook it in is different than most rellenos, its sort of crumby and dark, but delicious.  The sauce is some simple looking orange sauce with some sour cream in it - sorry, I can't cook so my skills in ingredient identification suck - I just know it's delicious!  My favorite.  I order it every time I'm there.\n\nI visit this Mi Amigos every time I'm in the area looking for food.  I can't remember the last Arizona Center place I ate at other than Mi Amigos.

Heard about it through yelp. The geography was right, the reviews were great,  so we thought let's give it a shot. Now if you're a fan of Mexican food from chain restaurants like manuel's or ajo al's, this is not the place for you. this is AUTHENTIC Mexican food. Probably the best in the valley. I was a die-hard via delosantos fan and shouted from the rooftops about how great that place is. I will still say that. But there's a new numero uno on my list! \n\nThe green salsa is nice and spicy the way I like it. I don't like having to pay for chips. They should be complementary. But paying the $1 for these is worth it. They are fried to order so they come out crisp and hot. The guacamole is creamy with nice chunks of avocado throughout. \n\nI ordered the chicharones because I was feeling adventurous and had never tried it before. Looking it up on Google described it as fried pork rinds so that's what I was expecting. Unfortunately I got soggy pieces of skin. Maybe that's the way they are supposed to be. I don't know. The flavor wad good but the texture wasn't appealing. The menu also states that this dish is \"very hot.\" It was the complete opposite with hardly any spice to it at all. I won't be ordering that again. The bites I had of my nephew's carne asada chimichanga was to die for though! \n\nEveryone raved about the beans here being the best ever... and they got it right! Delicious flavor. Probably made the authentic way with lard, but does it really matter at this point? I'm eating pig skin anyway! \n\nService was great! We were waited on by a lovely older Hispanic woman that has been there for over 20 years. She was so pleasant she kept bringing a smile to my face. \n\nThis is definitely my new favorite Mexican joint, not just for trips to and from the airport.

The billboards of the giant super 3-lb. burrito finally cast a spell on me, and I took the plunge.\n\nLa Tolteca is not quite as full service as Ranch Market, but it's somewhat of a smaller version where you'll find a counter-service deli, panaderia, carniceria, jugeria, and a mini-market here.  Even better is their cooking tools section (where you can buy huge tamale steamers, and mortar and pestles for making chile) and the catering menu which starts at $5 per person.  Holy crap.  What a steal.  \n\nUpon entrance you'll see the deep pit outside where some man is grilling all the carne you'll find served inside.  As you step inside you'll see some brisk business - I found all sorts of types and ethnicities here - a young couple on a date, some girls gabbing over lunch and others ordering food and pastries to go.\n\nThe food here ROCKS.   It's very authentic, cooked by commadres and tias just like back home.   The Grandma quotient on the beans and rice was very high -- always a standard assessment in my quest for good Mexican food.  They have every imaginable burrito type here and they're huge and cheap - at $4.  I always opt for the veggie (rice, beans, cheese and guacamole) burrito and am always impressed - the best part being the freshly made tortillas.  I even bought some on my way out to take home.\n\nThe tacos are a good choice too.  The combo plates start at $5.  The carne asada (a little overcooked) was pretty good and delicious in a flavorful marinade, and the shrimp taco was really good - a much better choice I would add.  Paired with some tamarind, strawberry agua fresca or horchata and you'll be in heaven.\n\nI find the bakery to be the highlight regarding the food.  The pandulce was excellent - if a bit more fresh (than Ranch Market) given the way it's stored behind a glass case rather than self-service.  The conchas and pineapple empanadas were soft, sweet and delicious - with perfect texture.

Keep in mind it's still pretty good, but there are better places in the area for getting your Mexican on food wise.  The potato taco is worth getting because it's fairly unique, but it came out so soggy that I had to eat it with a fork.  I grabbed a couple of the Yelp-Advertised taquitos as well - keep in mind these are not the Circle K, rolling taquitos.  They are literally just smaller tacos, but they were damn good.\n\nI guess when it comes down to it, I'm an atmosphere buff.

The staff is friendly and remembered me the 2nd time I ever came in, and every time since.  The ambiance and decor is fun and the food - oh the food is amazing!  I have brought several people here who doubted my claim of \"best in Phoenix\" and they all left agreeing with me.\n\nI confess that I tend to stick to a few favorites and always over-order, but it's all so tasty!  Their super nachos are much more \"super\" if you put carne asada on them instead of the standard ground beef.  I had never had elotes con todos (corn with everything) before coming here, but somehow, steamed corn on a stick with mayo, chili powder and cheese is a winning combination. Who knew?  There is no way to eat this corn daintily but it's so good that I don't care.  I can floss later.\n\nThe carne asada or carnitas soft tacos are consistently high quality but the real reason I pilgrimage here from clear across town is the fish tacos.  The mahi mahi is perfectly seasoned and flaky, with homemade tartar sauce and queso fresco.  I personally skip the rice and beans because they do use lard in the beans and that doesn't always sit well with me.  The salsa verde from the always well stocked salsa bar is noteworthy and good on nearly everything and just a few drops of habanero salsa on my fish taco is enough for great flavor and a little kick without totally setting my insides on fire. If you like ceviche, try the tostada de ceviche - a great little value for the price - shrimp, avocado, onion, tomato and lime for under $3?  I couldn't make it for that cheap!\n\nThe latest development at La Tolteca is the construction of an outdoor BBQ grill just outside the entrance closest to the parking lot. Perhaps this will reduce smokiness inside from the somewhat poorly ventilated indoor grill.  That would be great.\n\nBefore you leave, be sure to pick up some churros and a fruit empanada or two, or even some arroz con leche (rice pudding) at the panaderia (bakery). Even if you (like me) ordered too much and don't have any room left for sweets, they're just as good as a late-night snack once you get home.", "business_id": "apCfJVnRyaw6oVUBKujpUQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-06-22", "type": "review"}

A personal favorite is the carne asada burrito with a taco de papa. Delicious and only $8!\n\nThe reason I prefer La Tolteca over other local Mexican eateries is because the quality of the food seems superior and the staff is much friendlier.

Also the environment is unique, festive, and cheery, and the staff are great too.. the owner is a doll.. I just love her :D Before I forget.. THE SALSA BAR.. Absolutely the best salsa in Phoenix, and if you can't deal with heat, then go cry about it somewhere else.. There are several types and styles ranging from mild to BURN YER TONGUE OFF, and there are also roasted chiles and that marinated trio of carrots, cauliflour and something else I can't remember right now :P  I'm not even going to start about the desserts, cuz they speak for themselves..", "business_id": "apCfJVnRyaw6oVUBKujpUQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-07-14", "type": "review"}

WELL NO MORE!!\n\nMy friend had a Groupon (or something similar) for this place so we went. \nWhen you walk in, you're smacked with the delicious smoke from the FIRE-GRILLED meats they use for your meal! When I smelled that, my anticipation was amplified. You wander past the breads, pastries and cakes, and order from the board and take a seat. Your order number is announced bilingually when ready. Spartan seating, nice colorful tablecloths covered with plastic. Worn floor tile that can take centuries of traffic. You'll see what I mean.\n\nI had the pastor (pork) taco plate with refried beans (slightly runny) and Mexican rice (clumpy), and I accented with selections from the free salsa bar. The salsa bar has whole roasted jalape\u00f1os (you might need to peel some skin off) with onion slices (interesting roasted flavor), another section of veggies, then chopped onions, then cilantro, then salsas in descending heat to the right, begining with haba\u00f1ero red salsa on the left! Made me sweat! WATCH OUT, tell your friends, this is no ordinary salsa that you randomly grab and dump on your stuff. Pico de gallo is at the right end, and the MILD red salsa is next to it. The green salsa is DELICIOUS and mild as well.\n\nSin piedad por gringo: Habanero shot challenge! 2 people or more AFTER your meal. Have ice cream ready. Beer or water won't help.\n\nMy friend ordered two tamales, one chicken one pork, both wrapped in different leaves. Definite authentic flavor. We also got Jamaica (\"ha-MAI-ca\") which is a super sweet red hibiscus juice. You can also get bottled Mexican beers for $1.99. DEAL!! \n\nWater is located on the left side of the ordering counter in a self-serve container. \nExtra napkins (you WILL need them) are not readily available, you must ask for your plush paper napkins. Makes sense, they're more expensive, not cheap fiber napkins recycled from cardboard. \nThere's also a small grocery area. You can get fresh warm tortillas, a few veggies, some pork ($3.99/lb), authentic chicharones.\n\nSuper Inside Skinny: That's freshly made mol\u00e9 in bags at the grocery counter.\n\nCool Inside Skinny: 24 pack of Mexican sodas (Coke, Pepsi, Sprite I saw, but there might be others, maybe Fanta?) in glass bottles for $16. \nI usually buy them for a buck each at the gas station on the fly, but there's the real deal right there. Works out to 66.66 cents each as you can see!\n\nSo overall I'm sold and pleased with La Tolteca. \nTHIS is where you want to take your tourist friends when they come.", "business_id": "apCfJVnRyaw6oVUBKujpUQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-08-28", "type": "review"}

The tripe taco was fantastic - great texture and flavor - and I'd come back just for that.  I'm not sure I'd do the same for the carne asada, which was good but not as flavorful as it could be, cabeza, which was similarly less flavorful than I'd hoped and more reliant on texture for its kudos, and the fish taco, which was buried in sauce and otherwise not worth mentioning.  The tortillas are a little dense and also a little lacking in the flavor department - again, there's better to be found in the Valley (and, despite La Tolteca's extremely reasonable prices, for cheaper).  \n\nThe chilaquiles, however, are a dish to behold.  A giant platter of still crispy but sauce-laden tortilla chips, egg, meat, queso, avocado, sour cream, onion, and cilantro - it's full of flavor, heavy on texture, well-balanced on spice and hearty as all hell.

Shoppers here are mostly Hispanic with a few adventurous gringos thrown in here and there.  But workers there are friendly and know English - some better than others.\n\nHoly crap!  I can't believe it's taken me so long to review this place.  I only go here ALL the time for cheap delicious down-home Mexican food, cheap produce, and Spanish rice like Grandma used to make.

I'm addicted!\n\nThe food here is no-frills authentic and seats inside are picnic bench style.  It's not uppity Mexican fare like Barrio Cafe, but it's not Filiberto's diarrhea fare either.  Everything from chile colorado, chile verde, calabasitas, sopes, mole,  tortas, carnitas, chicharrones, tamales, ceviche.  You name it, they have it.   And that's just in the deli.  They have a panaderia with all kinds of cakes, flans and pandulce (sweet bread).  I LOOOVE pandulce.  They even have a jugeria (juice bar) tortilleria, and a counter for fresh cheeses and cremas. \n\nAnd the produce?  Cheap and abundant.  I got some bananas and tomatoes just a little over one dollar.  Don't think about getting any organic veggies here.  This isn't the place.  This is also not the place for low-fat shopping either.  But it is so many other great things that the other stores aren't.\n\nBest of all is the atmosphere inside - it is REALLY festive - like you're at Tia and Tio's fiesta.

Certainly one of our famous triple digit days, and as I sat in the passenger seat, bumming a ride from mi amigo, Vicente, I couldnt shake my contempt for his leather seats.\n We drove down Roosevelt in the Garfield district towards Ranch Market, on the way discussing the Alwun house, Rito's, and some colourful housing that we both agreed leant to the overall gentrification of the neighborhood.\n The grounds of this place are sprawling, palatial in fact. I was completely ripped and had on a pair of imitation wayfarers that had a broken arm and kept sliding off my face with the least possible movement of my head. \n Endeavoring not to break them further I held my head at rigid attention my back was grammar school like in posture. I then realized how arrogant and white I must've looked, in my mind I fantasized I was a conquistador with a local Toltec guide showing me the ins and outs of the Aztec village we were entering, then I kinda got sick of that phantasy and pictured myself as a balmy Harrison Ford intrepidly following Albert Molina through an alternate ruinous Mayan temple, all the while expecting danger and betrayal at every corner.\n I probably looked half insane as some of the patrons looked at me oddly, giving me a wide birth. Entering the place it's just as big inside. It's like costco and food city had a wild passionate tequila filled tryst and gave birth to the Eva Longoria of grocery stores.\n Vicente and I immediately split up, probably not the best of ideas, but I wanted to explore and he was eager to do the same. I quickly snatched up the worst shopping cart in the store (you know the one with a bad front wheel and sticky grip) and let my stomach guide me.\n Two gallons of horchata. check. Exotic mozzarella style cheese from Oaxaca and  some delicious salty Cotija. check. A lb. of plantains. check. Mango's, apples, dried pinto beans, sugar snap peas, string beans, potato's, roma tomato's- check! \n Grocery shopping while intoxicated can get a little quixotic, and confusing to say the least. I hadnt the slightest clue what I was going to make, but the colors of the produce were certainly alluring.\n Finally Vicente caught up with me and laughed gutturally upon seeing my hodge podge of a shopping cart. I stared thru him with glazed eyes as I espied the \"cafeteria\". I abandoned my shopping cart and slowly walked over, intriguiged, literally beguiled by the aroma of cooked meats. \n I hadnt the slightest clue what most of it was, and what broken Spanish I know certainly wasnt helping with most of the dishes behind the glass, until bingo; Carnitas.\n There was a word I knew and loved, I stared at the \"meat\" not quite convinced I knew what I was looking at. Sure it said carnitas, but this was...well...it resembled a tamarind bean, but was much longer, and had a color ruddy and blackish, certainly most unappealing. The tube like meat sat coiled amongst itself like tentacles in a brackish water. I stared at it hypnotized, until a young Mexican attendant came to take my order. \n \"Hey man what you want?\" he asked, breaking the glamour that held me entranced.\n \"...a half a pound of this...\" I said unsteadily. He looked at me almost impressed, and half cautiously. As he deflty grasped a pair of tongs and started sloshing the meat back and forth in it's brackish juices, attempting a better grip, it looked more alien to me than ever. I was beginning to come to my senses out of a stupor, and it was slowly dawning on me what this was.\n In a slightly horrified and hoarse whisper I leaned over the counter and looked him in the eyes and asked, \"Wait, wait......what is this...stuff!?\"\n Then he said, grinning a knowing, mocking grin, \"Yoo don' know whad tis is and yoo wanna poun' of eet man?\" \n Just then Vicente strolled up casually behind me and saw what I was doing, the two exchanged a brief chuckle as apparently Vin had overheard the attendant's query.\n \"Trrrriiipa!\" Vicente exclaimed, using his dormant mexican accent that usually only comes out when drunk or speaking with his parents, to which the attendant grinned and nodded enthusiatically.\n Aghast, I stepped back in revulsion, I'd nearly ordered a pound of pigs intestines.I felt profoundly embarassed, never more had I shown off the \"pinche gringo\" side of my personality than in that moment. \n I ended up just ordering some pork ribs that'd been marinated in a chile sauce, along with the ubiquitous spanish rice and refried beans.\n I love ranch market, but I'm certainly not going back until the raspberry of embarassment lightens.", "business_id": "VXIkI9_EbDbYHeO9IzKjJg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-06-27", "type": "review"}

I have been to Food City near my house, which I love, but I heard Ranch Market was like a Food City on steroids.\n\nI was disappointed by a few things...\n\nFirst the good. It's huge and has every Mexican delicacy you can think of. Awesome bakery, tortilleria, hot foods, huge cheese section, random pig body parts in the cheese section. \n\nMy tummy was growling so I decided to get a bean burrito before I shopped. The people working there were quite disorganized. There were 2 people ahead of me. I person ordered a cup of green chili and the other person ordered a side of rice. Between 3 employees it took 5 minutes to get our three orders out. After getting my burrito, I turn around and my cart with a couple items in it was gone! I seriously turned my back just for 30 seconds. It was obvious it was mine... hmmmm.\n\nLuckily the burrito was delicious. Do not underestimate the power of a good, simple bean burrito. The tortilla was puffy, the beans creamy, the cheese gooey. Yum.\n\nI go get myself another cart and by the time I get to the produce section I realize the handle of my cart is quite sticky. Yuck. Thank God for hand sanitizer in my purse.\n\nYes, the produce section is huge and has great variety. I saw some childhood favorites there... nopales, jicama, etc. The sale prices on produce were very good. However, the quality of some items were bad. The tomatoes were on sale, but they weren't even ripe. They were pale pink. I didn't even bother. The lemons were mushy and infested with flies. \n\nThe condition of the store in general was run down and dirty. A cooler holding frozen fruit was filthy. The lack of sanitation made me a bit nervous.\n\nAlso making me nervous were the many unsupervised children running amok, pulling things off shelves and just creating chaos. I almost accidentally hit a few with my cart. \n\nStill, I came out of Ranch Market with lots of produce, lots of pork for carnitas, fresh cheeses, fresh tortillas all for under $30. With a delicious bean burrito in my belly. Yep, I call it a good night.", "business_id": "VXIkI9_EbDbYHeO9IzKjJg", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-07-13", "type": "review"}

Of course they have all of the important imported beer, but the best part about this is that they are cheap!!! Almost half the prices of most places, which will definitely keep me coming back.  I have always said you can determine how good the Mexican food is by the salsa and the rice.  The salsa was just the way I like it, tasty while eating it and spicy when you're done.  This obviously just makes you want more due to the fact that your tongue is still sizzling and craving that hot flavorsome liquid on a crunchy tortilla chip-- a positive in my book.  They even give you an extra bowl to mix both the red and the green together.  \n\nNow onto my meal, chile verde burrito with a side of rice.  I love to try this dish at different places since most green salsas all taste different depending on who makes it, so different places meet my craving needs.  My burrito was ok, but I wouldn't rank it up there with the best.  It needed more flavor and definitely more spice.  Adding the salsa for the chips made it a little more enjoyable.  The rice to me was disappointing.  Mexican rice should be juicy and fluffy, but instead it was fried and had no flavor.  I'm not too much of a shrimp person, but my brother got shrimp colorado, which was surprisingly (to me the non-shrimp eater) good.

Both with the perfect balance of flavor and heat that builds to that point of being addictive. [I like my chile hot, but not to the point that it ruins my food or my taste buds.] \nThey have an extensive and well priced menu which includes a list of lunch specials and combinations. \n\nI choose the #18 lunch special which came with a Crunchy Taco with Shredded beef and a beef flauta covered in homemade guacamole, served with rice and beans. \nThe rice was perfectly toasty, simply seasoned and well cooked. The beans were re-fried to perfection, and not overly covered with cheese. The taco and flauta were perfectly crisp. The shredded beef used was wonderfully simple, none of this cumin infused, tex-mex chili flavored shredded beef, thank goodness. \nThere is nothing fancy about the food, this is simple classic homemade Mexican food, served with sincerity.

I decided it was the perfect time to try San Carlos Bay's snapper for myself.\n\nI was welcomed to sit anywhere I pleased, and was very shortly brought chips, salsa, water and a menu.

I ordered the whole (head included) fried red snapper (small - you have a choice of small, medium or large) which came with refried beans, rice, and a lime.\n\nMy food arrived in a reasonable amount of time and looked wonderful. The fish was still piping hot, and had been scored on both sides to ensure even cooking. What I loved about the preparation was that I ended up with so much nice crispy fish! It came away from the bone easily and I only had to be careful about the tiny bones along the fins. \n\nMy fish was un-breaded, nicely seasoned, and perfectly cooked. The \"small\" fish was the perfect size for me, and left me completely full. I didn't add any hot sauce or salt, but enjoyed eating the hot salsa with it, along with juice from the lime. The refried beans were good too. I've never been a fan of that red Mexican rice. I tasted it, but left it alone after that.\n\nI completely enjoyed my meal, and also thought that it was appropriately priced.

The chips come with two different types of salsa.  A red salsa with a little bit of a bite and a green avocado salsa that is mild with just the right hint of avocado. \n\nI ordered the shrimp in garlic sauce and the dish was sublime.  The shrimp were sauteed with red bell peppers and onions.  The vegetables were cooked perfectly - not too soft and not too crunchy.  The garlic sauce was wonderfully sweet and garlicky.  I couldn't get enough of it.\n\nMy dining companions both ordered the Camarones Culichi.  This dish is freaking amazing!  It consists of shrimp cooked in a green tomatillo sauce and loaded with melted Manchego cheese.  The sauce is divine and words cannot describe it properly.  \n\nThe perfect accompaniments to these dishes were Mexican Coca-Colas (Yay!), creamy beans topped with cheese, and white rice with vegetables.

This place did not disappoint. \nThe decor inside MPH is colorful and welcoming. Nothing to special, but nice. We were sat immediately and our drink orders taken. The reviews of the chips and salsa have not been exaggerated. The chips are thicker, almost softer and deliciously warm and salty. The red salsa has a nice rich, spicy flavor, but the green salsa, oh, the green salsa. The green salsa is avocado and cilantro based. It has a wonderful fresh, almost tangy flavor that is complimented well by the creaminess the avocado brings to the dish. When our drinks arrived my husband was delighted by the icy mexican coca-cola, as was I. Our waiter also brought out a fish ceviche tostada. Though it was a surprising treat the ceviche was not a flavorful as we had hoped. \n\nWhile we enjoyed the chips and salsa we could hear and smell our entree being freshly prepared. With out waiter suggestion we ordered the Molcajete. Which is essentially a sampler of grilled sea bass, shrimp, chicken, beef and octopus all swimming and sizzling in a tasty tomatillo based sauce. All the meats were fresh, tender and very flavorful. The rich green sauce was delightful. The bubbling cauldron of flavor was accompanied by flour tortillas that were tasty, but most importantly had a great texture for sopping up all the sauce, yum. Also included were some decent creamy pinto beans and fluffly white rice with what seemed to be veg-all mixed in. Mu husband loved the rice, I was less impressed and opted to fill up on everything else. \nI can not leave this review with out mentioning the amazing guacamole. Freshly made, and the perfect amount of chunkiness.

The menu that we had reads Fish, Shrimp, and Beef. But what we received was Battered Fish, Shrimp, Beef, Chicken and Octopus. The Diablo sauce is very hot and spicy but also very tasty and I found myself adding it everything I ate. Over all I thought it was good and fun to share. It cost $22.00 and feeds at least two people. It also comes with rice , beans and tortillas.

This is no easy badge to earn, because, unlike most other cities, there aren't good neighborhood separated from bad ones:  Phoenix is one of the few cities I've ever been to, where you can have a million dollar home and two doors down from it is a crack house.  Bizarre, but true.  Having said that, I personally would not want to come here when the sun is down, but when we arrived at 6pm, it was quiet and I didn't feel uneasy about the surroundings.\n\nPARKING LOT:  The entrance to the restaurant is off of Garfield and not 16th Street, which you'll be taking to get here.  This is important, because you'd think it would have an entrance to the parking lot from the main road; it doesn't.  The parking lot, like the restaurant, is small and they share it with a barber shop, which threatens to tow if you park in their spots.  Obviously, this is no problem after they close; but during business hours, I imagine it can be hard to find spots which \"belong\" to the restaurant.\n\nTHE RESTAURANT:  And, like the parking lot, the restaurant is small inside.  There aren't a lot of tables, so it wouldn't take much to fill up the place.  The decor is typical \"Mexican\":  lots of colors, nature motifs, sombreros, etc.  It may be jarring for some conservative Anglo types, but they more than likely wouldn't come here anyway.  The pinks, blues, greens, yellows and other colors so typical of the Mexican Pacific seem to blend nicely and don't seem garrish at all.  Now, as I said, the place is small.  So, for example, someone sitting at the table behind me actually had to pass next to my table to get to their seat.  Not a big deal and she politely excused herself twice.  This might be unacceptable in a 3 or 4 star restaurant or even something simply \"formal\".  But the atmosphere in this place is far from formal.  It's friendly, loud, noisy and familiar.  If you don't like people and if you're uptight about someone walking past you while you're eating, you won't like this place.  If you're there to enjoy the food, have a good time with friends, or don't mind a lively atmosphere, you'll do fine here.  That being said, I believe, I read somewhere that they have live Mariachi music on Fridays.  I'm not a fan of the genre, but even if I were, as small as that place is, I have a strong feeling it would be very LOUD while the music was being performed.  There are two TVs in the place, which, typical for this kind of venue, were playing soccer.  They were not loud and did not intrude on personal conversations.  The place also seems to have a full bar and a number of beer specials.\n\nTHE FOOD:  Being older and having to bring in my reading glasses, one of the things I very much appreciated about the menu was each item being listed in Spanish and English, with Spanish written in blue and English in yellow ink.  This made it much easier to separate the two and quickly see what was what.  I ordered a fish combo which was supposed to come with octopus and shrimp and with a creamy mushroom sauce.  It was not a \"combo\" in the sense that most Americans would be used to.  I expected there to be some fish filet, some shrimp and some octopus.  What came was a fish filet covered in mushroom sauce with some shrimp and very tiny pieces of octopus mixed in.  My companion had a less expensive fish filet with garlic sauce.  Outside of the different price and the cream sauce, they looked exactly the same.  Nevertheless, while this might sound negative, I was not at all disappointed with my plate.  My companion thought his fish greasy; I think it was the garlic sauce.  My fish was not at all greasy and tasted wonderful.  The food was served hot, but not so hot as to burn you.  The rice served with the fish was plain and nothing exciting; and yet, it complimented the fish perfectly.  The portions look huge and they are; but I didn't feel stuffed when I was done; just contented.  It was just the right amount of food.  I had oysters as an appetizer.  If you like oysters, they were good with the lime juice I squeezed on them.  If you don't, well, then it doesn't matter, does it?  The ceviche was okay; a lot of reviewers made a big deal about them in their reviews.  There was nothing bad about them; just nothing special.  Overall, we were both VERY happy with the food, the portion size, the temperature they were served at, and the taste ... and my partner usually complains about everything!  So this is a BIG endorsement!\n\nTHE SERVICE:  *sigh* ... Not everything can be perfect and this was the pebble amidst the pearls in the evening.  The service staff is friendly.  But the place is too small, has too many people  (on a Thursday night, no less ... can you imagine it on a Friday?!?); and not enough servers to be as attentive as they have to be.  Food and drinks were served promptly.  But when it came time to pay, I had to track them down.", "business_id": "Cp6JGY5YIRncTV_My9nf9g", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-06-27", "type": "review"}

We were in two weeks ago on a Sunday.  The inside is nice with a comfortable ambiance.

I also ordered the shrimp ceviche as an appetizer, again it was just meh.  Nothing really stood out, other than the limey juice and again, it was more of pico de gallo all mixed in that was another filler.  Maybe it was just an off day, but nothing special.  I still love San Carlos Bay on McDowell Road.  I have been going there since the early 90's and the have the best tasting seafood dishes.  Only down side is that they are cash only.  My daughter ordered a shrimp cocktail, hoping it would taste similar to those in Rocky Point, she told me that it was nothing special.

There were four of us who dined here and everyone said their food was just okay. The chips were stale and the salsa tasted too much like tomato, there was no spice to it.

What I'm looking for is good taste, and on my 2 visits to Macayo's  when I was in Phoenix, I found it.\n\nOn my first visit, I had a very tasty two tacos, beans, and rice.  On my second, I had the enchilada sampler.  This latter was not entirely my taste, although I still thought it was good quality.\n\nI have been to quite a number of Mexican places around the San Francisco area, and this was my first experience at Mexican food in Arizona.  I was quite pleased with the food here--and I got a LOT of it.  For what it lacked in \"traditional\" or \"authentic\", it made up for in flavor and meal size.  The decor at Macayo's was a bit loud, but not unlike some of the other Mexican places I've been to.\n\nThis is a great place for good single, couple, or family dining.

This is only the second dine-in place I've been to, with the other an authentic restaurant in Tucson.\nAnyway, my first time here I got mahi tacos and the wings.  I dunno why I ordered the wings or why I thought that'd be a good idea at a Mexican restaurant.  They were only OK, with no real kick or anything to make them unique in any way. The tacos were great, though.  All I can remember is the caramelized onions going so well with the sweet fish.  It was really a great dish.\nSecond time around I got a carne asada chimichanga.  \nWow.  \nThere was a spinach queso sauce all on top with melted cheese.  I could've put that sauce on the drink coasters and enjoyed myself.  Unbelievably delicious!  The meat in the chimi was seasoned well and quite tender.  It wasn't a crispy chimi due to the smothering of it in that wonderful sauce, but it all came together to make an incredible meal.  Even the beans were good, and I don't like beans.  Oh and their guacamole...so fresh.  I slathered it on top of the chimi and it impossibly made it even better.  This was honestly the best chimichanga I've ever had.\nWe went during happy hour and sat in a happenin' spot with a DJ and all.  Music was loud but varied and he was taking requests.  We got our theme song 'September' by EWF played and it made for a really good time.  \nWaiter did his job decently.  No complaints there.\nThe chips and salsa were much better this visit...the chips were actually warm and the salsa thick.  We didn't get refilled as quickly as we'd liked, but oh well.\nTheir menu has a lot of great sounding things on it and makes me want to come back again and again just to taste everything that caught my eye.  The prices...well, this is central Phoenix so I guess they are the norm.

My daughter requested a high chair for my grandson. These two requests caused such an issue that we ultimately decided to put my grandson on my lap. The server we were seated with was one who had waited on me before and I knew she had a lousy personality, but I opted not to request a different server so not to cause a problem. That was a mistake. When she brought chips & salsa to the table,  1 bowl for 5 people, I requested my own chips & salsa - it's an OCD thing. I was nice about it, but she was rude anyway. Oh well, I chose to ignore it and play with my grandsons. Then time to order...I was trying to get a ground beef taco with the shell the way I like, instead of the way they usually serve it. She was so rude about it that I finally said, \"just ask the kitchen and if they can't do it then let me know.\" She made so many excuses that I'm still not sure which shell I should have requested when they finally changed our server. After all this, my coworker gets a dirty soup spoon. She requests another and ends up with another dirty one. She requests another spoon - again - and my daughter requests one as well. My friend ended up eating her cold soup with a fork - as much as she could. After several more issues I finally go to speak with a manager. While I was gone, the server made a nasty comment about our party to a nearby table . Unbelievable! We get a new server, but still no spoons, who tells us we cannot have the separate checks we requested because the manager took 50% off our bill. The only issue then was that instead of any discount at all, we had been over- charged. At this point my daughter, who never complains, actually went to the manager herself. I was given my remade meal to go - which ended up in the garbage. We ended up with a full comp, but would still never go back.

Typically, I'm not a fan of chain restaurants, and because of the heavy Hispanic/Chicano population in the Southwest, we have a multitude of Mexican restaurants to choose from.\n\nBut it was good. I went with a group of friends recently. I monkey see-monkey do-'ed and ordered what my friend ordered. The cheese enchilada was tasty, and the beef tamale with baja sauce. Oh yes. Das ist gut. I mean, muy bien. \n\nI went again a little over a month ago with a dear friend during lunch, and it was even better than the last time. We were cozied in a booth in the back, with a darling older blonde lady as our waitress. She was chatty and pleasant. My friend ordered a margarita in one of the fancy mugs for him to take back to Utah. I ordered a conconutty margarita, which was mighty tasty with lots of coconut on the rim and in the drink, as well as a hefty chunk of pineapple inside, as well. Excellent!\n\nThe waitress was attentive but respected our space. The chips and salsa were uber fresh. They were so good, I could have come just for chips and salsa + a margarita. The food came very quickly, piping hot and the presentation was just so. Our lovely lady loaded us up with napkins (not gonna lie, I am a napkin hog), and we got to it. I ordered the tamale with baja sauce, and it was heavenly. We took our time to eat and sat in the booth with our food babies for awhile after we finished. The food was great and it was a nice experience.

She talked to the manager and came and told us \"you didn't get service because yoy were seated in a closed banquet area\", even though that wasn't stated anywhere and I even saw a waitress starring at us as we steated ourselves. I told the busser that it wasn't stated anywhere and the waitress that walked by about 4 times should have said something instead of ignoring us. She said \"well she's paying attention to her tables not you\" the only table I saw her service was the one group of people In the banquet area with us.. at this point I was annoyed and said \"why do you keep putting the blame on us?

Its to the point when someone from work brings it for lunch, I can tell just from the salsa smell they went to Juans. LoL. The chips and salsa are always a listed item when we order to go from here, for about $1.30, you get a small (which isn't small) bag of chips and salsa. Always ask for extra salsa.\n\nThe shredded beef or chicken hard tacos are always fantastic, the fluatas (rolled tacos) are good here as well. You can get them in a combo with rice and beans at a very reasonable price $7.00-$8.00.\n\nWhen you're sick? Go for the albondigas soup (meatball rice soup). It is soooo good and soothing to aching throats and it just makes me feel better when I'm under the weather. The broth is light but flavorful, with rice on the side, you can add or leave. It comes with flour or corn tortilla.\n\nThe have red and green chili corn tamales. Both are fantastic but I go for the green chili corn, extra sauce $2.00.\n\nThe service is always nice and professional when we stay in. They're quick to ask if we want a refil on soda, chips, salsa - check back a couple times to make sure you have everything you could want. Sometimes we'll call our order in and decide to sit and eat instead of coming right back to work. Their so easy about letting us do so.\nWhen dining in, I get my order quickly. If we're calling in for lunch, we call about 1035AM, since our lunch is at 11AM and before their rush hour begins. So in all, there hasn't been a problem with getting out food.\n\nWhen you first walk in for lunch, the sitting area looks small. But when it gets busy, they open the back area which has quite a few more booths back there. They have a flat screen going in the corner and also \"bar\" seating. The only thing that bothered me about this place is the Specials board is always under the t.v. at the far end of the dining area. You'll see it if you happen to go to the bathroom or know to look over there.\n\nOh yea, a large drink is extra large and medium is large. Sometimes I forget and have this delicious but HUGE Horchata, because I said large.

The building looks nice and they have been around forever. We got a coupon in the mail and decided to give it a try. The parking lot was pretty full for late at night. We go in and are seated and look at the menu. Both of us commented on the odd assortment of items on the Combo. Our first clue was all of the help looked as if they were from the Mid-West. We decided to have the Fajitas and a Combo. They brought out some chips that reminded me of the ones you get at Safeway in the giant bag for a buck or two. Then there was the \"Salsa\". It was basically Catsup, not Ketchup as in Heinz or some other reputable product, but the stuff in the huge container for 99cents, mixed with something like hot sauce. We ordered Cheese Crisps. They were basically corn tortillas with some shredded cheddar cheese melted on top. Then the food came out. Let's just say, having eaten at Ponchos Buffet, there is worse, but places like this are usually found in the Mid-West where the people think Taco Bell is authentic. The only redeeming value to this place was the Ice Tea was tasty, that and the cashier offered to let us buy some candy to make the $40 bill (for two) so we could get the $10 off rather than the $5 off of a $20. Purchase. I thank-you for this, because it was certainly not a $40 meal ore a $30, or even a $10 for that matter, but Sir, you earned a second star because of that.

About 5-10 minutes later a family came in with small children and after about another 5 minutes or so,  all of sudden a waiter comes out and looked me right in the eye and went to the other table and took their order. Turned around and went back in to the kitchen. Of course this pissed me off. We got up and hostess saw me I explained what happen she said it was her fault. That did not make it OK. The waiter should have said something to us and didn't. So we left Aunt Chilada's in discuss and went down the road to Ajo Al's for a awesome meal and great service..\n\nSo now we are at Ajo Al's for the first time and I was speechless when I walked out.

The building is nostalgic.  It's been there for a very long time.  It was once \"Tony Romos a place for Ribs\" and before that is was a fun place called \"Googs\".    The upscale version and night dinner spot for Guggy's Grill, which was kinda like a better Denny's or Brookshires if you remember that place.  Now I'm dating myself.  We're talking ancient history here.  This place has seen a lot of people in and out of it's doors.  I'm sure everyone in Phoenix has been there in the building one time or another.  If you have or if you haven't now you can have Mexican food there.  Go, It's great!", "business_id": "ib-y5nsfn3unE0lLY1vfAw", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-06-29", "type": "review"}

I had heard of Richardson's, and for my friend's going away/belated birthday dinner, he requested that we go to Richardson's \"other restaurant.\"\n\nLike any good yelper I checked its profile out and the peoples' who's opinions and tastes I've come to trust had me sold on it. A subsequent AOL City Guide review page was less than inspiring - complaints about them closing the upstairs dining area and diners who were less-than-impressed with the menu - they (the AOLers) came off sounding like snobs in their reviews, anyway, so I didn't let it bum me out, but I wasn't sure what to expect.\n\nBased on the price range and what I'd heard, I was prepared for a 40s-60s married couple crowd and elegant/traditional dcor that would appeal to that demographic; this assumption was further believed when we pulled up and saw those exact couples leaving the parking lot.\n\nHowever, we drove up (complimentary valet is required) and went thru a wooden door into a stone stair chamber (seriously, it felt like a secret passageway in a castle) to another wooden door that opens into the bar area (I was assured on the phone when I made reservations about three days ahead of time for the Sat night that we would get a table, or you can wait for a table or belly up at the bar to eat).\n\nAnyway, the crowd was very up-and-coming (for reals, not like Scottsdale mall Kona Grill happy hour, \"I'm in real estate\" up-and-comers) late 20s to late 30s crowd, the flat screen TV behind the bar was playing ESPN and the Cure (!) was playing...I was in love. It was still white table cloth and wood accents nice, but the subtle, muted tv and just high enough music volume were enough to make it seem more like a bar than a stuffy restaurant. \n\nI was told it was Dutch-inspired (so executed by the Dutch impressionist works all over the walls) but the food is basic \"new American\" grill faire. New twists on old favorites...along with favorites basic mashed potatoes (except these come out souflee style), bacon-wrapped scallops, prime rib ($32) and Chilean sea bass ($28? $34?) (all of which we ordered, and ate, and it was all excellent).\n\nWe also got a bottle of wine for $25 - not bad. That was one of the least expensive ones, it goes up to the $200s from there. Oh, we also had crme brulee (divine, freshly made with real vanilla bean and served cold, not hot) and coffee to top it all off. Whew! We were pretty drunk, very full and very, very happy with our experience. (the music selection also continued to impress, surprise me - The Killers, Morrissey\n\nOh! I can't forget the server...he was professional (not snobby), knowledgeable and helpful - he will give you his honest opinion on which dishes he likes and doesn't.\n \nOh! And, for a higher-dollar establishment, I was very happy to see they didn't try to charge for every little thing - for $32 I got a salt and pepper encrusted prime rib, the giant side of mashed potatoes, asparagus and a salad (you even get to choose from four specialty salads); a steal, really.\n\nOk, I'm done gushing. If you want a romantic dining spot, this works.

THANK YOU, I owe you guys my first born. Rokerij was fantastic. Give me a good meal, good wine with good friends, and Dottsy is one happy, blissful girl. It was Friday night around 7:30/8pm and the parking lot was PACKED. On round two of looking for parking we got a spot smack dab in front! When we walked in, we were told there was a 45 minute wait. When I looked over the hostess' shoulder, there were three bar stools sitting empty! YAY! We didn't want to eat huge meals because we were due for some country dancing after dinner! We decided to sample the variety of Rokerij by trying their small plate selection. We ended up ordering 6 small plates and a bottle of GREAT Zinfandel. Our selections were the following: \n\nWhite Bean and Garlic Bruschetta- This was one of my favorites. I am half Guatemalan and this plate reminded me of something my mother would make. The tangy cheese and mild creamy beans were a hit to me. My friends agreed it was good, but weren't crazy about it like I was. That's common. I tend to get really excited about simple dishes.\n\nSteak Tartare: This was my other favorite. The creamy mixture was made before our eyes. We watched the cook meticulously mix and mash the tartare to a creamy perfection. The only thing I would change on this is to make the bread that it's served on thinner. It seemed that our bites were overwhelmed by the thick, crusty bread. My guyfriend and I loved it. My girlfriend isn't a red meat eater so she passed on this one.\n\nStuffed Mushrooms: These were tasty. I only ate one but it was stuffed with a crab meat mixture that was very meaty, not full of stuffing.\n\nCalamari: This was not a winner. It was served slightly cold, and it was more breading than a meaty bite of calamari. We all agreed we wouldn't be ordering that one again.\n\nTomatillo Toasts: YUM! This was like an open faced tomatillo enchilada on bread, if that makes any sense. The tangy tomatillo was complimented by the salty and rich flavors of the jamon (thick cut ham) and grilled chicken. Again, I think thinner bread would be a good idea.\n\nNew Mexican Sausages: This dish was savory and rich. I'm not much of a fan of sausages, but these were yummy! I only ate one because at this point I was hella full. The onions were cooked to sweet, glazed perfection and the sausages were meaty and not terribly greasy as far as sausages go.\n\nWill we visit Rokerij again? YES. I can see myself becoming a Rokerij fiend! This place impressed me. The service at the bar was hectic but it worked for us. We got to see a lot of \"behind the scenes\" things. Watching the open kitchen buzzing with non-stop action was amazing. I was fascinated watching the chefs cook a steak to wood fired perfection. Even watching the bread being sliced in 2.2 seconds was amazing! \n\nA small note, when it's a crowded night, Rokerij will limit your visit to 2 hours if you have a table. The only reason I know this is because there was a BIG scene caused when a party was asked give up their table and move to the bar. In Rokerij's defense, the table had been seated for 3 and a half hours. So just keep that in mind. \n\nRun, take a fast car, and some food loving friends to Rokerij and I hope you'll enjoy it as much as we did!", "business_id": "5kRug3bEienrpovtPRVVwg", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-07-26", "type": "review"}

She suggested Rokerij and I wasn't sure, but we figured we'd give it a try. \n\nDriving along the long strip of road with little businesses surrounding the restaurant, I was a little nervous pulling into the parking lot - it looked like a stuffy log cabin, BUT there was some hope - the parking lot was pretty full. \n\nWe walked in and the place had character! Menu items were written in chalk along the walls and it seemed like a comfy cabin-like, but kind of hip at the same time restaurant. We were told there was some seating downstairs. Downstairs? Who knew? It was great! We had a corner booth (plush, high back) facing the bar and the bar set up was great! All the liquor was neatly laid out, clean and they seemed to have everything. And they had a couple of tv screens and a fireplace (although not exactly needed in Phoenix) on this floor. \n\nTHE FOOD WAS FAB! AND the prices, were NOT even as high as what you find in L.A. at all for what you get! \n\nHubby got the PRIME RIB with broccolini and mashed potatoes. What came out was a BEAST ON A PLATE. HUGE serving of meat prepared how ordered - medium rare. Mashed potatoes in its own little crockpot - STEAMING goodness. All that for $29! That's a pretty darn good deal for the amount of meat and with sides. \n\nI got the Rokerij Steak which was topped with crab (THE REAL STUFF) and jalapeno hollandaise (couldn't taste the jalapeno though). I ordered the grilled beets and GCP (green chile potato) as my sides. The GCP was unique but wasn't for my tastebuds. Beets were great and again, just a hearty portion for $36 - they didn't scrimp on the crab. \n\nWe also got appetizers - bacon wrapped scallops and a turkey chile relleno. Scallops were FAT, cooked well and flavorful (of course it helps with the bacon). Chile relleno with turkey? Um AMAZING. I have NEVER had turkey that moist before and so cheesy and it was laid across four different sauces - hollandaise to a tomatillo like sauce. \n\nOur bartender/waiter was so nice and attentive and he was just great. \n\nWe will DEFINITELY go back again as there are a TON of unique and interesting menu items.

Lucky for me, I think this may soon become my favorite happy hour place in Phoenix. The cellar was really intimate and cozy. I actually have no idea what the upstairs restaurant looks like. There was a confusing fireplace downstairs which is perplexing when you come in from the 100+ degree heat. It definitely made the ambiance more intimate and I don't even remember feeling the heat inside.\n\nThe menu was really awesome, and I had a lot of trouble deciding which happy hour appetizer to choose. I decided on two which ended up being more than too much food. The ceviche was all white fish, and sweeter than I typically like, but it was definitely fresh. The steak tartare was also very fresh. I only wish the bread was sliced a bit thinner. The beer selection was not too bad at all. They have Chimay on tap, and Hoeegarden in the bottle which is all I need. For the amount of food I ate, and the beers I drank, the price was really affordable as well.\n\nI also really enjoyed the prompt, and friendly service. I will be visiting this place pretty often, and hopefully with one or two friends.

We had a marketing retreat there a few years back and booked the private room (which is a great size - seats 12-15 people comfortably) and is fully equipped with a flat screen and computer for presentations and what-not. I had a friend book the room for a bachelorette party (I wouldn't necessarily have a \"party\" here... but it's certainly a great private space for small groups).\n\nThe second time I went, I sat in the main dining space, it was so-so. A little dark for my mood (it was the middle of the afternoon - I just came for lunch) and wasn't feeling the darkness dungeony vibe.\n\nThe third time I went, I found that little spot in my heart that was longing for a happy hour space such as this. The downstairs bar is by far one of my most favorite spaces. Thebar stools - large and squishy - perfect for your bum. The fireplace - awesomely lit - and oddly no warmth comes from it? There must be some crazy ventilation - I don't care how but I love it. There are a couple of large circular booths - very private - in the downstairs bar area as well - perfect size for about 4-5 adults. \n\nThey have a superb selection of seafood - and everyone around me ordered it. From Sunday to Tues. I believe they have 1/2 priced bottles of wine, we asked the bartender for some reccomendations and he gave us a couple of samples. We ordered a very nice red from Carmel Valley - it was amazing. Coupled with the chicken tacos (quite a kick to them - disctinct horse radish nose tingle...but great spice) and onion rings (more of the gourmet variety - not too greasy at all with very unique sauces) and we had ourselves quite the happy hour.... err actually happy 4 hours... \n\nThat's what happens when you go into a bar with no windows!!!

The food here is incredible and during happy hour all the small plates are only $5 each!  This gave us an opportunity, over a few visits, to try almost everything on the small plate menu.  The first time we were there, we ordered the bacon-wrapped shrimp, the steak skewers and the brie mushroom toast.  For two people this was a meal in itself!  We were full by the end.  \n\nThe bacon wrapped scallops, the tenderloin toast and the oysters were ordered on the next trip.  Thinking this couldn't nearly be enough food, we ordered the chicken tacos too.  The oysters Rokerij were incredible!  I'm not a big fan of oysters - in fact, can't eat them unless they are covered with lots of gooey stuff.  These were a step above Rockefeller!  The bacon-wrapped scallops and the shrimp both are served with three different sauces on the plate.  It would be best if you tried all three.  My favorite is the spicy red sauce.  They are all very good and everything tastes better with bacon!  The chicken tacos were not my favorite.  There was a funky taste to them that I can't pinpoint.  I'm not against trying them again...\n\nThe bartenders are great!  Can't beat the service here (at least in the downstairs bar).\n\nHappy Hour is only from 3pm to 6pm, which makes it hard to get there after working until 5pm, and prices are only good if you are sitting at one of the bars (there is one upstairs and one downstairs).  The bartenders upstairs are attentive and for the most part friendly but not nearly as good as the bartenders downstairs.

EVER.\n\nFirst time to go to the Rokerij on the recommendation of a friend. Three of us went on a early Sunday afternoon to the downstairs bar/restaurant and were seated in a booth. I had a question about the NM sausage on the brunch menu and the waitress says \"I don't know, I've only worked here five days\". Period. She doesn't offer to get a sample for me to taste, or even go ask someone who knows about it. Just \"I don't know, so live with it\".  Then, she refilled my friend's iced tea with water, and was annoyed when was corrected (and had to bring a new glass). She didn't even bring a \"new\" glass, just the same one she dumped out in the sinkthen refilled. Yuck. I question if that's even legal/sanitary.\nFinally, we paid $50 cash towards a bill that was just over $40 and she never came back with change. As we continually attempted to flag her down or make eye contact, we could tell she was just waiting for us to leave so she could give herself a big tip. When finally confronted (WE had to go to HER), she said, \"Oh, I wasn't sure what the extra $10 was for (so I kept it).\" Umm, the bill was for $40.44, not $40! That's what the extra $10 was for! I guess she expects the register will never close with the correct amount, or when in the same situation she just stiffs the restaurant for that extra amount?\nWe definitely won't be going here again - there are plenty of other places nearby with same quality of food AND great service.", "business_id": "5kRug3bEienrpovtPRVVwg", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-06-13", "type": "review"}

We had Ryno today, and he was outgoing, spoke about a few menu items, and generally came back in a reasonable amount of time. \n\nI decided to try something different, and got the dungeness crab omelet featured on the blackboard. It was a generous amount of crab, peppers and onions, paired with the standard tortilla, potatoes and beans.  Not something I'd order on a regular basis, but this whole place is a bit of an adventure and the crab omelet really hit the spot.\nHe got the meatloaf and eggs, mmm spicy!! You have to ask for ketchup for your potatoes, and we were only brought one ramekin, but that's okay. It sufficed.\n\nWe don't really care for free valet as we are fully capable of parking our own car, but at least when we walked out, they brought our car immediately.\n\nOverall, not enough for the 5th star, but it's worth the drive for something different. We are dying to come back for lunch sometime and try that Pasta Heidi or Chimayo Chicken! \nI could find the back door and restrooms here, too.

I had tried to call and make a reservation, but I couldn't hear the person who answered the phone at all - it was super crackly and cutting out with only tiny bits and pieces coming through.  I tried calling a few times with the same result.  So I had to just give up and go when we were ready to eat and hope we could get a seat in a decent amount of time.  When we got there, though, they said they could seat us, but we'd have to leave in one hour for another reservation (wonder how they got theirs!).  We thought an hour should be plenty, so went ahead.  But then we proceeded to sit there for about 25 minutes before anyone even acknowledged us at all - so there went almost half our time, despite 4 servers just kind of slowly wandering around and standing around.  I tried hard to get their attention to no avail until I finally got up and asked.  Our server just made a lame excuse.\n\nThe problems just continued from there, taking forever to get our appetizer, a bad drink for my wife, more crappy, inattentive service, and finally to top it off - bad food too!!  I was pretty shocked actually.  But both of our dishes were bad.  My wife got a fish special that was super bland, and I got a steak that was sitting on top of a soggy piece of bread, swimming in a pool of watery sauce that was spilling off the plate as the server so carefully tried to set it down in front of me.\n\nIt kind of seemed to us that maybe this place used to be good, or is maybe good on other nights or something, but this was a Friday night and for everything to be bad, from start to finish like that just seems pretty suspect.  As if the whole regular staff, including the chefs were out on vacation or something.\n\nI am giving it the benefit of the doubt and not rating it more harshly because there was really good atmosphere and decor, the server was friendly when she was there, and at least parts of the food were good - enough to think maybe it really was just a horribly off night.  I'm not sure if we'd go back, though, considering the price - huge waste of $$ and way overrated if this is the norm!", "business_id": "5kRug3bEienrpovtPRVVwg", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-07-03", "type": "review"}

The question really should be what do I not like about the Rokerij?  The answer to that is absolutely nothing! \n\nFrom the moment you walk down the steps underground to the Rokerij you are about to be transformed from any experience offered in the Phoenix metro.  The place is so intimate with no windows,  lit candles everywhere and even a couch that you can cozy up with someone special next to a fireplace. \n\nFood choices are great, not cheap unless you take advantage of their happy hour.  The wine list is very diversified with many selections.  The servers/bartenders take care of you with a pleasant smile and know how to make everyone feel special.\n\nThe Rokerij is definitely a great place to take your spouse or date to in an intimate setting unlike any other places in Phoenix.  If you'd also like to impress some out of town friends this would be a phenomenal choice to wow them.\n\nIf you haven't been here, Go.

Hi I'm great thanks for asking.... we decide to sit down anyway since we were meeting the rest of our group there.

As we begun to walk out, my husband holding my son leading the way, the snarky hostess irrelevantly informs him that they don't have changing tables.

It's been frustrating.  How hard is it to take a poblano, roast and peel it, stuff it with cheese, batter it, fry it, arrange it on a plate and dribble sauce on it?  (Well, obviously not SO easy or I'd make the damn things at home!)  \n\nSo DH and DD (Dear Dog) and I took a road trip to Tucson to check out Mt. Lemmon.  (It rained---what was that all about?)  and we come cruising back into the Phoenix area about 8.30 pm Saturday night and DH is asking what we are having for dinner.  \"Whatever we stop and pick up\", says me!  I am thinking Mexican in my head, but unlike back in the old 'Hood, there ain't a Mexican joint on every corner.  I guess we like Mexican food a lot more in the Midwest, or maybe it's because most Arizonians know how to make it at home and Ohioians don't or something.  So we are driving past Indian Bend exit off 101 and I remember I saw this fast food Mexican restaurant there when we went to LampsPlus.  So I tell DH and he recognizes the name Filiberto's.  Apparently, this was the after-hours food of choice when his brother and his friends had the munchies after a night of bar-hopping.  They said it was really good, DH says, but I don't know how toasted they were when they ate it.  But we figure---what the heck....\n\nWell, first of all, the shopping center parking lot is like a carnival.  Full of cars and people.  Apparently, they are having the world's biggest cruise-in!  But the line is short at the Filiberto's drive-thru so we pull up.  OH.  MY.  GOSH.  Number 17.  Two chile rellenos.  Okay, calm down.  This is a fast food joint.  I have been let down at some fine restaurants when it comes to rellenos.  So I order the #17, hold the rice, extra refried beans.  In the meantime, a car with a Big Muffler and a Big Stereo pulls up behind us going bruuuuum...bruuuuum.....!  Now DH doesn't eat a lot of Mexican (he's all about Italian) and he hates loud noises and we are kind of tired and nervy after a lot of hiking and driving and basically starving to death so he gets stressed and orders the #7, then as we sit, starts b*****ing because he got shredded beef and he hates shredded beef because it's always garbage.  Which I don't get, because you really don't know what's in hamburger, but that's just a spousal conflict.  (I do have reason for mentioning this---read on)  \n\nOne thing we notice is that looking through the drive-thru window, the food prep area was SPOTLESS!  As DH said, you could have eaten off the floor.  Big Points!\n\nWindow girl asks if we want red or green chile sauce.  We order both and she brings us three little cups of each.  I will mention that when we tried it, we found it bland and unexciting, but I told DH that a lot of times, servers will err on the cautious side because a lot of people don't like spicy the way we do.\n\nAll the way back to Cave Creek, delicious aromas are eddying up from the bag.  SERIOUSLY delicious.  We almost fall over each other getting into the house.  Okay---cut to the chase.  I think I have found my relleno nirvana.  Oh, wow, they were good.  And so were the beans.  Right on par with Sammy's Burritos and Burgers!  And I was eating them lukewarm because I didn't want to heat up the guac, pico, sour cream and lettuce that was in the carry-out box and we were too lazy and hungry to empty things out onto plates.  Oh, the deep fried, cheesy, peppery goodness...  I can't explain how happy that makes me!\n\nNow, remember I mentioned DH and the shredded beef?  He could not say enough good things about the taste and high quality of the beef in the taco.  He thought the whole meal was fresh and of excellent quality and not at all \"fast-foody\".  In fact, he immediately texted his brother (who now lives in Cleveland) to say: wow.\n\nI couldn't eat my whole meal, so I had about half for the next day.  I could hardly wait for lunch---surely the goodness of that relleno was the result of starvation.  Nope---and this time I took the time to separate cold from hot and warm up the beans and relleno.  It was as good as a leftover for Sunday lunch as it was dinner on Saturday.  Yummo!\n\nSo, I am going to have Filiberto's again very soon to see if this was an anomaly or these chile rellenos are this good all the time.  My only caveat is the closest Filiberto's is SIXTEEN MILES from my house.  What---are they prejudiced against Northern Phoenix?  What's this all about?  Why do they only have Filiberto's at Bell Road and further south.  Don't folks north of Bell deserve the good stuff?  I mean--Taco Bell?  Huh.  But I am very excited.  Yay!  Thank you, Filibertos---you have made me so happy!", "business_id": "WzhHlaEyaHE4KIFfcqC_9g", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-06-17", "type": "review"}

Basically it's a fast food joint with lots of mexican fast food items such as Burritos, Tacos, and Tortas. Prices here are a bit more than you would expect from a fast food joint and you're looking around $4 - $8 depending upon what you order. \n\nI decided to go with the Carne Asada Tortas Combo. I was hoping to be in an out but the food took a long time to cook. I probably waited about 10 minutes before the food came out. The Tortas was a good size and was a mix of good and bad. The Carne Asada had good flavoring but was tough and the guacamole while good was layered on there thick. It was to the point where I got a guacamole torta with some carne asada topping to it. The fries here - well frozen Costco fries. \n\nAs to ratings, Filiberto is ok. It fills a need and nothing more.

My friends got grilled chicken and veggie burritos also very cheap and also pretty tasty for the price. However there were a few negatives about Armando's that definetly stuck out. First, when I went into the bathroom there were two cockroaches crawling around (big deal breaker). Second the food is clearly not the most healthy or made with the freshest ingredients (however that wasn't exactly expected). The service was ok in that; it was fast and we got whatever sides and salsa we wanted at no extra charge. Overall if there weren't any roaches and it would have been cleaner and better maintained would have given Armando's four stars for it's convenience.", "business_id": "JobP0ghILdh8S8l-LhHHxQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-08-01", "type": "review"}

So freaking good.\n\nIf they can make beef intestines taste delicious, you bet your ass their traditional meat options like carnitas and pollo are equally as delectable. \n\nThey make their own tortillas and both the flour and corn are tender and flavorful. You'll end up looking forward to that first and last tortilla-filled bite of a burrito, and you'll wish they doubled up their corn tortillas on the tacos. (And don't worry, you don't need a double banger tortilla on the taco. I've only had a corn tortilla disintegrate on me when I've left it to sit and sop up juices for ages.)\n\nMake sure to take advantage of the salsa bar. Get lots and lots and lots of the aguacate sauce. That spicy green avocado sauce is the most amazing condiment. The red and green sauce will suffice in a pinch, but that bright green avocado sauce blows 'em away. The marinated carrots, cucumber slices and radishes are also spot on. Their strange pico with lots of cabbage is a concept I haven't seen anywhere else, but it's crazy complimentary. Give it a whirl.\n\nThe only issue I've ever had is with consistency.

We were seated immediately even though it was 5:45pm. We had friendly, attentive service from both our busser and our server.\n\nWe were served delicious, warm tortilla chips shortly after sitting with a tasty, fresh, and chunky salsa. They also provided the liquefied hot sauce, but I did not eat it because I do not like that kind at any restaurant.\n\nI decided on the veggie fajitas. The black beans are vegetarian, the refrieds are not. My sister selected the fajita quesedilla, sans meat.\n\nOur food arrived quickly and piping hot. Both of us had huge portion sizes and the food was extremely fresh and really tasty. They put a salty and slightly spicy seasoning on their fajitas, which come with a mixture of peppers, onions, squash, zucchini and potatoes. \n\nBack in the day when I used to eat meat (15+ years ago) I always ordered the shredded beef chimi. It was amazing. I would assume that it retains the same amazing taste and size as when I favored it as a child, but who knows.\n\nOur meal came to $21 and I gladly tipped our server over 20%!

I went with high expectations because she has told me over and over the past few years how good this place is.\n\nI arrived couple minutes after everyone was there and saw that the party (there was about 25 of us) was broken sort of into you, half the party down one side and other wrapped around the middle and the birthday girl was kind of not at either tables, just in the middle of the 2, which made it difficult for conversations to flow, you could talk to your half of the table, but if you want to talk with those on the other side of the restaurant, get up and walk over their then, needless to say, I stayed where I was at and talked amongst my fellow friends on my side, kept giving the bday girl a shout out and drinks to let her know we are here to party! \n\nLet's start with the salsa, their where 2 types, a pico de gallo and a hotter blend, which reminded me more of a smoky chipotle sauce.  Well the pico looked great, but had absolutely no flavor, no pepper ,no onion, no tomato flavor, not even the cilantro, which is my favorite ingredient to cook with, had flavor, even if you added salt and pepper to it, it didn't help.  The hotter of the two did have a nice smoky chipotle taste to it, so that was the one I went with it.\n \nI went with the filet of Salmon with mango salsa with Spanish rice and black beans.  The fish was perfectly cooked, and even though the top of the fish appeared to have some sort of rub on it, it too was lacking in flavor, I tossed on the mango salsa to see if that would help and sadly it did not, no flavor at all. I topped it with the smoky chipotle to give some sort of flavor and appearance that I'm not eating mush. The rice and beans were perfectly cooked, no issues there.  Had this dish had flavor to it, it would have been amazing, but nope it did not.\n\nNow like I said we were spilt into 2 along one sided booth table things from one end of the room to the other, and there was apx 25 if not more of us. But by the time my end of the table had gotten their food, the other half was already paying and leaving.  It was not because I was late; I got their in time for orders to be taken. This was poor planning on the server's behalf, half the party had ready left by the time we got our bills.  I was bummed because I was wanting to catch up with a friend I hadn't seen in a while and poof she was gone .  I wanted to like this place, but I'm afraid I am a onetime diner here.", "business_id": "ieYiA4L5gk7S3kZYK0l_dg", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-07-16", "type": "review"}

My favorite dish is the CHICKEN FONDIDO! If you like fried chicken, cheese and cream cheese THEN LOOK NO FURTHER because the Chicken Fondido is the end-all be-all of amazingness!\nGranted that the food is not authentic Mexican, it is very interesting to combine Mexican and Irish food. Coming from a Spanish and Irish family, I felt quite at home looking at the menu and having to choose between corned beef and nachos.\nAnd it gets even better when you consider the prices. For the over-the-top portions you receive, the prices are very agreeable. \nThe atmosphere is clean, friendly and inviting. If you're on a date you can ask for a more intimate table and they will be happy to seat you somewhere you can kanoodle with your date.\nDrinks from the bar are prompt and put together correctly.

The chips were light and crispy but the salsa tasted pretty generic. A spinach enchilada was very bland and a chile releno was mostly breading with a small chile and cheese but not much flavor. The two people who were with me agreed that their food was mediocre as well. We went with the frozen margarita only because we wanted a pitcher and the margarita on the rocks pitcher was much more expensive. The margarita was also unimpressive - perhaps the more expensive one would have been better but the regular on one the menu just tasted like frozen sour mix. \n\nWe had a good time, but if I were to ever go here again I would probably just go for chips, drinks and appetizers which I could get somewhere else anyway.", "business_id": "G9LwkTSdKOyOGqd5BbuIkA", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-07-10", "type": "review"}

SO, I met a petit blond young lady at work one evening/early morning. Miss Jami told me about this wonderful establishment. She shared a brief history of the place which really peaked my curiosity. She says she's a server there and that I must try it sometime. The sucker for a pretty girl that I am, I made a commitment to try it on Tuesday. I did.\n\nI loved the antique car in the front as I approached. I love the overall character of the place from the outside. I walked in and waited for a moment for the host, and just took in the beautiful entryway. The smell of that old wood gives hint to the age of this great place. The host returned and greeted me. Kyle was pretty laid back and calm. He was a gentleman and very kind to spend a few moments talking to me. Being by myself, that was a bit of hospitality that I love to receive at restaurants. \n\nWhile taking up Kyles time my server came and asked me for my drink order. This lovely creature calls herself Mari. Mari was great. great personality, attentive and lovely as can be. While waiting for my food, I gawked around at this beautiful 1892 masterpiece. This restaurant has great ambiance, and I was thrilled to be dining in what was once a horse corral. In this corral was a beautiful fireplace, built in the 1930's, I'm told, and a huge water fountain. Very pretty. I love the paintings on the wall, one of Aunt Chillada herself and another awkward one, but fun, nonetheless. While nearing the end of my meal I greeted Daisha. While she was setting up the table next to me, I struck up a conversation with her, because that's what Thought Creep does when he dines alone. Daisha was fun to talk to and how awesome, she cleared my dirty plate. I love the team work. Uncommon in other restaurants. So a shout out to her. On my way out I was thanked by the Manager on duty, Dan. Kyle had offered me a History Tour of this massive place earlier but guests were starting to come in about 5:30 pm so I thought I'd take a rain check. Nope!!! An enthusiastic Dan offered to take me on the tour. He really knows his history of this place. I was impressed with, not only his knowledge of Aunt Chilada's but local mining history that played a roll of it's earlier success. \n\nOverall, I am really impressed. I am sad that Jami wasn't there, but I will be back another time. But TC, you ask? What about the food? I had the two entr\u00e9e combination platter. A sucker for red meat and carnage, I chose the Machaca Taco and the Machaca enchilada. Served with shredded lettuce, lightly spiced refried beans with, what tasted like, a hint of fresh garlic, and a side of a seasoned baby angel hair pasta with bits of peas and carrots. Preceding my meal was home made flour tortilla chips and a delicious Salsa Fresca with baby black olives and other tasty bits of Mexi-goodness. And finally, I was impressed with the bottle of water. Served in a bottle that looks as old as the structure itself, this bottle was served extremely cold. The frostiness of the glass and light blue hue made this water appear refreshing. It was, at 110 degrees outside.  \n\nI absolutely loved my experience here. From the moment I walked in to the time I left, my experience was a grand one. I will be back. I've told my friends back home in SoCal this is a must try, while visiting Lil ol' me. Until next time. Thank you Aunt Chilada's crew.

Some tables and a mess of chairs awaited me in an old run down structure.  \n\nI ordered a grande asada taco and pambazo.  To my dismay there was no pork available so many menu items were not possible to order.  The food was good.  I didn't care for the pambazo but I had never tried it (or heard of it for that matter) and wanted to try something new.  It's a mix of chorizo and potato with cheese and lettuce served on a sandwich soaked in a red chili sauce (be advised this is very messy).  Win some, lose some with new experiences.  The taco was excellent and rivals that offered by Tacos Atoyac.  They served it with a side of red and green salsas.  Amazing salsa!  This isn't your average weak salsa.  It has a great kick.\n\nThe major downside here was the service.  Not attentive and I grew frustrated waiting on my check.  My plates had been cleared away, I had an empty Coke bottle and four different employees kept walking past, saying nothing to me.  I even told my waitress that I was finished.  With no plans for the evening I decided to wait and see how long it would take.  After 20 minutes I just got up and asked for the check.  Being my first visit I cannot say if this is normal here.  While annoying I'd give them another shot as the food was very good.\n\nI'd say it's well worth a visit if your crave cheap and tasty Mexican eats.

The items we ordered were guacamole cheese crisp, shredded beef burrito enchilada style (red sauce) and machaca burrito with green sauce. The cheese crisp was cold and the tortilla they used had the consistency of pop tarts. Hard, greasy, horrible. It was the worst cheese crisp I've ever had. The shredded beef burrito was only filled about a quarter of the way and the beef was extremely dry and flavorless.  It makes me nauseous thinking about it it was that bad.  The machaca burrito was made using ground beef with spices. Not your typical machaca. We thought we were given an incorrect order but the food server advised us this is how they make their machaca.

Okay, now on to the best part of my visit.  The horchata was AMAZINGLY delicious!  Lots of cinnamon, just the way I like it.

I'm not sure if this is always the case, or if it was because we were there 30 minutes before close and they were just trying to get rid of it.  The cinnamon chips they give to each guest at the end of the meal were amazing too!  A crunchy, little round chip (tortilla size) covered with cinnamon and sugar.

It was clean inside, and the gentleman waiting tables and manning the register had quite good customer service.  The family photos on the wall are a nice touch, and while the furniture isn't perfect, it's not ripped up either.  The bars on the front are unsightly and unsettling though...I wish they would just have a rolling shutter or gate that would come down.\n\nThey do try \"get you\" by charging for the chips and salsa...in fact everything is extra, so don't go expecting a free tortilla like Chipotle.\n\nI ordered the beef tamale and cheese enchilada combo, all rice, with an wff.  The beef was a tad chewy but had a nice slice level.  It was also a tad on the smaller side.  The red sauce made sure it was nice and moist.  It also had some potato inside and what looked like a green olive.  While it had a spicy kick to it, I do feel it overall lacked flavor (perhaps the meat wasn't marinated or slow cooked long enough, or was overcooked).  The rice was one-note, bland but not unpleasant, cooked decently,\n\nThe enchilada (which I ordered minus the onion) was pretty much perfect with the egg on top.  A bite with sauce, cheese, tortilla, egg, and rice was solid.\n\nMy bill for my tamale/enchilada plate and a flan was $17 before tip, which was a tiny bit higher than I expected, but their service was really quite excellent, they keep the place very clean (a girl bussed a table even though they were closing down the kitchen in a few minutes) and the food is satisfying.\n\nI appreciated the little cinnamon sugar chip dessert that came with my bill too!  While I am sure some would fault them from being a bit too American-ized and inauthentic with their menu, it obviously sells well here, and coexists with the more traditional and perhaps more flavorful or spicy options that Sunnyslope offers.

Then i tried some Nachos, with the \"carne asada\" on it. Pretty sure it wasn't beef. In fact I went back another time and ordered nachos with \"no beef\"  and the woman on the intercom actually corrected me to call it meat, not beef. And those particular nachos were just as bad without the \"meat\". The cook just globbed sour cream and guacamole all over the chips so you can't pick them up. I asked for diced tomatoes and got two half tomatoes with cuts in them. Oh they forgot to put cheese on the chips.. THEY FORGOT CHEESE ON NACHOS! They garnished with cheese, on the cold ingredients so no melted cheese. So all I got was a nasty cold pile of sour cream, about two cups amount, and guacamole, about another cup, on about a handful of tortilla chips.

I tasted the spinach enchilada that came with the plate, and I concur that it was really tasty.\n\nI had the chili relleno plate which I'm still scratching my head over. I must have had over a million chili rellenos in my life but never one like this. The chili wasn't dipped in a batter, it was just wrapped in egg. I was disappointed by this dish. I know the that the batter for chili rellenos contains mostly egg, but it's not pure egg. It has a little flour, milk, and sometimes baking powder to make it fluffy. The sauce that covered it wasn't very saucy. It was green chilis and onion basically. The whole thing wasn't terrible, just disappointing. Beans and rice were still delish though.\n\nI am still rounding up to 4 stars because everything else I have had at Manuels has been great.

I got nervous right off the bat, I chose this place the parking lot was almost empty and it was about 12:30 or right in the middle of what should be the lunch rush. We were seated right away in a nearly empty restaurant. From there I can say good chips though they say award winning chips and salsa, but the salsa tasted like El Paso out of the jar. The rest of the meal was outstanding. I had the Green Chili con Carne burrito enchilada style lunch special with green chili sauce on top. It was an amazing taste sensation. The beef was not shredded but more like tender stew meat seasoned to perfection and the beans and rice were pretty good too. My wife had the shredded beef taco lunch combo, She said it was good but about average for her. She really liked the chips but was not impressed with the salsa either.  I liked the novelty of the shirts they sell there, but in my circles I couldn't think of a time it would be right to wear it they say \"Excuse me, It's the frijoles\"", "business_id": "DXBPI8rR9f_IthOGPDWoIQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-07-28", "type": "review"}

This place is not good and a disappointment with the memories I had of it and how easy it is to get to from my new home. \n\nThe chips and salsa was the first sign that this isn't what I remember. They give you two salsas in which both had not a lot of flavor and I ended up mixing them. The mix helped but overall if the chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant are bland it means the rest of the meal will be. And I was right.. \n\nI ordered a red chile burrito and upon cutting it up the phrase \"canned meat smell\" went through my mind. The sauce lacked that smokey heat you expect in a red chili sauce, it had little to no flavor and had an overcooked texture to it. I kept eating because I was hungry, but then my BF said it looked like dog food and I had to stop eating. It did remind me of dog food because his not polite table etiquette connected with my first initial thought about the meal- canned smell. \n\nMy BF ordered a mix of al carte tacos and he had the same unimpressed feeling, and stopped eating halfway through his meal. \n\nThe two stars was for the service, our waitress was awesome and let us know that ordering a pitcher of margaritas would save us a few bucks. The Margarita, which I would consider the 'House Margarita' quench my craving for a margarita. It said it was award winning, which I don't think it was anything amazing, but it did it's job. \n\nOverall, I won't go back as the food was overall not good and there are too many other great Mexican places to go to.", "business_id": "oqZPXoenkQvAKQJ2pDCo0A", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-06-20", "type": "review"}

I hadn't been to this restaurant in years and decided to give it another try.  Being on a budget, I didn't have that much to spend on lunch for my boyfriend and I.  First thing that turned me off was printed in the menu.  Only 1 refill of the chips and salsa before they charged $1.99 for more.  Also, only 1 refill on drinks (which were absurdly expensive for iced tea and lemonade: $2.25 each).  Any restaurant that charges that much for drinks and limits your refills to 1 turns me off, especially here in the desert.  My boyfriend had a chimichanga with shredded beef which was pretty good and I tried the enchiladas with \"mole\" sauce.  It was absolutely disgusting.  I sent it back and asked for chicken enchiladas with green sauce.  Decent, but not worth $10.49 they charged for simple enchiladas.  The chips were nothing to write home about, honestly a Fry's bag of $1 would have been much more appealing.

Now as you all know with my review of Rito's Mexican restaurant i am not a Mexican food lover...but i must tell you LaParrilla Suiza has great AUTHENTIC Mexican food. The wife and I found this establishment by accident last weekend while we were out shopping. A co-worker had mentioned this place to me a week earlier but i didn't realize this establishment was within walking distance of our apartment. My co-worker lives in the west valley so she goes to the location in Mesa and she told me if i wanted Authentic Mexican food at a great price then visit LaParrilla Suiza.\n\nSo imagine my surprise when we found this gem in all places, a strip mall, right across from the Paradise Valley mall here in the east valley. So i walked in and got a take out menu...and the establishment was very nice and well maintained. I ordered the Chile Relleno because my friend Manuela told me all about it and she thought i would like it...and she was right. The wife and I shared it because there were two of them along with refried beans, rice, and coleslaw. \n\nNow the Coleslaw is not really what you would envision as traditional coleslaw...because it is not wet at all...but it is not bad either. Now Manuela also recommended  the Queso Suizo which is a pure cheese dish, the tortilla soup, which i am definitely trying on my next visit, the Pechuga Suiza con Alambre de Res, and the Pechuga Suiza which is chicken breast. I plan on trying all of these in the near future and i will keep you all posted on what i think of each dish. However my friends feel free after reading this review to try the food for yourself because if you like Authentic Mexican food in the valley of the sun then go no further than LaParrilla Suiza. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!", "business_id": "WxpCYziMlEy8mrEa_VcB1w", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-06-06", "type": "review"}

Being a gringo I expect my enchilada to be a corn tortilla filled with some gooey melted cheese and if ordered with, some meat. These were corn torts with a dab of chicken inside them, topped with a green sauce that had no heat but a lot of twang. Though given the flavor of the enchiladas I was happy that there wasn't much there. \nAs for the service, we didn't see him again after the food was delivered until done and ready for the check.

It is my de facto \"friends in town and want some good Mexican\" stop.  In fact, I'm freakin' shocked by the low ratings this place is getting!!\n\nAs with anyone Mexican place, they start you out with chips and awesome salsa.  There's a spicy smooth red sauce, a pico-type salsa, and the piece de resistance....the avocado tomatillo salsa.  They do, however, charge for extra chips/salsa after the first freebie refill.\n\nI recommend anyone try the Tortilla Soup (note: NOT a chicken tortilla soup).  You can get with or without toppings of sour cream and avocado for an additional cost, but I find it perfect as is.  It's mostly broth with cheese and tortilla strips (of course), but it is just such a delish soup. For my entree, I always get #25, which is a vegetarian combo of a tamale and cheese enchilada, which I have them use mole sauce instead of traditional enchilada sauce.  It comes with refried beans (the pinto beans are cooked with pork) and rice.  The soup and this plate are MORE than enough for dinner and breakfast/lunch the next day.\n\nThey have several other locations in the Valley, a few in Tucson, one in Guadalajara, and one in Mexico City.", "business_id": "WxpCYziMlEy8mrEa_VcB1w", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-07-18", "type": "review"}

For Mexican at its finest Phoenix is my city of choice.  And in this fine city is Carolina's, the epitome of everything a Mexican place should be, the gold standard for Mexican food if you will.  Here's why ...\n\n1) Cheap - Carolina's does to money what Jesus did to bread and fishes.  Find some change in your car or couch and you can feed a full family.  \n\n2) Delicious - Pick anything that rhymes with maraca (i.e. Machaca Burro or the Oxaca Special, my two faves) and get ready for it to blow you freaking mind!  Oh, and how could I forget ... The buttered tortilla is a piece of heaven, especially once you get to the middle.  My wife once made the mistake of having me hold her tortilla while she went to the bathroom, and after several minutes I just couldn't help myself and ate the butteriest middle bite.  She still to this day has not forgiven me for that.\n\n3) Ghetto - Every time I come here I'm worried the roof is going to collapse.  There's no back on my chair that's been bolted into the floor.  I would not come here at night for fear of getting my burro stolen, among other things.  All this adds to the experience.\n\nThis place is as good an excuse as any to plan a trip to Phoenix.

On the pro side, they were busy but got the order out quickly and they were nice enough.

The chorizo and potato breakfast burrito is also one of my faves.  A great place to start the day!", "business_id": "d52zg-S0o940WUCK-nNiKw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-08-05", "type": "review"}

It didn't have to be \"authentic,\" just a local's eatery.  I was already tired of the airport Mexican food, so instead of venturing straight there on my way out, I took a 20 minute detour to visit the city's top rated Mexican joint, none other than the infamous Carolina's.\n\nEver have that uneasy feeling of \"I don't know about this...\" while exploring a new neighborhood?  This was exactly one of those times.  I already knew it was a dive, but I didn't know it was going to be a scene from the movies, almost as if Compton was ever smack dab in the middle of desert.  Even when we questioned our GPS directions, it never lead us astray.  Within a few minutes into a ghost town of project like homes, we found Carolina's.  There wasn't any windows, some minor graffiti, looking something like a warehouse with a bare parking lot.  The doors were painted black on an all white building, I was just waiting to open the doors to find bikers and extras from the movie From Dusk Till Dawn.\n\nInstead, I found a mix of patrons from all social classes, some waiting in line, and many sitting quietly enjoying their meal.  After a quick peak at the menu, I noticed nothing was in Spanish.  The guys behind the counter were all speaking flawless English and then I realized none of the clientele was Hispanic.  Could access to decent Mexican food be any easier?  I decided to ask the guys behind the counter for things that weren't on the menu and they jokingly retorted, \"Go to Mexico, this is Carolinas.\"  The entire menu reminded me of the fast food Mexican joints (a la Muchas Gracias in Oregon) I've seen throughout the west coast, thought he prices weren't as dirt cheap as I had hoped but still a good deal nonetheless.\n\nWithout abandon, I ordered a mix of enchiladas, tacos, tamales, and their infamous tortillas that were made in house.  In short, I did not come away disappointed.  The tamales were fresh, steaming away as I unwrapped the corn husks.  A quick cut into the masa revealed the fine starch hugging the bits of shredded chicken just perfectly and spiced with the perfect amount of salsa verde.  They were good enough for me to consider ordering a second one, but I was on a limited time frame.  The hard shelled taco was totally what I was used to back home - deep fried, packed, and super greasy - producing an unmistakable crunch without falling apart.  The enchiladas were drenched in a salsa roja sauce, meshed with a bed of frijoles and cheese.  This was greasy Mexican at it's finest, the kind where artery salvation was never part of the agenda, sinful with every bite.  A surprising thumbs up goes to their tortillas, simple yet hearty.  The tortillas con queso were undoubtedly cheesy and though nothing like the ones I've eaten in Mexico, were worth their weight in saturated fat.\n\nIf I somehow warrant more visits to Phoenix, I can see myself coming out here for my greasy Mexican fix.  I still need to try their burritos, flautas, chimis, and tostadas.  If I like what I see and more importantly what I taste, I might be able to award this lil dive another whole star.", "business_id": "d52zg-S0o940WUCK-nNiKw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-08-31", "type": "review"}

Also, they ran out of tortillas which I wanted to purchase and I was bummed about that.\n\nMy husband, who used to work in the area and frequented Carolinas says that this experience was a fluke, perhaps because we were there fairly close to closing time (although I don't think that's a valid excuse).\n\nI wasn't impressed.

No expense was spared decorating the interior... literally, no expense.  But the food?  Divine.\n\nWhen I'm in Phoenix, no matter the purpose or the duration, I swing by Carolina's for a quick bite and a quart of machaca or red chili to-go (about $21).  I've sampled several things over the years and now make a b-line for just one thing:  I order the mixed machaca burritos ($3.50).  That \"mixed\" refers to the shredded beef AND a scoop of homemade refried beans, all wrapped into an incredibly tender/fresh tortilla (which they also make that day, ON-premises) along with a good dose of cheese.\n\nTogether, these three simple ingredients -- the cheese, beans and slow-cooked machaca -- create a flavor symphony that my palate would turn it's nose up to if approached by the fanciest French restaurant with a free dinner offer.  I get two of these and plop my butt down on the dirty plastic booths, close my eyes and (try) to savor each bite as slowly as possible.  Sadly, I'm always done in about 5 minutes.  I have eaten these on the road as well, but they are messy!  The bottom will almost always begin to leak juices from the shredded beef before you can even get halfway done.  If you dare to eat/drive, be sure to have some kind of tray (not a napkin or their thin paper plate, but a TRAY) on your lap... and wipes for afterwards!\n\nWith a location that is barely 1 mile or 1 minute off of the freeway, on the southern edge/entry to Phoenix, it is a mandatory stop for me when I'm in Phx.  There is a large parking lot that surrounds two sides of Carolina's and the interior is swamp-cooled (so it'll be muggy-hot during the summer months).  Drinks are fountain/self-serve style and utensils are all plastic/self-serve as well.\n\nNote, there is a single bathroom, but it is very cramped (just a bit larger than an airplane) and it is less attractive than a Chevron's (I probably wouldn't even let my labrador use it... but I still love this place!!)  Oh and one more note, this diner gets very, very packed during lunchtime (11:30a - 1:30p) with suits, blue-collars, cops, everybody!  Even during the afternoon there is a constant, albeit shorter stream of patrons.

The fish tacos tasted extremely FISHY and not in a good way. The crab meat enchiladas were authentic, dang it, but unfortunately the verde sauce was too tangy and there was pimento in the mix. It left a \"stale\" flavor in our mouths.\n\nWe would love to know the day of the week the fresh fish comes in. If we knew, we'd go back on THAT day. Otherwise, skip it.", "business_id": "Bv3g-9R5wUevZPP0jzihqg", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-06-17", "type": "review"}

The meal itself was incredibly filling - I had a huge burrito and the wife had her typical cheese enchiladas. You can get whatever meal you ordered smothered in enchilada sauce for an extra 95 cents. The enchilada sauce is reminiscent of New Mexican chile sauce - sweet and spicy.\n\nMusic is a bit loud, I got up and discreetly turned it down at one point.

There are non-seafood items, especially on the lunch menu, but seafood is definitely the special of the house (bahia means bay).\n\nSo, of course, I made the mistake of ordering a non-seafood dish.  Luckily it wasn't a horrible mistake - my cheese enchiladas were filling, had decent flavor, and were, best of all, cheap.

I plan to come here regularly as long as I live in Phoenix. Before I go on to expound upon the wonders of my first dining experience here, I need to make a brief but passionate comment about the location of this restaurant. I agree that Poncho's  is a gem, but I think it does a disservice to the residents of this area to think of Poncho's as good *given the area*. Part of what makes restaurants like Poncho's so great is that they are family-run, with the passion and experience of many generations fueling their current success. In my limited time here, South Phoenix strikes me as an area that has a lot of heart and soul to it - a lot of the homes in the neighborhood have been in the family for generations, and certain restaurants here reflect this sense of the past and of community. I loved my first experience at Poncho's because it's such a great dining experience with real ties to the South Phoenix community, not in spite of this fact. \n\nOK, that being said, on to the food and drink! We started with thin, crispy, perfectly salted chips with some hot salsa in a bottle - best starter ever! We ordered margaritas, and our waitress (who was really down-to-earth and helpful) asked if we wanted the \"big bowl\" ones. \"Hmmm, why not,\" we said (they were priced at $6.50, which is really reasonable). And we didn't regret our choice! They were a little sweet for my taste, but they still had a really great lime flavor and tasted pretty strong. Much better than the limeade Los Dos Molinos tries to pass off as margarita mix! And once we had them along with the chips, the mix started to taste less sweet and became the perfect compliment to the spice of the salsa. \n\nWhen we first saw the prices of the food, we were shocked! It was so cheap! It's really impressive that the owners have managed to keep the quality and portions so high while keeping prices so low. Based on Yelp reviews, I recommended to my husband that he try the Pollo Fundido (~$7). I tried two a la carte items - the chile relleno w/ chicken (~$5) and the shredded beef enchilada ($3.50). Everything was so rich but so good! The fried shell and the jalapeno cream cheese on the Pollo were so satisfying, the enchilada sauce was really flavorful, and the chicken was moist. The beans and rice were also really good. We enjoyed every minute of our entrees, which we continued to wash down with the margaritas. \n\nWe left feeling full but satisfied, and we definitely look forward to coming back soon (perhaps for happy hour or to sit in the cantina, which was really lively).

I decided to try my luck again and went to Ponchos for dinner last night. I now have been there a few times and my experience has been consistently horrible. First of the all the place used to be a house, now converted to a restaurant. Usually this is a great and charming idea, but it doesn't seem to work for me. The rooms are incredibly crowded and you are either screaming at your dining partner or (loudly) overhearing the table next to you. Imagine trying to fit 5 restraunt booths in to a small bedroom..

Lame. I have had many entrees (where's the pollo under all this fundido) (chimichanga greasemanga) but last night won the \"most disgusting entree\" award. I order the Steak Picado (I think that's what it was called) and it came out overcooked and cold. The rice and beans were barely edible, the cheese in my garnish and beans were melted stiff but there were also bits of cold (what appeared to be) sandwich cheese sprinkling the plate and hiding under the steak. It was supposed to come with tomatillo sauce but came with their normal salsa heated up..  My friend ordered the Huevos Rancheros and it was even worse, the eggs were rubbery and greasy at the same time. They were covered in a slimy sauce they passed off as ranchero but it seems like a watered down green sauce. It was so bad he didn't even eat it.\nDon't get me wrong - I love Mexican, all types and usually the heavier the better, but Ponchos is a place I will not be returning.

Every time we make the trip from Tucson to Phoenix I get this craving for Poncho's.  The building must have been an old house from the 1930's and converted into a restaurant.  There are so many nooks and crannys to get lost in.  But when you make your way in you are greeted by this lovely older lady who is full of piss and vinegar with a great sense of humor who leads you to your table.  We were there Sat. at about 2.00PM.  The place was packed with large families who seem to know the wait staff pretty well.  Everyone is so friendly and efficient which is a plus. Now to the real test.  The food is wonderful, rich in flavor and beautifully  presented.  Unfortunately, I am a wuss and order the same gringo dish (Chicken Enchilladas with green sauce)  Hubby orders Chile Relleno, tamale, combo plate.  The thing is those onions which are sauteed to perfection slathered all over the dish including the rice. This makes me real happy.  If you love onions this is surely the place.

It might be because Bill Clinton ate here in 1999 and they are still getting food tourists? Not sure, but I did snap a photo of Clinton's table and that earned the extra star. The place is a mishmosh of small rooms and is old looking, but seemingly it retains its customers somehow, The guy next to us said he has been eating here once a week for the past 20 years and the waitress must have been here from day one. Have you ever heard of a waitress being too efficient, doing her job too good - kinda weird concept, but maybe somebody will get it.\n    Even though, waitress informed pop that the fajitas were cooked in Teriayki sauce (WTF?), she said they were good and he took the veteran's bait. Big Mistake because our regular told us later that they just cook the chicken in Worcesthire sauce. His plate was swimming in salty, black liquid, only one tortilla was given, the guac had no chunks and looked like green toothpaste and the original salsa served with the chips was a watery mess of slightly hot red liquid (nothing in it). The $1 chunky salsa was better, but still on par with a chain or something (no offense to the much better chains in the area). \n    My $9 combo was a mess covered in a tasteless green sauce. The enchilada tasted like stale tortillas were used and the green corn tamale was all fluff and no green chile or corn present. The chile Relleno might have been the best item, but they used a green chile, not the traditional poblano.\n     Pancho needs a break, a new menu and can someone mention to them how to cook fajitas properly because that crap should be taken off the menu forever.

Hear me out. Before you ignore this review, understand that Arizona stands alone when it comes to Mexican food. Having eaten everywhere for Mexican food in both California and New Mexico, I can say that AZ's authenticity and flavor are incomparable. So naturally you would want to make the most of your dining experiences in Arizona and eat at places that have plates that leave a lasting impression on your palette.\n\nAlthough Poncho's may have a quaint history you want to root for, it doesn't mean that their cooking skills are the kind you want to spend a good amount for. Just because someone says they're Mexican or have a Mexican background does NOT mean that they automatically have the correct method of seasoning, prepping, or even frying.\n\nMy boyfriend and I wanted a Sunday lunch there, and we were going in with an open mind. I was actually excited that I would finally try the \"pollo fundido\" that everyone talked about. We left a little disappointed.\n\nThe human traffic in the dining area is distracting. The setup of tables is a little weird, and although the warm paintings of desert landscape are inviting, the constant movement of waitresses, busboys, and families is...well, annoying. Then the food came. It was very, very, VERY inauthentic. The salsa for the chips was literally a tomato paste that resembled something like ketchup with some spices thrown into it. The meal was heavy; it was greasy and felt more like a fast food combo that wouldn't keep me full for too long. Great meals leave you satisfied, but here I couldn't eat much. I looked around and noticed that the crowd that ate at this place really didn't care if the food was bland or nothing close to the beautiful mom and pop shops that would put the food to shame.

This place used to be one my auntie's favorites, so I chose to give it a go... We entered a booth filled resturant that seemed frozen in the 80s or worse - the early 90s.

It was just meh. Taco Bell does a better jobat this lunch time favorite than these guys do. My mom got the cheese omlet special.

Old man Woody would not be pleased about this, I'm sure.  \n\nFor starters, the chips.  C  In a way I am glad they are no longer using lard, for health reasons, but they are kind of boring now.  \n\nAnd the salsa.  B-   Where are the flavorful oregano chunks?  What happened with the original recipe?   Mostly tomato sauce.  Boring.  \n\nthe rice. C minus-  It used to be the most flavorful and large portion covering a good chunk of your plate. Where once lovely, soft pieces of oregano and cut green onions lay is now a bland and skimpy small portion.  The original flavor is gone.  PLEASE put it back.  \n\nThe beans.  A+ They are flavorful but portion size is down.  \n\nThe enchilada sauce. A+   It is still the original flavor.  They need to hold on to this.  You have not had great red enchilada sauce until you've had this one.  \n\nThe steak fajitas.  D  - At $15.99 they came in flavorless, kind of chewy and only a miniscule side of beans and pico mixed with lettuce (?) No rice.    It's almost like they forgot to season it.  Sad and not worth the money.   \n\nThe stuffed Pobalano Chile.  C minus.   Another disappointment.  Stuffed with tender chicken and breaded and deep fried, the intention was good.  But temperature of the deep fryer was too hot for this one as the crust was almost over done but the chile had not been properly tenderized.  It needs to be worked on folks.  I think an egg batter a la chile relleno would be an improvement here.  \n\nAnd what happened to the open buffet happy hour?  This used to be my regular drop off point after work.  \n\nThe music.  It was an ecclectic mix of modern Latin.  I didn't really get into it.  \n\nThe decor.  It is still okay.

My older daughter stated \"I'm just a menudo kind of girl,\" as she slurped down every last bit from the huge bowl she ordered.

What a jerk.  First of all, he pronounces his last name all Italian, and I am 100% certain that he pronounced it like a full on american all his life until he made it on Food Network.  Then, he gets to drive around and taste greasy food all day.  Plus, he looks high as a kite sometimes on air, which probably makes the food even better.  Anywhere from 1-4 reasons to be jealous/annoyed with the guy, depending on who you are.\"\n\nAlso:\n\"I wish God would smite Beyonce.  Her songs are the most annoying songs I've ever heard.  If there were a way for her to get smacked into permanent silence, I'd be all for it.\"\n\nAnd:\n\"I can't wait to eat at this place.  Street tacos sound delish.  Where is it?  Wait--this looks like a residential neighborhood.  Where the hell am I?\"\n\nUltimately I find the place and go in.  There's some floozy outside with a huge rack--only pertinent because she ended up being an employee.  Well I guess it isn't really pertinent then, either.\n\nAnyway, I'm *wanting* to like this place.  I long to be able to say that I went to a place today and ate food that tasted like pureed happiness.  I want to give this place five stars and brag right and left that this is the place to be.\n\nBut I don't.  The service was good--the girl was nice (bc of an earlier review I was expecting the worst) and she told me the street tacos were the way to go.  I got the three tacos, one chicken, one carnitas, one steak (asada).  Plus rice and beans.  On corn tortillas.  And I got a sexy-looking bottle of coke.\n\nWhen the food came out, I was devastated.  Where my three tacos should have been, I had three walniut-sized excuses for tacos.  Where my beans covered in mexican cheese should have been, I got beans covered in an afterthought of some white cheese (which isn't what I wanted.  Sue me).  Where my rice should have been there was rice.  1 for 3.\n\nThe street tacos all tasted ostensibly the same.  That punk Guy Fieri on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives on Food Network made it sound like I'd wet myself with glee upon eating the carnitas, and the lady making the batch acted like they'd be good enough to keep part of the recipe a secret.  They aren't.  That recipe should be open source for sure, so that maybe someone can come along and improve it.  I certainly could.\n\nAnyway--maybe it was because he was high as a f*&^ing kite but the food did not taste like magic, it tasted like hot sauce.  And I am all for hot sauce--I'll bitchslap a habanero or two, no problem.  But the issue is that whatever I ate, it tasted like only the hot sauce.  I added green sauce--still the same flavor.  I wanted to be wowed, but instead I thought, \"Meh.  I've experienced better.\"  Which is why you see two stars here.\n\nIn fact, I don't blame Los Taquitos for doing what they do.  Whatever is fine by me.  But now I kinda wanna slew-foot Guy Fieri just that little bit more for telling me that this place was so good.  If you're gonna tell the world what's delicious, don't smoke out first, because I've been there and eaten a piece of my cat's litter and it tasted pretty decent to me at the time.  Hardly a reliable indicator of a culinary masterpiece.\n\nA couple of disclaimers: I don't hate Guy, I have no idea if he smokes out, I'm not judging him or you, stoner.

I stepped up to the counter and placed my order for a chicken chimi. It ended up taking a bit longer than I would have expected, but when the food came out it was pretty good. Let me say this now, I'm comparing this place to the Filabertos and Rudolphos and etc. With that in mind, this place is great. The flavor of the chicken is unlike any you would find at those other locations I mentioned. If you compare it to that of items found at other diamonds in the rough, I think it falls short. It is for that reason I give this place 3 stars. If I lived closer to this place I'd eat here on a regular basis I'm sure since the food is not at all bad and the prices are worth it, however I'm not sure why this place ended up getting a spot on triple d.", "business_id": "rDvz5jX65gpfONFu7er9Tw", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-08-11", "type": "review"}

Of course, since I got my tacos to go, once I got home I found finely chopped onions on 'em. The kind that would take 3 days to pick out, so I just ate 'em.

Whether, Chinese, Mexican, Greek.  We are open for anything.   I checked out this place on Yelp for reviews and all of them were great.   I was looking forward to finding a \"gem\" of a Mexican restaurant.  We all agreed that the dishes were mediocre.  It wasn't the cleanest place either.  I ordered my usual chicken enchilladas  with green sauce.  Very tasty and a little different.  They marinate the chicken, pork, and beef which makes the chicken, pork and beef a little bit mushy.  The rice was tasty though.  My other half ordered the chille relleno which was also a little bit different from what we are used to.  It was served in a brown sauce with cheese, onions, and diced potatoes.  Pretty tasty. He also had a lengua (tongue) taco. Small but also very tasty. There is no waiter service.  You go up to the counter and order.  I'm not crazy about the plastic plates, but no tipping is a good plus.  We went for lunch about 2.00PM and the place was crowded.  So obviously lots of people enjoy this place.  The menu was plentiful with lots of choices.   I understand the place was featured on Diners, Drive-Ins-and Dives.  I guess you could label this place in the Dive category.  Prices were quite reasonable.  All and all, if you like Mexican Street food, Los Taquitos might fit the bill. I'm not sure if we will return or not.  We will still try other places to finally find Mexican Food Heaven.

I was turned on to Los Taquitos by a friend who, despite certain dietary restrictions, will indulge in the tacos here when she needs her street food fix.  Coming from California, I have been mystified and befuddled by the lack of good, cheap Mom-and-Pop Mexican food joints in the Phoenix Metro Area.  It seems that when I have gone out exploring, I have been completely disappointed with bland, underseasoned, cafteria-style Mexican food that seems to be de rigeur in these parts.  This is not the case with Los Taquitos.\n\nThe food here is a tremendous value.  You spend no more than you would at any other Mexican food hole-in-the-wall, but the flavor and attention to texture and food preparation is exceptional.  The hard-shell tacos have the proper jaw-rattling crunch, and the meat is well-seasoned and tasty.  They don't require too much hot sauce because they are so savory on their own, but the house-made green and red sauce condiments, add the perfect amount of heat and brightness.  I have also sampled the carne asada burrito, served enchilada-style (i.e., smothered in red simmer sauce), and found it to be spot-on as far as texture and taste.  The flour tortilla is soft and sturdy, whereas the beef is toothsome and appropriately salty and spicy.\n\nI fear that I have been ruined for all other quick-and-dirty Mexican food joints after eating here.

I raced over on my work break to meet my Yelpmigos, the place was packed with wall to wall people. Crunched for time & it being my first visit I didn't order much, quesadilla con jalapenos & a diet coke. The cashier tried to warn me they'd be hot, they must have grown them in the pits of hell because I think they scorched my tongue! My quesadilla was good, hot yes but the peppers were tasty & fresh so I'd order them again! My food came out fast, and everyone's food disappeared just as quick as it appeared! I'll definitely be back, the food is good, the service is friendly and fast, it's also been Guy Ferrari tested and yelper approved!", "business_id": "rDvz5jX65gpfONFu7er9Tw", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-08-23", "type": "review"}

Some of the best I've had in a long time. The spices worked well together, and no tough pieces were to be found. \n\nThe Red Salsa they top everything with is nothing short of amazing. It's not blazing hot, but tastes great. \n\nI enjoyed it so much I dragged my Dude back out a Saturday that same week, where we discovered the Carnitas are right up there with the Carne Asada! \n\nVery tender, and it tasted like some type of apple and brown sugar rub was used. \n\nAnd again for another workday lunch when I got stuck on a client call and missed a vendor provided lunch.\n\nThis place is small and gets packed at high noon quickly.\n\nCall it a dive; call it a dump. If you're coming here for ambiance (not delicious tacos), you're doing it wrong!\n\nI look forward to trying other menu offerings at Los Taquitos, but for now, I'm hung up on those amazing street tacos.\n\nUpdate 9/18: Tried the Bombero Burrito con Pollo. Do not order this if you hate spicy; also, it's massive (see photos) so SHARE. Barely ate half! Was able to sample the Vegetarian tacos, also delicious.", "business_id": "rDvz5jX65gpfONFu7er9Tw", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-08-29", "type": "review"}

The place stays busy at lunch (cheap food I'd guess) Streams and streams of people. They must have no clue what Mexican food is. Definitely won't be back. Never. Adios.

The place is fast food setup, but it not very fast. When we arrived the place was not busy at 6:30 dinner time.  The girl at the register was very new. She didn't know what some of the menu items were even. My wife ordered 3 chicken tacos,  and she got 3 shrimp tacos instead.  I tried the Carna Asada Taco combo, and a bowl of Passole. That was $23 with one Ice Tea. Not on the cheap side,  that's for sure.  \n\nWell after waiting about 15 minutes for our food, and the order being wrong,  my wife was not happy.  I have to say that the food was very simple,  and very traditional Mexican recipes, I found the Carna Asada tacos to be dry and lacking in flavor. The Passole was just homany, and pork in a thin red broth.  That's how the peasants make it.  The refried beans where not over mashed,  like most places make them,   but they put to much water in them to make them cheaper.  The Spanish rice was again very simple,  but good. \n\nIMHO For the money there are lots of better places.", "business_id": "rDvz5jX65gpfONFu7er9Tw", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-06-15", "type": "review"}

I got the AZ style Carne asada burrito. Which was pretty much guacamole, rice and beans inside the burrito. Didn't make sense but it was deeeeeeelicious.  My hubby had a Carne asada taco and tostada.  They were super yummy! Their happy hour started at 4 pm so we ordered a beer and a house margarita.

You can't go wrong with getting the green salsa. With that being said their tacos are good, but not amazing- worth it though on Taco Tuesday when a bunch of them are only $1each .
