Okay, maybe the best.  I can't say the best for sure, though, because I haven't made my way through then entire list of breakfast places around the city.  But I'm working on it, though.  (I even have a spreadsheet.)\n\nI've had everything from the pancakes to the eggs burrito to daily specials.  I always know it's going to be delicious, I'm going to struggle to finish the portions and I will leave happy both with my meal and the bill.  I'd like to be able to recommend one thing over another, but I really can't.  Everything I've eaten at The Dor-Stop has been a great and satisfying breakfast.  The pancakes are sweet, the bacon is always crisp and I can't find anything bad to say about an omlet special that includes bologna (aka jumbo).  \n\nI guess my best recommendation has nothing to do with menu items: go on a weekday.  Weekends this place is hopping and there will likely be a wait.  Sure, it will be worth it, but if you can swing by early on a weekday you won't have to and the food will be just as good.  A friend of mine will call me now when she has to take her car to the dealership on West Liberty Avenue because she knows I will take her to the Dor-Stop.

Given that we were headed out to South Park for a hike, and we wanted to get brunch beforehand, I suggested we take the opportunity to try the Dor Stop, since Dormont was on the way and I'd heard great things about their brunch (not to mention that they were on DDD!).  In hopes of beating the late-rising rush, we arrived at around 10:30, and it worked out perfectly, since we only had to wait about 15 min. to be seated.\n\nOnce we were seated, we were promptly greeted and given menus by one of the waitstaff.  Having checked out the reviews ahead of time, I knew I wanted to try the raspberry French toast.  I mentioned the other items that had been featured on DDD--and that people enjoy, based on the reviews--to CM, and he decided to go with the famous pumpkin pancakes (yeah, that's what I call them, rather than hot cakes--so sue me!).  Our order was taken promptly, and was delivered to our table about 10 min. after ordering.  My French toast looked exactly like I expected, based on the pictures--it consisted of four toast points covered with raspberry sauce, and drizzled with raspberry jam.  The toast was perfectly crispy, and the sauce was delicious and flavorful--it was everything I could want in a sweet brunch item!  However, I did find the name of this dish a bit misleading, since the toast itself wasn't actually stuffed, unlike other versions I've tried before.\n\nI tried a bite of CM's pumpkin pancakes, and they were also delectable--unlike most pancakes I've had, they were quite moist even without any syrup, and definitely included real pumpkin, rather than just pumpkin pie spice, like many pumpkin items I've tried.  The butter added some welcome savoriness to the sweetness of the pancakes, and a bit of syrup added some additional moistness.  Since both of our dishes came with a breakfast meat, we ordered bacon (duh!), which provided us with a supply of umami flavor when we wanted a break from the sweetness of our entrees.\n\nOverall, CM and I were very pleased with our experience at the Dor Stop.  Our total check, which included a glass of milk for me in addition to our entrees, came to around $20, which we felt was quite reasonable in light of the quality of the dishes.  Service was friendly and efficient, and the ambiance was cheerful and light-filled--exactly what I'd expect in a diner.  Even though we both felt a tad out of place among the clientele, which was almost completely white families with young children (very different than your typical East End eating establishment, which is what we're both accustomed to), we felt welcome.  Without a doubt, the Dor-Stop offers one of the best breakfasts in PGH, and doesn't disappoint for down home diner goodness!", "business_id": "2Igiyhi82R8_QaaPplRmCw", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-04-22", "type": "review"}

That day we decided to though since I was hungry and did not want a full meal and boy am I glad that we did.  Originally I was just going to get one of the loaves of bread to have a bit then and save for later but then I noticed some true french bread pizza (aka pizza toppings on top of a slice of french bread) which I ended up getting.  While I was ordering that my fiance noticed some Sfogliatelle and she ended up ordering one of those as well.  I think the total cost was $3 and Jimmy told us the story of how the sfogliatelle was created while chomping on his cigar.  Both of our items were good and both my fiance and I were espcially impressed with the sfogliatelle.  It had a lot more filling than we are used to getting as well as a more orangy flavor which made it extra good.  Honeslty she was just happy to find a good Sfogliatelle in Pittsburgh.  She is Italian and is used to getting them with some family members at some Italian bakeries in NYC.  The second time that we came here was once again at the cart on a Sunday when Jimmy enticed us with sfogliatelle that was fresh out of the oven and still warm.  Finally the last time that we came was on a Saturday and so the whole store was open, not just the cart.  It was interesting to look around inside and see everything that I had been missing by walking past it all of these years. There were a number of display cases with a ton of baked goods in each of them and it also looked like they served a bunch of different lunch type items like sandwiches to go.  Jimmy once again waited on us and as always was super friendly and told us some stories that we enjoyed.

Tough cheese mostly tasteless and chewy. * I have had many saganaki in various countries. This ranked as one of the VERY worst! I made the best decision to leave before food poisoning set in.

Both were good, with the frico being the standout for me.  Think rustic quesadilla, but the cheese is melted and fashioned into the shell.  Yum.  \n\nMain: Mushroom Stuffed Quails and Cotechino Sausage with Cannellini Beans and Swiss-Chard.  Loved it.  Dining companions enjoyed the pasta trio (neverending bowl of house-made selections) as well as the fish special (Brazilian tiger fish).  17 bucks for house-made pasta, and as much as you want, is a great deal.  No entree was priced over 26 bucks, which was fair.  Big portions for sure.\n\nDidn't have room for dessert or coffee, but the server brought out a complimentary biscotti plate served with an affogato \"dipping sauce\" for the group to share anyway. Very classy and was appreciated.\n\nOverall: a wonderfully warm-yet-modern dining room, attentive service, a great value, and a very good meal.  Would have to visit a few more times and eat some more things to give it the full five stars, but am absolutely looking forward to the opportunity to do just that.

I'd definitely recommend reservations if possible as they can get pretty busy both on weekdays and especially weekends.\n\nThe food is amazing.  Have you seen her cooking shows on PBS?  It's just like that, times 1000 because you actually get to eat it, not just watch her cook it.  I've never had something I didn't like here, though I do have some favorites.  The duck breast is wonderful.  Perfectly cooked and prepared with a sweet cherry sauce all served over polenta.

Most of the time these are delicious, I've had a very few where they are good, but don't knock my socks off.  Just depends on your taste.  The servers do an excellent job describing the daily specials, so go with their recommendations and input.  Oh yeah, don't forge the tasting trio is all you can eat so come hungry!\n\nI almost forgot the breadbasket!  Always delicious with focaccia bread, cheesy breadsticks, and Tuscan style Italian bread served with a kalamata olive spread, garbanzo bean spread (amazing!) sitting in a moat of olive oil.  It's hard not to fill up on the bread!  If you enjoy wine, try their wine of the month by glass or bottle.  I often get it and have never had one I didn't enjoy.\n\nThe servers are always on point with excellent wine and food recommendations based on your personal tastes.  They are quick with refills, more bread and are very capable of dealing with reasonable special requests.\n\nIt's really a blessing that Lidia picked Pittsburgh as a location for one of her restaurants.

Lebanon, I went to il Pizzaiolo years ago, but haven't been back in recent memory. I don't remember much about it before, and after my experience there last night, I will remember not to go there again.\n\nWe were celebrating my friend's birthday. We got there about 7:45 with a party of 5, and there were a few tables open. The only table that was large enough to accommodate us, a table for 8, was available in the back. The brunette hostess starts to take us back there, but then the blond hostess says \"we have a large party coming in and they're going to be eating and drinking for a while.\" She points to a small table for 4 and says \"You'll sit there.\" Confused because the restaurant allegedly doesn't take reservations, we offered to wait until one of the 6-person tables opens up. The blond hostess refused. \n\nParagraph in which I rant about the blond hostess: This girl can't be older than 17. The whole time she interacted with us, she was rude, dismissive, and acted like it was a bother for her to be doing her job. She gave us so much attitude, like she was doing us a favor by seating us at all. No wonder people always comment on how bad the service is at this place - if your first impression is with a condescending high schooler who needs an attitude adjustment, it would take a lot to negate that first impression. Also, someone needs to tell this girl that tights are not pants. If I wanted to see someone's a$$ while I ate, I'd go to a strip club. /end rant\n\nWe were seated at the tiny 4-person table, two people on one side of the table (who wants to eat with a corner of the table sticking into their chest, as the hostess arranged the seats?). The 8-person table sat vacant for the first hour we were in the restaurant, and we were almost done with our meal when the allegedly expected party came. Funny how they don't take reservations, yet they would not sit us at the only table available that would accommodate our party.\n\nOur server, Ryan, was great and attentive. I think he realized how pissed off we were at the hostess and put in some extra effort.\n\nAs for the food and drink, it was just fine. Severely overpriced, but fine. Piccolo Forno is much cheaper (and is BYOB) and has much better food. \n\nThere are so many options in downtown Mt. Lebanon that there's no reason to put up with bad service, attitude, and mediocre, overpriced food.

Really cool experience and it was a beautiful night to sit outside and enjoy the atmosphere.\n\nFirst, Tuesday is bacon night and I'm not quite sure how it works, but I heard it's free bacon at the bar and $1 baskets of bacon if you're sitting at a table.  My friends and I had a drink and some bacon at the bar while we waited for a table (obviously bacon night is a hit and makes the restaurant busy).  I really enjoyed the selection of beers.  I wanted to try the Game of Thrones beer, but liked the amber beer they had too much to switch.\n\nAs an app, we shared the buffalo chicken dip.  It was not the biggest portion, but it's always nice eating grilled pita instead of just tortilla chips every so often.  The dip had very large pieces of chicken and was crusted with blue cheese.  Pretty basic and well executed.\n\nThe menu is pretty simple, but difficult to read.  My friends had been there before so they knew what to look for, but I had a difficult time reading through the commentary and trying to tell what was in each dish.  One of my friends recommended something he had gotten before, so I decided that was easier than wasting my time with the menu.\n\nI got the mac and cheese and added in lobster and bacon.  It was really decadent and better than I expected.  The cheese was very creamy and flow-y.  A lot of times, the cheese on mac and cheese doesn't flow well, but I really liked the consistency of Harris Grill's mac and cheese.  The lobster was also very delicious.  As for the bacon, they just put it on top.  So basically it was lobster mac and cheese with some bacon strips on top.  I was expecting either bacon bits mixed with everything or even bacon strips submerged in the cheese.  Nonetheless, the bacon was very crispy and i dipped a few strips in the cheese which was a solid idea.", "business_id": "rgmptwPbBH1wLpiBHcbIhA", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-04-29", "type": "review"}

The menu is pretty much the same as the previous location- which I have to say is EXTREMELY limited for vegetarians. From what I remember, the ONLY item for veggies is the veggie wrap and fries. Needless to say, this one item is really good- however, it would be nice to be able to have the choice of getting something other than this, fries, or a salad. That being said, the brunch here is amazing and perfectly vegetarian friendly. Furthermore, the drink menu here is always great, and from what I remember they have really good happy hour everyday.

Mac n cheese was off the chain. Green beans were just that, nothing special. My son had green beans, mac n cheese, and homefries.

We didn't have reservations, and still got in. Anytime there's a nice restaurant in Uptown Charlotte that you can get in to immediately without reservations on a busy evening, either it's not actually a nice restaurant, or you're the luckiest person in the world.  I would recommend reservations, but clearly they're not necessary in a pinch.  \n\n2.  The atmosphere is great. I felt cooler just being there.  The tables were covered with these cool mats that made them look like iridescent tile. My only complaint here is that we were pretty close to our neighbors at the next table, it almost felt like dinner for 4. \n\n3. Wine specials! We were there for 1/2-price wine by the glass, and both got to try some good reds. I don't remember the specifics--my husband got a Tempranillo to start, and I got a Malbec, I think.  We enjoyed both wines. After that, I don't remember our selections.\n\n4.  The menu featured some great-sounding dishes, even though both of us got the bison special.  I loved everything on the plate. It was served over grits (one of my favorites) with wilted spinach, I think. The bison itself was very delicious. I like my meat rare, and this was cooked (or rather, not cooked) to perfection.   They messed up my husband's order, but recovered quickly, and he still left pleased.\n\n5. And finally, the bowl of foil-wrapped fruit candies by the door sent me home very happy!\n\nThe only thing that was a little sub-par was the service. They were very busy, and I think they were short-staffed. I don't think it was our waiter's fault that Jim's order was wrong, but he was not as apologetic as I would have liked. It also took him a few more minutes than it should have to check on us, and discover the mistake.

This also means that it can be absolutely packed, and when there are a few college basketball games on, it's even more so.\n\nThis is because the Tavern is not only a restaurant, it is a sports bar.  That makes it a little difficult to classify, but I'll do my best.\n\nFirst, you have a largish bar area.  This section alone is larger than many sports bars these days, and it looks even larger because it's open, rather than being cramped and confined.  While there did not seem to be any smokiness to the area, there could have been some.  It was definitely loud, as most any bar will be on this sort of night.\n\nNext, you have a dining section, which wouldn't be much different than any other family-style dining area, except for the fact that it was right next to the bar.  So if you take the family, you'll want to be aware of this.  It's not exactly set up for a quiet night out, even on the calmest of times, and this certainly wasn't that.\n\nThe good news for older crowds (those without younger kids) is that if you're waiting for a table, you can wait in the bar section.  They also have these very long tables that run the length of the bar area, and you can even eat there if you don't mind the crowd.  We didn't really feel like waiting, and since the whole building had a sort of bar feel to it, felt like it really didn't matter.\n\nIn the end, it didn't.  The only problem with this was getting the attention of a waitress.  Once we did, service went along fairly well, though getting refills was a bit slow.\n\nThe food was good, and priced decently, but appetizers were expensive, as can be expected in most bars.  Wings especially were not cheap.  But it was all tasty.  I don't know that we'll be back, but it's certainly better than most bars, and definitely a leg up on most sports bars.", "business_id": "r-pBY6vR_Iu5XhPRvPnquw", "stars": 3, "date": "2007-03-26", "type": "review"}

I'd say i've had a couple of other visits to TGIF's in Charlotte and I don't recall them being a good experience. I kinda forgot that until we headed there on a whim and right away i remembered, ohhhh yea, this place is soooo loud. I'm not talking a little loud, I'm talking scream to place an order or ask your wife sitting next to you what the waiter said. Yep, that loud. \nIt took us about 15 minutes to get seated was what they had advised. The waiter was good and provided really good service (Once we could hear each other). It took another 30-45 minutes to get our food and then another 10-15 to get bill and checked out. Almost 2 hours is way to long for a meal, especially when it's impossible to have any sort of conversation with the others in your party. \nSo I believe over the years i've tried TGIF's 3 times or so and I'm pretty sure this will be the last time.

Mac Grille seemed a nicer choice than others so we stopped by. We made sure to get there early to avoid the crowds.  The problem was that Mac Grille seems to schedule wait staff very thinly at the beginning of the evening. So our waitress was the hostess! She didn't know much past where to seat us but gave her all in the attempt until the overloaded waitress stopped by to take over.  Despite it, both the hostess and the waitress were very pleasant and professional throughout. Shame on Mac Grille for understaffing though.\n\nTo the food! Meh.\n\nMy wife had something called Carmela's Chicken. It was a nice looking bowl of rigatoni, chicken, mushrooms and other assorted goodies. She seemed to enjoy it but I found it to be fairly ordinary. As a guy who cooks professionally, I am always looking to be blown away with flavor or at the very least something that I didn't think to make at home. It could have used a little salt (especially in the pasta boiling water) to bring out the nice semolina taste in the noodles. The important thing is that she liked it and was happy.\n\nI got Mama's Combo. A plate with lasagna, chicken parm and a chicken and mushroom cannelloni. The cannelloni was pretty good the lasagna was the star of the plate but the chicken parm was a pure throw away. I was unaware of where on the chicken a round disc of breast meat comes from (probably right nest to the nugget!). If I was to bet my last dollar on something to regain my vast fortune I would place it on the fact that the chicken came straight out of a box, already breaded and cooked and flash heated and put on the angle hair. Very disappointed. Did really enjoy the lasagna bolognese, though.\n\nSo, who knows, maybe one day we go back, but honestly I don't think we will feel on our deathbeds that we missed out on anything special if we never stop by again. Shame.\n\nAlso, just FYI, they were out of 2 of the 4 tap beers walking into a Friday night! Who does that? May as well run out of parmesan cheese! Oh yeah speaking of parmesan cheese, I hate restaurants that have the server put the parm on your food in those grinders. Seems like if you like a lot of parm on your grub (like all of us) you are screwing it up for the other tables, so you allow them to leave too darned soon and you are left wanting more but felling a bit shy and embarrassed to ask them to come back and pile on some more. Just sayin.\n\nEat Well!!!!!!\nV-Dub", "business_id": "hvhogN-3cMny0Nrqbsjpkg", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-05-19", "type": "review"}

Their food is some of the best diner food I've ever had. I'll be honest and admit that I usually order the same thing (BLT and chicken dumpling soup), but each is an exemplary specimen. BLT with the freshest, crispest veggies, perfectly cooked bacon, and - and here's something so many restaurants fail on - plenty of mayo! Ever notice how so many BLTs are lacking in the mayo department? Not at Pine Cone. A literally perfect sandwich.\n\nNow. About that chicken 'n dumpling soup. Here is, word for word, an actual text message I sent to my boyfriend: \"Do you think if we called ahead, they'd sell us like, a quart of that soup to go? I think it's worth trying.\" Most chefs CAN make chicken soup...not many can make it PERFECTLY. Pine Cone does. Well-made soup is very, very important to me, and something I tend to judge a restaurant on. This soup is perfect - excellent meat/veggie ratio, dumplings that are neither too fluffy nor too chewy, but right in between, just salty enough...I could go on and on, but the bottom line is, if you've never had this soup, you owe it to yourself to go out RIGHT NOW and get some. \n\nMy boyfriend usually gets the biscuits and gravy, and they are also excellent (we eat a lot of those too...). \n\nPrices are cheap, service is fast, food is unbelievable...that's all there is to it.

The waitstaff has always been attentive and professional, and the wait time for food is reasonably short. The restaurant itself and the bathrooms are clean and spacious. The ambiance is relaxed and pleasant, and noise levels are comfortably low.\n\nBut none of these things can save the mediocre-to-bad food. That is, if you get your food at all. On more than one occasion, they have forgotten to include entire entrees or side dishes when I've picked up take-out. I now double-check all of my orders before leaving. The egg rolls taste like they came out of a box in the freezer. They are greasy and heavy, with very little flavor until you douse them in sweet-and-sour sauce that's so sweet it might as well be syrup. The same problems plague the entirely unremarkable crab rangoon. I've had the hot and sour soup, and disliked the taste quite a bit. Not spicy enough, and far too sour. I usually order the ginger beef stir-fry. There's hardly any ginger flavor, and the sauce is thick and also fairly sweet. If they halved the amount of sugar in everything, it would be a good start. I've had more success with the sizzling black pepper beef, which has a punch of black pepper and a good balance of meat and vegetables. On a recent trip, a friend got the beef lo mein. It had a nice quantity of beef, but an anemic quantity of vegetables. It was also very greasy and watery, and tasted extremely bland. The only reason I go here as often as I do is that my grandmother (the poster child for stereotypical Wisconsin taste buds, bless her heart) loves the three delicacies sizzling rice.\n\nI did discover one saving grace: if you dump sriracha on the food, it blends very well with the food and elevates all of the flavors. Too bad they don't have any of it at the restaurant, it could save many a dish. Bottom line: there's much better, more authentic, more balanced, and less heavy Chinese food available in Madison at comparable prices.

My hubby will love the fact they serve breakfast all day, everyday & they have a To Go menu.\nOur server, Keith W, was personable, prompt, & so helpful in describing the different dishes. DD & I each ordered a coffee with donut ($2.79 per order) DD ordered Florentine, one of their specialities.  (Saut\u00e9ed spinach, onions, tomatoes and two poached eggs on top of crusty sourdough bread and finished with Mornay sauce & American fried potatoes  $8.99). I ordered Eggs Mornay: Two poached eggs with smoked ham on a toasted English muffin, topped with Mornay sauce & served with American fried potatoes $8.99.\nYou can order any one of six different hamburgers (five can be made gluten sensitive and one is Vegetarian) between 11am until closing. But that's not all.... They serve 11 different Entrees, 14 sandwiches, 5 salads & at least 3  soups! And I know all of that sounds wonderful, but I haven't even started to describe the specialty shakes, malts, sundaes and fountain drinks. My brother is a huge Elvis fan, so he'll probably love the \"Fat Elvis Shake\": vanilla ice cream, peanut butter, sliced bananas, & a splash of chocolate syrup ($6.99)!

By itself, the mousaka would last me two additional meals. We couldn't resist the Boston creme donut, which turned out to be the best I've had in Madison, and a gigantic cinnamon roll fritter. Plus the two coffees, the total came out to be $25 (!!) and some change. \n\nThe service is a relaxed pace, but the owners were charming and seemed to enjoy us enjoying their food.

We live on the west side of Madison so it it took a little drive just to get here, but Toby's has been on the bucket list for a while (often rated the best supper club in the greater Madison area) and it was my birthday.  To begin, the bartender we had was amazing.  He made great drinks, and was quick at it.  Their old fashioned's were great.  We put in our order for 2 entrees and an appetizer.  The place is standing room only for the most part because it is so packed.  We got our appetizer but a table wasn't available yet, so we ate our moz sticks while standing at the bar.  They were actually amazing, but how can you screw that up?  It was about 90 minutes before we were finally seated.  We ate are salads and rolls and whatnot because we were starving.  It was probably close to 30 minutes after being seated that we got our entrees.  My New York strip was perfectly medium as requested.  It was very tender and juicy.  The hashbrowns with cheese were pretty bland and nothing to write home about.  She got the steak and shrimp, and thought it was was cooked well but under-seasoned also.  The waitresses were running around and quite busy, which resulted in getting very little in terms of service.  I had to go to the bar for more drinks because we got so little attention.  We were very disappointed at this point with the service and the amount of time spent there and asked for the check.  The atmosphere was very typical of a supper club, except for the fact that the bar was packed 3 deep and it was very loud with conversation.  This might have been more exciting to us if we were locals and knew other people.  I will gladly skip out on the drive and long wait for food to go to Klassic Tavern in Verona, or other similar establishments on the west side, rather than come back.  If you're a local or have recently eaten, Toby's is a great option for you.  I will say the patrons were friendly and helpful, as we didn't know how the ordering process works.  The bartender basically gives you a menu and you wait for a waitress walking around to see you and take your order on the spot.  I would probably be a regular here if I lived in McFarland, but I have better options closer, and I don't get how this has numerous nominations as best Madison area supper club.", "business_id": "FIR1SRvSAMNTO3VvNaJn2g", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-04-10", "type": "review"}

We started off with the broiled goat cheese as an appetizer which was very tasty, and then I got the grilled salmon as an entre.  Like everything else in Radio Maria, it was cooked well, plated beautifully, and served relatively promptly.\n\nI came here again several weeks later for brunch with some friends and had a craving for some spicy sausage so I got the house-made chorizo omelet.

Radio's selection of beer and spirits is dizzying and its bartenders have been, in my experience, charming and skilled. Their tapas menu is a little uneven, but with that topography come some nice peaks.\n\nFor sit-down dinners, there's a dining area and outside seating, both of which are quite nice. The dinner menu is small but far more evenly excellent. Their desserts are also wonderful. Other restaurants in the area with comparable pricing can't deliver meals this nice.\n\nAnd finally, go to Radio Maria for brunch. You'll spend about as much as you might at, say, \"Le Peep,\" but your meal will be ten times as good.

The prices were not rock-bottom, but I am always willing to pay a little more for good food and larger portions, both of which Wild Thaiger offers. The papaya salad was refreshing and really authentic, although the shrimp were a little fishy for our tastes. The soup we had was also very flavorful and best of all, the chicken in it was actual pieces of chicken breast (often, the chicken in soup is small pieces of dark meat). The Mussaman curry was also a lot better than most places we have had it - often, restaurants use pieces of flank or strip steak, but a more authentic version, like the one we had here, has more stew-like cuts of almost-braised beef. Also a real winner were the spicy clear/glass noodles with vegetables and chicken.

I was surprised by how not crowded it was on Saturday before the game. Also, the most vocal fans were the table of Mets fans sitting on the patio (I was wearing my Mets hat), so we cheered with them for a minute before going inside.  When we walked in there were less than a handful of people at the circular bar and maybe three tables were occupied.  For a game day, service was quick and our server was nice.\n\nI think the food at Coach and Willie's is solid bar food with large portions. TI've had the chicken tenders and fries which is good. The tenders have a very light breading which I appreciate. I've also tried the chicken nachos which were OK...at times I would only get chicken and no chips. I've had better chicken nachos at other sports bars.\n\nDuring the week, lunchtime service is a mess. Service is slow. Really slow actually. I don't mind taking longer lunches occasionally, but last time I went with five coworkers and we nearly had a two hour lunch at Coach and Willie's. That is much too slow in my opinion! Plus, seperating checks is a nightmare there, so my advice is if you go with a group, just bring cash.\n\nThere are plenty of TVs and when my husband and I met for lunch there in March, I asked for the TV closest to us to be turned to the Ohio State Big 10 basketball tournament game which they did willingly. I definitely appreciated it.  However, this past Saturday, did every TV need to be on the Kentucky Derby...and it wasn't even the Derby, it was like the \"red carpet\" event hosted by Molly Sims. Blah, I would have much preferred some baseball.\n\nCoach and Willie's is an easy walk to Chase Field and I believe after Dbacks games, they have a reverse happy hour.

Being vertically challenged, I was pleased that the booth bench was high in relation to the table level, but it certainly could have had a lot more cushion.  \n\nWe were brought drinks, had orders took, and tortilla chips brought promptly. I really liked the chips. They were paper thin, very crispy, and were glistening with fresh, hot, fryer oil. The pico de gallo type salsa also tasted very fresh and home-made, but it could have done better with a few less chopped onion chunks in it. Upon request, we were also brought a bowl of more picante salsa, which had the flavor of roasted red chilies. Nice.\n\nOur orders, both from the lunch menu, were also served quite quickly.  My husband had a cheese enchilada/chicken taco combo (~$6.25) which came with black beans (on request), rice, and a cabbage garnish. I didn't even see the taco since my husband devoured it so fast, but his enchilada was swimming in a mixture of cheese & red sauce which he said was pretty tasty. \n\nI had a chicken enchilada (~$6.75). There were nice chunks of breast in there that actually tasted like chicken, unlike some other mexican joints where the meats all have the same texture & flavor. The enchilada was drizzled with a nice green chili sauce. The spanish rice was a little bit nondescript, but was more edible than some other restaurants'.  Mine was also served with black beans as requested, and a cabbage garnish. There were also more big chunks of onion in the garnish. I'm not an onion hater, don't get me wrong, but I'm sure after this feast, nobody would want to be within four feet of me. If I was on lunch break from one of the nearby offices, I'd probably request they go easy on the onions, lest I offend my work-mates back at the office.\n\nAlthough I arrived with a huge appetite, I was stuffed after devouring everything on my plate. The service was very good. Our waitress was quite attentive and quick. The food was delicious. The prices were reasonable.

Sometimes the cheese doesnt melt right and its lumpy but the flavor is divine. No boring grill cheese there. The rye adds a lovely added dimension of grilled-cheesiness.\n\nNow for the new, sexier menu, there are a few more veg options. \n\nI had the hummus and salad plate and I was so surprised at the awesome flavor. The hummus was as good as my homemade hummus and the salad is very well done with real lettuce (no nutritionless iceburg here) and fresh veggies and of course, the requisite Zoe's feta cheese. The cucumber Raita was just the right touch. \n\nSoooooo tasty!\n\nNow I'm not a fan of any of their sides, till now. The Braised white beans are a dream. I dont know what spices they used (ginger maybe?) but I couldnt believe my tastebuds.

Being able to watch the light rail go by gives it a very urban vibe which is a nice change from the usual suburban strip mall locale of most places in Phoenix. \n\nI went here with a group of four for spring restaurant week. I am not sure if this was really such a good deal since the pizzas on their menu all sounded awesome and were much cheaper than the $30pp that we paid. But we happily decided to save that for another time and so we all ordered off the prix-fix menu. Everyone at the table liked their food though one person felt their chicken was a little undercooked. We got a variety of options so that we could all sample each others food. For me, the highlight was the gazpacho. It was really delicious. None of the other dishes were really out-of-this-world great, but still impressive food for a place that appears to primarily be a wine bar. \n\nThe best part was that our server was able to recommend wines for each of us that we had never tried before but really enjoyed. I love trying new wines so that was a lot of fun. A small plus is that it prints the name of the wine on the receipt so I can actually remember the name to hopefully purchase a bottle another time. Even though I don't come to this midtown area often, this place is right down the street from the art museum so I will definitely be back.", "business_id": "muCl5p-9ut1sY0aKeUeRhw", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-05-16", "type": "review"}

Alice Cooperstown still stands for a reason.  The staff is friendly and fun loving, the menu diverse and in unison with the rocking roll and sports themed decor. \n\nI usually get the BBQ sampler or the incredibly stacked nachos, but tonight I went for the simplicity of the Tom Brady Burger.  It was \"Spot On.\" \n\nThe bacon was crisp and plentiful and the burger itself was perfectly cooked with a smoky charbroiled taste.  The fries were fresh, crisp and spiced perfectly. \n\nI opted for two Kiltlifter beers, from local microbrew Four Peaks Brewery.\nThe beer was available on draft served in nicely chilled her glass. \n\nGiant screen television monitors are strategically placed throughout the cavernous restaurant so every seat can view the game or games. \n\nThe only negative remark actually is as a result of their popularity:  You may have to wait a while on big game or concert nights, plan for that contingency arrive early and enjoy the fun. \n\n\"UNIT!\"", "business_id": "oCA2OZcd_Jo_ggVmUx3WVw", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-04-30", "type": "review"}

I suggest sitting inside by a window, same view as the patio but more comfortable. \n\nI understand that $10 for parking, $20-30 per bleacher ticket, and $35 per person for a buffet isn't exactly living on the \"cheap\" for a lot of people, but I promise it is the best way to experience a ball game on a budget.

I'm not a religious man. Easter is just another day of the week for me, however I am a man who can appreciate a day off work. That said, I am grateful that you were open so that I and my degenerate crew could enjoy your establishment. \n\nThing 2: Thank you for having delicious food. That is all.\n\nThis was our first time trying Welcome Diner. We pretty much almost tried one of everything... because why not. \n\nThe Fried Green Tomato Sandwich and the Biscuits and Gravy were my top two items. As I've declared unabashedly in the past, I'm from the south and these two items brought me back home. Very well done in their own unique way. \n\nI think the thing that was most surprising about WD is that they were churning out this great food from such an unassuming place. It looks like they just dropped a little ol' diner right in a residential neighborhood. The location is also just east of Roosevelt Row, in a slightly more rough area. Not bad, but some people might shy away. \n\nThe only issue I see, particularly with summer coming up is that, if I'm not mistaken (which I could be), majority of the seating is outside. There are sun shades, but from our experience, even with said shades, if you're sitting in the wrong spot, you could still get pretty toasty from the sun. \n\nWe sat outside on our visit because it was beautiful. Although as the morning moved along it did get uncomfortable at times when the sun would be at just the right angle to blast you for just long enough you could feel the sunburn happening. \n\nAll that said, get there while the weather is good!

There was 5 of us and we were seated promptly. I was skeptical at first, mostly because I was not feeling like I wanted Mexican Seafood, but when I had the first sip of my Limonada (freshly prepared and refreshing) and dipped into the homemade chips and salsa, I knew all would be ok. \n\nIt took me quite a while to choose from several options on the menu. Most of my lunch partners went for the baja fish tacos, another for the Camarones al mojo de ajo...or Garlic Shrimp. Two of us decided on the Camarones Rellenos (stuffed shrimp). Now when I think stuffed shrimp I think of my favorite stuffed shrimp at Papadeaux's, with lots of flavor. I was expecting the same here. When it arrived there were 6 large bacon wrapped shrimp on a small bed of french fries, accompanied by refried beans and rice. The rice and beans were very good, the filling in the bacon wrapped shrimp was very basic unseasoned Ricotta/Requeson, not like the jalapeno, garlic, with monterey jack cheese I have had at other places. It was admittedly bland. I added lime but decided against any of the bottled hot sauces on the table. I should have spooned over some of the salsa but hind sight 20/20.   The other diners with me enjoyed the fish tacos but mentioned they had had better, while the other with the Garlic Shrimp raved about that dish.  \nIn all I would go back here to try any of their other dishes on their menu.", "business_id": "NYBx4sdSVrN-I5Q8RfLMPg", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-05-03", "type": "review"}

There's the ones in strip malls that typically feature a grouchy old man behind the counter and a huge TV displaying Indian MTV or soap operas, and largely do-it-yourself service. (See: Kohinoor)\n\nIf I'm feeling like spoiling myself, I'll take the next jump up to the places with painted walls, friendly waitstaff, and a-la-carte style menus instead of \"specials.\"\n\nAfter a long day at work and in hippy progressive meetings, me and my beyonce decided to try Indian Delhi Palace, which is an excellent example of the latter.\n\nThe waiters were attentive without  being overbearing, and the complimentary appetizer - I always forget the name - the crispy, slightly sweet cracker thingamajig with the green sauce? - was yummy.  And the samosas we started off with were also great.  Not overly greasy or soggy or stale like a lot of Indian places.\n\nThe palak paneer is wonderful!  Ask for it spicy if you are a fan of spicy foods.  The creamy spinach flavor doesn't become overbearingly hot, but has a pleasant spicy aftertaste that mixes perfectly with their garlic naan, served fresh, of the soft and chewy variety that I prefer.\n\nRE: The people who miss paneer... The paneer was definitely on the skimpy side, but I didn't mind.  The taste was definitely still there - perhaps they blend it in more than other restaurants?  Anyway, if you are a huge fan of blocks of paneer in your food, you might want to mention as such to your server.\n\nThe lady ordered vegetable bhriyani, which is sort of our Indian comfort food, and it didn't disappoint.

I must say this time the sopes were smaller and they did not have much beans on them in fact they didn't put much on them at all. usually they are topped with beans lettuce oinons and shredded cheese this time it was just a small  amount of beans, and just a tiny amount of lettuce. I also orderd chillis torreados with onions. the chillis  are always perfect here they don't over cook them. the onions on the other hand are always very oily and over cooked. Over all I like this place and would recommend.  the fact that they have sopes and huaraches. Because if you look most Mexican restaurants don't have sopes, gorditas or huaraches.

Perhaps I should have cut my teeth on something a little less flamboyant than the Pillow Chicken when I first went here, because each dish I've tried after that has left me disappointed.  \n\nHowever, keep in mind that I've been ordering off of the lunch special menu lately, and those dishes are usually a little less spectacular on anyone's menu.  But I guess that's no excuse, as anything you serve to your customers should be prepared to the utmost.  \n\nAnyway, today's dish, House Special Chicken...  Its described as battered chicken in a spicy garlic sauce.  Its battered and spicy, but not very garlicy.  Still its decent.  A good taste, just not a very eventful taste.  Of note is how tender and delicious the chicken was.  I felt like taking it and putting in a sandwich.\n\nAgain, the soup of the day was the one that I cannot eat.  Don't know what this stuff is...but I guess somebody on this planet must like it.\n\nOh well, I can either hold this place in high regards related to the lone dinner entree I've tried and downgrade it for the few lackluster dishes I've had afterwards...or I can give them a break since most 'lunch combos' are only good enough to fill stomachs at the office and not to wow the tastebuds.  \n\nMeh.

We both ordered their beer sampler, (6 four-ounce beers!!) and the server also brought a taster of a seasonal beer for us.  Let's just say by the end of it, I was super tipsy!  The Light Rail cream ale is good if you're new to beers, or just like lighter brews.  I am not a hop head, so the IPA was definitely not my fave nor was the Red Ale.  The hef tasted rotten, and I usually like wheat beers, so maybe something was a little off.  My favorite, hands down, was the Vanilla Porter!  I absolutely adore dark beers (Stouts/Milk Stouts, Porters, etc.) and this one was a perfect blend of vanilla and dark beery goodness.  I still think about this beer, and I will go back for it someday.\n\nThe food was a different story.  Remember how I asked for my burger medium?  Yeah, it came out well done, which sucked...but I ate it anyway, cause I needed something besides beer in my stomach.

This place is always busy, so expect a wait even during the week. The best time to come is after 9pm in my opinion. I have seen the wait as long as two hours, no joke. They don't take reservations and all the party has to be there for them to list you. Choose inside, outside or first available. You can order a drink and even apps for the wait. This is basically a bar that sells food so leave the kiddos at home. They will not enjoy it here, you will not enjoy it here with them and everyone else will not enjoy it so take them to McDonalds and leave them with a sitter. You deserve a night out anyway.\n\nThe Pizza Cookie is really good. I like Chocolate Chip/Peanut Butter. The servers here really work their buts off. They will do most anything to make your meal here a great one. They even chit chat with you if you like and make you feel special.

They have a solid business and I attribute that to their growth, but for the most part the employees seem to like working there.\n\nMy only real beef aside from the wait is there are only two bathrooms. One Male and one Female. As many customers as this place has they need to figure a way to add dividers and make it so more can use as there is always a line. The parking is not a big deal to me.

Nothing is grosser to me than biting into a chicken wing and getting a big mouthful of greasy, fatty flabby chicken skin.  YUCK.   Long Wong's wings are deep fried and come out meaty and chewy and little bit crispy.  Delicious!  Kinda like the perfectly browned skin on the Thanksgiving turkey, but covered in delicious hot wing sauce.  Someone once complained that they were similar to chicken jerky and I think that was a compliment!  The way they are cooked you can appreciate the meat and crispy skin and the sauce and you don't have to muck through a heavy breading or flabby, fatty chicken skin.  \n\nTheir $5 cheese pizza isn't bad either.  And for some odd reason their fountain Pepsi is somehow more yummy than most fountain dispensed Pepsi at other restaurants.

I ordered a gyro platter and the gyro meat was not shaved off the spit like one might expect, but it seemed to be more like thin pieces of meat fried in a pan on their stove top. My guess is because they don't do a high enough volume that an entire cone of gyro would be too wasteful - although I could be wrong. Either way, ive had much better gyro from other establishments.\n\nIf you're looking for better mediterranean food I would recommend cypres grill over on camelback, just next to the trader joes.

I'm so glad I finally ventured in. It's adorable!  \n\nWith copious amounts of places to sit (inside and out) it's perfect for a leisurely bite. My adventure was during a Friday happy hour. (M-F, 5-7pm. $3 drafts! $3 house wine!) Arriving early to secure an outdoor patio spot we meandered thru the space. There's live music on Fridays with a start time of ~ 6pm. \n\nTHE BASICS\nCooking accessories, teas, coffees, spices, a wide array of imported specialty foods line the shelves. Need some meat? They've got it. Want a sweet? Yep. In the mood for a sandwich? Si. Want some cheese? Be adventurous! They have adorable tiny wedges for a buck and change. \"Try something new without fear of commitment.\" Ha!\n\nThe wine / bar area, though petite in size, is lined floor to ceiling with wine bottles. Bob, the bartender on Fridays, is the friendliest gentlemen you could ever meet. The beer fridge is filled with a respectable number of bottles. \n\nSEATING\nThere's plenty of it. Two floors. My visit we were focused on nabbing seating outside near the live music. Turns out the music is fairly loud and you don't need to sit that close! You order your food inside and service your own tables here.\n\nFor noshing we nibbled on a patio cheese tray. I'm not entirely sure what cheese was served. Our platter included a small palmful of soft cheese, a jam spread, sliced bread and sliced apple. For the price point I'd actually have preferred a sandwich. But still tasty!\n\nWINE TASTINGS\nAt Duck & Decanter you can arrange a private wine & beer tasting for groups of 14-24 ppl. Lasting two hours in duration the sessions include the booze (duh!), cheese, printed info and a host. Sometimes they can include additional food. It depends on headcount and budget. ($20-$35 /person + gratuity + tax). This seems like a really neat thing to set up.\n\nTasting menu examples...The Beer Tasting has you traveling thru six different countries. The Business Mixer offers three red and three white wines. The Blind Tasting sounds awesome! Wine is served from a brown bag and it's up to guests to pick the grape. \n\nSo anyway, Duck & Decanter is a pretty neat experience!

The bartender handed me a happy hour menu and a regular and convinced me on getting one of her \"signature\" margaritas. \nWell I looked over the regular and the happy hour menu. Some items were only like 30 cents below the regular price and another item (Edamame) was $3.98 on the regular menu and $4 on the happy hour menu. I decided on a Shrimp Cocktail ($9something on the regular menu and $6 on the happy hour). \nWhile waiting on my shrimp, I was served up this \"signature\" margarita. The rim ooozing with a strange red concoction. It was weird,  I asked what it was the bartender said it was chile and claimed that it was the key to making the margarita so great. [Hummm...ok?!]  I was brave enough to sample, which turned out to be some strange chile lime slime instead of salt. Ok?! Just weird I used the lime at the rim of my glass to wipe off this ooze when the bartender wasn't looking...she seemed so proud of this mess she was calling signature. Not one to waste liquor I finished it. \nThe shrimp cocktail arrived and looked promising 6 good sized shrimp, garnished nicely. The cocktail sauce was spicy with lots of horseradish, which I enjoyed. The avocado was a nice compliment not too much. The Shrimp....over cooked, tough....but I ate 'em. The crackers, provided while still individually wrapped still had a taste like they came out of my grandma's purse.

The kitchen was backed up for 45 minutes with the restaurant only half full.  After a long wait, 2 out of 3 orders were wrong and no one liked what did show up on their plate.  I got the Pollack \"all you can eat\" fish fry.  Wow, was it disappointing after the long wait.  The plate showed up with basically one semi-large fish stick.  I stared at it for a few minutes in shock at the lack of food and honestly, gross presentation.  I'm not some snooty guy and I was expecting something in the Denny's/Shari's realm but wow was it worse.  Rather than dive in, I pulled a Gordon Ramsey and pulled apart the fish stick to see what was inside.  As big as it was, there was almost no fish.  Ate a bite of fish and couldn't continue.  I was so frustrated by the experience and the sub-par food that I couldn't bring myself to eat it.  In my entire life, I have never sent anything back to the kitchen, until today.  The waitress came around eventually and I let her know that I was sending it back.  She offered to bring out another dish but I was too irritated and couldn't wait another 45 minutes anyway.

Worst restaurant experience I've ever had in my 50 years of existence. Here's the experience went\n\n1. Right out of the gate...Our hostess who seated us told us the fruit and chocolate fountain were included with the meal. My girlfriend grabbed two pieces of melon and two strawberries.When our waitress did finally decide to show up 10 minutes later we both ordered a cup of Albondigas soup without rice. She made a snotty remark that we should get the bowl of soup because the cups were small. She then barked at us that if we don't order an entree that we would have to pay $8 for the four pieces of fruit. I said whoa, hold on. We are ordering entrees. She replied that a lot of people come in just for soup. All of this is going on while my girlfriend and I are still reading the menu to decide what we wanted. I want to know what other people just ordering soup has to do with us.\n\n2. After 30 minutes the entrees arrived. I complained that it took way too long and the waitress said they had a large party and that is why the food took so long. Mind you I ordered 2 enchiladas and my girlfriend ordered a gound beef tostada and it took 30 minutes...no shit. How hard is that to make? I told her that we are just important as any other customer in the restaurant. She sent the manager over and he said the same thing. Large party sorry. I told him I don't care about the large party. Not our problem. That was it...he walked away. I looked around and the place was practically empty.\n\n3. I ordered beans and rice with my meal. The waitress didn't even have enough courtesy to listen to me. She brought me fideo (mexican pasta) instead of rice.She also brought fideo and beans for my girlfriend who ordered her tostada ala carte.and charged us for it. When my girlfriend ordered just the tostada the snotty bitch complained that my girlfriend wasn't ordering more.\n\n4. After trying to eat what was very poorly made food (we couldn't eat it because it was horrible) we went to pay the bill and noticed extra charges. We complained again. This time the manager did not come to talk to us. He told her to tell us the meal was comped. Since we couldn't eat that crap, that was fine with me. My girlfriend was going to taste my enchiladas and without asking one of the bussers took my plate away.\n\n5. Finally I asked to speak with the manager and a waiter called him (Marty) and the manager turned around and yelled across the bar that he was too busy. He LITERALLY yelled it. Then he noticed me standing there and said Oh, I'm sorry. I replied no I'm sorry that you are too busy. I told him I would never return. That was the last straw.\n\nThe waitress was a snotty bitch and never checked on us once except to give us the check. We had to ask other wait staff to get our waitress more than twice. If you are smart you will not waste your time or money at Aunt Chiladas. Over rated and over priced. This place should be out of business.\n\nOh and the Chocolate fountain is disgusting.

I was enjoying the halibut with shrimp, asparagus and purple mashed potatoes.  I finished the shrimp and still had most of my halibut and mashed potatoes when I set my fork down to look at my phone.  (My fault I guess...)  Because the next thing I noticed, a server took my plate away.  There was no \"Are you finished?\" or \"Would you like to take this to go?\"  Nothing...just took my plate away.  I noticed that he stacked my plate, so there was no way to retrieve my food.  My friends were finished with their dishes....so when I said \"I am sorry, but you took my plate away and I wasn't done\", the waiter said that he was sorry and was about to go back to retrieve it.  I told him that I didn't want it now, so he did offer to have the chef make me a new one. (NO!) or if he could refill my drink.  (I was driving, so NO!) I would have thought that I would have gotten a complimentary dessert but I didn't.  I was being treated for this dinner, but still,  the dinner wasn't even comped or had a percentage taken off. \n\nI would love to try this place again since the food and view were great.  I would just hope that my service next time would be better.", "business_id": "3Zsjlum5kl5N5KV712aTMQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-03-29", "type": "review"}

The reviews we've read definitely made this place seem like a winner.  I made a reservation for 6:30, just shortly after the restaurant opens.  The drive up the mountain was steep but the resort is beautiful and you could just tell that the view at the top would be amazing.  Were we ever surprised!\n\nThe valet parked my car and we went inside to be seated.  Unfortunately the patio wasn't open for service but they sat us by the window so we had a great view of downtown Phoenix.  One complaint we did have about our table was that it felt like we were in the path of all the server traffic.  It was also right next to a door to the patio so a couple of people tried to come in and out but the door was locked, so that was a little distracting.  \n\nOur server, Lenny I believe was his name, was very friendly and informative.  There were so many people that came to our table giving us water refills and bread and clearing our plates.  Lenny helped me pair a wine with my dinner.  My wife ordered the duck ravioli as an appetizer and I had the lobster bisque.  The lobster bisque was phenomenal, every bit as good as the previous yelpers have proclaimed.  And the duck raviolis were excellent as well.  The ravioli was cooked perfectly, just aldente enough so that it had a nice chew, the way I like my pasta cooked.\n\nFor dinner, my wife had the lobster and prosciutto wrapped prawns.  Both were so flavorful because they were braised in butter, which adds flavor every time.  I had the scallops over a bed of rainbow cauliflower and some sauce.  The sauce was a little too citrusy  for me and the scallops were almost better without it.  There were also a couple pieces of black garlic, which I forgot was in the dish.  So when I took a bite of one not knowing what it was, that sent my mouth into shock and I immediately had to wash it down with water.  Minus that, both dishes were very good.\n\nAfter dinner, we walked out onto the patio and down to the bar section to take some pictures with the city in the background.  The weather was amazing and we were so lucky to have the cityscape as our backdrop.  Dinner was a little pricey but I was glad we could share a fancy dinner on a special occasion.", "business_id": "3Zsjlum5kl5N5KV712aTMQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-04-03", "type": "review"}

I had the strawberry/rubarb parfait, my husband, the lemon cake which really was more the size of a thimble, but delicious.

Then off to our shared appertizer - Hamachi Crudo, aka yellowtail sashimi. Well, I had to mark off a star by paying $14 for a plate of fish that's almost equivalent to one piece of sashimi in a normal sushi restaurant, maybe I should compliment great knife work to the chef? And no, you did not use blood orange as described on the menu, the color is too light to say 'blood'. \n\nPan Seared Barramundi - pleasant presentation and tasty fish, but the bed of olives and toasted farro with feta cheese, hmmm, very sour and too salty for me, and maybe too many drizzels of olive oil? Also, it seems like they really like this garlic crisp, saw it twice on three different dishes! And decent 3.5 stars to the short ribs! It's good but not impressed.\n\nI don't think I've ever said no to a dessert, in fact, how can you fail a dessert? Well, I was proven wrong that you can mess up a dessert, very badly. We took the waiter's suggestion and took his favorite chiffon cake (no offense to our waiter), but this cake had the strangest taste, the middle part is a saffron flavored ice cream? I had to admit I just tasted Indian or persian on my cake, not to mention that the edge of the cake looked like it was bitten off by a mouse, why so uneven? all three of us had a bite and all had the same reaction - please take it away...\n\nOverall, the high expectations of good food due to such beautiful view did not work for us, and be careful with the dessert!", "business_id": "3Zsjlum5kl5N5KV712aTMQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-05-19", "type": "review"}

So my last review about this place I was upset a little not because the food was bad or anything it was actually good but I am  always getting teased about being hispanic and not able to even eat the mild sauce from taco bell without sweating and panting with my tongue for a drink. Lol\nBut I had ordered mild and received hot last time and wasn't pleased because I honestly at 4 wings and the rest sat in the fridge for a week before I threw them out. I had called and someone offered me 12 wings and I thought it was fair but I am not the type to really complain or go running to get free food like some people would do but needless to say I was contacted by vinnie and offered to replace my whole order and even a pizza. I offered to pay for the pizza because again I am not a free food person. I know nothing in this world is free unless it's your birthday then there is an exception. Ha ha ha\nWell I met with vinnie and he was awesome and very friendly and approachable I got the pizza and wings and able to eat the wings this time it was amazing. Best wings I have had in years they were juicy and crunchy and not small. I have been to some places where the wings are so small you get like one and a half bite of it but these wings are huge and the pizza that I was able to try for the first time was amazing as well. The cheese was flowing and piping hot and the sauce has to be a secret recipe past down from a family genius because it was perfect and not too over spiced or sweet. I am so glad he contacted me to try it out again and I know that our family Friday night pizza will be ordered from this place going forward in the future.  My kids even ate the crust and not sure about other people's kids but for mine to eat the crust it's nothing short of a miracle. Awesome food and great people and I will continue to be a repeat customer and I think that if you are reading reviews to figure which pizza place to try then look no further because this place is not expensive, delicious and will feed the whole family for under 25 bucks.

When I pulled up I noticed the bar next door and there was loud people and smoking and sounded like a few guys arguing so definitely not a place you want to take your kids for picking up pizza. The pizza was the main reason for the trip to Domino's especially since it's a few blocks from my house so why pay the extra 5 to 6 dollars for delivery. We got the 2 medium 2 topping pizzas and 16 parmesan bread bites the pizza had hardly any sauce and the crust was really greasy like they slapped too much of the butter flavor on it and wasn't all to appetizing as a family we can eat 2 medium pizzas no problem especially being that we have hungry kids but there is still a whole pizza left over rare for our family on pizza night. The bread bites didn't come with sauce so I paid the extra 75 cents for a cup of the most awful tasting marinara sauce and the bites were greasy and so salty it was hardly edible.\nSo on a fair note being that the cheese was the only thing good about the pizza give this Domino's 2 stars and I won't be going back probably for another year or so just to remind myself why we never order from Domino's.", "business_id": "fyy4WNuchHJBa2zH6L8QQw", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-04-11", "type": "review"}

A primarily delivery-based pizza place is an hour and a half on deliveries? What in the world...? \n\nAnyhow, we changed our minds and stated that it was for pickup.

Both the assistant manager on duty the night of our dining and the managing director, Kevin Hommert, called to discuss the disappointing service. Kevin was very open and non-defensive. He's made a few changes already to the table cleaning process and seemed very committed to improving the service level through better staff training.  I wasn't asked to change my review, but I moved it up from 2 to 3 stars to reflect the outreach and positive attitude.\n\n\nOK Food -  Combined with the Staff Training of an Average Fast Food Restaurant .\n\nOften, I think the host position in restaurants sets the stage for the entire meal. How many times have you walked into a restaurant, only to find the hostess staring at the seating map? Hello? Hum, maybe I'll check my phone for messages..... 'Oh Hi!'\nThat's how our dining experience started at Outback. It's not a big deal, but if I ran a restaurant, I'd have a greeter and someone working the table map. It's an easy way to differentiate your restaurant in a crowded market. \n\nAnyway, we were asked to wait a couple minutes while they bussed a table. \n\nWell a couple minutes turned into 10 or more minutes, so I got to watch the table busing process at work. At this Outback, table busing is done by the assistant hostesses. Behind the hostess stand, there's a napkin on the floor with a bucket of disinfectant solution. Once the assistant host is done busing the table they drop the cleaning rag near the bucket, grab menus and seat the party.  Sometimes the rag  lands on the edge of the napkin, sometimes partly on the floor. Doesn't seem to bother anyone doing it, but I doubt it would meet with the approval of a health inspector. It certainly can't impress any customers who notice.\n\nAnyway, back to our wait. Several new parties walk in and are seated, so I approach the hostess and ask if she's forgotten about us. She looks confused and surprised. It's obvious she has - and we were quickly seated on the other side of the restaurant. Our table hadn't been cleaned properly, so my wife had to wait another 7-8 minutes or so until our waitress arrived, as she had been getting drinks for a large party. We asked to have the table cleaned. She immediately asked the hostess stand to send someone over. They grab the rag off the floor and head over --somewhere else in a big hurry. Meanwhile she takes our drink order and food order - still no table cleaning. We ask again. She asks again. An assistant host heads over with the rag from the floor. I ask for a clean rag, not one off the floor - or  'off the napkin on the floor' -  as they put it, and eventually we have a clean table - well at least it's not sticky any more.\n\nFood was OK. Waitress did a great job trying to make things right. The hostess came over at the end of the meal to apologize for the rocky start, and offer desert. I told her that was very nice. I don't think I've ever had a hostess come over and apologize, so I thanked her. She offered desert again. We declined again. (We can't have it for health reasons.)  Nice service recovery until she got up to leave. As she walks away, she has the oddest expression. I think it was something between wanting to roll her eyes, (but she didn't) to being frustrated by us not accepting the 'peace offering', to confusion as how someone could possibly turn down desert.  \n\nI wish restaurants moved beyond 'free desert' as the solution to all problems. Not everyone is looking for a freebie. Most people just want great food, and good service from a well trained staff. Where was the manager in all this? I don't know. I didn't ask to speak with one, but a good one would have come over early in the dinner. I don't know, maybe the hostess was the manager, but she seemed a bit young and running the host stand certainly doesn't leave time to make sure things are running smoothly.\n\nI sent Outback a similar review, but they haven't acknowledged it or responded to me, which tells me the lack of customer engagement is probably systemic. Outback is part of the Blooming Brands chain of restaurants. Other brands include Carrabba's, Bonefish Grill, Flemings and Roy's. Flemings has good food and excellent service. But, I guess I just don't get the Outback, Carrabba, Bonefish Grill model of moderately expensive food paired with mediocre, inexperienced service. \n\nIf you're going to drop $100 on a steak dinner do yourselves a favor and avoid chain restaurants, especially those with inconsistent management.  Food was OK, but with the exception of the nice waitress, the staff was about as well trained as your average fast food restaurant. Not a good situation when your bill comes in near $100. Find a good independent steak house and pay the extra bucks. It'll be worth it.", "business_id": "4mZ__NR8jLD1k0rYpSbplA", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-03-10", "type": "review"}

Generous, steaming hot portions of wonderfully flavorful Italian favorites. We wanted to experience those memories and to share them with our kids (11 & 13) who have no frame of reference.\n\nUnfortunately we've had so many false starts over so many years we've gotten quite skeptical. As mentioned in other reviews the location of Roma didn't mitigate our skepticism much, around the far corner in a strip mall that is mostly closed up gave us a long moment of pause. Upon entering our worries were calmed. Nicely appointed, comfortable and inviting, we were relieved. \n\nThe menu is familiar yet there are plenty of options you may not expect. Veal is my favorite dish but I've been disappointed for over 20 years so I resisted. We decided to stay with some classic's. Caesar Salad for an appetizer, Spaghetti & Meatballs, Lasagna Bolognese, Mostaccioli and Chicken Cacciatore. The busser brought a huge portion of hot, toasted bread with herbed butter to get started.\n\nThe herbed butter was a pleasant surprise as we've found that most chef's overdo it on the herbs. The Caesar was pleasant, tangy and we accepted the offered extra parmesan & ground pepper. The food come out as we were all taking our last bites - perfect!\n\nAll four dishes were fantastic. Healthy, steaming hot portions of perfectly cooked pasta, hallelujah!!!! Someone who understands that \"al dente\" doesn't mean chewy, it means firm. Plenty of gooey melted cheese, wonderful sauces, hearty meatballs, flavors that complemented each dish perfectly. We gorged ourselves, happy to share with each other the reality that each one of us chose something we really enjoyed, what flavors, what fun!\n\nThe service was nice, not overbearing, overly formal, rushed or slow. The table was well maintained, refills came at the appropriate times, small talk and smiles were honest and easy. A perfect compliment to the meal.\n\nWe had no room for dessert but we still got the Outrageous Chocolate Cake - gone in 1 minute. We were stuffed, but had (4) boxes heavy with left overs to take and enjoy at home. The final treat was the complimentary Amaretto aperitifs to cap off the finest Italian meal we've had in over 20 years.\n\nTo top off the entire experience we got to chat with the owners just before leaving. It really doesn't get any better. (Veal next visit for sure.)\n\nP.S.  Well, I guess it does get better - after a 2 hour ride back to Flagstaff our son decided that he enjoyed his meal so much he couldn't wait until the next day so he heated up his left overs before going to bed.

Probably stay away from the soups going forward to focus on better stuff.\n\nI love spicy food and my request for a chili sauce or hot sauce was answered with a funky paste of mostly seeds that had absolutely zero heat level to it---and I mean zero.

I told him the information and he told me that it was non-alcoholic.......I told him I tasted it and so did my parents and it indeed has alcohol in it.

They remember when it was a walk-up window take out place. Infact, when my father picked my mother and I up from the hospital after I was born, the FIRST stop they made on the way back to the rez was Poncho's! \n\nOne of the co-owners likes to laugh and say that she saw me before most of my family did! I went from being in a car seat gurgling as my relatives chomped on the best chips in town served with some awesome hot sauce that hasn't really changed since I was young. To being a little girl who always ordered the deep friend tortilla wrapped hot dogs with crinkle cut french fries and the BEST coldest ketchup I ever had!! To being a young woman who brought every single close friend I met while being away at school or through the native pageant circuit to enjoy the wonders that is \"The Works\". \n\nMy FAVORITE meal there is the cheese crisp as an appetizer, Combination #18 which is two tacos (i always order beef!), rice & beans. They have the best beans EVER!! And the rice is awesome too! I've had all the desserts on their menu and nothing really jumps out at me. I guess I still love the family tradition of going to the water & ice cream shop for thrifty ice cream before heading home! \n\nI have had many experiences at this resturant. I've held my high school graduation party there; this resturant was the place where I signed a contract that made me the goodwill ambassador of my people for nearly a year; it was from their bar that I had my first LEGAL margarita on my 21st birthday, it was also the place where my then boyfriend got on one knee and asked me to marry him, and it was their waitresses who said \"to HELL with him!!\" when we ended our engagement. \n\nIt's a wonderful place to me, I like that I can go in and say \"Hi Marty!\" to their one time waitress who now manages the resturant. and have her yell, \"HI CHERYL!!\" Yes... that's right!! That's how long she has known me!! She can call me Cheryl and get away with it!! I also love the other long time co-owners/managers. There is one that always wants to buy a certain piece of jewelry off of me. And another who always laughes when I bring someone new in. \n\nPoncho's is a place of regulars... LONG time regulars. and i think this is what every great restuant needs. Local, long time regulars who grow with the restuant. Who bring in new friends to enjoy the huge wonderful chimichangas or the Presidential Special and laugh over delicious enchiladas while a secret service agent (who kinda looks like leslie nealson if u ask me) painted on the wall watches on. While a bustling resturant does what it does best: offer homestyled, friendly, affordable and great food to it's old time regulars and it's about-to-become regulars.", "business_id": "14NSxaXBNspIVnsrMYJZVw", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-03-04", "type": "review"}

It felt as if we weren't in Phoenix anymore.  Well, except for the burning desert sun overhead.\n\nOn the farm road there were a handful of dining options.  Our selection was Morning Glory Cafe.\n\nThere were lots of cute outdoor tables, some with umbrellas, scattered in a little garden courtyard.  Servers were mulling about offering muffins and scones from large baskets as you looked over your menu.  Unlike bread at many restaurants these carbs ain't free.  we were told to help ourselves to drinks.  Nearby, there were spigotted vessels with coffee, water, lemonade, and a unsweetened flavoured iced tea.  Again, you will be charged for these later.\n\nPerusing the menu, we were torn because everything looked delicious. There were a handful of omelettes, eggs benedict, french toast, and even a french toast monte cristo.  You could also order beverages not on spigot, like fresh squeezed oj and mimosas (i think these were $7.50) from this menu.\n\nSticking with self-serve drinks, Jen ordered a South Mountain Omelette which came with rosemary roasted potatoes and an herb biscuit.  I ordered morning glory benedict minus the ham, which came with accoutrement of rosemary potatoes but no biscuit.  It seemed like our food came a few minutes after ordering it.  It was the fastest service I have ever experienced.\n\nJen's omelette had green peppers, red peppers, snap peas, tomatoes, swiss chard, and farmer's cheese ontop,  She said, \"This is the best omelette ever.\"  My eggs benedict (i'm a fan of benedicts) had perfectly poached eggs voluptuously mounting a tomato, on an english muffin bed, a dark green blanket of spinach draped over shoulders, and one of the best hollandaises ladeled ontop of it all.  It was delicious.  Also delicious was the rosemary roasted potatoes.  However, the biscuit was incredibly dry, so it was like mixing Quickrete(r) in yo mouf. (yes, i just said yo mouf)\n\nIt was very good food overall though with the eggs coming straight outta the hen house a few yards away and the veggies hailing from the equidistant farmer's market.  These fresh local ingredients make a big difference.\n\nMorning Glory Cafe would make a great place to take out of town guests, family, bedheaded lovers, or hungover friends.", "business_id": "MLcXtnpzygZvQ9BtseLLlw", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-05-04", "type": "review"}

If you want to grab a drink, we'll go here! We even spent one horribly drunken New Year's Eve partying it up with the Rock Bottom crew. This would normally be a 5-star review but I feel like their service has gone downhill a bit in the last 6 months and this could stand to be addressed.\n\nFirst of all, you cannot beat Happy Hour! As a beer snob, I often feel left out when the Happy Hour specials only include America's favorite urine-colored watered down drinks. Occasionally I can get a Sam Adam's or Blue Moon, but it's nothing to match. The specials here vary by the day but you'll be able to get a pint of beer or a mixed drink for around $3- sign up for their free Mug Club and you'll get 20oz mugs every time too! There's a patio with smoking on one side only- it's great to sit out there most of the year but does get packed close to the weekends. \n\nThe food specials at Happy Hour beat the oh-so-cheap yet mediocre Applebee's standard. Most appetizers are $3- a few items, such as sliders, show up just for happy hour and aren't even on the regular menu. There is a burger they offer for $5, and you can get a bucket of fries or kettle chips for $1.50. The sliders are my favorite (both chicken and beef), and i'd also recommend kettle chips, the spinach artichoke dip, or the nachos. \n\nThe beers could almost use their own review- there are 6 or 7 to try and account for what people like to drink. There is usually a special seasonal beer along with a cask-conditioned option. As I mentioned before, the best way to drink beer is with a Mug Club card. You'll get a 20oz mug for the 16oz price and accumulate points towards things such as logo pint glasses. If you like the urine-variety of mass-produced beers, try a Dreamcatcher. If you enjoy good flavor, try the El Jefe Hefeweizen, Desert Trail Pale Ale, or Raptor Red. At this location in particular I think the El Jefe is the best. \n\nThe food is delicious- i'm getting to the point where i've tried almost everything on the menu. The standouts are the Mac N' Chicken, the Lemon Chicken, the Smoked Salmon Fish and Chips, and the Prime Rib (they run specials on this at various times of the year). A lot of entrees come with the wonderful White Cheddar Mashed Potatoes, and the vegetables you are served are pretty flavorful. Definitely good enough to deserve coming here even if you don't drink beer.\n\nMy only complaints lately are that the service has gone downhill. We've been several times in the past few months- 3 times for happy hour and once for dinner. One time at happy hour was perfect, the second our food came out and had clearly been sitting around (coagulated cheese skin on top of the artichoke dip), and the third the food had only sat a tiny bit but it took us forever to get the attention of our waitress. The time we went for dinner the food was good, but it took a long time and didn't come out all at once. If the restaurant can resolve this, it'll earn its 5th star.", "business_id": "s_cKw6m0Fw9jZbobRH0YSg", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-04-21", "type": "review"}

I've lived in the Phoenix area for 21 years and eaten at many a Mexican restaurant.  Los Taquitos uses chopped chicken rather than shredded chicken in their taco & burrito (which is A+ in my book).  Many restaurants confuse heat with flavor, but not Los Taquitos!  The seasoning on their meat is so delicious, I can't describe it appropriately.  The tacos have your choice of meat cooked with the most excellent combination of herbs & spices; plus, fresh cilantro leaves, and diced red onion.  They are served in two small (street taco size) corn tortillas.  When I eat the average taco, I like cabbage or lettuce, cheese, sour cream & salsa.  But not at Los Taquitos!  Their tacos are so simple yet so flavorful.\n\nI've been thinking about how good it was for the last week, and wondering how it would do if I used their food for a party?  The only downfall is I live about 30 min away and I'm not sure how it would be if not eaten right away.\n\nI thought the guac had too many onions.  The chips were over cooked and bland (you couldn't taste the corn flavor which is so delicious in fresh tortilla chips).  I liked the chicken burrito, I probably wont have it again just because I don't really enjoy beans, I can take them or leave them.  I did like how the burrito did not have rice in it.\n\nPrice:\nVery affordable.  I did notice that online they have prices listed and the Phoenix location is more expensive and has a little different menu options.  \n\nAmbiance: \nI've never been to the location.  My office brought food in for us on two different occasions.\n\n(I must qualify my opinion of the tacos by saying that I do not care for shredded chicken.  Typically it has no flavor of it's own and has a slimy texture.   I prefer shredded chicken over shredded beef, so I usually end up with shredded chicken dishes at the average Mexican restaurant)", "business_id": "rDvz5jX65gpfONFu7er9Tw", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-03-09", "type": "review"}

I ordered freshwater eel nigiri - hard to mess up, spicy tuna roll - also hard to mess up, but it was also nothing special - and a softshell crab roll. I was definitely not a fan. The roll had too many other things in it that contradicted the crab - I ended up taking out the carrots and asparagus - too hard to put in a sushi roll! I was so put off by the roll that I didn't even finish it. It was a pretty expensive roll that should have just been kept simple like all other sushi places. \n\nFor dessert, we ordered the banana maki. Again, it was nothing too special.

In addition, we were not given any bread after the initial 3 loaves for 18 people nor water for about 20 minutes until we flagged someone down to get some.

My cousin got the same thing and ordered meatballs and meat sauce, and was brought out marinara with mushrooms.... hmmm. I ordered chicken, garlic, broccoli, spinach, and marinara. Well, it had no spinach and 2 cloves of garlic. The chicken was all fat, like it was what you cut away from a chicken breast before cooking it. It was some of the grossest chicken I have tasted. My brother ordered a dish that was supposed to have shrimp and some other meat in it...it came out in the smallest bowl I have ever seen and contained 1 shrimp. Really? Wow.

Why? Because once you step in, this does not seem to be a Mediterranean restaurant, neither a gyros place.\nThe options didn't seem appealing and we left.\n\nToday we were short on time, and we had to make a quick decision. Well, if someone handed this food to you and you didn't have any expectations, maybe it would be 5 stars. \nWe had the gyros wrap, and the steak chipotle or something like that. I chose small because we were in a hurry and some other reasons, but it seems that for a dollar more (6.79 I think) you can get a considerably bigger wrap. Maybe next time we can share one...\n\nHowever, I found kind of confusing what ingredients I could get, and I didn't get much into it.\n\nLike Todd described, they use the pita like a pocket and stuff it with whatever you ask for. Mine had lettuce, jalape\u00f1os, tomato and cucumber. Feta cheese, Greek dressing and tzatziki. Well, tzatziki looked more like plain yogurt... and the scary part was the frozen whatever meat. It seems all the meats are frozen, and if they cook them in the back room, oh well, maybe. But when they heat them in front of you... not so appealing.\nWhat I did like is that at the end, they shape it and wrap it as a burrito, and you can remove the top part of the wrap to eat and since you have the bottom part of the wrap still intact, it does not get messy.\n\nBy the way, the young man that took my order and prepared half of my food was very kind and friendly.

It's been about two years since my last visit and in the past couple of months I've already been here like three times and wanted to go back more. I've decided that it's all about what you order; for example the first time I went I probably felt overwhelmed with all the choices and decided to go for something really plain like turkey with hardly any toppings, have fun! Their menu has a wide variety of yummy sandwiches and lots of new tastes to try. Also, don't be afraid to speak up. I was a little disappointed by the lack of lettuce and veggies on one of my veggie sandwiches but I also didn't pay attention. Now I ask for lots of lettuce and they're happy to make it the way I like. They make their breads fresh and they have garlic-herb bread that has lots of flavor. I won't order a sandwich from there without a side of ranch dressing. I am a picky ranch eater...I hate mayonnaise so I am always super careful that ranch doesn't taste or resemble mayo. I usually like restaurant mayo that is a little more runny in consistency with lots of flavor. They have the best home made ranch dressing here! Pair it with the garlic-herb bread and your sandwich is going to be booming in flavor. OMG! Wipe...sorry I just started to drool a bit. Service is good...everyone runs at the same chill pace which seems to go well with the theme of this restaurant. My current favorite is the Humboldt sandwich...I get the Pinner (8\") but I swear some days I am so hungry I think I'm going to order the Blunt (12\")...maybe someday soon. All sandwiches get toasted. Okay so toppings: Guacamole, sprouts, lettuce/spring mix, onions, mushrooms, tomatoes, black olives (I get mine w/o), cucumbers, pickles, your choice of cheese (I get Swiss), with their house goodies (EVOO, vinegar, herb mixture on top). Now that I found my sandwich, I crave it all the time and can't wait for my next visit. Oh, be sure to check their daily specials too! If you're lucky enough to be in their delivery area...well, darn you then! :-)", "business_id": "KS2w8ychyieJbUqRa6kCHw", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-03-07", "type": "review"}

I had ordered a vegetarian soon tofu soup with everything in it (seaweed, mushrooms, and kimchee) and eveything else ordered was shared with my friend except the soup. Although my friend tasted the soup and thought it diddint taste fresh. Towards the end of dinner, around 9:15, I began to feel suddenly ill. I went to the bathroom and threw up violently and painfully. :( Went out, and went back to throw up. Struggled to walk out of there, I threw up multiple times on the way home. By midnight I was hyperventilating, in extreme pain everywhere, and could not walk. I called my friend who was just with me to take me to the emergency room. I considered calling an ambulence. :( I truly felt like I was going to die.\n\nMy friend found me on bathroom floor. Rushed me to hospital. In the hospital, I blacked out a few times, saw the light, as they rushed to attend to me. I couldn't talk, walk, or function. I had severe food poisoning.  I had chills, sweats, shakes, and feeling hot and cold. Absolute worst feeling in the world. They immediately gave me fluids, nausea meds, and morphine for pain. I was there untill 3:30. My feeling is that soup was bad. It diddnt taste right to begin with, nor did it look right. Also, considering it was a veggie broth, I wonder if because it may be something the Asians there NEVER order (perhaps), they probably had a batch that went wrong, or... maybe something else in the soup wasint right. Lastly, the soup is usually super boiling hot. I felt like it wasint, cause my egg diddint cook right away as usual. Maybe it was the egg from samonila poisening. I'm going to talk to the manager, I want a full refund.\n\nThis has been the most traumatic health issue I've ever felt, and certainly the worst case of food poisoning I have ever had. :(\n\nUpdate: Sean the owner helped to get me a full refund.

Where to begin. \n\nWe happened upon this place mostly by accident. It shares a parking lot with Texas Roadhouse which is a great steakhouse but because of that fact, at any given time it's extremely crowded. We had planned on hitting Texas Roadhouse for dinner before catching a movie at the nearby Mesa Grand AMC Theater. However, as is always the case it was packed, and we were told it was a 45 minute wait. Seeing Charleston's across the way, we said why not? \n\nUpon entering the place we were surprised to see how well done the interior was. Classy, with dark wood and stone accents and lit just well enough to maintain an intimate atmosphere. Each table is lit by candles and soft overhead lighting. Up until recently it had some real smooth Jazz playing in the background (which has regrettably been replaced with easy listening/pop fare in an effort to attract a younger crowd).\n\nAll of the wait staff male or female is dressed in black slacks and black shirts which may sound pretentious but only adds to the ambiance in practice. They are, in general, extraordinarily attentive and quick to serve. On most weekends, the management helps bring out food, refill drinks and make sure everything is satisfactory. Nice touch. \n\nNow on to the food... oh the food! I have yet to eat a meal that was less than excellent no matter what I order but my favorite is the Baby Back Ribs and Herb Chicken combo. It's a huge plate of food, and it comes complete with garlic mashed potatoes and I opt out on the bbq beans in exchange for the glazed carrots. You MUST eat the glazed carrots if nothing else... I do not like carrots at all mind you, but these I could eat all day until my skin turned orange.\n\nAside from the carrots, the herb chicken is actually a half a chicken seasoned perfectly and very succulent. I've scoured the internets trying to find the recipe for this bird and it's nowhere to be found. I'm considering a part time stint at this place just long enough to poach the recipe or at least watch the chef do it. Delicious. Sub out the potatoes for the fries (they're crispy, and salt & peppered) and you won't be disappointed either. \n\nIt's never as crowded as the neighboring Roadhouse, but to me that's a good reason to check it out. It's great.\n\nTip: Check out their menu on the web before you go.

Wow, I was definitely wrong.  I asked for the burger to be cooked med-rare, and although quite thin, it came out as ordered.  The meat was definitely not frozen, I could sure taste the freshness of the meat with the fist bite.\n\nCheese options are limited (american / swiss).

Well, have a look at the photos and see just how much I had!  Florencia's thin-crust pizzas normally contain cornmeal, but I was able to specially-request one without.  Fabulous!  The bruschetta was oh, so very good-- the tangy-sweet balsamic vinegar is key in making it so tasty.  :)  Liked the fact that it had a lot of garlic, too!  The only downside, so far, was that the desserts I inquired about were all pre-made [cannoli shells came dusted w/ powdered sugar from the supplier (Kim wasn't sure that the pastry cream had powdered sugar in it, but w/ the shells being pre-dusted, the point was already moot!), the caramelized walnuts, for the Apples and walnuts w/ ice cream dessert,   didn't come w/ nutritional info (were they made w/ granulated or powdered sugar?), and ice cream wasn't homemade...  I wonder if Florencia makes its own cookie batter for its chocolate chip cookies (freshly-baked and then topped w/ ice cream)?  Again, w/ the ice cream not being homemade, this scratched out another dessert option for me.  With desserts being a non-issue, I'm able to eat more crusty pizza to my heart's content!  A very glittery silver-lining, which you'll soon agree with!  :D\n\nVery patient and fast service- ask for Kim.  Nice, non-intrusive music playing in the background, but the restaurant got a lot noisier as the room slowly filled w/ dinner traffic, so come in early to avoid it.
