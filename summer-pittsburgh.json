I have worked as a vet tech in a previous job and have had experiences at numerous facilities here in Pittsburgh and Greentree Animal Clinic blows them all out of the water. Key things that you should note about this place:\n* They do not over charge\n* They only recommend services/things that they genuinely believe will help your pet, not their bottom line and they do not pressure you in any way\n* They are respectful and genuine to you and your pet which is hard to come by nowadays\n* Everyone from the front desk to the techs, to the vets are kind, patient and understanding. No condescension or poor attitudes, just positive vibes all around. \n* Dr Brown goes above and beyond any vet I've ever met. He has shown so much care, professionalism,  kindness and knowledge that I will gladly refer anyone with a pet to him because I know they will be in good hands and his fellow vets (Dr Reuther, Dr Kelley, and Dr Mann)  are just as phenomenal. \n\nThankyou Greentree Animal Clinic for setting the bar where it should be for all Veterinary Care Facilities.", "business_id": "QoDa50dc7g62xciFygXB9w", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-06-03", "type": "review"}

This was a nice surprise. Yes, it is not in the best looking area, and yes, the restaurant may not be as nice as a Benihana.  But the food was quite good.  \n\nWe had our doubts at first.  We went in the middle of a Sunday afterfoon and the place was empty.  And service seemed to be a little disorganized and distracted.  But once the chef came out and got to work, it was great.  The salad and soup were veyr good, the soup being a little more beefy in flavor than what we were used to.  We then had the fried rice and got a HUGE portion.  We needed a little more soy sauce that what the chef used, but he gladly provided more and the rice was delicious.  \n\nThen we moved to the main entrees.  Wife had the Chateaubriand and I had the Tenderloin and Scallops.  The meat, although cooked  just a tad past medium, still melted in your mouth,and the scallops were absolutely the best I've ever had!!  Again, huge portions of meat and vegetables, plus a large portion of noodles. Definitely a plateful.\n\nWe did not get the requisite show you get at this kind of restaurant, but we've seen it so many times, it's kinda boring to me.  Instead, we had a nice conservsation with the chef about the Pittsburgh area.  All in all, this was a very pleasant meal, and I'll definitely go back.", "business_id": "8Nm_jcCYtMXYW0ODSHDiXA", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-08-06", "type": "review"}

I've found other places that come close, but for me, this is the place I like to spend my money when it comes to hibachi cuisine. \n\nSapporo is an unassuming place right next to Steubenville Pike's hottest tourist attraction, the Pittsburgh Motel. But don't let the location fool you. Step inside and enjoy a cozy atmosphere. There's a bar at the front, some tables to the right, and the main dining area to the left. There's also that karaoke machine I've never seen used in all the years I've gone here.\n\nUnlike other Japanese restaurants like Saga (great stuff) and Ichiban, the cooks at Sapporo aren't all about giving an extensive show while cooking. Each of the chefs have a few of the basic crowd pleasers, such as the knife and spatula toss and the onion volcano, etc., but really it's all about the food, which is fine by me. I do sometimes miss when the chefs toss the pieces of shrimp up in the air towards your mouth to catch, but only because no one ever likes to participate in that but me and it's fun to look like a goofball while trying, but that's neither here nor there.\n\nThe food here is excellent. They've introduced a new look to their menu recently. I don't know if they scaled it down, as I often always order from the same section. I did notice they have a couple of sushi options available. They used to have a full sushi bar, and you can still see that when you walk in, but I'm not sure if they're using it for anything other than just what's on the main menu, which would be a shame if so, as their sushi was always great and you could order it from a separate menu. Again, this may be something they still have that I'm not aware of.\n\nAt any rate, the starter soup and salad is great. I love the bits of onion in the soup. It's a very strong broth, but not overpowering. The ginger dressing on the salad is something you either like or loathe at any Japanese restaurant, and here I really love it, but I tend to like it everywhere I've had it, so I'm not a real stickler when it comes to that.\n\nUsually I order the filet mignon and shrimp with fried rice for my main meal, though last time I got the deluxe version of the dish which also includes lobster tail and ice cream for dessert. Either way, it's a great dish. I've also had the chicken and shrimp and have enjoyed it as well.\n\nNow, my favorite thing here is the shrimp sauce. I call it the \"magic sauce.\" It's of the light pink variety and thin consistency. I'm always disappointed when I go to other Japanese steakhouses and they either don't have shrimp sauce altogether or they have the thicker, mayonnaise-based version, which is OK, but doesn't come close to the awesomeness that is the magic sauce. Apparently it's a secret as to just what goes into it. On one visit our chef joked that its main base was strawberry Quik, which one of the fellow diners at my table believed.\n\nSo if you get the fried rice here, dump some of the magic sauce on there. It's amazing. Use it for your steak or chicken as well. I find myself doing that and then saving the darker sauce for my grilled veggies, which are also top notch here. Terrific grilled onions and ripe zucchini as well as mushrooms and broccoli. I don't care for broccoli personally, but the rest is excellent.\n\nSapporo has also started throwing in noodles to the mix. According to the owner this is because other restaurants started doing it, so patrons who came in started asking why Sapporo didn't have them as well. I think they were doing fine without them, as it just adds even more to an already large amount of food, but they are good, if unnecessary.\n\nThe steak here is great. I've had the sirloin as well as the filet. I always get mine cooked rare, and it is of the melt in your mouth caliber. The shrimp never taste fishy, and the lobster tail is similarly excellent. All around, you get a great meal here for the price.\n\nI'm not sure which nights are more crowded than not anymore. Sapporo's a funny place in that some weeknights you'll drive by and it's packed and then other nights it will be quiet. I'd suppose weekends draw the biggest crowds. Yet even when it was \"packed\" I've never had to wait long to be seated at a table.\n\nSo if you haven't been, give Sapporo a try. It's been there forever. The owner and staff are super nice and they really do care about serving you great food when you visit. They don't do lunches anymore, so it's strictly dinner meals, so be looking at spending at least 20-30 dollars on up for adults, and around 10 or so for kids' meals. It's not some place you would go frequently if you're on a budget, but that makes it all the more a treat when you do go.", "business_id": "8Nm_jcCYtMXYW0ODSHDiXA", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-07-26", "type": "review"}

We decided to come here because it was Pittsburgh restaurant week and they offered a special 3 course $30 fixed price menu with 2 course wine pairing for $12.  It ended up being a small little restaurant in the middle of Point Breeze which I had been past many times previously but never really noticed.\n\nThe restaurant was swamped whenever we got there, probably due to a combination of it being Friday night and restaurant week, so thankfully we had made reservations and were seated almost immediately.  I decided to start off my meal with a salad while my girlfriend had the tomato garlic bisque.  My salad was good and came with goat cheese, pears and a vinaigrette which all tasted nicely.  It was nothing amazing but I think it takes a really special salad to be amazing.  I also tried my girlfriends bisque and unsurprisingly found it to be a bit tomato-y since I do not enjoy tomatoes very much but she really enjoyed it.  For my entree I decided to get two small plates instead of a larger entree and settled on the mac n cheese and fish tacos.  The tacos were a bit sloppy/wet but had some nice flavors (cilantro, aoili and pico) in them along with some chili sauce that gave it a nice little kick.  My mac n cheese came out in its own little cast iron type pot and was good.  There was an adequate amount of cheese throughout and I liked that they even had some ricotta buried inside the dish.  I was also able to try the Arrabbita that one of our dining companions had ordered.  Wow was it good and it packed quite the spicy punch too.  Immediately I regretted not ordering it although I still did enjoy my two small plates.  For my dessert course I ended up having the White Chocolate Creme Brulee.  My girlfriend decided upon the tiramisu while another at our table had the peaches and puff pastry.  All of the desserts seemed large and made sure that we did not go home hungry!  My creme brulee tasted decently and ended up being a good finish to my meal.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here in the future.

Granted, it has the basics you need, and is 1 of the biggest in the city itself.  Finding things takes work.  My big gripe is that it has one of the weirdest and most illogical layouts that I've seen.  It actually takes time to find what you need as compared to most stores where once you are in there a few times, you easily find everything.  Parts of this store are diagonal and that causes you to go in every direction possible.  Here is a quick summary of the setup as it can be classified as a maze:\n\n1.) When you enter the store through the slow wide door, you go to the left and walk past the front registers to produce.  Normal enough.\n\n2.) From produce in front of you (a quasi L-shaped department), you take a quick left and go diagonally to the right to walk past the pharmacy.  Take a hard right down aisle 1 and then you hit the bakery.   \n\n3.)  From the bakery, you walk along a long meat wall.  Diagonally to the left, you'll find the service meat/seafood counters. And because how the wall goes diagonal to the left, the sign for Aisle 9 is facing diagonally to the right so you don't miss it because the 1 side is longer towards the back than the other. (Aisles 9-14 are almost twice as long as 1-8).\n\n4.) From meat, you have frozen straight back on a long back wall in its own cove.  A hard right (if you bypass frozen) brings you last to hot foods, the deli, and then facing in front of you, the Customer Service desk which is tucked away in a corner (not really visible when you walk in the store).\n\n5.) Once you pass the deli and customer service, take a hard right, then to the left (almost a U-turn) to the checkouts, and then you take a hard left to leave.\n\nMost of the other Giant Eagle stores are much more logical in how their aisles and deparment locations are set up.   You're not going every which way to try and find things.\n\nAlso, the service isn't that great as one of the other reviews said.  Given that, I would take Market District on Centre Ave or GE on Murray Ave over this store.\n\nHowever, for those who remember the Giant Eagle on Centre Ave at N. Craig St, nothing beats how BAD that store was.  There is a reason that store was nicknamed \"the dirty bird.\"  Compared to that North Oakland store that closed several years ago, Shakespeare St GE is light years ahead.", "business_id": "BG4N0V93wml9kaU6YYRxRA", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-06-09", "type": "review"}

I got a haircut here once and hated it, but kept waiting for it to settle in after a few washes. It never did look right, so I just fixed it at home rather than going back to these incompetent people. I didn't even feel like the hassle of complaining was worth it, as I highly doubted that I'd get any money refunded and I certainly didn't want them to touch my hair again to try to fix it. \n\nI then figured, hey, this place sucks for haircuts but they can't mess up eyebrow waxing, right? Right! But their service is so bad that I gave up on that too -- I got my eyebrows done here a few times with not much trouble, but the last time I went in, I had called ahead to put my name in and was told that I would be next on the list, and to show up in about 20 min. My house is a 20 min walk from there, perfect! I headed out, got there in 20 min, and gave the woman at the desk my name and reminded her I'd called ahead. There was one man sitting there waiting, who I had seen from across the street walking in about 1 min ahead of me. \n\nThe \"stylist\" was just finishing up a haircut, so I should have been next, right, since I had put my name in before the guy who walked in? Nope! She called him over and I said \"sorry, I think I was next, I called ahead and was told I'd be next in line\" and the lady said \"oh we don't do that.\" WTF?? You told me very clearly that you do exactly that, what craziness is this? So I waited, figuring that I'd already invested 20 min into this venture, so I may as well stick it out. \n\nAnd waited, and waited, while one \"stylist\" cut the man's hair and 2 of them chatted in the back (ironically next to the chair where they do facial waxing). They must have been \"on break,\" or maybe just terribly rude and idiotic, because I sat there waiting for another full 20 min, and when I finally spoke up again to ask when someone would be available to do my eyebrows. The 2 chatty cathies in the back looked over, very annoyed at my presence, and the woman doing the haircut said \"after I'm done here,\" and I sat there incredulous for another 2 minutes before getting up and leaving.

Unfortunately a great deal of what is on their regular menu and with the delivery services is comprised of the American version  of Chinese food.The first time I came to this place they only gave me the American iced menu.But having lived in the Bay Area for many years I scoped out the Hong Kong style menu and vowed to order from it the next time I went to Tasty and I did.Now I just  pick up the Hong Kong menu automatically when I come in.Their Hong Kong dishes are some of the best I've had in Pittsburgh.The garlic eggplant in a velvety sauce combines the right hint of spiciness with sweet and virtually melts in your mouth.The salted squid (what's usually known as salt and pepper squid) has a light, crispy coating with a minimum of oil and the texture of the squid is\njust a tiny bit chewy but not too much so.Texture in squid is a daunting thing to get just right.I am a Chow Fun freak anyway  but their shrimp chow fun with egg sauce is the best I've ever tasted with slightly charred noodles fresh dhrimp and a wonderful egg scramble sauce . Recently I had a friend visiting from San Francisco and took him here (kind of a test to see if my view of this place was somehow off) and he raved about everything especially this chow fun dish.To sum up,if you want to experience the best of Tasty please order from the Hong Kong menu.Since. I don't order American Chinese dishes here I can't comment on them but I guess the genius of this place is authentic South Chinese dishes (as evidenced by the Chinese families I've seen eating here) not the usual  pseudo Chinese dishes many people seem to order here.I expect the chef/cook here just doesn't have his heart in Crab Rangoon or chow mein.", "business_id": "Y2p07YEC8xOsYTHWf0UxiA", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-07-31", "type": "review"}

BUT, I'm very disappointed by their dog trainer/behaviorialist, Lacey. \n\nI have a large papillon (a \"throwback\", as my vet called him), whose previous owners neglected and undersocialized him for the first two years of his life. As a result, he is now extremely fearful when taken outside the home, and he becomes overstimulated and aggressive. I brought him to one of ARL's Saturday small dog classes, but he freaked out, and we were asked to leave. Lacey said she'd be in contact to set up a private class. \n\nShe called a few days later, and we arranged a private class for 6pm on a Wednesday. I made arrangements to leave work early to drive back into the city and get my pup some help! It's hard to anticipate exactly how much traffic there will be on Fifth Ave during rush hour, so I wound up playing it overly safe and arriving 10 minutes early for our class. \n\nAfter a few minutes, Lacey noticed us and came outside to tell me that she was running fifteen minutes behind. I wasn't sure what to do, because I couldn't really go anywhere with my cray-cray dog, and there was too much traffic to go home and come back again. So, she said we could wait inside in a small hallway. \n\nWe went in to wait, and naturally, with all the smells and sounds, my pup got a bit riled up. But, we waited...and waited and waited. At 6:25pm, I knocked on the door to the training room. Silence. So, I opened it. Nobody was there, and the door to the outside was open. I peeked out, and there she was, with the people and dog that had the lesson before me. I waited for a moment, hoping she'd notice me and look at her watch or something, but nope.\n\nSo, I took my dog and walked outside to my car. She turned and looked at me, but didn't acknowledge me in any way. I went and sat in my car with my dog for a few minutes, hoping the other folks, their dog, and Lacey would wrap things up, but no. They just continued on. At 6:35pm, I knew I couldn't wait any longer, because I had work I still needed to finish up that had to be done by 9pm. I got out of my car, and began walking towards Lacey. She just stared at me, rather than saying \"We're just finishing up,\" or \"Sorry, I lost track of time,\" or anything at all. So I said, \"We're going to have to reschedule. It's past 6:30 now, and I can't stay past 7.\" She simply replied, \"Okay. I'll call you.\" \n\nI thought it was rude and unprofessional to not offer any type of apology, or even a half-hearted explanation, but whatever.

Many of us get here more than an hour before the clinic starts and wait in line. For those of us who have not as well behaved animals, we tag team it and have one person stand in line while the other stays somewhere off to the side with the animal.\n\nHowever, on the July Clinic, one lady claimed to be first because she told a volunteer that she needed to stay in the car with her mom instead of waiting in line. Then when the paperwork was being passed out and those of us in line expressed the fact that she did not stand in line, some of us even having a picture of those of us in line, she repeated the fact that she has an elderly mom. When that didn't suffice, she said she had an agressive dog. While I understand that agressive dogs should not be in close proximity to other animals or humans which they could harm, that doesnt stop others who have less friendly animals to still stand in line and control our pets or have another member of the family stand in line on our behalf. For the ARL to let both individuals and their \"agressive\" dog sit in the car and be taken first is unfair to the rest of the participants. What is even more concerning is that this \"agressive\" dog was allowed to sit in the waiting room for 21 minutes with 10 other owners and their pets, some of us which had more than one pet. If this truely was a case of an agressive animal, then the ARL did a disservice to its first 10 Vaccine Clinic participants who were in the waiting room. In addition, the release form states that agressive animals will not be tollerated. \n\nIt would be one thing if this was a one off, but then someone came in claiming to have an apt for a vaccine booster at 930 even though they don't schedule appointments on Sundays except for SPAY day, and they took him!\n\nIf any one knows what I need to do or say to get preferential treatment in the future, please let me know! I get that this is a low cost clinic where the services are provided at cost and I greatly appreciate  that because it helps me care for my animals and the rescues we have at a reasonable cost. However, I shouldn't be punished or forced to wait because others cannot follow directions. It would have been a different story if the preferential treatment was because of medical emergency, but they won't.\n\nARL, please keep up the great services you provide, but also please be mindful of ALL of your patients.\n\nThanks,\nA loving pet owner.", "business_id": "VkFDer80GOrelWALdgNReg", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-07-05", "type": "review"}

Let me repeat, never again. \n\nThe primary reason I used to visit this store was to fill medical prescriptions. Due to their repeated inability and ineptness in fulfilling simple requests, I cannot continue to patronize this store.\n\nWalking into the store, you are given the stink-eye by a minimum wage security guard, which automatically gives you as a customer the warm and fuzzy \"guilty-until-proven guilty\" feeling a shoplifter would get, which is what this store assumes everyone is based upon their decision to lock up the mouthwash and shampoo.\n\nThe pharmacy seems to be staffed by high school interns.  They have no concept of customer service, nor do they display any attention to detail, which is quite frankly frightening in a pharmacy.  I really think my chihuahua would make a better pharmacist than the people who work here - my chihuahua lick you to death before you got your prescriptions, but at least you'd get greeted when you approach the counter, and you'd get what you ask for.\n\nThe first mishap was when my wife and I changed prescription insurance providers.  i handed wanna-be pharmacist #1 my new insurance card.  After spending about 5 minutes staring into a computer screen behind the counter, he assured me that they had my insurance information in the computer.  I then returned in the following days to fill a prescription, trusting in what wanna-be pharmacist #1 had told me in the days prior.  When I went to check out the bill came to over $300, which I chalked up \"maybe I have to meet a deductible before the coverage kicks in.\"  Upon further research, we discovered that wanna-be pharmacist #1 had NOT updated my insurance information and had run the numerous prescriptions I filled under my old insurance.\n\nThe latest of many \"adventures\" involved my wife calling in a prescription refill.  We stopped to pick it up on the way home from work, only to be told when we arrived that the insurance won't cover the refill until tomorrow.  Again, she CALLED and SPOKE to one of them to refill the prescription before showing up.  I guess it's too much to ask to TELL someone you're speaking to on the phone that they need to wait a day for the insurance to work before coming into a ghetto pharmacy to not pick up a prescription.  But hey, at least wanna-be pharmacist #2 behind the counter was dressed like a stripper, which gave me and my wife some comic relief for the moment.  \n\nWe then returned the following day to (again) pick up the prescription we called to have refilled 2 days prior.  We were first told by wanna-be pharmacist #3 that there weren't any prescriptions waiting for us.  After searching around for a few minutes, they \"found\" my wife's prescription refill, but it would take 10 minutes to be ready.  Yes, the prescription that we tried to pick up yesterday would need another 10 minutes to be prepared.

Since my check engine light was on, I stopped at a local garage to get it checked out. They looked at my engine for me and told me that Goodyear must have spilled a TON of motor oil on my engine which caused it to smoke like crazy. The mechanic also pulled up the check engine light code (Goodyear did not tell me when I asked them about the code when I picked up my car), which said that my oxygen sensor was malfunctioning. The oxygen sensor in my car is connected right to the exhaust manifold and it was clear from visual inspection that oil has gotten all over it.\n\nI went back to Goodyear the next day, they took my car in and I waited for over an hour in their lounge.

There were only two other tables with guests, one of which had empty plates on the table during this entire experience. After what seemed like forever, my husband got up to find a server. He literally walked around the restaurant to find someone, but couldn't. He then tried to ask the bartender, but she was just as elusive. When he finally found a server,  she acted totally shocked that we were there. Maybe if someone had been doing their job, they wouldn't be surprised to find hungry people in a restaurant.\n\nShe came to our table, got our drinks (a soda and a water) and asked us if we were ready to order. When we said no she said she would be back. We could see her chit chatting with another server, but again, couldn't get her attention to come back to take our order. After another ten minutes of waiting for her to return, we put a few dollars on the table for my soda and we left. We ordered a pizza at a local shop and picked it up on our way home.\n\nTwenty-five minutes passed and we only get drinks? Such a waste of time. It took us 20 minutes just to make the drive there, 25 of waiting, and another 20 to get home. That's over an hour of our evening completely wasted which left us starving after a hard days work.

They also entertain all requests with patience, which my roommate and I appreciated. \n\nIf you're picky and used to \"luxury\" apartment living, this isn't the place for you because the majority of their units are very old. However, it worked great for our short-term plans and was spacious and CHEAP! 625/mo split between the two of us. It was also in a safe neighborhood.

Based on # of staff members x 20-30 mins/customer/staff member you can get an idea of what your wait time will be. I did not see a staff member process more than 3-4 applications per hour.\n\nI went in for a new title & registration and the process took about 25 mins as I was fully prepared with all the right paperwork.

She suggested the vegan BLT. I was hesitant, as I wanted something hearty and filling, and let me tell you this!... The sandwich totally did her smile and sales pitch justice. It pleased me like no other sandwich has ever done. I want to compliment every sandwich maker in that department, specifically Bethany, Eric, and Rick. They know when I walk in their direction from the Fresh Pack section that I'm looking for my second option of the BLT because the burrito isn't available. No matter how bananas and certifiably insane I might seem during my food shopping excursions, they always treat me with such dignity and respect.\n\nMonths have passed since my first BLT experience, and I was completely taken for another ride through satisfaction land during this past week when they offered to notify me \"the night before when the vegan tofu burritos are being made\" because they know how much I have my heart set on that beautiful meal on most days of the week. I can't say enough for Bethany and her team of prepared foods colleagues. \n\nAnd everyone else at the store is so helpful and nice, too! So kind! So informative!

I've visited Whole Foods locations around the country, but this Pittsburgh location is one of my favorites. It's a small store, but it feels homey and comfortable.\n\nStaff: Most of the staff members are super friendly and willing to do just about anything to help you find what you are looking for. I had one staff member begrudgingly help me out, but I assumed he was having a bad day or was very busy. Either way, it's nice to treat others with respect. \n\nThe cashiers here are so fantastic. They are never rushing and throwing food into bags. They take their time, ask you questions and treat you like a person instead of another number in a long line. \n\nDeli/Made-To-Order: The deli and made-to-order foods are currently my favorite. Sometimes I would rather spend $20 on lunch here with my boyfriend than go to a restaurant or get fast food. My favorite is the vegan chicken salad on foccacia bread. I adore this bread. It's just the right texture, it's nice and herby and deliciously buttery. Topped with swiss or muenster, it's a super delish sandwich. If I am extra peckish, I get extra veg. chicken salad. Yum yum yum! \n\nThe tomato bisque they have is something I newly tried. I'm very picky about my tomatoes and tomato products. This soup delivers. I wish I could have it every single day. It's so phenomenal! My boyfriend got it today alongside a cheddar biscuit that paired beautifully with the soup. \n\nCheeses: If you want fancy gourmet cheeses, the Whole Foods deli counter might be the best choice. We purchased a small amount of Midnight Moon Goat Cheese Gouda and made the most expensively delicious grilled cheese sandwich. We're grown-ups now, say goodbye to gross American cheeses! The cheese counter is so great because all of the cheeses are labeled with the kind of rennet used in the processing. You can easily find a high-quality vegetarian cheese with just a glance. The cheese experts are also willing to talk cheese to you for as long as you like. \n\nStore Selection: Overall the store has great options, but they don't carry everything that I wish they did. Unfortunately, they discontinued one of my favorite products - Field Roast Deli Slices. They bring in new and trendy foodstuffs though, so it's enough to keep me happy. \n\nWhole Foods can be pretty expensive, but if you don't fall for the tempting packaged foods, you can get away with a reasonable grocery bill! I primarily shop here for special items though. \n\nP.S. Their selection of natural body and haircare is great and affordable.

When I lived with my parents in forest hills it was worth the 15 to 20 minute drive to shop here. Lots and lots of organic produce. Everything you would need to stock your fridge and pantry plus lots of more exotic options too. Much of the produce comes in conventionally farmed and organic options so pay attention to the labels and signs if you're aiming for all organic. It is more expensive to shop here than most grocery stores but you really do get what you pay for. \nThe bulk section has lots of nuts, seeds, beans and grains.\nThe meat counter looks pretty great with some grass fed and organic options (a bit out of my price range for every day eating but its good to know its there for a special occasion). Their seafood counter is passable (that being said, I worked at Wholey's fish market for a while so I have really high standards when it comes to seafood. Not that Wholeys fish always meets my standards, but I'm used to huge variety and at least a few incredibly fresh options). Much of the seafood is previously frozen because it's out of season or exorbitantly expensive when fresh. I honestly can't believe people who shop at whole foods have any interest in irresponsibly farmed fish like tilapia and Chilean Atlantic salmon but they carry it nonetheless. \nStaff are friendly but can't always answer what you might think is a simple question. As in the bulk foods guy probably knows everything about the bulk foods but literally has no clue where you can find horseradish.\nSalad bar and hot foods are good and seam fresh. The sushi is passable if you're really in the mood for quick sushi. There's not a very big baked good section and I've never tried what they do have but my dad likes their cookies. \nI usually bike there now, but when I used to drive the parking lot was sort of a mess. Just be prepared to walk from the far end (I'm sure you'll all survive). \nLines at the registers can be long but seem to move fast. People complain so much about how crazy busy this place is, but they have obviously just never been to the whole foods in Columbus circle NYC.", "business_id": "wfCLz9-aeShbPB7CaTY-qQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-07-04", "type": "review"}

The salads are good and although I haven't gotten the soup anytime lately, I hear great things from my friends.

Damn you Big Burrito Group with your local ingredients, contemporary design and excellent service.  I was here last night and on a Monday this place was doing brisk business (definitely a good sign).  The space itself is beautiful.  You  enter from S. Highland into the outdoor dining area, which because of the heaters is viable almost every day of the year.  There is plenty of seating outdoors and a few tables indoors.  The design is contemporary.  The bar is large and has a nice area opposite for more informal seating.  The one thing I dislike about the bar area is that the \"stools\" are actually chairs that are not moveable, so your distance next to your \"neighbor\" is pre-determined.  I also prefer to stand at  the bar instead of sitting and this set up makes that more difficult.  The wine selection is pretty extensive and they have a good happy hour special that any wine or premium cocktail is just $5, which is really good when many of their wines are priced at over $10 per glass.  The hostess was very nice and professional even though she was young taking our names as we went to the bar for a drink and then anticipating our return with two menus in hand.  The server was a nice enough guy and helpful when it came time for our dinner selection.  We ordered a bottle of conundrum which is a delicious choice and I guess in line with what others charge.  We were started with an olive tepenade (sp?) and some crusty toasted thinly sliced ciabatta I think.  The tepenade was too oily and salty for me, but I guess it's what I should expect since it's ground up olives basically.  The bread was great.  It was warm really hearty bread that was wheat I think, definitely not white.  It was served with room temperature butter with some sea salt on top.  Really good start.  We then tried the smoked salmon appetizer.  I'm a huge fan of smoked salmon and was pleased with the quality of the fish, served nicely with capers and chopped egg.  It also was served with a patatoe pancake that was crisp on the outside with warm and delicious  filling.  The only thing I was a bit perplexed about was why it wasn't served with some type of bread or crouton to put the salmon on.  However, the waiter was happy to oblige by bringing out a few of the toasted ciabatta.  We also tried the lamb mac and cheese (omg was this good).  The pasta was cooked al dente' and definitely made in house.  The sauce and lamb were amazing.  This would make a fine entree' in my opinion and is total comfort food reinvented.  The only detraction I'd say is that it is a very heavy dish to serve as an appetizer on a summer menu.  Fiona had the arugula salad which was nicely prepared with pork belly (kind of like bacon), feta, and a few other interesting ingredients.  We also tried the short rib ravioli, which was incredible as well albeit a heavy dish.  By the time we got to this I think we only tried one ravioli each (plenty of leftovers).  This is such a rich dish, because shortribs are like the epitome' of richness and then to wrap them in ravioli and add cream sauce is really indulgent.  But, then again this is my chef not my cardiologist.  I tried the Elysian Fields Lamb which was cooked perfectly medium and then served with their homemade pasta wrapped around some of the lamb as well.  This was really good and the pasta was a surprise.  I actually would have preferred a green vegatable on the side instead of pasta and mashed potatoes.  The bartenders are good, especially FionaOverall, a really good place and a nice flagship of the big burrito group.", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-06-24", "type": "review"}

Citing a mix of Mediterranean and Northern African influences with a bargain Piccola Gusto Menu for lunch and the option for indoor or al fresco dining it seemed as if Casbah was a can't miss option...well, sometimes things don't turn out quite as you expect - almost everything that transpired from the moment we arrived until the moment we left was a failure.\n\nWhen our server, a young woman named Amanda L who would prove quite inept and inefficient from start to finish, finally did arrive our menus were delivered with a brief hello before she wandered away - another server later stopped by to fill our water and drinks were never even offered.  When Amanda finally did return she was capable of answering a couple questions about portion size and our orders were placed.  With my mom and sister opting for the two-course Gusto lunch and myself choosing two courses a la carte we sat and sipped our water.\n\nWaiting approximately 10 minutes another ancillary server arrived with bread and butter - a light and airy white bread with a hefty crust paired with a sweet and salted cow's milk butter - decent, but nothing to write home about compared to the myriad bread options at Eleven.  After this point we would not see another staff member for 30 minutes...well, we would see them, they just wouldn't be walking anywhere near our table - instead bussing tables and running around while the hostess flirted with a man at the bar...I'll note that my water glass remained empty for greater than 15 minutes.\n\nFinished with our first courses approximately 10 minutes would pass - long enough for me to actively collect each and every plate and stack them at the empty seat of our four-top - before Amanda would finally return to collect the dirty plates...we'd not see her again until 15 minutes later when she filled our water glasses and told us our main courses would be \"right out.\"  While I guess she didn't define \"right out,\" what this actually meant was \"in 25 minutes.\"  Starting first with my mother's combo - Jumbo Lump Crab, pepper bacon, avocado, radish sprouts, on a paesano bun and Orecchiette Pasta with grilled chicken, dried cranberries, Riverview Farms goat cheese, sage cream. While the sandwich may not be memorable, the pasta was actually quite impressive.  Using a less salty cheese and mild cream to flavor the al dente little ears of pasta worked wonders while the sweet/savory m\u00e9lange of craisins and grilled chicken were a nice match.\n\nVastly less well done than my mother's plate would be my sister's option - the Grilled Vegetables, portobello, zucchini, eggplant, arugula, chickpea hummus, on baguette and Maccheretto pasta with wild mushrooms, white beans, sun-dried tomatoes, rapini pesto, fontina, walnuts.  Beginning with the sandwich, the bite I had was good in taste but rather mushy in consistency - too many similar vegetable textures and the hummus spread too thickly.  Moving on to the pasta - we all tasted it, but I'm still not sure what we were supposed to be tasting - it tasted like watery cheese...no spice, no salt, and certainly nothing resembling pesto or tomatoes.  For the first time in the meal Amanda actually opted to check on us approximately 10 minutes into our main courses and when told of the watery pasta she did apologize and offered to replace it with something else - more Orcchiette.\n\nFor my main course I received a simple side salad-fresh greens, crispy onion strings, and a pleasant vinaigrette.  The salad, of course, was served alongside Elysian Fields Lamb \"Mac and Cheese\", tubetti pasta, mascarpone, cheddar, Pecorino-Romano, and bread crumbs.  Piping hot and browned with crispy bread crumbs the dish was a decent Macaroni and Cheese, but honestly the lamb was so scarce and thinly cut that it added little.\n\nCompleting our mains approximately 110 minutes after entering Casbah we again waited nearly ten minutes before anyone would stop by to collect dirty plates-a different ancillary server this time.  With my mother and sister already deciding enough was enough they stood up to use the restroom before leaving-by the time Amanda would stop by to ask if anyone would care for dessert our two course meal had lasted 2:05 and I skipped on a menu entailing bread pudding, carrot cake, and panna cotta with \"just the bill.\"\n\nSettling the bill via credit card no tip was left because no tip was deserved - in reality Amanda may have actually be the worst server I've encountered at a fine dining establishment in the last 2 years.  I will note that when I wrote to Big Burrito was met by a (seemingly) sincere apology without excuses - the Manager stated things don't' normally happen like that and he'd be sure the issue was addressed.

Everything was delicious, especially the complimentary bread and they olive oil-based stuff you can put on it.

After all, they spend months growing the stuff chefs spend maybe seconds using).\n\nThe atmosphere is really cool, I recommend sitting out on the patio in summer.

We each then had the heirloom tomato salad which was tasteless.  I grow heirlooms and know the intense and wonderful flavor they should have. These tasted like a grocery store tomato bought in December.  Very disappointing.  I opted for the cavatelli entree which was not prepared as described on the menu.  It was swimming in tomato sauce and overall was very bland.  Another disappointment.  My husband had the pork chop which wasn't bad but certainly didn't leave us wanting to return here for the food.  All this said, the service was professional, we enjoyed the drinks (he had the sangria and I their house cosmopolitan) and had a lovely bottle of wine.

She said it was her favorite restaurant, but that she didn't go as often as she'd like.\n\nI knew the building from the early 80's when it had been one of Pittsburgh's dive gay bars called 'The Tender Trap', and knowing this, as well as a lot about the Big Bistroid Group...oops...Big BURRITO Group, I was curious to try it out and see if it lived up to the usual Big Burrito hype.  And voila, indeed, it's another excruciatingly overpriced bistroid in da burgh.\n\nThe atmosphere is actually quite lovely, inside or out. The colors are comfortable, the noise levels subtle, the seating comfortable, and the service staff looks professional (YOUNG) with no Coney Island side show appearances.\n\nThe service was good. Not overly friendly, but not uppity like young people waiting tables in more upscale restaurants tend to be in da bugh.\n\nThe menu was short, but did have a list of pretty unique offerings.  My friend had a salmon salad, and I opted to try the Farm Lamb Mac-n-Cheese.  The waiter brought a small basket with bread to the table accompanied by a single medium sized pat of salted butter to spread.  For a beverage, we both opted for just water.\n\nI have to say, if I actually had to pay for this, I would have been pretty miffed.  \n\nFor LUNCH, the prices were all around the $15 range, and the portions were NOT large.  The portions were actually fine for lunch, not overly filling (by any stretch of the imagination), but they didn't leave you hungry.\n\nI can't speak for the salmon, as I have NEVER had salmon in any form other than lox that didn't taste like a dried sawdust version of some strong fish. She seemed to enjoy it very much, so there it is.\n\nThe Farm Lamb mac n cheese was tasty. The lamb was tender and moist, and the mac n cheese was a tiny tube pasta with a very nice creamy cheesy sauce, all topped with a bread crumb covering when it was broiled until crispy.  It was accompanied by a 'pinch' of mesclun salad topped with another pinch of fried onions.\n\nBasically - take one large spoonful of mac n cheese with a higher end cheese sauce and a fancier noodle than comes in the average box - mix in about four cubes of roast lamb, sprinkle on a layer of bread crumbs and toss it in the broiler until the crumbs are toasted - then using your index finger and thumb, pick up a pinch of mesclun and sit it on the plate next to the mac n cheese bowl - and you have a bistroid expensive art project on a plate.\n\nSeriously? $15 for lunch? It's mac n cheese people!\n\nI also have to call into question the name and theme.  Mad Mex is bistroid Tex Mex.  Soba is bistroid Asian.  Kaya is bistroid Caribbean-ish.  Casbah? Farm Lamb mac n cheese? Sure, I can see this as a box lunch while riding a camel through the desert...not.\n\nI can't say the experience was awful. The company was awesome, and we had a nice unpressured amount of time for fun chat.  The atmosphere was comfortable, and the food was tasty.  But was it all worthy of a return trip or recommendation?  I honestly can't say 'yes' with any kind of cheerleader rave.  \n\nI'm not quite sure that I comprehend the mindset of people in this burgh who think paying that kind of money for food is worth it, when honestly, food with just as much flavor can be found in abundance around town for half the price and twice the portion. \n\nWho are all of these easily dupe-able rich people, and where do they come from?

It had been a couple of years since I had last been to Casbah and while I remembered it being decent, it differed a bit from my fiance's opinion that this was the best of the Big Burrito restaurants.  Due to that it had been on my list of restaurants to visit so that I could get a better opinion of it.  The restaurant looked the same that I remembered it with a large outdoor seating area and a smaller one inside with the bar on one side of the restaurant and the dining room on the other.  It was all nicely and tastefully decorated.\n\nI arrived shortly after 5 PM and immediately made my way into the bar area of the restaurant as I hate taking up a table if I am eating by myself.  There was no one else at the bar at this point and the bartender quickly greeted me and gave me a happy hour menu while explaining it to me.  I had not been planning on getting a drink but one of the $6 cocktails caught my eye and I ended up ordering it.  The bartender was pretty friendly guy and explained how he came up with the drink while he made the drink and we chatted for a bit.  For my entr\u00e9e I decided to order the Long Island Duck which was a roasted breast, braised leg, gnocchi, spinach, rosemary, black mission figs and duck jus.  Whenever I had ordered it I had actually missed the fact that it came with a braised leg and was excited to see that extra unexpected portion of meat on my plate whenever it was delivered to me.  The whole meal ended up being incredibly tasty with the duck breast being cooked perfectly with nice seasoning and not greasy at all.  This was in stark contrast to the leg which was incredibly juicy and greasy which I absolutely loved.  Normally I am not a fan of greasier duck but the two preparations really helped to enhance the other.  Finally the figs provided a nice touch of sweetness while the gnocchi was pillow like and tasty.  It was also nice to be able to taste a hint of rosemary on them which I had forgotten about between the time I had ordered and when it was delivered.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here again in the future.

Casbah is located on a wonderful, neighborhood street in the Shadyside area of Pittsburgh. We got there a little early and waited a little in the lot. Our reservation was for 11 and they open at 11. We were still told the valet had to move our car. I get they have a way they do things and it must work for them but the lot has about 40 spaces that you can see from the street so I don't know why valet is necessary. We are particular about our vehicles and we don't valet anywhere. Not that the valets weren't nice and it's not like we could not see them move the car but anyway...the main reason they get a 4 and not a 5 star. Onto the meal...\n\nWe waited just a few minutes in line to be seated. As I said our reservation was at 11 & that is when they open. We were seated promptly requesting the inside area of their dining room. They do have a very nice, shaded patio area as well complete with ceiling fans. We requested to sit inside and the hostess happily obliged. We were greeted quickly by a happy and knowledgeable waitress who was on it. She was not at all intrusive but our water was never empty and we didn't have to wait long for our check when we were done. She asked if we wanted any other beverage. I got an iced tea and the hubby requested iced coffee. The waitress noted they could make one for him by adding ice to coffee and he said yes. He was very happy they would accommodate his request. \n\nWe ordered our food and were promptly brought a basket of bread (oh the wonderful bread basket!). We got 3 types of amazing breadly goodness that included cranberry scones (wow), biscuits (warm, soft, & the Hubby's favorite), and (my favorite) the lime, coconut muffin (sweet, lime, coconut, what's not to love). Oh, and let us not forget the maple butter, yum! I ordered the smoked salmon app. The combo of salmon, capers, aioli, and truffled potato cake - absolute perfection! There was a salty, smokey, sweet flavor that was sheer joy on my taste buds. The hubby chose the creamy polenta which he thoroughly enjoyed noting it was very oatmeal like. For my entree it was the sea scallop fry minus the caramelized onions. I would SOOOO get this again! The scallops were cooked to perfection with a wonderful golden outside that makes my heart sing with joy (can you tell I love a good sea scallop?). The combo of English peas, fennel sausage, and white corn grits...it was something special for sure! I could eat that sausage by the boat load every single day! And the grits - smooth, creamy, and perfectly seasoned. Not that it needed it but the dish comes with scrambled eggs and a beautifully, buttery croissant. My brunch was so satisfying, Heaven! The hubby chose the eggs Benedict with prosciutto. He liked it but noted he should have gotten the spinach not the prosciutto. He said the prosciutto seemed vinagary. The dish includes paprika roasted fingerling potatoes which were mild and perfectly cooked. And for dessert we chose the chocolate stout cake on a wine caramel drizzle served with a little dish of creme brulee ice cream. Holy cow! What a terrific chocolate cake & the ice cream rocked too. \n\nOverall, I would recommend Casbah to everyone noting their brunch was fabulous! The valet (even though the need for valet is questionable) and wait staff were super nice, attentive, & knowledgeable. The apps, brunch, & dessert were yummy and delightful.

I'm a fan of their Bloody, it's spicy and flavorful. The smoked salmon was filling enough that it's easy to split and the truffled potato cake served with it melts in your mouth. The sea scallop fry is everything you would expect, almost too much food, but no complaints.\n\nMy second trip to Casbah brunch, I went with my old favorite of the smoked salmon but split it with my friend who ordered the cheese plate. Also, I ordered the Braised Lamb & Eggs as my main based on friends' recommendations. It's honestly to die for. Rich and flavorful in the best way, attributed to the tarragon sauce and the slow roasted lamb, and easily their specialty. If you want to order something you can't get anywhere else, order this.

We only made them the night before and it wasn't a problem at all. When you arrive, there is complimentary valet parking- how awesome is that? We were sat on the covered patio area, which I really loved. It was a little slanted, which was weird, but our table wasn't thankfully. It was really beautiful- plants and art all around. We started off with drinks- I ordered the white wine flight. Having had a wine flight one other time, I found these to be pretty reasonably priced. I received three small glasses of white wine for $11. Each one was delicious and I really loved how they were all from different places (Austria, Italy and Spain). \n\nNext, we received bread and two types of butter. One was more traditional and the other was a homemade lemon and herb butter. I really liked them both! For my entr\u00e9e, I ordered the pork chop. It came with a magical mix of sauces and two side dishes- one that was mainly potatoes and the other being saut\u00e9ed kale. WOW. The garlic cream sauce was unbelievable, the pork chop was HUGE and literally cooked to perfection. The kale was perfect, not bitter at ALL (how do they do that?)- it was amazing.

I was so full that I skipped the desert.

My last experience at Casbah was excellent (minus the dining partner but that's another story) so I suggested dining there for this occasion and, since he is not from the area, he trusted my judgment (and my Yelp elite status lol) to choose a great restaurant. I actually made reservations for 8:15pm this past Saturday while I was on the way back from my vacation. Personally, I was quite surprised there was still same day dining availability, but of course I didn't question it. We arrived right on time and used the complimentary valet (get your ticket validated before exiting the restaurant) which was great, particularly since it was raining. We were seated inside and normally I would have rather dined outside but due to the rain, I actually appreciated the inside spot. \n\nI began with a glass of Malbec (my new favorite go-to wine) and my bf had a Cab. We were brought bread which came with regular butter and another seasoned spread which was more flavorful. The bread was fresh and warm, much appreciated since we were both famished. We started off with a cheese tasting and chose the Jasper Hill \"Harbison\"; Vermont, cow's milk, soft; the Sardinia \"Calcagno\"; Italy, sheep's milk, hard; and the Misty Creek Goat Dairy Leon \"Leonora\"; Spain, goat's milk, soft. The tasting was accompanied by bread (I believe the same we were first served upon sitting down) and three spreads-a mustard, a fig spread, and an additional sweet spread, pinkish in color-possibly pomegranite spread. We both LOVED the tasting and all of the cheeses paired excellently with our red wine! We easily cleared the cheese board. For entrees, my bf had the Ricotta Cavatelli( house-made fennel sausage, spinach, crushed tomatoes, ricotta) and I had the Orecchiette (grilled chicken, dried cranberries, Riverview Farms goat cheese, sage cream). He devoured his pasta, however, I was able to sneak a small bite for it was entirely consumed and it was quite tasty! The sausage had a bit of spice to it that was very flavorful. I absolutely loved the orecchiette! The savoriness of the goat cheese compounded with the sweet tartness of the cranberries was heaven in my mouth! The chicken itself was quite flavorful and the pasta was cooked perfectly, not too firm yet not too soft. Another testament to the greatness of this dish is that my leftovers, heated in the microwave the following day, tasted just as good as the meal did when dining at Casbah! Unfortunately, we were stuffed to the brim and too full for dessert, which will be on the agenda for our next dining experience here. The only criticism I had this go-around was the service. We had a male server who was just not personable, unlike the last time I dined here and the server hit the ball out of the park with her friendliness, multiple suggestions and explanations, and knowledge of the menu. This server never introduced himself, mumbled and talked so quietly it was difficult to hear him, and rarely checked on us. My wine glass sat empty for quite some time before he came around and I had to ask him for a glass as he didn't offer if I'd like another. The main reason for dining out is the food, which was incredibly delicious so I will return, however, I hope next visit the service can match or exceed that of my first visit here since that exceptional service contributed to my wanting to return here again and this particular service made me feel quite undervalued as a customer.", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-06-24", "type": "review"}

I am a huge fan of Eleven and Mad Mex, but I wanted to try somewhere new.  I had previously sampled Casbah's food when they catered the dinner for Quantum Theater's production of Tamara.  I enjoyed the food at that event so I settled on coming here.\n\nThe atmosphere of Casbah is really cute.  It's slightly upscale, but you will still feel comfortable in nice jeans.  There is a Mediterranean theme to the atmosphere, but I don't know that the food is themed that way, despite what Yelp says.\n\nI ordered the Lamb Macaroni and Cheese because I am a Mac and Cheese addict.  The portion was exactly lunch sized, and it came with a small salad.  The salad was really just a spring mix of lettuce with an oil dressing, but it tasted good.  The mac and cheese was delicious.  Plenty of lamb and lots of cheese.  It was on the creamy side of the mac and cheese scale.  I would order it again, but I would also like to try other things on the menu.  My friends ordered a sandwich and one ordered a bowl of soup.  The sandwich eater felt her turkey sandwich was pretty standard, but it was a turkey sandwich.  The soup eater was a fan.  Again, I plan to come back and test other things.\n\nAs a side note: The catered meal I previously tried was family-style chicken with potatoes and veggies, I believe.  It was good but not what I would expect after seeing the menu for them to serve.  I think you are safe to try just about anything here, really.\n\nThe only odd thing was that the servers really seemed to be fighting for tables.  Everyone was trying to get our drink and food orders, to the point of it being a touch aggressive.

It is my birthday month and Big Burrito offers a great deal for anyone who is on their mailing list, providing their patrons with a free entr\u00e9e up to $30.00 at any of their locations beside Umi.  I chose Casbah since I have been to all of them but this one.\n\nOur reservations were early at 5pm on a Sunday.  We arrived seated quickly in their outside seating area, which is very nice.  We were brought some water while we reviewed the menu.  I decided to start with a Manhattan to drink.  It was very nice, and strong.  Next we decided to order.  Earlier I looked online at their menu and I decided I would be ordering either the Cioppino, littleneck clams, mussels, shrimp, scallops, halibut, grilled sourdough -32 or their Long Island Duck, roasted breast, braised leg, gnocchi, spinach, lavender, peaches, duck jus- 29.  I have had the duck dish at Soba before and loved it, but I wanted to try the Cioppino despite that, since I also love seafood and shellfish.  This I would discover was a mistake.  My partner got the Pork Chop dinner.  We placed our orders and waited.\n\nDuring our wait they brought some bread.  It was a nice touch; the bread was warm and served with two types of spreads.  By the time our entr\u00e9es came I wanted another drink and asked for Boyd and Basil - 10 Boyd & Blair vodka, fresh lemon, basil, soda, Angostura bitters, this was one of their signature cocktails.  So we began to eat.  The scallops in the dish were excellent.  Perfect sear and seasoned, as well as the shrimp.  The tiny piece of halibut in the dish and I mean tiny, was so overcooked.  I choked it down but completely unappealing and tiny.  The sauce in this fish soup was also not that great.  The dish came with bread to soak up the juices but the bread itself was burnt and hard.  It actually hurt my mouth to bite it and that was after dipping it in the juices.  I was going to ask for more bread, hold the burn, but our server had not come back.  So I finished the meal and said forget it.  \n\nAt this point the drink I ordered was still not delivered.  I was done eating and had to use the restroom so I told my husband if he came back without my drink to tell him forget it and just bring the check.  When I got back to the table that was indeed what happened.  Except he told him he was sorry and if we ordered dessert he would comp my drink.  So when he finally returned, he ordered the Chocolate Cheese Cake Bombe, Pinotage syrup & whipped cream, hazelnuts, praline ice cream, gastrique, when the waiter asked me I simply said no thank you, can I just have the drink I ordered?  He brought dessert and my drink and explained it was \"on the house, and it was their/his fault.\"  No biggy really, I was way more annoyed with my meal.  I think what really bothered me was one, how small the entr\u00e9e was.  It was more suited to be a lunch portion in my opinion.  And then how much it was, but I did have the coupon so I guess I can't complain that much about that.  Simply put if I had spent $32.00 on the meal I got I would have been very upset.  Lastly, the halibut was so overcooked and dry, same with the toast, and the sauce wasn't that pleasant.  All in all I wish I would have gone with the duck.

They were good with maintenance stuff but tried to screw you over wherever they can to get the extra money from you. The lady, Sherry (who is the owner's daughter and run the management company) is very disrespectful-- especially after you've signed the lease.\n\nI signed a lease stating that the apartment will be available for move in on August 1st and she yelled at me for asking her for the key on August 1st-- saying that I should take into account that it needs to be cleaned-- that's NOT how leases work. When the lease states a move-in date, it literally means that. I didn't have the apartment until August 6th but until then they only had the carpet changed. The apartment was not cleaned. I had to request them to give me a cleaning coupon and prorate the rent for August for me-- they did both but nothing makes up for the urgency I was in since my sick brother needed the apartment urgently and I had conveyed that to her before signing the lease-- that and the fact that she was arrogant because she knew we were pretty limited in our options. \n\nAlso, they tried to squeeze in every penny from our security deposit. My ex-roommate had magnets on the fridge that left a couple of pink stains on it. They charged us $531 for that-- the fridge worked fine.\n\nIf you didn't have to deal with Sherry the place won't be a bad idea to stay but her attitude problem and unprofessionalism makes it really hard.

First building for about 3 years and the second building 1 year.\n\nFirst, their customer service might suck.  They have tried to improve it over the years.  They're are friendlier now though it is the fake kind.  Their rudeness shows through sometimes. For the time I've been with them, I've seen all of them at the office talk in a rude manner.  Sheri, the woman that runs the place, is the one I mainly dealt with.  She can get snippy on the phone.  She's the type that always look like she's frustrated and tries her best not to go bitchy on you.  These are just small examples.  I've been with them 4 years and it's been overall fine.  They're straight forward, and again have been working on their politeness recently.  They have been pleasant the last few times I've visit them.  The maintenance staff is friendly too.\n\nSome of their buildings are pretty run down.  Both my apartments have fake fire places.  I personally think they're disgusting.  They're the \"cover it over\" kind of maintenance.  My first building, everything was covered over with paint or caulk.  Mold grew through the caulk in my bathroom.  However, at my new place, they renovated the apartment so everything is relatively new and clean.  No mold in my current bathroom.  You just have to find the right building.  If their apartment was in the same quality as my first apartment, I would never move back in. \n\nThey always responded to maintenance calls.  There has been times where I came home and realize maintenance has been there without any notice.  However, it seems they're leaving door hangers now to let you know they were there.  I like that they accept pets but a deposit is required.  Their apartment has AC.  My first building had heat included.  My 2nd building has heat but the vent is so small it won't heat the entire apartment.  They do respond to neighbor complaints.  We got people playing drums at odd hours, reported them, and the drumming stopped.  \n\nWhen I left my first apartment, I got my deposit, and my pet deposit back no problem.  It did take a month after I already left but that was clearly stated on the sheet that give us.  My current apartment has been renovated.  New cabinets, carpet, bathroom redone, new windows with screen.  It's good enough.\n\nThey're strictly business.  The apartment I live in now is livable.  I like my area of Friendship.

Aiken Ave. This 7 unit building is very unique. With two apartments with balconies on the top floor, exposed brick in some, and brand new renovations in others, there is so much to love about the place I had spent my last year.

I've had quite a bit of interaction with the folks in the leasing office, as well as with the maintenance crew at my building. First and foremost, when I first accepted this apartment, it needed gutted and renovated. The staff that is hired by the company to remodel and perform maintenance on the buildings are WONDERFUL people, with lots of respect and a sense of humor to boot. Secondly, Sherry, Melita, as well as the rest of the staff over in the leasing office on Shady Ave, were such a pleasure through my entire lease. They understood and answered any questions or concerns that came up throughout the process (although concerns were few and far between). Not to mention, every conversation I've had with Sherry or Melita (the folks I speak with most often) has been such a joy... I truly couldn't have asked for a more overall perfect experience for my first apartment. \n\nI would whole heartedly recommend looking into the options that Herbert Halsband Properties has to offer.

Believe you me, Quiet Storm tops them all.  I wish I knew their secret recipe, but the part I do know--baking the tofu rather than just sauteeing it--makes a tremendous difference.  Come in on a lazy Sunday morning, get the Nothin' Fancy, and you will see for yourself just how good tofu can be.  On top of that, they are as vegan-friendly as can be, with earth balance for the toast; soy, rice, and almond milks; and a selection of specifically vegan mixed drinks and milkshakes.  Plus, sandwiches!  Get the spicy spinach and peanut butter wrap, ask for added tofu (planks not crumble), and be astonished yet again.\n\nAND AND, as a delicious cherry on top, they have theme brunches, fantastic theme brunches that show off the creativity and chops of the cooks here in a way that the regular menu can only hint at.

I had the Dagwood sandwich, which was a perfect mix of sweet, sour, and spicy with hummus, apples, hot peppers, cucumbers, and pickles... it came with an option of the side, and I had to try the mockamole.

My friend had a wrap with curry and tofu and I honestly don't remember what else, but it was huge and really tasty.

I like that in some dishes you can replace rice with salad. A lot of people I've eaten with here have raved about the quesadillas. There's a nice laid back atmosphere and fun retro diner decor.

That's an unpleasant prospect to face down after a hard night of drinking, which is the only time the idea of brunch ever occurs to me.  But then, the grim Spectre of Laziness appeared to me and asked, \"Do you really want to drive to another place?  Just look at you. Your wearing the same shirt that you wore yesterday dude.\"  \n\nThe Spectre of Laziness is a dick, but he was also right.  And to my surprise, nothing I had was bad at all.  For brunch options, meat eaters will find that potatoes and eggs are the cornerstone of any breakfast, and seitan substitutions are not as bad as say, having the grim Spectre of Laziness point out your slovenly appearance.  \n\nI think the biggest surprise in this place is that, though nothing is particularly jarring to the palate, there is nothing that really stands out as being amazing.  In Yelp terms: it's kind of a 3.  For hard core vegetarians having a night, er, mid-afternoon on the town, it's probably a blessed change from the meat based culture that Pittsburgh is pretty famous for.  But I'm willing to wager that very meat eaters will become converted to vegetarians after this.  Maybe they did TOO good of a job substituting meat items.  That being said, we did make it back another time for lunch where I had a vegetarian gyro.  My friend said it best: \"What's the fucking point?\"\n\nThe service is always very sweet, but both times the waiters have been curiously, nay ominously spacey.  Even when it wasn't crowded there had to be some substantial flag downs and polite and doleful eye contact before they would do what you needed.

The meat is layered just perfectly on it and they don't slather on the condiments (presentation is every bit as good as taste, folks).

Yes, this is important for me to mention because I come from Seattle where recycling is the norm and we get fined if we don't recycle..and recycling does not seem to be a big thing in WV where I currently live. \n\nThere is also a community board if you are looking to post something up (events, classes, pet sitting, etc.) near the bathroom in the back of the store.", "business_id": "-iVcmhjfq79QoTWzrb6pKg", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-06-08", "type": "review"}

This all changed yesterday when I was desperate for a healthy smoothie and nowhere near one. \n\nWe were a little confused as to how to get into the co-op, because didn't realize that it was on the opposite street all tucked away. After we figured that out by following another patron, we were really excited to walk through the doors. \n\nIf you've never been into a co-op, you should know that they are typically smooshed together and have an interesting smell that emanates from the bulk-spices isle. I love this smell. It's really the best grocery store smell, EVER.\n\nProceeding through the store we noticed the colorful and abundant produce section. So many beautiful fruits, veggies and herbs. The prices varied, but they were probably on par with what you would pay for any other organic produce somewhere else. \n\nWhen we found the back area with hot foods, cold foods and the smoothies...I died of happiness. There were so many wonderful things back there. The food bar is $7.99 a pound, which is a lot cheaper than some places! The smoothies were all very tasty sounding, but I settled on a smoothie with soy ice cream, strawberries and papaya juice. Oh, my, god. It was so delicious! My boyfriend got the King smoothie, and he really enjoyed his too.\n\nRight beside the smoothie bar there is a section for all kinds of books. My eye was caught by an organic and local homebrewing book. It is now on my list of must haves! \n\nThe rest of the store was great. I especially love the cheese selection (we bought AMAZING and LOCAL tomato-basil havarti), the vegan meat products and the prices. \n\nI'll definitely be coming here a lot more.

This is a Tony Pais restaurant, he owns another more formal place downtown but I forget the name.  He used to own Baum Vivant on Baum Blvd.  This was a great place.  The last I was there was 7 or 8 years ago.  It was total formal fuu fuu fine dining, but what an experience.  Anyways, it's gone now and I haven't been to one of his places since until last night when a friend suggested we try this little oasis located on Spahr St.  This place is the opposite with respect to atmosphere than Baum Vivant.  It's in a converted garage with a few outdoor tables.  It's cash only and BYOB.  It's very informal and I got away with wearing tennis shoes and my \"Super Size My Foie Gras\" fruit of the loom t-shirt.  Don't need to get dressed up to enjoy amazing food.  The inside of the restaurant/garage has a high ceilings and an eclectic mix of non-matching tables that I imagine were collected from Thrift stores.  The service was awesome, spot on from start to finish.  The lovely european women who served and hosted had big smiles and a genuine appreciation when we said we liked the food.  The meal started with some warm rolls that they may cook on site.  It was served with ice cold butter.  That's fine, but let's get a little more creative people on the butter, dips with the bread.  The first course was this amazing artichoke soup.  This literally is the best soup I've tried since I can remember and I eat out all the time.  The flavor was layored with the cream, maybe nutmeg, maybe spinach, and also what tasted to me like a shellfish broth.  It was a very complex flavor.  Amazing!  Next was a goat cheese dish served inside of phyllo dough.  It was tasty, but a little too rich for my taste.  The inside of the dough had apricots mixed with the goat cheese and the sauce was some type of combination of walnuts and apples pureed'.  Interesting, but didn't add too much to the dish.  Also, we tried a smoked salmon appetizer served on croutons with capers.  It was perfect and I really like their portions here.  They don't try to kill you with the size of the dishes.  My friend ordered the crabcakes, which were two small mostly lump crabmeat portions.  They were delicious served with a mushroom cream sauce.  The rice that was served with the crabcakes were another story, totally tasteless and not seasoned well. The rice was also a liitle mushy.  I tried the Elysian Fields lamb burger.  I had never seen an Elysian Fields lamb burger, so I thought I'd give it a try.  It was a decent portion (4 oz. I'd guess) at a reasonable price $11.  I didnt' really get to tell the difference between regular lamb and Elysian because they overcooked the burger to well done and it lost much of the flavor.  Overall, I'll stick to Tessaro's for my burgers.  We finished with a chocolate mousse, which was okay but I thought too heavy for a mousse.  I got out of here with a $65 + tax bill for all this amazing food.  What's even better is that because it's byob I probably saved $30 for the bottle of wine as well.  I really like the fact I can have interesting food, relatively cheap in a casual atmosphere.  One last thing, they don't have AC so you may want to pick a cooler night if you plan on sitting indoors.  They also say they don't take reservations on the menu, but we were able to make a reservation on Sunday for Monday for two people.", "business_id": "l_Wey2YC6NvVUIH8vTygGg", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-06-10", "type": "review"}

Family-owned.  Off the main roads.  Charming interior.  Unique staff.  WONDERFUL FOOD.  (We called this our \"less-expensive Casbah\" when we left).\n\nLike everywhere we end up going, we go because a Yelp review we have read, that inspired us to give it a try.  We new it was BYOB, but we weren't in the mood for drinking, so we walked on over.  It was our own fault that we got there, at 5:00pm, on the dot - and they were not quite ready to be opened, as they were finishing setting up the tables.  My boyfriend and I took a quick walk around Ellsworth.  It's a family-owned business where they turned their front garage into the most charming, artsy-like, romantic restaurant.  We'll cut them some slack!\n\nWhen we got back, they were ready for us; and we chose to snag a table outside (they thought we were nuts).  However, in one of the reviews, we read that they had no A/C, which was a big selling point for us (I absolutely loathe going into a freezing cold, A/C'd out restaurant, and being forced to bring a hoodie with me, when it's 90+ outside.  And we do kind of like hot, humid, and muggy); but, I guess they have upgraded because the A/C was BLASTING on the inside of the restaurant.\n\nWe started off with the Gazpacho.  This was a perfect summer starter because it was cool, extremely flavorful, and a natural air conditioner to the body.  It had lumps of shrimp and crab meat at the bottom, which made us feel like we were eating somewhere on Duval St. in Key West.  I normally don't like cilantro, but the cilantro was so subtle and completely rounded out the flavor.  When our waitress brought out the freshly baked loaf of corn bread, we sopped up the rest of it.  It is true, the wait staff genuinely appreciates your compliments and feels honored every time you say you enjoyed something.\n\nI ordered the Wild Mushroom Ravioli and my boyfriend ordered the Lamb Burger.  When our dishes came out, they were the most beautiful dishes I had ever seen - full of color, wonderful portion sizing, and aromas just attacking the olfactory with sensational goodness.  My Ravs were topped with this grape tomato paquillo sauce, which tasted like it had hints of red pepper also.  It was FANTASTIC.  Plus, there were whole mushrooms, okra, carrots, and cauliflower on top of the dish as well.  I don't know what kind of separate seasonings were on the veggies, but they were to-die-for also.  I can't exactly remember how many Ravs were in my bowl, but every time I thought I was finished, there was another ravioli to be found, and then another.  For the price - I think there were a total of 10 fully-stuffed, hand-made mushroom ravs.  Incredible.\n\nMy boyfriend's Lamb Burger came with a cranberry and raisin jam (but \"jam\" seems to clich\u00e9 of a word for this topping), and a salad that had slices of apples in it.  Now I'm usually not one to eat sweeter tasting foods; however, the complementing of sweet and savory in this dish blew my mind.  I'm also not a big fruit eater (unless it's blended in a smoothie), but I totally got past all that because the flavors and the textures all are playing nicely with one another.\n\nWe opted out of dessert because we were so stuffed.  But our bill for an appetizer and two filling, insanely delicious entrees came to $40.  DING DING DING DING DING!  WE HAVE FOUND A WINNER!  \n\nAfter dinner the owner came over to our table and we were introduced.  What a wonderful, sweet, and genuine older guy.  We will definitely be back before the menu changes again; and next time, we're going for entrees and dessert!! \n\nOne last thing - it is a Cash Only restaurant, but they do have an ATM on-site.", "business_id": "l_Wey2YC6NvVUIH8vTygGg", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-07-27", "type": "review"}

Also, make sure to have $5 (or more) on hand to give at the entrance for the recommended donation.\n\nEven though the music is important (thanks to Meeting of Important People for putting on a great show on Friday night), I think that friends and food really make this event. My husband and I met 8 friends and had a great time chatting and laughing and catching up on life. This is the sort of concert that it's OK to talk through. Then, the food -- you can't forget the food. Our group had fruit and cheese and wine and spring rolls and mac & cheese and dessert and on and on.

I have never eaten there before last night, but I have eaten at Davio's and that is what the atmosphere reminded me of.. we were there a total of 3 hours start to finish.. 3 hours until our main course was served. But, many courses are served as you wait... most of them were delicious. They bring you out fresh, delicious, warmed bread at the beginning with a garlic oil sauce dubbed \"holy oil\" and it truly is heavenly. They also have a bowl of cheese and garbanzo beans to eat atop of the bread. Delicious. There is also a cheesy spread available. All were wonderful. Then about 45 minutes later, they brought our appetizer. It was a soupy-looking mushroom appetizer with a sweet flavor. I do not recommend this app. It wasn't good. Then about 35 minutes after that, a salad was served. It came dressed and was one of the best I've had. 35-45 minutes after that, the HIGHLIGHT of the dinner came. Pasta in a bowl. It was the best part of the dinner. Finally another long time after that - our main course came. Mine looked only slightly better than it tasted. I got the seafood diavolo and it was a huge disappointment.\n I really liked our waiter - he was very busy but attentive - but I cursed him under my breath for recommending this main course. I was so close to ordering a pasta dish, which I'm certain I would have loved and devoured. But I was talked out of ordering pasta, because pasta comes with dinner. I wish our waiter would have asked me what I liked; sauces, etc before recommending this dish. $68 for something you give to your cat is a hard pill to swallow. I love seafood, but I enjoy it in butter sauces, lemony butter sauces, Alfredo sauces, wince sauces with garlic... not this red soupy dish.\n It was literally like eating cold tomatoes and water with Tabasco sauce poured in. It looked like \"seafood soup.\" All the delicious seafood was drowning in a dark red, spicy, soupy mess. I wanted to cry when I saw it.. then I tasted it and really wanted to cry. It was gross. This is the last dish I would have ever ordered had I known how it was presented. I looked around at my date who had a massive veal tenderloin in front of him and I was so jealous.. wishing I had went with my first instinct - the pasta - or even the Halibut.. anything that wasn't drowning in a spicy red soup. I just hope that staff read this and never recommend this dish to a first-timer.. especially someone who enjoys seafood they can actually TASTE that isn't drowning in some spicy tomato sauce. If this dish wasnt so awful, I would have given 5 stars. The only other bad dish was the mushroom appetizer, and it was also a soupy mess. but, i would eat the mushroom app 3 times a day for the rest of my life if it came down to that and the seafood diavolo.", "business_id": "qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-08-15", "type": "review"}

We had reservations for 7:30 on a Tuesday, so we obviously figured we would be seated immediately.  The brother and his girlfriend arrived a couple minutes before the reservation and were told to go up to the bar while they set the table and wait for the rest of the party.  I arrived about a minute after and my husband a few minutes behind me as he needed to park due to the lack of valet during the week.  There was no one at the host stand when either of us came in.  So we went up to the bar, declined a drink... and waited, and waited.  The bartender soon became deeply involved in picking a wine for a couple at the bar, not his fault.  The brother eventually was able to flag down a waitress to ask if she could check on our table.  She looked very annoyed.  She eventually went over to the phone at the bar, called down, hung up the phone and said, dead pan, \"no, it's not ready yet.\"  Not a smile, not a sorry, not a \"can we get you a drink on the house?\" Meanwhile, there was an open table for 4 on that floor.  The bartender eventually told us \"that's for a reservation.\" \"Yes, we have a reservation... for 25 minutes ago.\"  \"They must have specifically requested that table.\"  They did, however, offer us the table right next to the door on the first floor though - the one with the 10 degree breeze coming in that night.  No thank you.  We were very insulted by the lack of table for our reservation, but more so by the lack of acceptable service.  We decided to leave and spend $20 on pizza instead of $100+ per person and enjoyed much better service.. which is never the way it should be.  Hopefully they solve this problem soon.  We'll give it one more go when the insult has worn off.\n\nMy husband won't hesitate to tell you what his favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh is: Alla Famiglia.  And to be honest, these days I agree with him!  \n\nWhile my husband enjoys many of the more \"up and coming\" restaurants with smaller portions and interesting flavor combinations, he often finds himself longing for the same quality food with better cuts of meat and bigger portions.  This is where we satisfy both of our appetites for big flavor and, well, big portions.  But to reduce Alla Famiglia to those two things alone would not do it justice.\n\nLet's start out instead with addressing the two biggest critiques of this place: its location and the price.  Yes, it is in Allentown, but they also have plenty of parking and valet if you prefer.  Honestly, we drive almost everywhere to get dinner, so this is not an issue for us.  The other thing I always hear about is how expensive it is.  Some of those complaints come from people who I know have no problem giving their money to the big steakhouse chains, while getting a lot less value.  No, it is not cheap.  You will likely pay upwards of $50 for your entry.  The veal chops are close to $70.  But, that's not all you get.  You get delicious, fresh baked bread, a spread, dipping oil and gustoso for same, a delicious salad, and homemade pasta served family style.  If you wanted to be especially frugal, you could approach this place like an Olive Garden senior special: feast on the freebies and take your entree to go.  But, even if you're full, it may be too difficult not to savor the meal as it comes out...\n\nI've been here twice and my husband has been here three times (lucky - he got to go for work and he said they ordered almost every appetizer, all of which were apparently delicious).  The first time I ordered the filet with gorgonzola.  It was one of the most delicious and largest filets I've ever had.  My husband ordered a veal chop with prosciutto which I don't think I recognized on the current menu, but he absolutely loved it.  The veal chop is one of the largest bone-in cuts of meat I've seen and the sear on it was absolutely perfect.  We also ordered the mussels, which were spicy and delicious, and the meatball appetizer, which I remember being tasty, but nothing too out of the ordinary.  I think there are other things on the menu to try first. \n\nThe second time we came I ordered the Milanese veal chop, breaded, slightly citrusy, and absolutely heavenly.    He had the cowboy ribeye which was also large and an absolutely beautiful cut of meat.  The husband has a thing about fatty cuts and avoiding anything that is the least bit chewy, and he barely had to leave a piece on his plate.  We also got the calamari appetizer, which was perfectly, lightly fried with a savory, garlic sauce that sets it apart from the sweet sauces often served with calamari.\n\nFinally, I should note that the service we have received here has always been exceptional.  Everyone is always professional and courteous.", "business_id": "qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-08-15", "type": "review"}

The salad is one of the best salads I remember eating and could easily be enough for an appetizer.  The pasta tossed in a vodka sauce was just ok.  The homemade pasta is not actually made in house (I asked), but it is 'fresh,' which I'm assuming meant bought from a store on the strip or a market district.\n\nWe had also ordered the calamari and the meatball appetizer because we were starving and that proved to be way too much food for a family of 5.  If you must get an appetizer, I highly recommend the meatball, you will not regret.\n\nThe veal chop is easily the best thing on the menu and where Alla Famiglia really shines.  From all the pasta plates and steaks and seafood dishes that were ordered at our table, the veal chop was by the unanimous favorite at our table.  Incredible flavors and tender cuts, but by the time you get to the main course, you're full with the bread, salad, and pasta that comes before you can't really enjoy it fully.  Most plates come with a side of their grilled veggies (which again were ok), but some dishes come with nothing so I would make sure to ask if you need a side.   So long story short, this is a marathon and don't expect to be done in an hour and a half.  Pace so you can really enjoy that veal chop at the end!\n\nWhen you first walk in it seems very small, but there are back rooms and stairs that go up one or two floors.  There's also a back patio one floor up from ground floor.  It's tight sitting spaces, but very cute and authentically Italian.  \n\nSo now that we established that the ambiance and food are pretty solid, the thing that earned this 3 stars is how we were hosted to our table.  We had a reservation at 7:30pm and were 30minutes early, which we recognize is nowhere near to our reservation time so we elected to grab drinks and sit on the patio.  When 7:30 comes around we inquire about our table only to be told that there was not a sitting space yet, which would be ok minus the fact that there were multiple tables open that we asked about.  7:45 we asked again and were told that they were setting up a table immediately.  8:10 comes around and we're still not seated so had to ask the hostess again, which apologized and sat us at the table we had asked about 40 minutes ago when our reservation time was.  It took 40 minutes to seat us at our table for our reservation time of 7:30 when there were tables open.\n\nIt was a frustrating experience because everyone was hungry and we weren't even offered bread sitting on their patio...  The frustration unfortunately set the mood for the dinner and although our food was great, we didn't really enjoy the time we had here. \n\nWe really wanted to love Alla Famiglia.  Perhaps we'll try one more time and hope our experience is better.", "business_id": "qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-06-20", "type": "review"}

The service was very good, and all the staff were working very hard and quick, but were available to answer questions and assist us when needed.

I was just thirsty\n\nAlthough it was only around 9 in the evening, the majority of people were drinking - not eating. As I mentioned in my first review of this restaurant, the menu is pretty small. Also, all of the food is pretty much prepared by the owner at one end of the bar. He uses microwaves to heat up just about everything. The food isn't bad, it's just not great and there's absolutely nothing special about it. So, do yourself a favor and come here for beer.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the gyro and hummus platter. I noticed that the tzatziki sauce had been sitting out uncovered and underneath a hot light for a significant amount of time before finally being covered by the owner. I found this to be a bit gross, especially since there is dairy in the sauce. By the way, we learned that the sauce is not homemade, but is doctored up by the owner.\n\nThe hummus platter came with two warm (microwaved) pitas. The owner noted that he makes his own hummus. It was pretty tasty, but definitely wasn't a plentiful portion.\n\nWhat I didn't like about this experience at The Park House was that the owner was eating food behind the counter (with gloves) and seemed to be preoccupied with a woman that was sitting near us. I wanted to say something to him about eating with his gloves on, but I felt extremely awkward.\n\nWe'll continue to come here, but in the future we will pass on the food.", "business_id": "YRDKsBFYP7G0E8BLJKIkvA", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-08-19", "type": "review"}

It had been having some trouble with the battery, so I took it to the only place in Pittsburgh (apparently) that will help with this. A dark-haired guy greeted me as I walked in and treated me like a total noob, and his demeanor made me feel like the dirt under his shoes. However, he did give me good information and service about my camera when prompted by another man in the shop (who I might assume is Bernie). \n\nThey told me they could send it to the manufacturer where they'd clean it for a couple hundred bucks, but instead they cleaned out the sensors and the lens right there at the counter and checked the contacts between the lens and the camera. The dark-haired guy showed me through a magnifying glass what I was looking at, and explained that some spots I saw in the viewfinder were inside the top of the camera and wouldn't appear on the pictures. The other guy (Bernie?) explained to me some of the functions of the camera -- I knew these already, but it was nice to hear them explained and he showed me a few examples. They advised me to get a UV filter to protect my lens, which I knew was overpriced but I happily bought anyway to pay for their service. \n\nSo I think the kind of experience you get depends entirely on the person you run into. I can see how someone would be put off by the dark haired guy I ran into first, and how someone would absolutely love the service from the other guy.

I love the cuckoo clock and tapestries they have.\n\nNow, to the food:\nThe bread they give you... with apple butter!! ... is very fresh and tasty.  Try not to fill up on it while waiting on your huge main course.. The Bavarian soft pretzels were warm and soft when we ordered them.  Also delicious.\n\nThe sampler platter is a great deal if you don't know yet what you like.  You get 3 entrees and the typical sides for ~$16.  My favorite, though, is the schnitzel liechtenstein, with sauerkraut and potato pancakes.  Fresh and delicious everytime.\n\nI would definitely recommend this place to anybody who likes ethnic, or German/Bavarian food, or just trying new stuff.

I've had several sandwiches, most of the appetizers and even the Sunday brunch (which has a good spread but can be hit or miss) -  though not all in one visit.\n\nI most recently took my Mom out for dinner using a Living Social deal I had.  Somehow, even though we have both been to Max's quite a few times before neither of us had ever seen the sampler platter option on their menu.  For just a bit more than the cost of the regular entrees, you can choose three entrees and two sides.  Obviously the portions of each selection are smaller than the individual meals, but the size is still generous and there were only a couple things not available for the sampler platter.  Between the two of us we selected six different items and four different sides to try and shared everything - and still had enough left for a full meal each the next day.  I can't even decide on my favorite of all the items we tried.  If you aren't sure about some of the entrees, this is a great way to see what you like.  I personally loved everything so much that I think my new go-to menu item from now on will be the sampler platter.  Not being forced to choose just one item is what living in America is all about.\n\nAll together I think our bill was around $35 (no alcoholic beverages consumed).  Some might consider this a tad pricey but the food is so good I usually don't mind the slightly higher cost.  Service has never been a problem for me in fact they've always been helpful when I have questions about the menu.  Full bar with numerous good beers on tap.

Of course I couldn't miss out on tantalizing conversation... so I obliged.  \n\nI really had no clue what they offered for brunch options, but quickly learned they have a a pretty decent size brunch buffet.  I'm not below buffets at all, it's the fat kid in me!  Most things still looked a little questionable to me, but I went for the big ticket items.  Make your own omelets, potato pancakes and dessert.  I'd hit up the buffet again, but still be hasty to check out the regular menu again.  \n\nThe omelet was made right in front of you, so I added cheese, mushrooms, peppers, tomatoes and onions.  I was super excited about it because it was the size of a football.  Sadly, it was pretty tasteless.  I don't think they added any salt or pepper to the egg mix, so it came out really bland, despite loading up on ingredients.  \n\nBut the potato pancakes... I could survive on them forever.  They were amazeballs!  Add some sour cream and I was in potato patch heaven!  I had to keep myself from getting more because of the other thing I loaded up on... dessert.  \n\nThe desserts looked unassuming, but they were also awesome.  I had a smattering of delectable bites.  The scones were so moist and tasty.  I had to stop myself from taking more than 20.  I also had some carrot cake, brownies, cookies among other things I inhaled and didn't pay attention too.

My partner has been in the basement before for various work-related functions, but I had never been there, despite driving by on numerous occasions. \n\n    We easily found on-street parking and entered the restaurant. I immediately loved the decor in the entry room/bar area, and those pleasant furnishings continued into the more intimate rear room where we were seated. We enjoyed the beautiful wall tapestries, and I thought the old newspaper-like menus were pretty cool! I was surprised (in a good way) at the old-fashioned urinals in the men's room. In a city that has struggled to nourish and revitalize its history over the years I was already a fan of how unique Max's was in the regard of feeling \"authentic\" in an era of predictable chains.\n\n     We were initially enticed by the prospect of ordering fried soft pretzels stuffed with cheese as a shared appetizer only to find out they were not available. We settled for the non-cheese-stuffed version, which were \"melt in your mouth\" good and were handsomely complemented by tangy honey mustard. We were a bit dehydrated after walking miles around the city, yet our waitress was very attentive in consistently replenishing our water glasses as soon as they were half-empty. I was craving a burger but was tempted instead by the fried fish sandwich, which I ordered with a side of potato pancakes and applesauce. My partner ordered a fried chicken sandwich with the same side I did. \n\n    Our food arrived surprisingly promptly. My fish sandwich was HUGE! I had enough to take home and enjoy for a post-work meal the following evening. The fish tasted fresh, although I wasn't a fan of having to pick small bones out of my mouth in exchange for enjoying that freshness. The bread it was served upon was tasty as well. The potato pancakes were thick, fresh, and were delicious when enjoyed with the chunky applesauce. My partner also thoroughly enjoyed his own sandwich. \n\n    As if this wasn't good enough our check was only $22! We will definitely be back soon, at which point I look forward to trying a burger!", "business_id": "IxQ1ATP_Wg_QujO9nywzcQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-06-11", "type": "review"}

But seriously.  This place has been an institution for my family, and I really love it here.  I feel like this is some of the only German food in Pittsburgh, and I think it represents fairly well.  My thoughts:\n\nBrunch Buffet- I love the Sunday brunch buffet more than life.  Omelette station, German and American breakfast and lunch foods, and lots and lots of beautiful, delicious, and decadent desserts.  It's heaven on Earth.  There is usually a decent selection of meats, and the potato pancakes are almost always featured.  They've changed it a bit over the years, but I still love this buffet.\n\nAppetizers- My family loves the soft pretzels.  They are so yummy and buttery, but a bit heavy if you are going to eat your entire meal.  So make sure to share.\n\nMeals-  I, personally, have never had a bad meal here.  The sauasages of all varieties have been great.  The weinerschnitzel also great.  Sandwiches all good as well.  I really like the cheesy spaetzle dish that is just like macaroni and cheese but with spaetzle noodles!  I don't get too crazy and order anything complicated, though.\n\nSides-  I love love love their sides.  I could live on the spaetzle and potato pancakes.  Don't pass the sides up!\n\nDessert:  Also love their desserts.  There is a chocolate chocolate cake that they heat up with homemade whipped cream that is TO DIE FOR.  Not so shockingly, the apple strudel is wonderful as well.\n\nBesides the food, the servers are always very friendly and efficient.  There is also ample street parking, which is really nice.

The tiny and I mean very small bar, with three tiny tables and three bar stools is big on properly made drinks. \n\nI sat at a stool which isn't high enough for the bar which made for a rather uncomfortable seating. My friend Katrina has known the lone bartender, Nikki for years and has been wanting to get me out of my comfort zone and try new places. I beat Katrina to the Priory and found a lot of free parking out front (after 7 pm street parking is free) and went inside. \n\nNow situated, I sat down and looked over the menu and decided on a Monktini, citron absolute, fresh lime juice and razzmatazz. Perfect for a warm summer night, not heavy or filling, a little sweet, a little tart. Refreshing! After Katrina arrived another couple walked in and sat at one of the small cafe tables, the tiny room induces conversation with others, especially when the bartender introduces you to everyone. \n\nTime for a bite and this is where Monk's Bar lost a star (the uncomfortably high bar and low stools cost them a star as well) but as a practicing vegan, there were no options I could enjoy. Sandwiches are served on pretzel buns (monks invented pretzels) with options like a ham and turkey club, turkey, creamy chicken salad, and a few others I forgot. I did order hummus but it wasn't filling at all. I did enjoy the house made Lemoncello, although I have made this in the past, Monk's makes there's with grain alcohol which I found to be too strong. I'll continue to make mine with 100 proof vodka and forgo the impending hiccups. \n\nIt was a very interesting night, made new friends, found an interesting new spot and a really cool building I'd love to explore more of.

You seem to recall that those are in London. Isn't there an ongoing controversy about repatriating them to Greece?\n\nOh. Wow. Oh, ok. They're all plaster casts. That's sort of cool, I guess. Maybe I'm a bit slow on the uptake. So, move along. The contemporary art works are pretty fantastic, particularly a Rachel Whiteread piece, a video installation filmed supposedly in a semi-trailer, and a sculpture using mirrors. Also, there is some great Pgh related art. Especially the painting of the dog from the firebrigade.\n\nGo over to the Natural History Museum. Appreciate the fact that the displays were constructed before people worried about portrayals of violence and proceed to play a pretty fun game of Spot-the-Dead-Thing-in-the-Diorama. And trust me, nearly every diorama includes a death. Go into the wood paneled room (yep) and walk into an area that is tucked away and looks like an after-thought to see a badger. It's a pretty great badger, as far as they go.\n\nNotice that much of the museum is under construction. Wander out after an hour or two. Maybe when the dinosaur exhibit is up it will be worth going; apparently the bone collection if extensive. In any case, leave a little disappointed.", "business_id": "EEuGTah-oEssSl3o6pK-ZQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2007-06-17", "type": "review"}

Their dinosaur fossil exhibit is top-notch. \n\nWhen I was visiting the Carnegie Museums this summer, they were hosting the Life On Mars international art exhibition.

The Carnegie Museums are scattered throughout the Pittsburgh area and include the Oakland Museums (highlighted here) as well as the Carnegie Science Museum and the Andy Warhol museum.  \n\nThis three building complex (the Museum of Art, Natural Science and History, and the Carnegie Library) sit on an entire city block, lined with sculptures of winged sirens, dinosaurs and literary legends.  Complimented by the lush Oakland landscape, right on the backdrop of the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University, the locale delivers wonderful exhibitions across most mediums and provide a wonderful cultural and learning experience.   \n\nI recently visited the museum to see \"Horse,\" an exhibition in the history museum, depicting how this working animal has influenced human culture.  A VERY interesting and educational exhibit.  With one of the largest dinosaur collections in the world, you could literally spend an entire day in the History museum alone.   \n\nOver at the Art Museum (which joins through one hallway) The Scaiffe Galleries house works of Rodin, Monet, Klimt, Hopper and many others.  There's something there for everyone - paintings, etchings and sculpture.  And, don't miss the Hall of Art and Architecture.  This enourmous room houses casts of early Greek and Roman buildings, as well as church and mission facades' which cannot be matched.  \n\nIf you're in town for the Carnegie International, you're extra lucky.  As one of the largest annual art shows, the museum hand picks pieces from around the world, showcasing leading contemporary artists.  A must see.  \n\nThere is a cafe inside the museum, as well as a couple of gift shops. There are also several restaurants on Craig Street, adjacent to the museum.  There is paid parking next door to the Art museum.  Metered street parking is also available.  The museum is largely funded through the Carnegie Foundation, and has a huge donor program.

We went to theaters, clubs, restaurants, yet I NEVER went to any of the museums or any of the tourist sights.  Why?  Because I could do that anytime, right?  Then I left and I look back and think, \"Why the hell didn't I go to the Empire State building?\"  Now, every time I go back to NY, I try to knock off at least one tourist thing and one museum, in addition to the usual list of restaurants, etc.\n\nI realized I was about to fall in to the same trap here in Pittsburgh.  I've been here a year and eaten about about every conceivable restaurant in the city, been to most of the bars, but I haven't been to many of the attractions that people talk about that make the city so great.  \n\nSo I have made a list--a list of things to do in Pittsburgh if I were a tourist.  And every Saturday, I will do at least \"One Cool Thing in Pittsburgh.\"  Today was day one--and today was THE CARNEGIE MUSEUMS in Oakland.\n\nMy first comment is, man, am I tired.  That is one big museum.  We started out by visiting the Biennial exhibition--a collection of Pittsburgh Artists.  The work was mixed--the photography exhibition was strong; I was a little underwhelmed by some of the other work--but either way, it was awesome to see the work on display and it speaks to the vibrant arts scene here.  \n\nThe layout of the permanent collection is one of the most logical and easily flowing I've ever seen.  And the collections, while not huge, are all solid.  Definitely the 'right' pieces for someone who wants a nice overview of a period of time.  \n\nWe were already tired by the time we got through the second floor (we never did go down to one) collection and decided we had to at least check out the dinosaurs.  \n\nAwesome.\n\nGot some geological history on the way.

This museum was not only a huge part of my daughters' childhoods with at least 1 visit every summer, our youngest daughter got married there. The Carnegie Museum will hold a special place in our hearts forever! \n\nThe basic exhibits have been there since I did my school field trips (a loooong time ago!) and there have always been special rotating ones to check out and enjoy over the years. What one doesn't stop long enough to realize as you're schlepping kids from place to place is the amazing architecture of the building itself. That's what became so apparent as the wedding was taking place. The murals all around the walls and ceiling of the grand staircase area where the ceremony was held are spectacular, as well as the marble columns and staircases themselves. I had never had the opportunity to stand there and take it all in until that moment and it's pretty mind blowing how gorgeous everything truly is. \n\nThe 2 typical places for social events at the museum are The Hall of Architecture, where our reception was held, or the Carnegie Music Hall. Both are amazing event sites. Parkhurst Dining does the catering for events at the museum. Yes, it's the catering division of Eat N Park which initially gave us pause until we did their tasting and from that point on we had no worries. They produced really spectacular food elevated far above what one considers typical banquet fare. Everyone raved about their steaks being perfectly cooked and everything arrived hot to the tables. Alice, the baker, did a phenomenal job on the wedding cake, too. I'm not even a cake person and have to say that Alice's chocolate cake with raspberries was killer! \n\nAll the Greek and Roman Facades in the Hall of Architecture had always given me goose bumps when I walked in there over the years. Imagine it decorated for a reception! Truly unique and wonderful. \n\nThe Carnegie Museum is certainly a Pittsburgh treasure to be enjoyed on many levels both as kids and adults.

It was not what I expected at all. Tiny I expected because I'd seen it driving by many times. Diner-esque inside, completely unexpected. I knew they are BYOB but after eating lunch here, I can't imagine any scenario where I'd take more than a couple of beers with me. Not a place to linger over a bottle of wine. Tables on top of each other, cramped and kind of a low end divey diner, uh uh.\n\nI wanted the mussels for lunch but was told they were out of them. Not terribly disappointed because our server had just run through the lunch specials and one had caught my attention enough that I mentally considered changing my mind anyway. A fried zucchini plank sandwich with melted mozzarella and side of sauce. I do love a good zucchini plank and had never heard of anyone creating a sandwich out of them, so no hardship to change my order. \n\nThat was a greasy, good lunch sandwich....heavy on the greasy but, I've always loved some tasty 'fried deliciousness!'\n\nHubs had the sausage sandwich... good...but mine was the clear winner.\nStarter soups were homemade and tasty. Hubby had black bean and I had the chicken pastine, aka wedding soup. The broth rivaled my premium homemade Christmas chicken soup broth so no complaints on that. \n\nOverall: ambiance 1star, mine and hubby's sandwiches 3 stars, soup 4 stars. Average is a 3 - not rushing back but I'd clearly have lunch there again, if I'm across the street.", "business_id": "q_BKmbdlYfQJroJVHfYMUQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-07-04", "type": "review"}

Friends told me it wasn't worth it but I persisted to the point that we went there for lunch yesterday. My first reaction was not a pleasant one. The cheap plastic chairs, the small close together tables, the tacky decorations, not a good feel but I pressed on. \n\nNow, I didn't avail myself of the BYOB (might have resulted in a higher rating!!) and it was only lunch so I can't comment on dinner. Regrettably, I won't ever try them for dinner so this is the best I can offer.  I think Legends in their name only applies to the sports heroes and not any legendary food experience you'll find here. \n\nThe place is essentially a diner. Diner atmosphere, diner chairs, diner specials, diner everything. Not that I don't appreciate diners, I do. But this atmosphere is BLAH.  I'd rate it a max of 2 stars. Max. \n\nFood on the other hand is ok. Not great. Ok. Worth going out of your way for? Absolutely not. I had the Parma hot sausage with a bowl of black bean soup- both things I love!!! We're these memorable? Not in the least. It's generous to say they were adequate. \"Mama's gravy\", a marinara sauce of sorts, was lackluster and flavorless. The sausage was just a split link of hot sausage and something I could replicate at home with ease. The black bean soup was listless and uninspired. Sad because i was expecting (hoping?) for so much more.  I wish I had ordered the chicken parm that the guys pressing up against me from behind ordered. It looked way better. But I'll not have that chance cause I won't be going back. I'll drive by this place a thousand times to go to other more deserving places on the Northside. \n\nSorry. Didn't do it for me.  Can't even imagine coming here for dinner with a bottle of wine. Would be awful.  I wanted to give it 2 stars but felt a little generous today. Plus, I thought if I worked down the block, I'd probably come here for lunch.

We were not brought or offered bread.  What brought down this rating was service problems which obviously were not the fault of our server.  I appreciated that the restaurant offered me a reservation when Open Table indicated that nothing was available on this day. The hostess did not seem to know how to handle a reservation and I do not believe that our arrival was matched to it. She asked another individual for assistance and I believe that person told her simply to seat us. After more than ten minutes had passed after we were seated without a server coming to the table, the hostess came over to ask if she could take a drink order.  She was not able to answer my question about whether the featured beers were draft or bottled.  Soon thereafter, our server, a charming and gracious young man, came to take the drink order.  We asked him to take our dinner order as well, given that this was stacking up to be a very lengthy meal.  More than fifteen minutes later, our entrees came, but no sign of my wife's wine and my beer.  I asked the young man who brought the food about our drinks and a few minutes later, our server came over, apologized, and told us how backed up the bar was.  He graciously told us that the drinks would be complimentary.  We received them more than five minutes after the arrival of our entrees.  These were not mixed drinks requiring anything special to dispense, simply beverages that had to be poured.  For almost the entire time we were there, a band was playing inside at a volume that was deafening.  We could not possibly have had our meal inside near the band as it would have been necessary to use sign language to converse and to order. We were seated outside as far away from the music as possible, yet it was still difficult to speak to each other over the din.  Additionally, the placement of the band in a small room makes it particularly difficult to snake in and out when coming in to use the restroom. The menu at this Atria's is a bit different from the traditional locations and some of the prices are not the same for items that are identical.

I love the Steelers as a sports team, BUT this week I am very disappointed. Tisk Tisk Steeler higher ups. This does have to do directly with Steelers policy not Heinz Field.\n\n I have a 9 month old daughter and I was so looking forward to taking her to her very first Steeler game! Now, she is a very very good baby and in social situations I have been able to take her everywhere. She loves people and loves to take in new and exciting experiences. The point of this is that she would be well behaved, laughing at a Steelers game, and most likely clapping with rowdy fans not throwing a temper tantrum and disrupting the game for others. I would take her out if she was upset, believe me I get it!\n\nI feel that The Steeler organization is trying to weed out the younger crowd by charging full price for a ticket and a seat that a baby can't even use. Most kid friendly places don't charge for Children 2 and under, that includes Aiirlines in the US, museums, fairs, Zoos, Concert Venues, Pitt games(at Heinz Field) Baseball games(PNC park), and many more less opulent businesses.  \n\nAs far as the Steelers are concerned even though your child won't be using a seat they have to buy a full price ticket. I asked about Club level seating and yes especially in the club. Which would be the best place to walk around and entertain a youngster if fussy. If you purchase non club seating then it doesn't matter where your baby sits if you have lower level seats. Getting 3 seats together can be much pricier than a pair and are harder to find. I asked why this was the policy and an unfriendly person told me that \"Steeler Policy states that gate operator is not incumbent to assess a childs age of 2 or under so they do not have the resources available for gate entry for people in line entering the stadium.\"\n\nSorry but considering the Pirates allow free entry under 2 and offer discounted tickets for children under 2 if they want to participate in the activities for children's days.

I hate writing a less than stellar review of a business. It actually makes my cold goth baby heart sad. No one WANTS to go somewhere and get bad service, thats just ludicrous. (Not Ludacris, close but not the same.)\n\nI have just recently moved to Beechview and the best part of moving to a new part of this wonderful city is giving new businesses a try! I have sampled so many tasty and amazing new food items and coffee drinks etc etc. I am always in search of a non-smoking bar where I can hang out, eat, drink, and get to know the locals. I prefer small bars with \"yinzers\" as they tend to be a true gauge of a neighborhood for me. \n\nWe have many friends in this area, which means that we got some great tips before we even moved in about different types of food, stores, laundromats, and bars. One of these tips, repeated from friend to friend, was The Huddle. As the name implies it is a bar where you can be certain you can watch a sports game of whatever sport-ball type you're interested in. It is indeed non-smoking, a handful of tables suitable for 4 people and a \"U\" shaped bar right in the center as soon as you come in. It is a cash only establishment with an ATM on site for quick transactions. The have free popcorn from a popcorn machine which makes the place smell amazing. It's been around quite a while which means that there is a great group of locals who frequent the establishment. \n\nThis is truly everything I need in a local bar. We had been in for the very first time for drinks shortly after moving in and happened to be in there on one of their two weekly wing nights. This are not the wee tiny wings, more a weird in between of some of the \"full\" size wings I've had other places that clearly came from giant monster mutant chickens (I mean maybe they were goose wings, who even knows... they were huge) and the teeny tiny wing night wings you find most other places. They have two options; buffalo (sloppy) and \"tanned\" which are buffalo then cooked again so they are drier and crisp and un-freaking-believeable. The prices are mega cheap and it's so filling and delicious we've been back more than once for them. I like this place so much we have even taken the handsome-boyfriend's mother there when she was in town for the weekend. (P.S. She loved it too!) \n\nMy dear sweet lovely readers, here is where I have to talk about something less than all of the amazing parts I've already mentioned. Tonight, both ravenous from too little food and too much work-day, we trekked up the monster that is Coast Avenue for beers and food and a chill environment (that would undoubtably involve pre-season football). We walk in the door and aside from an employee (other than the bartender) and a few people in the back at tables, we are the only patrons aside from one regular. We belly up to the bar on the far side and say our hellos. This is where I get a serious case of the sad. The bartender working seemed annoyed by our presence. Ok, I get it... I work sort of indirectly with the public I have days where I can't handle people. It happens! As customers come in and sit down, she greets them with a warmth that was clearly lacking. Ok. That's sort of disappointing but still fine. When we got to the point that we asked for a menu three times while she retrieved menus and took orders for the people next to us an hour after we came in... thats where I start to have an issue with the service. Eventually we decided to leave because I was tipping over the line to \"hangry\" and was afraid I'd lose my temper after the 3rd time we had asked for menus and didn't get them while she continued to warmly greet other patrons and provide them menus and take their orders while refilling our beers seemed to be an annoyance to her to the point of not even asking if we wanted another or the same beer and just taking the glass and starting to fill it (wherein I had to stop her because I hadn't asked her for another one and actually just wanted the tab cashed out).\n\nYes, of course I'll give it another try, I want this to be my local hang out bar. My service in sitting at the table or being served by the woman I presume is the owner has been great. The food is amazing. The prices are great. Don't let me down, The Huddle.", "business_id": "wan0X-oHpLgGTPXqaICZCw", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-08-21", "type": "review"}

It was almost empty when we arrived for a relatively late breakfast, missing out on the commuter crowd. A friendly Greek lady who may have been one of the owners served us promptly and we were perusing the plentiful options before us.\n\nI decided to go with the gyro breakfast burrito which comes with eggs, gyro meat, tomatoes, onions and mushrooms in a crisp griddled tortilla, and slices of fried potatoes on the side as well as gyro sauce, aka tzatziki. The meat in the burrito was crisp and gravitating towards the dry side of the moisture spectrum, but it had a really good flavour, quite similar to donairs here in Halifax. Although the crisp tortilla added a nice texture to the dish, I would have preferred a soft pita for the sake of being able to eat it with my hands.\n\nThe potatoes were OK at best. Some pieces had nice crisp edges, but their texture was inconsistent and a normal hashbrown or home fry would have been better.\n\nIf I was around for longer, I'd have definitely tried Tom's again, but alas, it'll always be Dor-Stop that holds a place in my heart.", "business_id": "m61vZsAxmTEq3uiCjFjM8Q", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-07-15", "type": "review"}

Nice and crunhcy, light and flaky, and also has the moistness of a biscuit.......if that makes any sense. Sauce is also good, nothing crazy, just good ole pizza sauce.

I was excited because they use canned mushrooms and loaded them on. Call me weird, but i love canned mushroom on my pizza. Another delight, the onion was sliced into rings. Onions HAVE to be sliced into rings for pie....plain an simple. Diced? One pissed of jedi! Like I said before, raw toppings, so it was a shock to bite into raw cheese and onion. The raw onion went well with the whole Beto's thing they have going on. I was pleased.\n\nI will be back to Beto's and it is a great change of pace.

It's a unique style & in my opinion ranks Beto's in the top 3 pizza spots in Pittsburgh.\n\nIn addition to their pizza, I think Beto's has the best Italian hoagies in Pittsburgh. I believe their cheese is what elevates their food. Absolutely amazing!", "business_id": "93UCt9OgWYmypZCpXtUu8g", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-06-29", "type": "review"}

I agree with the other people's review that you will either love this place or absolutely hate it. I'd have to give it a thumbs up but instead of calling it pizza, call it beto's raw cheese baked bread haha. They cook the bread sauce/tomatoes and then throw a heaping cheese pile after your meal is cooked. Then they throw on any toppings. I call it raw cheese pizza. It is good. Crust is crispy and the sauce is delicious. \n\nEatability I'd give a 2/10. The whole point of pizza is that you can bend it in half and then stuff it in your face. Here it's more of a fork and knife operation. The cheese falls right off because it's not melted so you end up slurping it up like spaghetti. \n\nI dig it though. Good job beto's.

The perfect \"plate\" for that great sauce, with pieces of tomatoes, delicious. And, if you eat a cut right away, you can just about get all that cheese and pizza in your mouth and you get to eat about 8 oz of cheese that surrounds the cut. I had the second piece when I got home. By then all the cheese had melted into the pizza creating a blanket of cheese. Heavenly. Which is better, a cut with melted or unmelted extra cheese?

This is J and my go-to spot when we are in the mood for something good, reasonably priced and close to home.  We have been many times, but the last time was especially awesome. \n\nJ ordered the full slab of ribs which came with fresh-cut fries and cole slaw.  While there was a bit too much BBQ sauce on the ribs, they were cooked perfectly, fall off the bone good.  \n\nI was in the mood for a good beer of which they have plenty.  While I normally would order an Abita Purple Haze, I was talked into some shandy that was on special.  Thursday specials are micro-brews - which means that we should really go every Thursday.  But I am getting off track.  When the waitress told me that there were two shandies on tap, she offered to give me a taste of the one in which I wasn't familiar.  The beer that came out was big enough that I didn't really need to order a full glass, but it was good enough that I wanted several. \n\nWe decided to split an order of the pepper jack cheese bites which were served with unnecessary ranch dressing.  The bites were awesome - cheesy, not greasy and excellent breading.  I ordered the California Turkey Hoagie with a side spinach salad.  The spinach salad has feta cheese, walnuts, dried cranberries and warm bacon dressing - all in all, a delicious spinach salad with fresh, crunchy spinach.  The hoagie has fresh turkey - that is featured in several sandwiches and meals and always delicious - avocado, pico de gallo, swiss cheese and lettuce.  I would probably trade out the swiss for maybe pepper jack, but other than that - the sandwich is perfect.  \n\nI know that this place is not everyone's cup of tea, but for my husband and I, it's good food, good beer and decent service. \n\nThe one thing that for me stopped me from giving it 5 stars is that it is so freaking loud in there.

The following is an email that I sent to the owner, it will shed a little light as to why I feel this way...I will also share his response, and what ultimately became of the situation. I know this one is long winded, but you should be forewarned about giving them your money!\n\nI have been to your bar many times, and I have had both good and less than average experiences, but this past Saturday was terrible! My girlfriend and I came to have some dinner around 9 pm. We knew it would be crowded due to the Penguin game, and that wasn't a problem. When we arrived, there were no seats at the bar or tables available anywhere. We decided to have a beer and wait. After the game was over, some tables opened up so we sat in an empty booth in the back and waited. After about 5 minutes, a waitress came over, cleaned our table, and made notice of the fact that we still had drinks. Sadly, this was the last time that she ever came to our table. We placed our closed menus at the end of the table...nothing, we put our empty glasses at the end of the table with the menus...nothing. We sat and waited for more than 15 minutes. All the while we were waiting, another group of four sat the table next to us, they were never given any attention. They got up and left after being completely ignored. I understand that the restaurant was busy, and that service and wait times may be impacted, but the way we were treated (or lack of being treated) was appalling. It was especially annoying to watch the server that initially cleaned our table giggling and carrying on with two other booths that appeared to be friends with her on the other side of the dining room and then when she was done she just casually walked over to another empty table picked up something off of it and went into the kitchen without even taking a look around the dining room. At this point we were disgusted and got up and left, I was annoyed and made mention of how awful the service in the back was to the doorman. The waitresses in the back were terrible and seemed to have no sense of urgency or seem to care about most of the customers, with the exception of the few tables that they were more interested in socializing with. This seems to be a problem, because on some of my past less than stellar experiences, the disappointment was again with the service from the back servers. On those occasions it was the same thing, they seemed to be more interested in being social butterflies than providing any sort of service. You don't need to improve your wait staff, you need to replace some of them, at least the people working the back dining room on this past Saturday, they were completely useless! Will I come back to your restaurant, I'm not sure. The food is good, but I work hard for my money, and I expect to receive more than good food in exchange for it. \n\nSincerely,\n Matt K.\n\nHere is the response that I got\n\nPlease give me a call (412)555-1212 to discuss the matter. I'm sorry & will make every attempt to make sure this doesn't happen again.\nThank you for making me aware of the situation.\nJoey DeMarco \n\nI promptly called him as soon as I got this email. It went to voice mail , so I left a message. That was it, the guy didn't even have the decency to return my phone call. It is amazing that this is how business owners expect to keep people coming through their doors and handing over their hard earned money.

Getting its name from the bedroom community it's located in, Dormont, it benefits from a charming mini-downtown area immediately around it, as well as lots of brick houses, although some have seenbetter days. \n\nDor-Stop is diner chic through and through, serving the breakfast and lunch crowds only. Nic nacs and local sports teams' placards adorn the walls, as well as a proudly displayed signed poster from Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives after that show's stop here. A mix of booths, tables and a few counter seats could cram several dozen people in.\n\nYou don't have to do any research about what's popular here, just take a look at a good chunk of the menu or what the person next to you is eating: the hotcakes. With a dozen options, there's a lot of choice and they're all tempting. I settled on the apple walnut hot cakes with sausage on the side. We didn't have to wait long but it felt like a while hungrily watching all the delicious looking food come out of the open kitchen or sitting in the window.\n\nOnce in front of me, I was staring at three thick hot cakes with apples chunks and walnuts cooked into them and topped with icing sugar, along with two sausage rounds. The hot cakes were utterly fantastic, with a pleasing denseness but with just enough air in them to keep them from being chewy, The apples were cooked perfectly, soft but not mushy, and along with the walnuts added some texture. I was initially disappointed that the sausage came in round form instead of links as they tend to be drier, but these were nicely browned and still juicy, albeit a bit too greasy. \n\nMy girlfriend went for the lunch time food, getting the Chick 'O' Philly hoagie  which came with sliced chicken breast, sauteed mushrooms, onions and green peppers, tomato lettuce and Swiss cheese. It was a winning combination of ingredients and the thick bun made for a even heftier sandwich, and as a good sandwich should be it was greater than the sum of its parts. The fries it came with were a solid entry - lightly browned, thick cut but still nice and crispy. \n\nOn a return trip, I went with the plain hot cakes and they were just as good as the apple walnut ones, a sign of great fundamentals when you're doing something as seemingly basic as a hot cake. Kudos. \n\nService was friendly and attentive, with a ton of coffee top ups. You'll be challenged to get past half empty in your cup at any point in the meal.\n\nDor-Stop seemed like just a convenient spot to fuel up for a day of tourism but turned out to be a damned good spot with memories of its own: the best pancakes I've ever had.", "business_id": "2Igiyhi82R8_QaaPplRmCw", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-07-04", "type": "review"}

I'd never been to Dormont before and we were eager to check out this place and the neighborhood in general (side bar: Dormont is adorable! If it were a bit more convenient to where we work and like to play, I would totally live there). \n\nAnyhow, so we get there on a Saturday morning, and the place is packed. No biggie, most good breakfast spots usually have a wait on a weekend morning. I think we waited about 30 mins, which wasn't bad. We're seated, we order, everything is just peachy. Then things started to go sour.\n\nIt had been about 40 minutes since we were seated and we still hadn't received our food. Other diners who were seated after us had received their food and were finishing up. Our waitress hadn't stopped by our table in a long time. I had started to wonder if maybe our ticket was lost (ordinarily I wouldn't think anything of it, but the fact that people seated after us had gotten their food made me think something might have been wrong). Anyway, so the next time we see our waitress walk by, we flag her down and ask her if she knew when our food would be out. We asked politely. We weren't snarky, we weren't mean, we didn't roll our eyes or snap our fingers. It was a simple question, one that I think many would probably ask. And the waitress replied, \"Are you really hungry or just really impatient?\" No hint of a smile on her face. No twinkle in her eyes. It was clear that she wasn't joking (not that it would have been funny anyway). \n\nHmm. Are we really hungry or really impatient? Well, neither...we just wanted to make sure our ticket hadn't gotten lost. We sat in stunned silence, unsure of how we should respond to such a flat-out rude remark. The waitress left, and finally brought our food out about 10 minutes later (and then we never saw her again except for when she dropped off the check). By that point, our appetites were pretty much gone, and we just wanted to leave. So we scarfed down our food and got the heck out of dodge.\n\nI dunno. Maybe the waitress was having a bad day. Maybe she gets asked that question a lot (by actual impatient people) and is sick of hearing it. But we were very polite to her and didn't deserve to be treated like that. I don't care how good your food is (and for the record, the food was okay, but certainly not mind blowing for the all the hype), if you have lousy customer service, I can't support you. And it's a shame, because I really, really wanted to like this place (it looks like such a cute mom and pop place). With so many other great breakfast spots in the Burgh, I'd rather go somewhere that cares about giving their customers a good (or at least not a blatantly bad) experience.", "business_id": "2Igiyhi82R8_QaaPplRmCw", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-07-31", "type": "review"}

What arrived was this wonderfully thick, cheesy, reeking of garlic in a good way, just what I needed, comfort food that instantly made the days worries seem distant. The first bite was heaven, chewy center, crisp bottom, olive oil coating my mouth, ooey, gooey italian cheeses, saltiness from the black olives I ordered as a topping. This was pizza! Two slices and I was full, I drank my beer and paid the bill, and walked out with lunch and dinner for the next day.

If selection drives your decision-making, definitely head on over.  However, if you'd like to receive anything other than slow, resentful service from your waitstaff, or food that is anything above sub-par, head on by without stopping.  I've lived just down Forbes from D's for 3 yrs, and walk down there with friends a lot during the summer and early fall.  I'm also a former bartender and waitress, so I can say with experience and certainty that I've received just downright terrible service there about 80% of the times I've been.  Once, a friend and I stopped in for lunch with her kids and ended up waiting for the check 18 minutes after we'd asked to receive it.  We were both fuming, and the waitress just looked annoyed and kept ignoring us to chat with her buddy.  Another time, my husband and I came in 15 minutes before the ordering deadline, and watched as the waitress did not approach our table until exactly the cut-off time.  She proudly announced that we could no longer order food (we just wanted pretzels, for god's sake).  Food is pretty lackluster, although it's a nice touch that they have veggie dogs.  Upstairs, expect about the same level of service, with a douchy element of annoyed resentment from the bartender, along with even douchy-ier clientele. \n\nI know D's is a favorite neighborhood place, but I'm tired of the abuse from waitstaff who look annoyed that I'm even there.

Their draft list changes constantly so there's no sense in trying to remember which beer you had there the week before. Plus their beer cave is great with hundreds of different bottles to choose from all listed by the region from which they came. They also have a small cooler with about 150 different varieties of beer that are already chilled for your liking. Even if you get a warm beer, they have this ice cold dunk tank to put your bottle in that gets it nice and chilly for you in just a few minutes. That by far is my favorite aspect of D'z. If you choose to take beer home with you they also have a discount of $1.00 per bottle of every beer you take with you(excluding the pre-made six packs). So sometimes we get a six pack of variety beers at a lower cost than paying for them individually. On to the food:\n\nI love their wings and hot dogs and my masterful veggie burger creation. We always order the BBQ sauce because it taste so gooooood and their wings are nice and crispy and hot and smothered in plenty of sauce that you will be licking your fingers. We've tried almost all their dogs expect 2 and my favorite is the mac and cheese dog(w/ ketchup) and the chihuahua dog which is avocado, shredded cheddar cheese and jalapenos, my fiance enjoys a classic Chicago dog. The have delicious sauerkraut that i enjoy as well so i usually get a side for only 99 cents. Can't beat that price. Now when it comes to the veggie burger i love the way it taste. I do it up real nice by getting that black n blue topping which is blue cheese and cajun seasoning. I add bacon, onion, mushrooms, avocado, tomato, lettuce and their spicy mayo/double dip sauce. It is hands down the best burger i've ordered in a loooong time. \n\nIf your looking for a fun hangout spot for you and your buddies or even a tasty treat for the kids then D'z is where it's at!!! It gives you the feeling of just a fun place to be on the weekend or even the weekdays. \n\nDue to an unfortunate circumstance of eating at a different hotdog shop during restaurant week, my fiance would have proposed to me at D'z.

I will say their seitan wings were particularly crunchy/dry and not altogether satisfying shared between people, but the flavors were great.\n\nBut let's be real, you're probably coming here for the dogs. It's cool, I do too. And you will probably want to add avocado to whatever it is you're getting, because avocado is for winners, just like the ocean.\n\nOne night, during some seriously biblical amounts of rain and lightning, the power went out temporarily and workers and patrons alike kept on going like it was -no big deal-, demonstrating that the strength of D's can weather any storm.", "business_id": "2X5G4Ujq0s4Wfn4TC7gX0g", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-06-24", "type": "review"}

He had an IPA by Sierra Nevada and I had the Boulder Shake Chocolate Porter. Both were awesome and their draft list is decent. About 15-20 craft beers on tap. \n\nWe each ordered a sandwich. Their menu wasn't large but they had more than just your typical bar food, definitely more interesting items. I got a chicken sandwich named the chihuahua--chicken, avocado, cheddar cheese, salsa and jalape\u00f1os. It was amazing! Their sandwiches automatically come with chips (which I'm never a fan of) but I was able to substitute them for French fries. Their fries were amazing, they were the kind that are battered and those are my favorite (very few places around the burgh sell them like that) so this was very exciting to me. Overall the price isn't bad either which was awesome. After dinner my boyfriend and I both go my 6 packs to go.. They have an awesome selection.. Over 1,000 beers in their beer room (all beers are warm) but they do also have a cooler which has less beers but still not a bad selection. \n\nI honestly couldn't be happier with my experience.", "business_id": "2X5G4Ujq0s4Wfn4TC7gX0g", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-07-08", "type": "review"}

At best, the food was mediocre, and the only time that I would eat here was when I was too tired to get in my car and travel the three or so miles to the Union Grill in Oakland (which offers similar fare as Dunning.s - and does an incomparably better job of it).\n\nRecently, however, things have taken a nosedive at Dunning's.  I now consider Dunning's to be the single worst restaurant in the city that I've ever had the misfortune of entering.  \n\nI recently had the worst restaurant service experience of my life at Dunning's when our waitress first ignored our party, then hurried us through our order, then left us sit for over 20 minutes waiting for food with empty drinks.  We then received terrible food (soggy sandwiches, brown lettuce in a salad, and cold french fries - stone cold), and when we complained about our fries, the waitress launched into an angry tirade (nearly yelling at us) about how it wasn't her fault, that she just picks up the food, and that there wasn't anything she could do about it.  When I asked to speak to the manager, he just shook his head sadly and offered us free desserts.  I told him that I didn't want to eat anything that came out of a kitchen that clearly showed that the people working in it simply didn't care - at all, and we didn't want to eat anything, not even the food sitting in front of us, and just wanted to pay our bill and leave.  He said that he was going to \"comp\" our meal.  \n\nIt was a disastrous experience - the single worst restaurant experience of my life - and I will never return until the restaurant is under new management.  It is crystal-clear that the current manager and/or owner isn't doing his job, and I cannot understand how anyone would choose to spend their hard-earned money at this establishment when virtually every other restaurant in town offers far better service and food.  \n\nIn short: no one - not the manager, not the waitresses, not the cooks - cares about the customer.

This was the third time I consigned with Ambiance in Oakmont, and I only offered items that I thought were in excellent condition from high end retailers; even though I have seen brands in the store from Charter Club for example (Ambiance says they do not accept them in the consigning agreement). The employee was very apologetic and she said that she stood by her assessment that the items were of good quality, but the owner (who she seemed upset with) disagreed. So, get your stuff together Ambiance owner and either train your employees better, or only accept items yourself so that you do not inconvenience potential customers like me.

We found this place through our Home Warranty Company.  Our dishwasher was broken when we moved into our new house. The sellers were supposed to have it fixed by this company before we moved in however it was still not working on move-in day-would not drain.  I called Perla and they had no record of being out to our place to fix the dishwasher (sellers did pay for it) and said they think they had the wrong zip code written down and could not find the house. I mean are you kidding me??!!  So we scheduled an appointment for a service man to come out. This took several calls as they rarely answer their phone and one lady is extremely rude whenever she answers.  The service man was scheduled to come in a week between 1-4pm.  He shows up at 4:30 because he typed the wrong house address into his GPS instead of going to the appointment scheduled before us. Well lucky us.  He recommends we get a new dishwasher as it would be cheaper than fixing and he leaves after 10 minutes. The home warranty company says otherwise and tell Perla they will pay for the parts.  Perla never calls to make another appointment so again I have to call about 5 times until I can get someone on the phone to schedule a second appointment.  We were told the parts they ordered had come in.  The day they were supposed to arrive we did not get a call so I called and they said they cannot find the parts they ordered for us. Another are you kidding me!!  Two weeks ago they said the parts had arrived. They said they would call back if they find the parts and never do.  Meanwhile we are waiting at home for them to arrive.  I call them back and the parts have been found and I demand they tell me when they will be coming. In an hour they finally show up and fix our dishwasher.

It's a lot more spacious than the Oakland location, which can feel a bit claustrophobic to me on a busy night.

The Yucatan Bean Dip is to die for, and the Dos Equis queso dip and fire-roasted tomato chipotle salsa are also great.  For entrees I usually go with the fish tacos or one of the quesadillas.\n\nThey have great lunch specials too.  I can get a huge quesadilla and a salad with their delicious lime-cilantro dressing for like $7!

My search ended with a trip to the Manor Oak Barber Shop this past Saturday.  Upon walking in the door, I was greeted with a big hello by the owner, Tom Grove.  I waited while the two people in front of me had their hair cut by Tom and was really impressed by the friendly conversation that was going on between barber & customer.  When it was my turn to hop in the chair, I was greeted by a big welcoming handshake from Tom.  I was quite apprehensive as Tom started to cut my hair, especially since I had no idea whether his claim of being a master flat top artist was true or not.  But my fears faded as I watched him work -- he really did know how to mold a great flat top.  I told him that I wanted my head to look completely square and that's exactly what I got (plus, he did it completely free hand!)  The shop is a throwback to the shops of yesteryear, friendly, inexpensive and a barber who truly knows his craft.  By the way, Tom still shaves the back of your neck with a straight razor and, get this, you get hot towels on your face to top off the experience.  if you're in the area and in need of a haircut, do yourself a favor and stop in to see Tom at the Manor Oak Barber Shop.

The quaint room made me feel very claustrophobic. As well, there aren't any places to eat near. I would stay there again for a reason of a place to crash after a concert or something similar. I wouldn't recommend staying with a family at this facility because of it's size, unless you can get a bigger room or a couple rooms at once.", "business_id": "AJiwOb0s5zpYu0NW7Jvrpg", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-07-29", "type": "review"}

And the second bed was receiving the blast also. I  jury-rigged the unit to cover much of the vent and that reduced the air flow over the beds greatly.\n\nThe Wi-Fi worked reasonably well, but you need to sign in everyday (we were there for three days).  Most other places only require a single sign-in.  \n\nThe OK: breakfast was standard fare: a few fruits, yogurt, cereals, breads, sweets, scrambled eggs or prepared omelettes, sausage.  Nothing special, but plentiful.\n\nThe really good: the staff.  At our check-in, the front desk personnel were friendly and helpful, making me forget how long it took to check-in.  And the best for last: the bus service.  You virtually do not need a car or a taxi to get to most of the places to visit in Pittsburgh.  We had a restaurant reservation and concert performance in the Cultural District.  As it turned out our activities coincided with an arts festival downtown, making parking extremely difficult, especially for someone who is not familiar with the downtown area.  We made arrangements to take the 5PM departure (you do need to sign up for a specific time) and we got to our reservation in plenty of time.  When the concert was over, we called the hotel and within about 15 minutes the bus arrived to take us back.

Check the reviews folks (I sure wish I had) and you'll see that this place has been under construction for at least four years!\nMy family, and I'm sure countless others, initially had trouble even finding the place and had to humble ourselves to ask directions at the nearby Doubletree Hotel. But even with directions, we drove right past the Clarion because: 1). There are no hotel signs; 2). We were arriving at night and the building was completely dark; 3). There were no parked cars visible from the road; and 4). The entire front of the building was boarded up.\nWhen we located the correct driveway and approached the construction zone, which once represented the entrance to the hotel, we saw a tiny sign directing us to the \"Temporary Lobby\" in the back of the hotel. The makeshift lobby consisted of a hotel room with a clerk sitting at a desk. The clerk initially could not locate our reservation on her computer, but found it as soon I had dug through my luggage to find a copy of the confirmation email.\nWe were given a room on the second floor, thus we walked past stairwells that were closed (because of endlessly drying 'wet paint') and an out-of-order (and leaking) ice machine, until we located the elevator. Well, let me tell you folks, Disney's Tower of Terror ride is less frightening than this elevator. It looked like one of those service elevators that the public never sees. The floor was covered in dead bugs and the ceiling had holes in it, leading to the conclusion that someone must have taken the globes off the ceiling lights and just dumped the dead bugs onto the floor.\nWhen we got to our room, the carpet was so covered with nasty grease stains that we wanted to keep our shoes on. We did the preliminary check of the beds and found some stained sheets, but thankfully no bugs. We also checked for the free Wi-Fi signal and found that it was completely useless (maybe that's why the desk clerk couldn't locate our reservation).\nFinding the complimentary breakfast in the morning was like a scavenger hunt, where you look for clues on small paper signs in the hallways. The adventure actually took me outside of the hotel and then back into another part of the building (thankfully it wasn't raining like it had been all night). I then realized that I had just entered the main construction zone and the outside route must be the only passable route to the dining area.\nThere was yet another sign outside the dining room which said something about Complementary Breakfast and the strange phrase \"Gratuity Included.\" But inside the dining room there were at least two clearly-marked 'Tip Jars.' Now, I've been at some pretty trashy hotels in my travels, but I've never seen a tip jar in the dining room. I've also never been in a hotel dining room where it looked like a bomb had gone off, but there were drop cloths, power tools and all sorts of debris everywhere.\nWhen I got in line for the grub, I learned how the attendant earned her tips: she was there to help patrons identify the food. The person in front of me inquired about the gray-looking sausage-like links and was dutifully informed that they represented turkey sausage, adding, \"Because Clarion cares about your health.\" I'm not kidding (who could make something like that up?). Anyway, I tried this so-called health food, because the only other hot alternative was French Toast and I did not want any syrupy food that morning. Guess what? The sausage had some kind of sugary additive to make the links taste like syrup! Real healthy, right? Thus, I ended up just getting a cup of coffee and returning to my room to pack up. The coffee was okay, by the way.\nIn conclusion, I would not have stayed at the Greentree Clarion had I not made prior reservations and had not been coming back after midnight following a music festival where it rained all day. Plus, we used our loyalty points for this room, so I couldn't even request a discount.\nBelieve me, HUD would shut this place down if it was an apartment building and the Dept. of Homeland Security would never even consider housing immigrants there. But, of course, you and I are welcome to pay upwards of a hundred bucks a night to stay there.", "business_id": "Ml6Up5SH9GbJQ8oyIJsj_g", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-07-31", "type": "review"}

She's very open about trying different things (e.g., perhaps a multivitamin--work from the inside out--to fix hair, rather than slathering on lots of product) and really seems to care about getting it right. Go to Kara!\n\nThe rest of the staff are equally friendly and fun. The salon definitely has a hip, young vibe, without making my (somewhat) unhip self feel awkward. Great open space, very clean, no chemical stinks, lockers for your purse, coffee/tea/water, tons of magazines, and a phenomenal view of East Liberty. Just a chill place. Add a friendly bulldog and it can't be beat.\n\nAll in all, I have to thank Yelp for absolutely pointing me in the right direction!

I tried looking on Yelp to identify if any salons downtown offer it, but with no success. So off I went, and I stumbled upon Kenny's Nail Center/Salon. Apparently right now they are the only nail salon in downtown Pittsburgh that has shellac. \n\nAt first, I passed it b/c I didn't see any bright flashing lights saying shellac, but then I did a double take b/c on the window there is a small poster advertising that they do shellac. So I went in to confirm that they do shellac and to get the costs - as some of you know it can be pricey. \n\nThey did confirm they did shellac and that without a full manicure that the cost would be $25 (slight grooming and painting only). I'm not sure how much the manicure and shellac would cost, but I thought $25 was a good deal for getting a 3-week polish job. And from what I heard it usually costs $35-40 bucks a pop. \n\nThey were very busy and asked if I could come later in the afternoon around 2:15 PM (I went there initially at 12:30 PM) and I said that was fine - luckily I have some flexibility with work. So around 2:00 I departed work to go back to Kenny's. It seemed even more crowded so I was worried that I'd be overlooked, but they asked what I was there for and I said shellac and they said, \"oh yes, 2:15 sit down\" and pointed towards a nail chair. \n\nSo I sat down and was greeted by Kammy - she was super nice and did an awesome job. I get a bit worried about some of these nail places cause they can do a pretty crappy job, but Kammy took her time (although it was clear she was very busy and people were waiting to see her). \n\nShe's the only one in the salon that does Shellac and she is there on Thurs., Fri, and Sat. So for my downtown working ladies (or men if you're in to that sort of thing) in the house - stop by and see Kammy to get a polish job that will be chip and smudge free for 3 weeks! \n\nMy nails look aaaaawesome! I got the bright pink color - I think it's called tutti fruity! \n\nOh and there was also a cute little girl that helped out after Kammy was essentially finished who put the oil on my cuticles and did the alcohol finishing step to make the nails all glossy.

He has long, gross fingernails with dirt underneath\nHe picks out said dirt WHILE massaging my hands with some oil stuff. he painted my nails and when he was done I looked down in horror. It looked like a child had done it. The bottom was so sloppy I had nail polish on my skin of my fingers and it just looked horribly unprofessional. I had to be somewhere right after my appointment after I said to him that's is not a good job he just grab my hand and pure polish remover on my finger and start screaming in Chinese language. I was in shock. This guy is out of control its definitely something wrong with him. He can't be around people .

The first strike was that when I made an appointment for three people at the same time, they did not let me know that only 2 nail techs were available so me and my friends were not able to have our nails done at the same time (looked like they only had 3 total and one spent his time watching a movie on his iPad while he took care of another customer).  Also a heads up - only 3 pedicure chairs in the place.  The pedicure was the shortest I have ever received, they spent barely any time massaging or rubbing.  The nail tech also sent me to the manicure chair without painting my toe nails and told me she would do them later.  She later had me put my feet in her lap and she painted my toenails in the manicure chair.  During my manicure, the nail tech made two of my fingers bleed while she was trimming my cuticles.  Not only did she not apologize, she lectured me on how I should be taking better care of my cuticles...my nails are in great shape and even if they were not, you just made me bleed!!  Two days later I still have sore fingers.  Very limited color selection. Definitely not worth $40.", "business_id": "oH-N5ONrsWK8jWuq8p653w", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-08-24", "type": "review"}

After a morning at the Aviary, we stopped here for lunch before heading over to the Phipps Conservatory. I'd never tried this place before, so I wanted to stop in. Catherine was hungry--she said she could have eaten cardboard at that moment and it still would have tasted good! \n\nLuckily, she didn't have to go that route and the food here was much better than cardboard! \n\nWe began our lunch by splitting an order of Angry Shrimp. Angry Shrimp is very spicy (as its name implies) and is served over chilled pasta. For my main course, the Apple Raspberry Salad sure was tempting, but my blood sugars were running high (I'm a type-1 diabetic) and I already had my carbs with the pasta. I wanted a burger as a second choice, but their burgers are 1/2 pound and I knew I couldn't finish one. Plus I didn't want to schlep leftovers on the bus. So I opted for a Chicken Cobb Wrap, which was tasty enough. \n\nFor the life of me, I can't remember what Catherine ordered, but she did remark that the food was good. She tried the Penn Pilsner beer, which she loved. I don't drink, but unsweetened brewed ice tea with a little lemon in it really hit the spot. \n\nSo the food here is good as is the service. But there doesn't seem to be anything that distinguishes this place from Chili's, Houlihan's, Mex & Erma's, etc. And I wish they'd offer 1/4 lb burgers. Still, it's a good place to go if you're visiting the nearby Aviary, Science Center, the Warhol, or if you're going to a Steeler's or Pirate's game.", "business_id": "FtjvnLhh51ZBYEpKAARaFQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-08-18", "type": "review"}

Lord, I hope not. The restaurant is located across from PNC Park in just about the least artsy-fartsy neighborhood of Pittsburgh. But I guess Post-Game Drunken Fratboy Hangout doesn't really have a good ring to it.\n\nIs it a nod to Pittsburgh's very own SoHo? Lord, I hope not. The restaurant has far more glam than the rundown neighborhood trapped between Duquesne University and South Oakland. But I guess Depressing Shithole doesn't have a good ring to it, either.\n\nWhatever the story behind its namesake is a moot point upon experiencing the restaurant's fare. Here's what you can expect:\n\n1. Meh food. The SoHo steak and cheese is essentially chopped steak and Cheez Whiz on a bun. It's not particularly delicious. The fries were good, though.\n\n2. Outstanding drinks. Perfectly priced, elegantly presented, and expertly mixed. The Cinnamon Toast Crunch martini is ridiculously delicious. Honest to God, it tastes like a friggin' bowl of the cereal. Except with alcohol.\n\nIf you're in the North Side, go for a cocktail during Happy Hour, but don't schlep out for a special trip or for a memorable meal.

That's because Soho is a kind of \"eh\" place.\n\nI visited for the first time yesterday evening. My boyfriend and I decided to stroll over the bridge to catch some Jazz Live in Katz Plaza (Roger Humphries - really good show) and then headed to North Shore for some grub. Now, I don't find any of the restaurants near PNC to be that good (see my Bettis Grill review) so I knew we weren't going to find anything spectacular. We settled on Soho because I'd never been there before and Atria's doesn't appeal to me.\n\nI did like the open layout on the inside of the restaurant. Looks like a perfect place to catch a game. Finally - a halfway decent TV setup, Pittsburgh! The bar is ginormous and they seemed to have an extensive liquor and beer selection. The draft selection was lacking, but they did have quite a few choices in bottles, if that doesn't bother you. I did not check their wine list, but I know they do have one.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered a chicken stir fry and I got a cheddar burger. My first thought: \"These two things should never be on a menu together.\" He said the stir fry was so-so. Ingredients were spot on, but it was lacking any real flavor. Someone mentioned this place as being a runner for best burger in town - huh?? There are a number of places I would put before Soho's: Winghart's, Burgatory, even Olive Or Twist! My cheeseburger tasted like a frozen Bubba Burger from the grocery store (you know the ones ... ). It wasn't terrible perse, but it wasn't particularly good, either. It was just so-so. The cheddar cheese on it was not very appealing - it tasted like one of those individually wrapped Kraft slices. Onion rings were tasty, but I've rarely, if ever, had bad onion rings.\n\nI would visit this place again if my focus were more so on watching a game and drinking than actually eating. Otherwise I say pass. In fact, skip into town over eating in the north shore at all.", "business_id": "FtjvnLhh51ZBYEpKAARaFQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-06-27", "type": "review"}

I had a buffalo chicken wrap and it was good.  However, someone at our table was charged for extra ketchup... what is that about?!
