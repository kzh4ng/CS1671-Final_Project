There was a full kitchen, king bed and TV. I was just surprised at the lack of amenities at the hotel. While I have stayed at other extended stay hotels, I was surprised to find a sign in the room at this one stating that you only got your room cleaned once per week...if you wanted it more often than that you would have to pay for it. If you needed fresh towels, you'd have to go to the main desk to get them. They also only provided a small bar of soap in the room...not the typical soap, shampoo, lotion, etc. This didn't bother me too much as I was only staying a couple days but again I found it surprising not to have these basic things. \n\nThe hotel in general was easy to get to and very easy to get back onto to freeway from.

The hotel itself is still beautiful and the food is above average.  All solid four stars.  I was a bit disappointed initially with some of the pre-arrangements.  In the past I was able to have a complimentary room and the fee waived for the coat check girl.  Friday night because the party was a bit smaller than the last they only discounted the room and charged full fee for coat check/ carving station/ etc.  Now, with that being said the service was over the top 5+++ stars from start to finish.  I get there and am running a bit late. I ask the bellboy Eric how long for a shoe shine, he states its pretty much an overnight service.  I tell him I'm in a rush.  He runs downstairs and shines them himself, done in 30 minutes.  While I'm waiting my contact for the night Ryan Hunt sends up a cheese dish with a bottle of above average wine.  The party goes off without a hitch, great staff, good food, some discounted wines and good premium open bar.  After the hotel party we are walking outside and run into Eric (bellboy) again ask for directions to other club, instead of giving them to us he walks us to the club.  One of the girls wanted cigarettes and instead of directing her to the store.  He ran down and bought them for her and brought them back.  Btw, did I mention he was done working for the night and just did this off the clock.  The next morning I get a ring around 11 am in the hotel room and its the bellboy bringing up aspirin and bottled water from a long night prior.  Everything about this place is three to four stars.  My main pet peeves are the valet cost ($17 and $25 overnight).  There lack of flexibility in food/bev minimums, but the service is over the top great or at least my contacts were over the top great with service.

These are far from our tastes, but they compensate (in our eyes) by taking good care of what they have. The TVs aren't even old flat screens, but they do stock the rooms thoroughly with l'occitane.\n\nWhere this place really shines is in the staff and the food. I actually find this aspect to be _better_ or even _much_ better than many celebrated big-city five-star properties. When was the last time that the night staff pulled some food from the refrigerator (gratis) after a midnight arrival caused by flight delays?\n\nThey make everything in-house and it is all extraordinary. On this last visit, I indulged in their traditional french toast with a side of eggs. I forgot that this all includes an additional course in advance with fruit (not just big grocery store chucks of melon) and house-made cookies and muffins. On each visit, they mix these up. For this December visit, they did gingerbread cookies (of course). The Chef (Jackie), from NYC, could be gainfully employed high up the hierarchy of any top big-city restaurant.\n\nThere is no elevator, so either pack light if you want a room on the 3rd floor or choose a 1st or 2nd floor room. The 1st floor room has double doors so I didn't find it any noisier than the others.

The driver showed up a few minutes early so I ran back inside to finish brushing my teeth and hustled into the car. \n\nOn the way to the airport I asked to plug my ipod into the cigarette lighter in the hopes that  it would take enough charge to get me through the 1 hour flight to San Diego.  \n\nWell the cab ride was uneventful and pleasant enough, but when I got through the degrading and dehumanizing (not to mention pointless and ineffective) Soviet-style airport \"security\" checkpoint that we all know and love so much,  because we're so goddamn *FREE* in this country, free to be strip searched, bullied, and threatened with arrest anytime we travel, anyway, I was going somewhere with this... \n\n..oh yeah, I realized that I had FORGOT MY FRIGGIN' IPOD IN THE FRONT OF THE CAB.  Dammit.  So I called the cab company and they told me to call back when the driver turned in the cab.  \n\nA few days later I called the lost and found office and lo and behold, the driver had turned in my ipod.  I mentioned that I was out of town for another week and asked if they could hold it.  \n\nSo a few more weeks go by, and I keep putting off going down to the office to pick it up.  When I finally get my ass down to the mesa location, they could not find it!  \"Great\", I thought to myself certain that somebody in the office had yanked it, \"I'll never see it again\"  \n\nI was about to walk out of the office a defeated man, kicking myself for waiting so long to pick it up, thinking it was all my fault.  In my mind cab companies were just a cut above towing companies on the sleaze-o-meter. \n\nThat's when the lady  behind the counter asked me to hold on just another minute.  I was put in touch with Jeff Lunn, the Operations Supervisor, who invited me to his office, where I sat down and gave him some basic information.  \n\nIt was immediately obvious to me that Jeff _actually cared_ about getting my ipod back.  He explained that the office was a secure area with limited access, there was a strict procedure for dealing with lost customer items, and that he has and will fire someone on the spot for taking something that does not belong to them.  I was stoked, and given new  hope.\n\nWell whaddya know, a few days later my ipod resurfaced.  This was almost one month to the day after losing it.  \n\nSo I can't say that I've ridden Discount Cab enough to confidently rate it as a taxi service.

We continued on to our hotel and decided we would check the oil when we got there.  The next day, we called the Enterprise office and told them about the oil light.  The young man checked the records, said it had an oil change two days before.  No worries.  We never did check the oil until we arrived in Flagstaff, 175+ miles since picking it up.  Pulling off the interstate at Flagstaff, the motor began coughing.  We called the Flagstaff office and they brought over another car for us right away.  Were the same kind of friendly easy to work with folks we met in Scottsdale.  \n\nWe turned the second car in at the airport in Las Vegas.  We didn't have the same car as our paperwork, we had no paperwork for the second car.  We were afraid it would either be super easy or super intense once we turned the car in.  The assistant Manager, Nick, greeted us and thanked us, sent us on our way.  The easiest thing ever!", "business_id": "hW0Ne_HTHEAgGF1rAdmR-g", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-01-23", "type": "review"}

The coolest place is La Grande Orange. I was surprised that there was one in there in terminal 4. Good restaurant for food!\n\nThe place is pretty clean too. It's very well kept. They started upgrading the entire place. Now there's LCD boards giving you information on the roadways, recharge stations inside and a sky train that takes you to the light rail station. For free. To ride the light rail is not free. But you can be dropped off at the airport light rail station and take the sky train directly to the main check-in building. \n\nThe airport only keeps getting better. :)", "business_id": "hW0Ne_HTHEAgGF1rAdmR-g", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-12-01", "type": "review"}

Arizona Shuttle is one of the only and most economic options in Arizona for getting from city a to city b if you don't have or don't want to use your car and it does so for a relatively cheap price of $27-$37. Is it the most comfortable and best smelling trip? Nope. \n\nWhile taking a trip to Tucson for Yelp Tucson's very first elite party, I had a ride back but not a ride there so either we would have two cars going back or I could do something like the shuttle. And since I hate driving on the 10 late at night, I opted for the latter. Enter Arizona Shuttle. It just took a couple clicks on the internet to make my reservation and after confirmation, they told me to meet at Sky Harbor Airport at 11:15 and the shuttle would leave at exactly at 11:30. Well, I arrived at 11:15 but did the shuttle leave at 11:30? Nope...more like 11:50. So I rushed to check in at the time they told me, but then I waited around for 40+ minutes before the shuttle left. They offered several different shuttle times too and I chose the 11:30 one because it would get me to Tucson when I need to be there, but since the shuttle was 20 minutes late, it then made me 20 minutes late in arriving to Tucson. When relying on a shuttle service like this, I was hoping they would be on time since I planned my schedule around the shuttle leaving on time. I understand it may take longer to get there with traffic etc, but the shuttle company could have delivered when it came to leaving on time. \n\nThe shuttle ride itself was pretty much what I expected. It's a van full of folks needing a ride. It was a little cramped, a little smelly, the windows didn't open and the drive is long. Weirdly enough, a trailer was hitched to the back and I worried it would detach on the road, but it seemed to work and held our luggage. In addition, as I was exiting the shuttle when I got to Tucson, the girl behind me also exited...with her ferret. Apparently I had been riding the whole way with a ferret behind me. It might have been nice for them to warn the passengers. However, the upside to taking a shuttle to Tucson was that instead of doing the drive myself, I was able to get a lot of work done on my computer (thank you Verizon network card!), so it wasn't a total loss of 2 hours. \n\nSo in summary, taking the Arizona Shuttle would have provided me with the experience I expected, if we didn't get off on the wrong foot when the shuttle was 20 minutes tardy. But, if faced with the situation, I would probably use Arizona Shuttle again and it's a decent option if you need to get to any of the Arizona cities and you'd rather not rent a car and pay much more.", "business_id": "EW-DCLsUbUF-uHA5sm9c8w", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-12-15", "type": "review"}
