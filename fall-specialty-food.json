They also have conventional (non-organic) items that are usually shipped locally and not from across the country. Tons of options from Bok Choy to avocados to seasonal fruits.

There is also a deli counter with fresh pasta salads and side dishes made in store. \n\nI recently started a gluten free diet and this store meets all my needs from bread, buns, cereal, crackers, basically all the common wheat products. I've substituted out a lot of wheat products like flour and instead use rice flour, regular milk for almond milk, things like that.\n\nMy favorite part of the store is there hot foods and salad bar. They make all their dishes in the store and sell them for $8.49lb. The hot dishes are amazingly good. The last time i went i had green beans with red peppers, cajun sweet potato wedges, sauteed mushrooms, curry tofu and purple cabbage. Man was it delicious!!!!

On the other hand, I also expected parking difficulties, even at stores with multi-story garages.\n\nThe Whole Foods Market in Pittsburgh is not much different from those in the DMV area. However, the parking is horrendous! Really, a medium-size private parking lot for the only Whole Foods Market in the Pittsburgh area right along a congested major road? Let me say that Whole Foods Markets in D.C. are also close to major roads, but they at least have underground or aboveground garages and fairly decent road infrastructure to accommodate for the influx and outflux of shoppers. I would love if the Pittsburgh store can build a garage of some sort (I'm not counting the garage next to the Starbucks and Walgreens) with smooth entry and exit so as to prevent a mini-gridlock along Centre Avenue.\n\nParking situation aside, the Pittsburgh store does live up to my expectations established from the DMV stores.

It's hard to justify paying that much when I could make it for 1/5th the price at home.

Yes, the store is small and usually crowded and the majority of the people who shop who here completely unaware they are NOT the only people on the planet. All those things aside, I love Whole Foods. Most of the issues can be handled by slight changes in habit. For instance, park farther away instead of circling the GD parking lot for the closest spot!!! I get so sick of people complaining about that damn parking lot when all you have to do is park by Walgreens and walk. Seriously, the walk won't kill most of us. Stop being lazy. (Sorry, for the tirade; that's a pet peeve of mine). \n\nThe produce is fantastic, always. And not just the organic stuff either. The regular pesticide-laden produce is great. The quality of the meat department is second to none. Now, the bakery is a little 'Eh' for me. The muffins and cookies and cakes always look De-Lish!, but they aren't. Usually to dry or dense or flavorless. It really doesn't matter because the star of the show is...\n\nThe HOT FOODS BAR. The quality and taste of most of the hot foods/prepared foods bar is unbeatable. I lovelvoelove the breakfast bar. My dream weekend starts with waking up and taking a nice long walk, stopping for coffee then heading on to WF to pick up Eggs Rancheros Burritos and Sausage patties from the breakfast bar. I may get creamed by a bus the second I leave, but I will die happy. \n\nSome of my other favorites are a Vegan General Tso's \"chicken\" that has the BEST real chicken texture. It's really good! The mozzarella pasta salad, Sicilian cauliflower and the egg rolls which are seasonal. Don't forget to check out the packaged hot foods across from the salad bar; same stuff but pre-packaged. \n\nAs a note though, the chicken fiesta soup is nooooot good. Bland with a capital B!

I first visited whole foods in February of this year.. In my opinion, it is a little overwhelming at first and here's why. Like most People in the US, I was brought up on all of the \"typical\" mainstream American food brands. So when I walked into this place and barely recognized any brands, it was slightly overwhelming. It took a little research and I still do some research on some products before making a trip. I recommend going online and checking their coupons before making a trip - I tried a bunch of new products that way. I have also googled \"best snacks at whole foods\" to get some more ideas of what to try. \n\nNow here's the sucky part- overall, whole foods is pretty overpriced. BUT I will say that it is not ENTIRELY their fault. They sell higher quality products than your average grocery store. Mostly all of their products are made with the best ingredients and are often organic and gmo free. They are vegan and vegetarian friendly and have tons of options for people with allergies. If companies are spending more money on better ingredients , they are going to have to sell their products for a higher price. \n\nHaving said that, tazo tea for $4 a box is not a sale. I went a couple weeks ago and saw the sale price advertised, did a quick google search and realized target sells their tazo tea for $3.50 NOT on sale. Needless to say I took the trip down the street and saved myself some money for the tea. I also recently wanted to purchase kale chips that I heard so much about (brand is called brad's raw and the flavor was vampire killer)... Until I realized they were $9 for 2 oz ! You can get fresh kale for less than half the cost! \n\nAlthough whole foods can be expensive they aren't ALWAYS that bad. My favorite yogurt, wallaby organic yogurt, is sold here. On a normal day, it cost $1 each. A couple days ago, they were 89 cents each- not bad for organic yogurt. They also have an amazing selection of uniquely flavored chocolates and they are pretty reasonably priced. Justin's organic peanut butter cups are incredible! \n\nThe customer service has  always been awesome in this particular location. I hear that whole foods is very willing to take back anything that you don't enjoy , as long as you have your receipt. \n\nas other yelpers have said- the parking sucks in this location, it's a nightmare.

I love the produce selection, the cheeses, and the meats. The hot bar is lovely and the bakery pretty good. When I moved to Pittsburgh, I was elated to finally have a Whole Foods I could shop at! \n\nBut the experience is just... unpleasant. Humans in BMW's/Audi's/beat up subarus have turned into vultures, circling... waiting... for the next spot to open up in the impossibly tiny lot. There are no words to describe the anguish of being stuck behind one of these vultures stalking a shopper with a full grocery cart, only to see a spot just ahead, that someone else pounces on while you helplessly look on. It sounds trivial and I get that this is a city, but is this what one really wants to deal with as they are trying to run errands on their day off when there are other, less stressful options near by? \n\nAnd, you know, I think the trauma of trying to find a parking spot remains with the shoppers long after parking their car because people the atmosphere is kind of stressful inside as well. The jockeying for the shortest line in the check out, the pushing people out of the way for the last organic horseradish root... it's about the same as any other urban grocery store but after the parking! Knowing the dangerous gauntlet I must run to get back to my car with my groceries! The prices! It's just not worth it. \n\nAnd I'd be willing to forgive all of this if it were an above average Whole Foods, but it's not. This brings me, at last, to the turkey. I called ahead in late October TWICE to make sure the turkey I ordered would be fresh for Thanksgiving. It was supposed to be fresh. It was labelled fresh. But it was frozen. If I'm going to pay 60 bucks for a bird, it really should come as labeled and advertised. I don't need the stress of hoping my bird will thaw before the big day (spoiler alert... it won't). Especially not after the parking lot.\n\nEDIT: Well, customer service was awesome and they refunded my frozen turkey. I amend to 3*... thanks customer service!", "business_id": "wfCLz9-aeShbPB7CaTY-qQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-11-23", "type": "review"}

I thoroughly enjoyed the gyros and even used some of the meat to make Greek omelettes (with some feta and spinach).  \n\nI've never been disappointed by this place.  I was once in another Strip District store looking for Greek inspired seasoning and found it, but skipped it because it was so expensive.  Fast forward to Stamoolis Bros where I find packets of seasoning for just a couple bucks.  In fact, with each new visit I discover something I haven't noticed before.

When one of the deli guys was free and asked me if I needed help, I flat out told him \"I know nothing about anything in this room.  But I want to learn.\"  And he was like \"I got just what you need\" and brought out some samples for me.  He went on to explain them to me and what kind of cheeses to pair with stuff.  After I picked out my meat, I was heading over to the cheese counter when he kinda called me out and was like \"I'm not done with you yet!\" and handed me butcher paper with even more cured meats and cheeses to try out.  He also told me I have to feed my friend more b/c she looked too skinny, =P.\n\nI love going into a store where I get individualized attention by someone who actually cares about what he or she is doing and is passionate about his or her job.

It was short & sweet, but perhaps too short.  I want to emphasize how much I really, really, really love this place.  Every time I get stuck going to Giant Ripoff Market District, I realize how much those rat bastards overcharge for everything.  Penn Mac is so damned cheap for cheese, I can see why people come from all over the place to get it here. FYI...my favorite new cheese is Fleur Vert...it's seasonal, but a game changer of a goat cheese.  I paid $14.49/lb for it.  Giant Ripoff wanted $22.99.  Jerks.  Also, make sure to buy ricotta here...it's freshly made!  Be forewarned...you have to buy your cheeses in 1/2 lb increments.  They like me, so when I ask for a small 1/2lb, I can sometimes get lucky.  \n\nSeriously, go here for cheese, fancy meats (they have frickin' Iberian jamon...good luck finding that elsewhere) and random Italian things.  I wouldn't say the prices on everything else is as cheap as the cheese counter, but I heart it here and am sad that they're not open during normal working people hours(i.e. after 5pm on weekdays.)", "business_id": "niW0ggRVPW5fafcfImdK7w", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-09-06", "type": "review"}

I used to do a lot of my weekly shopping here, but now that I live in the North Hills I've got that can't-cross-the-river syndrome and I only get there every other week or so. It's miles above a Market District, though, in terms of entertainment value and pricing.\n\nThe cheese counter is pretty good. It's not the most amazing selection ever, but it's great for Pittsburgh. For example, they don't carry a variety of aged cheddars or Stiltons, opting instead to offer one or two basic and many flavored versions (with apples, with onions, etc.) They do let you sample, which I recommend; like another reviewer, I've gotten over-old blue cheese here once or twice. They've always enforced the half-pound minimum for me. The fresh mozzarella is great, and I can't resist it when tomatoes are in season. I hate to even mention it, but one time I got home and found... well, a hair in my mozzarella. It put me off for a few weeks but seems to have been a one-time incident (and no, I never brought it up to them).\n\nThe deli has fantastic prices and does proper thin slices, nicely laid out on paper sheets so it doesn't stick together. Daniele prosciutto is amazing, and the domestic is pretty good at a great price. Iberico and Serrano jamon? Yes please.\n\nService at both the cheese and deli counters can take a pretty long time if you go on a weekend. However, I've been able to walk right up on weekday afternoons, and the weekend logjam is kind of fun once in a while.\n\nIn the same room they have the amazing olive bar. I pretty much only buy olives in the Strip. I know the Iggle has an olive bar, but everything I've ever bought from one tastes off in a way I can't put my finger on. Castleventrano olives (a bright, clear light green) are amazing: buttery and briny and fruity with a firm texture. Cerignola are good, and the various stuffed olives on offer are nice if you don't feel like dealing with pits.\n\nI haven't really bought many of their bulk goods aside from Jordan almonds, to which I am shamelessly addicted. They have a variety of pretty colors, as well as the \"seconds\" which aren't as shiny but taste great anyway.\n\nI love the selection of anchovies, tuna and tomato products in the dry goods area. They also have a good variety of hot sauces, though I can't say I've ever seen Pickapeppa there. Full range (I think) of Dave's Insanity, and lots of other brands as well. Important: They do sell Blennd concentrate, which you can also pick up at the Iggle. I have fond childhood memories of drinking Blennd at the KMart cafeteria growing up. I introduced my Michigan-born husband to it and he never visits Pittsburgh without getting Blennd at least once. (You can also get it premixed and cold at Wholey's, FYI.)\n\nIn the next room you'll find baccala (yum), pour-your-own olive oils at a reasonable price (not a huge selection, but the Spanish is fruity and a good everyday sort of thing at $4.99/12oz). I pretty much never buy bread here, opting to hit up the double rustic baguettes at Mancini's instead. The anise love knot cookies are great.\n\nThe last room has produce, normally at a good price but not the best selection. They do have fresh figs in season, thank God. I have to admit I've never tried the fresh pasta, since that's one of those things I just make at home. I should probably remedy that so I can offer an opinion on it. They sometimes have refrigerated and ready-to-go San Pelligrino Chinotto, a bitter soda that comes in a pretty bottle you can use as a small vase afterwards.\n\nCheckout is straightforward and efficient, but you will be in line for a while if you go on a weekend. It's nuts, just like everywhere else in the Strip. If you can, visit all the shops both on a weekday and on a weekend to enjoy two totally different experiences.\n\nThey do have a small parking area behind the store on Liberty, with which I wish you good luck on a Saturday. Otherwise it's street parking, but there's a ton of that, and walking past and through the other shops in the Strip is so much fun it shouldn't matter anyway.", "business_id": "niW0ggRVPW5fafcfImdK7w", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-09-13", "type": "review"}

Browsing through the aisles takes me back to the vacation I took to Italy, where I consumed entire pizzas by myself.    \n\nIn the back, Penn Mac has a lovely selection of fresh Bread Works bread and other local vendors. The produce section is adequate, which does the trick--because who is going to Penn Mac to buy lettuce? Shame on you, eat some prosciutto instead. \n\nWhen I get to check out, I'm always stunned by how much I didn't spend! Since it's wholesale, you get quite a bang for your buck, so don't hesitate to grab a few extra treats.", "business_id": "niW0ggRVPW5fafcfImdK7w", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-11-10", "type": "review"}

I love cheese as much at the next guy, but M is seriously addicted to the stuff. It blows my mind how much cheese he eats!  So obviously Mousehouse is his Disney World, and on our way back from Hayward, we of course had to stop here to stock up.  And by stocking up, I mean that we filled a cooler with a variety of cheeses you can't find in your local store. And I will admit that this wasn't the first time we filled a cooler with cheese.\n\nThe inside is a decent size, but it fills up fast so it doesn't take long for claustrophobia to kick in. They let you sample any cheese you'd like before purchasing, which is freakin' awesome! \n\nThe employees are friendly and helpful, which is always appreciated when you're getting elbowed and stepped on by other cheese addicts scrambling to get their fix with a sample slice. A little bit of cheer can (sort of) help you forget about your toes getting smashed.\n\nThey also carry quite a selection of craft beers, and of course fudge, knick knacks, and other Wisconsin-y items. So if you forgot to grab a souvenir elsewhere, you can pick up some postcards, shot glasses, and the like. If you're hungry for more than cheese samples, they do make sandwiches or offer pre-made ones.\n\nSo, we ended up buying ten different kinds of cheese, and with the fancy schmancy check-in offer, I saved 10%.  \n\nChicken soup is one of our favorites; it tastes exactly like the soup.  The Ghost Pepper cheese was fabulously spicy as anticipated. I didn't really care for the Taco Cheese, Raspberry Chipotle Cheddar or Pizza cheese; the flavors weren't what I expected. \n\nTomato & Basil Cheddar, Buffalo Wing, Salami Colby, Cheddar with Bleu Cheese, Green and Black Olive, Horseradish and Chive, and Beer Cheddar were our favorites this time around. The curds are delicious but you can find them anywhere in Wisconsin. The Whips were interesting; it was our first time trying them but we didn't purchase any.\n\nWe once drove here just for cheese. Seriously. We weren't on our way up north or had other plans. We literally drove from Naperville to Windsor just to get cheese for M. \nHis mother commented on our freezer, stating that we could build a \"cheese-gloo\" out of all the bricks of cheese. I laughed at the thought, and without missing a beat, M said \"No, that wouldn't work. I would eat myself out of house and home.\"  And I wouldn't doubt that for a second.", "business_id": "jpxlSFhdrtbNyxS6vB036A", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-09-06", "type": "review"}

It's not everyday that I find a restaurant that I absolutely want to be a regular at, but La Tolteca is a restaurant that I can see myself having a healthy relationship with, and, if I'm lucky, possibly growing old with. I'm all for market-style restaurants, and La Tolteca seriously nailed it!\n\nOkay, now that that's out of my system, here's what I tried: I tried the chips and salsas, huevos rancheros and the chilaquiles. The chips were fresh as can be (still warm in the bag), and the salsas...oh the salsas...they were all great, but the stand out had to be the habanero. It was definitely one of the best salsas I've ever had, and my girlfriend considered it the best she had ever had. That's not to be taken lightly because we eat salsa almost religiously. Because my girlfriend got the chilaquiles, I went with the huevos rancheros. They were piping fresh and everything one would expect. The second I cut open the yolk of the egg and saw the yellow and red run together, I knew I was in for a treat. The flavors of that mixed with beans and a little rice were really great! For those of you that have had good huevos rancheros before you'll know what to expect. Alright, and lastly the chilaquiles. In all seriousness, these were the best, and I mean the BEST chilaquiles I've ever had! I'm not sure exactly what was going on in the kitchen, but I suspect a tiny sprinkling of crack right before it was served to us, but that may have just been the garlic. Either way though, it was phenomenal! Every single bite made me so happy, and even after everyone was full at the table, we still managed to pick away at it until it was completely consumed.\n\nEvery person reading this needs to do themselves a favor and endure the trip to Central Phoenix for this place.

What's even cooler, though, is buying the dough and make your own special pizza, which I did. The crust turned out great!\n\n* * *\n\nHere is where I'll find my new favorite bread, AJ's brand.

From cheeses to nuts to produce and wine, you'll find what you need here. If you have any trouble, just ask. The people working here are really quite friendly. I actually enjoy going to a grocery store - GASP - so I can tell you that this place far outshines other retailers. Of course, it far outprices them, too. But, if it's a special affair or you just don't care, then this AJ's is for you. \n\nI love how it's in walking distance too, situated in an easy-access plaza that offers other interesting treats, too, like Booster Juice and Sweet Tomatoes. \n\nOh, did I mention this place has a great beer selection? You can buy the 6-pack, sure, but for those nights when you're uncertain of what you're craving, you have the option of buying a single beer - mix and match, if you will - and not choking on the cost. Single beers here are cheaper than what you'll find at the bar. Granted, although it comes chilled, you can't open it on the spot. Wouldn't it be great if you could? (Beer tasting, anyone?!)\n\nIf you're not fond of beer (my god, what's the matter with you?), then peruse the liquor or wine selection. You can even find Mexican tequila that isn't your typical Jose.

They even have small boxes of Hawaiian Host \"Peppermint Macnut Crunch\" in their Christmas display right now!\n\nThe store is going to get an expansion and remodel soon to compliment the remodeled Uptown Plaza too!", "business_id": "Mng1FUcW-xRSdsDkowQm2Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-11-06", "type": "review"}

The Walnut Square - Available in both a truffle and a candy bar, this dark chocolate coated chunk of heaven (butter caramel and English walnuts) haunts my reverie 2-3 times a week. The only problem with the bar is that you have to bite into it, meaning there are opportune moments to drool while eating. Embarrassing? Yes. Worth it? Yes.\n2. Key Lime Truffle - A totally unique, decadent delight, this creamy cube of white chocolate houses a key lime cream flavored center. It's tangy, sweet, and addictive.\n3. Kona Mocha - The perfect blend of texture and flavor, toasted coconut and white chocolate surround a coffee and milk chocolate truffle. If there was a coffee that tasted like this, my mornings would rock.\n4. Almond Truffle - Somewhat reminiscent of an inside-out sushi roll, the roasted almonds coat the outside, followed by white chocolate, and finally smooth milk chocolate in the center. They don't really look like truffles, which makes it easy to eat, oh, say, 10 of them at a time.\n5. Chelsea - The ultimate classy truffle, pecans and chocolate liquor surrounded by milk chocolate create a mini-explosion of awesome on your taste buds. \n6. Scotchmallow - Available in a bar and a truffle, a layer of marshmallow and flavorful caramel are enveloped in dark chocolate. If I could put this between graham crackers I'd be a) in s'mores heaven, and b) a total glutton.\n7. Dark Almonds - Technically this is just a dark almond cluster, but I'll be damned if it's not the best almond cluster I've ever had. \n8. Dark Chocolate Truffle - A pure, smooth chocolate with a bit of texture, this semisweet chocolate truffle and chocolate liquor center is topped with nut crunch. It's simple, but perfect.\n9/10. Mocha/Bordeaux - Both of these truffles are covered in chocolate sprinkles, which I usually hate, but for some reason, they taste amazing. The Bordeaux is a pure chocolate flavor with a hint of brown sugar, and the Mocha is chocolate-coffee (obviously) available in both milk and dark flavors.\n\nTraveling back through my childhood by writing about these exceptional chocolates has made me realize something: these are some of the best truffles I've ever had, local or not. The price is fair (maybe too fair), the quality is evident, and the selection is grand. In fact, I'd pick these over $4.00 French truffles at a shmancy-pants chocolatier any day.", "business_id": "ezM-93i6eNb4LnYp3J101Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-11-14", "type": "review"}

Lucky for me, this stuff tastes just like home to me. I can hardly drive by without stopping in for at the very least, a cup of macaroni salad.

Everyone knows exactly what to expect here, I'm not going to whine about high prices. The prepared foods area at this WF is much more restrained than at any other WF I've been to, which is sad because I used to love ogling the selections at my Boston shop. I think this location has a somewhat small but interesting wine selection but my real purpose for this review is to talk about the cheese shop. \n\nArizonans have absolutely no cheese culture. Sorry. I love AZ and I'm glad I live here, but when I think about exotic cheese I don't think 'gruyere'. Cheese selection is the only way in which Arizona has failed me, until I met Laura, my Whole Foods Cheese Monger (not Lara of Petit Fromage).  After truly depressing excursions to AJs (their cheese is a JOKE and they should be embarrassed), then Trader Joe's and Safeway I called over to Whole Foods and connected with Laura. I asked her about certain cheeses I was looking for and we agreed to meet that evening to find unique options for a wine tasting I was hosting. \n\n Laura explained that in the heat of the summer her cheese selection is rather sparse and that it would be picking back up in the fall. The cheese area is one of the smaller that I've seen, but there are some fun options beyond a simple Parrano or Gorgonzola Dolce. I saw some of my old favs like Taleggio, Explorateur, and Humboldt Fog and Laura introduced me to a few new friends, like Hirtenkase, the delightful german cheese that is made from some of the most pampered cows in the world! I decided on a refreshing chevre called Fleur Vert from California, Mimolette and Chaubier, though Laura very generously let me taste through a horde of options to find the right cheese and wine pairings. \n\nI really look forward to checking back in with her to see what new treats are in. I hope I can use her expertise for more wine events and I encourage you, nay, I insist you step away from that enormous Costco Manchego and talk to the Whole Foods Cheese staff about your exotic dairy needs.

I'm also lazy and prefer one-stop shopping.  After reading some positive information on their website (and hoping it's at least partially true), I headed to Whole Foods to check out their offerings.\n\nFirst off, their seafood selection was really incredible.  Since I wasn't going to be able to cook it in the next few days, I settled on some frozen salmon filets certified by the Marine Stewardship Council.  That means they can charge $7 for an 8-oz filet.  Off to the meat counter.  I purchased flank steak for $15/lb.  First off, I would like to know why flank steak is ever more than free.  It's a crappy cut of meat in my opinion, but works well for slow cooking.  I also purchased stew meat for $9/lb.  Stew meat!  Another crappy cut of meat.  Needless to say, I did not buy steaks at WFM.  What about pork?  Again, ridiculous prices for chops.  Chicken?  I did find prepackaged chicken for $4.99/lb.  \n\nI did not bother checking out their organic produce since I'm more than happy to consume pesticides like my forefathers.  And wasn't there a big stink lately about some of the frozen produce at WFM labeled \"organic\" actually coming from China? A variety of other items also made their way into my cart totaling $188 for very little.  Needless to say, WFM will not be a grocery store I frequent regularly, but with their pretty amazing selection of seafood, prepared foods, cheese, locally made breads, I will be back occasionally.  I'm a fan of the store, just not their prices.\n\nAs for beef, I found a ranch in Arizona that makes monthly deliveries to the Valley and charges half of WFM without the middle man.

Wednesdays are special produce days, which means that tons of different produce items are on special for 3 pounds for $.99. Yes, my friends. $.99. \n\nI had seen the special pricing advertised on the flyers we get every now and then, but had been hesitant to make a special trip there in case the produce was bad-quality or ran out after, say, 10 am. Well, I went today around 1 pm, and I can tell you that the produce is neither bad-quality or gone after 10 am. There were tons of the special advertised items, and 90% looked super-fresh. \n\nI left with 2-3 pounds of bananas, tomatoes, peaches, key limes, and avocados, all of which cost me a mere $5.62. And just think - just yesterday, I spent $2 for 3 tomatoes at Whole Foods. I'll definitely be back at least every other Wednesday to snag some of these special deals.", "business_id": "iyjEqYqSk-mAya95A9hW8w", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-09-17", "type": "review"}

The price is fantastic for a customized cake for kids.  The selection is incredible!\n2) If you are familiar with the Mexican baked goods - this place is a one stop shop!  For for a nice change from traditional french bread, try a \"bolillo\" (a Mexican roll).\n3)  Rotisserie Chicken.  \n\nBut ....just so you know...the produce is great and less costly than Frys.\n\nTwo warnings .  First it's difficult to get in and out of the Ranch Market on S. Central on the weekends -- it's VERY VERY CROWDED!  Second, this is an \"ethnic\" experience.   My husband, a \"gringo,\" has, on occasion, encountered some language barrier challenges, but has always been successful in navigating it. - so don't let it stop you!\n\nThe Ranch Market is always on the tour for out-of-town-guests who visit us from the East Coast.
