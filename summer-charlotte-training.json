The shower pressure was adequate, but there is no place in the shower to put your shampoo, soap, washcloth, etc.  That's just dumb.  Toilet paper sconce is behind you and a pain to reach.  An overall bad layout, design, and decor in the bathroom.\n\nThe room is very dark with just some dim lamps scattered around the room.  There is a desk, but its shape makes it painful to sit at (there was a wooden part jabbing into my legs) and you have to unplug something if you want to plug in a computer, a short sighted setup on their part.  Because I was here for work I was too busy to eat their breakfast or spend any time at the bar, but I did need to get some stuff done in the room and the above features made that difficult and unpleasant.  \n\nAlso, you have to park in a public lot behind the hotel and get your ticket validated by the staff to not pay there, but you still pay Dunhill $12 per day for the parking.  Not convenient, and one time I forgot to get the thing validated and therefore ended up paying more than just paying the garage itself.  Bad system there too.\n\nBut overall the bed was comfortable and the room was quiet and getting around is easy.

All the wines are on a tablet, which was really neat cause you could easily scroll through the bottles and filter. We ended up settling on a Zin/Shiraz blend. It was absolutely delish....I wish I got the name of it!\n\nSince we were dining for restaurant week ($35 per person), the menu was limited. However, I would love to return cause I heard their lobster mac was fantastic! I decided on the clam chowder, 8oz filet mignon, and chocolate flourless espresso cake. My husband picked the wedge salad, ribeye (i think it was crazy big like 14 oz) and chocolate flourless cake. \n\nUnfortunately, the clam chowder wasn't anything special. I have a huge love for chowders and this one simply didnt do anythign for me. I took a bite of my husbands salad and it was very good. Our steaks came out next. They were cooked absolutely perfectly! The filet mignon literally melted in my mouth. My husbands steak was seasoned so well. This is definitely where Capital Grille shined! The shared potatoes that came with it were perfect. Additionally, the meal came with shared green beans. I thought the green beans weren't cooked enough, but that is just a personal preference. The taste was excellent though. Lastly, the desserts. Oh my gosh, rasberries, cream, and the fudge like cake. Perfection. That dessert was spot on!\n\nThere was one small incident that I wasn't super thrilled with how it was handled. The waiter brought over our steaks and sides. In the few seconds it took me to grab my fork and knife and almost cut into my steak, my husband (and at the same time, the waiter) realized he brought over the wrong steaks. Like, our entire order was for a different table. Literally, not a big deal at all. Misstakes happen. However, without even an apology he grabbed all the plates, including the veggie sides (that come with all restaurant week meals!) and cleared our table. It was just awkward cause he made something that wasnt a big deal into a scene. Our neighbors sitting beside us literally leaned over and said they couldnt believe he did that and took the sides off the table too. Additionally, I would never complain about this, but the new steak I got was definitely not as nice looking or as large of a cut (not that it completely mattered cause I didnt even eat all my steak anyways) as the one that was accidentally served to me.

It's a hell of a lot cheaper than a pool membership in town.

Really liked my primary a lot.  That said, I have noticed that last year or so, they over-bill folks.  I went in for my checkup- the doctor spoke to me about high blood pressure.  No prescriptions were written, nothing outside of a BP test was done, yet they split-coded it as a separate visit/discussion than my annual.  $150.  I thought the purpose of my annual was to talk about stuff like that.  This practice and the associated hospital are there to make a $.  No customer service.  When I went in to discuss, I heard another patient checking in.  This time the attendant let them know anything out of basics annual check up routine, anything else discussed will be billed separately.  Clearly other folks complained and now they CYA at check-in.  I decided to get a copy of my records and find another practice.  2-months later, I get a $30 bill to photocopy my records.  To photocopy people.
