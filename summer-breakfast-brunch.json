Lots of it and dirt cheap.  I sat at a vacant stool behind the formica counter and ordered the mixed grill.  Potatoes, eggs, sausage, bacon and Italian toast.  A giant mound of food guaranteed to sooth any hangover.  I swear the full mixed grill had two pounds of food.  Neat thing is that the grill is right in front of you so you can see your potatoes and eggs frying in a pool of fresh grease.  All that food, plus coffee and tip for around ten bucks.

Getting its name from the bedroom community it's located in, Dormont, it benefits from a charming mini-downtown area immediately around it, as well as lots of brick houses, although some have seenbetter days. \n\nDor-Stop is diner chic through and through, serving the breakfast and lunch crowds only. Nic nacs and local sports teams' placards adorn the walls, as well as a proudly displayed signed poster from Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives after that show's stop here. A mix of booths, tables and a few counter seats could cram several dozen people in.\n\nYou don't have to do any research about what's popular here, just take a look at a good chunk of the menu or what the person next to you is eating: the hotcakes. With a dozen options, there's a lot of choice and they're all tempting. I settled on the apple walnut hot cakes with sausage on the side. We didn't have to wait long but it felt like a while hungrily watching all the delicious looking food come out of the open kitchen or sitting in the window.\n\nOnce in front of me, I was staring at three thick hot cakes with apples chunks and walnuts cooked into them and topped with icing sugar, along with two sausage rounds. The hot cakes were utterly fantastic, with a pleasing denseness but with just enough air in them to keep them from being chewy, The apples were cooked perfectly, soft but not mushy, and along with the walnuts added some texture. I was initially disappointed that the sausage came in round form instead of links as they tend to be drier, but these were nicely browned and still juicy, albeit a bit too greasy. \n\nMy girlfriend went for the lunch time food, getting the Chick 'O' Philly hoagie  which came with sliced chicken breast, sauteed mushrooms, onions and green peppers, tomato lettuce and Swiss cheese. It was a winning combination of ingredients and the thick bun made for a even heftier sandwich, and as a good sandwich should be it was greater than the sum of its parts. The fries it came with were a solid entry - lightly browned, thick cut but still nice and crispy. \n\nOn a return trip, I went with the plain hot cakes and they were just as good as the apple walnut ones, a sign of great fundamentals when you're doing something as seemingly basic as a hot cake. Kudos. \n\nService was friendly and attentive, with a ton of coffee top ups. You'll be challenged to get past half empty in your cup at any point in the meal.\n\nDor-Stop seemed like just a convenient spot to fuel up for a day of tourism but turned out to be a damned good spot with memories of its own: the best pancakes I've ever had.", "business_id": "2Igiyhi82R8_QaaPplRmCw", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-07-04", "type": "review"}

I'd never been to Dormont before and we were eager to check out this place and the neighborhood in general (side bar: Dormont is adorable! If it were a bit more convenient to where we work and like to play, I would totally live there). \n\nAnyhow, so we get there on a Saturday morning, and the place is packed. No biggie, most good breakfast spots usually have a wait on a weekend morning. I think we waited about 30 mins, which wasn't bad. We're seated, we order, everything is just peachy. Then things started to go sour.\n\nIt had been about 40 minutes since we were seated and we still hadn't received our food. Other diners who were seated after us had received their food and were finishing up. Our waitress hadn't stopped by our table in a long time. I had started to wonder if maybe our ticket was lost (ordinarily I wouldn't think anything of it, but the fact that people seated after us had gotten their food made me think something might have been wrong). Anyway, so the next time we see our waitress walk by, we flag her down and ask her if she knew when our food would be out. We asked politely. We weren't snarky, we weren't mean, we didn't roll our eyes or snap our fingers. It was a simple question, one that I think many would probably ask. And the waitress replied, \"Are you really hungry or just really impatient?\" No hint of a smile on her face. No twinkle in her eyes. It was clear that she wasn't joking (not that it would have been funny anyway). \n\nHmm. Are we really hungry or really impatient? Well, neither...we just wanted to make sure our ticket hadn't gotten lost. We sat in stunned silence, unsure of how we should respond to such a flat-out rude remark. The waitress left, and finally brought our food out about 10 minutes later (and then we never saw her again except for when she dropped off the check). By that point, our appetites were pretty much gone, and we just wanted to leave. So we scarfed down our food and got the heck out of dodge.\n\nI dunno. Maybe the waitress was having a bad day. Maybe she gets asked that question a lot (by actual impatient people) and is sick of hearing it. But we were very polite to her and didn't deserve to be treated like that. I don't care how good your food is (and for the record, the food was okay, but certainly not mind blowing for the all the hype), if you have lousy customer service, I can't support you. And it's a shame, because I really, really wanted to like this place (it looks like such a cute mom and pop place). With so many other great breakfast spots in the Burgh, I'd rather go somewhere that cares about giving their customers a good (or at least not a blatantly bad) experience.", "business_id": "2Igiyhi82R8_QaaPplRmCw", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-07-31", "type": "review"}

I was a party of one and there was a small table available. I decided to try the chocolate chip & banana pancakes, they were very tasty, but got a bit mushy in the center, they weren't undercooked they were just loaded with bananas. I had a side of bacon to complete breakfast and freshly brewed iced tea to wash it all down. \nService wasn't bad but could have been better, my server never stopped by after my food was served and i had to request my check from a different server. \nGood breakfast, I recommend giving them a try", "business_id": "2Igiyhi82R8_QaaPplRmCw", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-06-29", "type": "review"}

The place is small and very crowded. Food is all homemade from scratch. My girlfriend opted for breakfast so she settled for a veggie omelet with toast and I chose a turkey Rachel. The sandwich came on marble bread and was filled with sauerkraut an cheese. It also came with potato pancakes.

The reviews looked good, why not give BSS a try. Baby in tow, I walked over in the heat and called a friend to meet me there. When I walked into BSS, I froze in terror. How is it possible that all of the reviews do not mention that this place looks like it hasn't been cleaned since it opened. Yikes. The floors were a mess, the chair cushions were torn and the staff don't seem to even notice nor do the customers. That may have something to do with the food but more on that later. I was pleasantly greeted by an older woman, Ma Roz I assume. She sent someone in the back to dig out a highchair and specifically asked him to clean it. Well, it came out about half clean with some hairs on it. Nothing wet ones couldn't handle. My friend arrived shorty and she was just as shocked as I was. Well, I was committed at this point so we were going to give it a try. We both decided on breakfast. I ordered the pancakes with a side of bacon. There are some interesting pancake mix ins to note such as marshmallow, thin mints and chocolate chip cookies. I decided to go with peaches and blueberries. It didn't take long for our food to arrive. My pancakes looked incredible though they were missing one thing, whipped cream. Not a problem, they easily remedied that situation. I took my first bite and ta da! The light bulb went on. I suddenly understood why locals would keep coming back to this place despite the decor- if you want to call it that. They quite possibly could have been the best pancakes I have ever eaten. The fruit was fresh. That's right, FRESH peaches. Not canned stuff like you might assume for a small establishment such as this. The bacon was also cooked to perfection. They definitely know how to do it right here. And the prices were very reasonable. $4.50 for 3 pancakes, or should I say heaven cakes, and only $.50 a mix in.  I think they may only accept cash here so, you may want to head to the ATM first. Although, I was shocked and quite honestly, taken aback by the decor of BSS, I was also blown away by the quality of the food. If they sunk a little money into cleaning, fixing the uneven floor and replacing the chair cushions this place would be top notch and easily deserve 5 stars.", "business_id": "o_wRqOpli9kyZGXlJtLLdA", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-07-17", "type": "review"}

I'd passed the Bloomfield Sandwich Shop countless times on my bike, and had often wondered about the food and the clientele.  When a friend cancelled alternate brunch plans with my on Fri., but I was still craving breakfast food, the idea occurred to me to finally check this place out.  I'm very glad that I finally did, given the sandwich shop provided me with one of the most memorable brunches I've had in PGH.\n\nThis place is the definition of a hole-in-the-wall--it's very small inside, so expect to get cozy with the owners and other customers during your visit.  In true diner style, CM and I opted to sit at the counter.  Indeed, space was at such a premium that at a couple points, one of the owners placed dirty plates on the counter a bit closer than I'd like for a minute or two before proceeding to clean them.  As for the decor, the best way to describe it is flower child kitsch, with a dash of sports (indeed, surprisingly, the paper placemats contained sports trivia).  You really do feel as though you're in the owners' kitchen when you're here.  CM described it as organized chaos, which I thought was quite apt.\n\nAs for the food, as far as I can tell, the sandwich shop offers the most inexpensive breakfast in PGH (aside from McD's, etc.)--everything on the menu is $5 or less, and the portions are generous.  Despite this, as others have mentioned, the quality of the food is quite good--on par with, if not better than, Pamela's, and leaps and bounds above EnP.  CM ordered a hobo cake, a breakfast sandwich consisting of eggs and cheese between two pancakes ($4.50), with bacon (+ $1.25), and I ordered the short stack of pancakes ($4.25) with Nutter Butter cookies and chocolate chips (+ $1.00).  Both entrees were delicious, and very satisfying, not to mention filling.  (In fact, CM fell into a carb coma shortly after going back to his place.)\n\nAlthough the food and prices are great, what really makes eating at the sandwich shop a real experience is the owners, Mike and Mama Ros.  Mike, who waited on us, has a great sense of humor, joking with us and making us feel like family from the time we walked in the door to the time we left--and even afterward (he greeted us again when he and Mama Ros were taking a break at the outside tables as we walked past on our way back to the car after taking a short walk).  From talking to him, we learned that he and Mama Ros have run the sandwich shop for 15 years (impressive!), and that he lived in San Jose, CA prior to moving to PGH.  We didn't get to talk to Mama Ros much, because she was working the grill at the time we were there and it was quite busy, but they both seem like great people.\n\nNeedless to say, we had an awesome first experience at the Bloomfield Sandwich Shop, and look forward to returning for more.  While I'm tempted to award 5 stars, there were a few minor shortcomings on the food front (use of boxed pancake mix, lack of maple syrup), and the chaotic atmosphere may not be for everyone.  Having said that, if you're looking for cheap and plentiful portions of basic diner fare done well served up by friendly owners, check out this neighborhood institution--it won't let you down!  4.5 stars.", "business_id": "o_wRqOpli9kyZGXlJtLLdA", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-07-05", "type": "review"}

Since 1980, Pamela's has been voted \"Best Breakfast\" by Pittsburgh's City Paper survey.  Not to mention the diner's modest flare received the White House's \"Presidential approval.\"  \n\nIn the fall, while President Obama was on the campaign trail, he ate breakfast at Pamela's.  He loved the crepe-style pancakes so much, he asked Klingensmith and Cohen to prepare a Memorial Day breakfast at the White House for him and dozens of American troops!  Now, that's a good pancake!\n\nI've sampled just about everything on the breakfast menu and, after eight years of patronage, my favorite is still the strawberry hotcakes.  These thinly poured crepes are laid flat, then rolled around a delicious combination of strawberries, brown sugar and sour cream, topped off with a nice dab of whipped cream to truly send your sugar levels through the roof.  They're simple, delicious and just enough not to feel \"stuffed.\"\n\nThe egg and omelet plates come with home fries (chunky sliced potatoes with what appears to be approximately 1/4 small white onion and a 1/2 lb of butter per serving) and your choice of toast.   The spinach and feta omelet with rye is a decent combination.  But as a warning, these plates are not for the weak.  \n\nFor smaller appetites, they do offer fresh fruit bowls, egg white plates and a variety of a la carte items.  \n\nThe space is typical of older Walnut Street buildings with typical diner flare - simple painted brick with tables bolted to the walls.  On weekends, the room get's pretty cramped.  (A note to parents with small children: if you have large strollers, it may be a good idea to either leave them in the car or ensure they pack neatly in the corner.)  If you get there around 11:00 a.m. the wait can run you about 30 minutes or more, and there's literally one small bench to sit at while inside.  Weekday crowds are much lighter.  \n\nParking can be found on the street, or in the metered parking lot located behind the building.  There's no need to feed street meters on Sundays.  \n\nAll in all, this diner is a classic.  It's managed to outlive a lot of other local businesses while the larger corporate chains have moved on the street.  Perhaps it's the presidential influence, perhaps because it's \"cash only,\" but I think it's because the food is good, down-home cooking.", "business_id": "TxKmAsKQjND5vbhBdUSyIA", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-08-07", "type": "review"}

I am a picky omelet eater. My eggs have to be cooked just so . . . and so they were! Truly a rarity. The accompanying potatoes were heavenly.

I took one bite, and it was like my palette was ready for 5 more bowls of it. The corned beef in the hash is so good. They season the corned beef so well that it gives the whole dish this heavenly taste.\n\nChocolate Chip Banana Hotcakes (5): I think Pamela's called crepes hotcakes. This was just chocolate chip banana crepes. So naturally, it was delicious. The hotcakes was made really well, a bit crispy on the ends. and the melting chocolate with banana was just yummmmmmy.\n\nGo to Pittsburgh, and you better stop at Pamela's.

Another thing is that the tables do not move so there is no re-arranging for larger parties.  This place only accepts cash unless they've changed that from the last time I was there it's always been like this at least for this location.\n\nThe tables are small considering the amount of plates you will get when you order breakfast.  Really with the coffee and side plates of toast, hash, etc it will be a balancing act to get everything on one plate maybe...  So if you ordered side of sausage or whatever, if you can throw it on your main plate and stack all the side plates if possible.\n\nNow to the food.  It's damn good period.  I mean breakfast is tough because you can really only twist it so many ways so what makes Pam's special?  The crepes and pancakes is what is unique if I had to pick something.  The crepes you can get will walnut and creme and whatever but they ultimately become humongous and if you had something else like bacon and eggs then you will have no room on your table and in your stomach (maybe) because the portions can be big.\n\nI prefer plain pan cakes with butter and syrup and nothing else added myself... their pancakes... the edges are crispy and light but not too fluffy.  \n\nWe usually get a side of corned beef hash which is just awesome but wow I try not to think about how much sodium is in it especially since I always get bacon too.\n\nThe place has packed for a reason and they're not all tourists because Shadyside is a nice cozy neighborhood.

I usually don't like having sweet breakfast dish like pancakes or waffles as main breakfast dishes but was glad I decided to try the hot cakes here. To my surprise, the hot cakes were not as doughy or too sweet at all. The corner of the cake was even crispy that it makes the cake not too filling. If I had to choose another filling for the cakes, however, I'd pick strawberry fillings instead of blueberry because with strawberries I think you get fresh ones instead of blueberries like what I had this time which seemed a bit processed.\n\nMy SO also ordered some breakfast egg dish with corned beef hash and a side of lyonnaise potatoes. I didn't try his breakfast dish but tried the side potatoes that we ordered...and they definitely were yummy! I couldn't pin point how they got their lyonnaise potatoes so tasty..but maybe with a bit of cream?, onions and some butter? ...I honestly have no idea...I took a bite of the lyonnaise potatoes...and ended up finishing the whole side dish :x..oops..it was that good :)\n\nIf you are looking for a good breakfast place in Pittsburgh, check Pamela's diner out.

I went in of course to order...well...a waffle, because I would be remiss to not order a waffle at a place called the Waffle House. \n\nAs for the waffle. It was pretty good. It was a little too sweet and tangy for my taste. Plus is was a bit flat. I can tell they are designed to hold food on top of them, and I think it would be great if paired with fruit. Alas, I was trying to conserve money, so I ordered it sans fruit and opted for maple syrup and butter to adorn it. They made it even more sweet, so I ended up just eating the waffle itself which was sweet enough for me. \n\nAs for the customer service, it was fine. The woman who took my order did a good job and was quick to take my order even though it was packed. there was a man sitting next to me at their bar area next to me, who kept trying to sell me these coupon books, which frustrated me quite a bit, but he seemed to be a regular and was interacting with the staff quite a bit so they didn't tell him to leave me alone, when it should have been obvious that I was really tired and jet lagged and I didn't want to talk.  \n\nHowever, as far as cleanliness goes, this place needed some sprucing up. First, I got a dirty glass with my water. Second, the woman who took my order gave me dirty napkins. Third, the floor was sticky in some areas. \n\nWhile I can understand that in a rush, sometimes these things can happen. Those issues happened too many times in the space of an hour for me to really give it a pass, which downgrades the review a bit.\n\nStill, it was not a bad first experience.

The fact that their pancakes and their omelets are above-average sized doesn't make them great. In fact, I'd declare they're pretty mediocre, and I've eaten here several times.\n\nThere are quite a few things about OPH that irk me to no end, especially at the South Park location.\n\n1. Regarding their pancakes: yes, they're good pancakes. Best pancakes ever? Hardly. Don't get me wrong: if all I had to eat there was a stack of pancakes, I'd be satisfied. But when you hear friends and colleagues rave about OPH's pancakes, you're expecting to have your dirty, hole-filled socks knocked off. \n\nNot so much here. \n\n2. Their omelets are obnoxious-sized. Seriously. They look as if the line cook tried to shove an entire turkey inside a egg wrap. \n\nLook, I get that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. That doesn't mean I want an omelet the size of the Hindenburg. I'm not going to finish it. Hell, I may not even last 3 bites. I'm not fond of places that tend to overdo it when it comes to certain plates. \n\n3. In the 5 or 6 times I've eaten here, I've never been waited on by someone who didn't have a shitty attitude. Ask for extra syrup or butter, and they look at you as if you just asked if you could perform all kinds of illegal and immoral sexual acts upon their mother. Considering this is the Bible Belt, some of those acts would seem immoral here, but where I come from, that pretty much constitutes \"going to first base.\" But I digress...\n\nIn addition to shitty service is the lack of service to begin with. You get seated, and maybe, just maybe, your waiter/waitress will take a few minutes from bitching about how much they hate working here - and mind you, I worked my way through college as a waiter, so I sympathize with having to work a crowded restaurant - and maybe they'll realize your coffee's running low and pour you some. Or maybe they'll realize you don't have silverware...while your meal's on the table. You can't eat pancakes with your hand. I mean, you could, but that's barbaric.\n\n4. Speaking of coffee, their coffee is BRUTAL. A warm cup of water with a pathetic sprinkling of coffee grounds is NOT COFFEE. Then I realized they serve Royal Cup Coffee. This is the kind of coffee you serve to people you hate. Apparently, the management at OPH hates their customers.\n\n5. Speaking of customers, something about OPH seems to bring out the shitty in some customers. Apparently there's an addictive formula in their pancakes that makes some customers act stupid, although I seem to be immune. Every time I've gone to OPH, I've been seated next to patrons who speak too damned loud and want to share every excruciating detail of their lives, or behave towards their meal as if they'd just escaped from a chain gang and haven't eaten a meal in weeks. \n\nI know I pointed out the crap service, but nothing gets me as angry as a customer that treats a waitress like shit. Dressing down a waitress because she forgot to bring you your egg whites is uncalled for. And the behavior some patrons demonstrate here is a big reason why I won't return to ANY OPH, wherever, whenever. The joint seems to bring out a giant stack of stupid in people.\n\nThere are better places in town for breakfast. \n\nThe thing is, the existence of an establishment like OPH proves the incestuous relationship that takes place between \"well-established\" restaurants that are merely coasting by based upon past glories and name recognition, and a general public either too ignorant to know better, or one that simply doesn't care.", "business_id": "UzMMpUFwJhwUkHOyeXeWsQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-08-27", "type": "review"}

On any given Sunday the restaurant is packed with people and the wait is over an hour, but it is totally worth the wait. I have never had a bad experience at The Original Pancake House and I've tried many different dishes over the years. \n\nPerhaps my favorite dish at The Original Pancake House is their chocolate chip pancakes. Now I love a good chocolate chip pancake and it's very hard to get them done just right. Most of the places I've been to may put a few chips inside the pancake, but the majority of the chips are scattered on top of the pancakes. However, at The Original Pancake House they put tons of chocolate chips both inside the pancakes and on top of the whipped cream that's on the pancakes. This makes for a great combination of perfectly melted chocolate chips and hard chocolate chips on top that melt in your mouth.\n\nAlso another favorite of mine is the ham and cheese omelet. The omelet's at The Original Pancake House are absolutely huge and I don't think I've ever actually finished a whole omelet in one sitting. Not only are these omelets big, but they are also stuffed with whatever toppings you want, so you will not be disappointed with your meal. \n\nThe only reason I gave this restaurant a 4-star rating is because of the wait time and the noise level inside the restaurant (sometimes it gets pretty loud), but if I were basing my rating solely on the quality of the food then I would give The Original Pancake House a 5-star rating. The food tastes fantastic and it is very reasonable for the price.

They will allow to sub anything for anything, and pay the difference, IHOP will not.\nexample: IHOP will not allow you sub meat for non-meat, even if you don't eat meat!\n\n2. OPH has better options for people who don't want to eat meat, but do want to eat eggs. \nexample: Hash brown and eggs Combo comes with Pancakes.\n\n3. OPH pancakes are perfection, IHOP pancakes are a joke and are only eaten as a result of good marketing and advertising. \n\n4. OPH has better syrup, made from fresh ingredients. The strawberry syrup is made with real strawberries, The Blueberry is made with real blueberries. \nThis cannot be said about IHOP. Think about that next time you are at IHOP trying to pull that syrup jug that's stuck on the table to pour over your lowsy IHOP pancakes.\n\n5. OPH omellets are bigger and better, granted that are different style.\nExample: I brought my friend there, and before we order I asked him, \"Are you ready?\". He didn't what I was talking about until the mammoth omelet came out. I am sure OPH is a great way to put your kids to sleep for the day, worth trying. \n\nIHOP omellets aren't bad as long as they don't cross contaminate your food, with things you don't want.\n\nI think I have made my point, the take away here, is OPH has the best pancakes period, if you know better send me a message or something.", "business_id": "UzMMpUFwJhwUkHOyeXeWsQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-07-27", "type": "review"}

The lettuce and tomato are fresh, as is the \"fresh fruit\" on the side. Today, my wife had an egg sandwich with ham. It was huge, like an omelette on the same toasted bread as my BLT a few days before. The yogurt parfait my daughter ordered had fresh fruit and crunchy granola.

It's a short bike ride from the 53597 and the Alterra Coffee (or is it Colectivo now, I'm so confused) they serve beats the pants off of what you can get from the neighboring Starbucks.  \n\nI wish the outdoors seating area took advantage of the nearby Pheasant Branch Conservancy.  Sipping coffee and watching the locals pick-up their dry-cleaning just isn't the vibe I'm looking for I guess.  \n\nI can't vouch for the breakfast or lunch selections, since I'm just a coffee and baked goods sort of guy.  As for baked goods, I've had some excellent scones and muffins at Prairie.  Like scream it from the rooftop great.  But not every time.  Just when I'm ready to proclaim Prairie my go to coffee and a scone hangout, I get a scone that's as dry as Atacama Desert.  And since I'm dropping some decent coin here, I want better consistency.\n\nThings I like:\n * Love the staff here. Even when the place is getting slammed by waves of morning commuters looking for their sugar and caffeine fix, I always get a smile and courteous service.\n *  Always love me some free wi--fi.  Never had a problem connecting or with download speeds.\n * The noise level indoors always seems to be a soft murmur, with some relaxing music wafting in the background.  Never had a problem carrying on a conversation with my table mates.\n * When the FDA approves Alterra Coffee for intravenous use, I'll be first in line.  There are always are four or five roasts to choose from and I've never had a skunky cup.\n\nThings I don't\n *The \"cash only\" thing was so hip in the 18th century, but it's 2013 now.  Start taking plastic, people.\n * The baked goods are not inexpensive.  It's usually worth it, but it's annoying as hell when I lose the muffin lottery.\n\nIt's a solid three star option with lots of upside if the bakery improves its consistency.", "business_id": "ShEYKerTwb2LSORE5o_s7A", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-08-28", "type": "review"}

Firstly, breakfast stops at 11:00 on weekdays and noon on the weekends, NOTE THAT because when we showed up today after my husbands late night shift the night before they would not serve us breakfast.\n\nCASH OR CHECK ONLY\n\nWorth noting, both menus are pretty slim, but breakfast is larger than lunch.  \n\nThey were out of the fried chicken \"dinner\" (you mean lunch, since they were only open till 2, right?). We ended up ordering the patty melt, ok, fish sandwich, subpar, and onion rings, good but not $3 good. Sandwiches come with chips, not fries.  But was definitely not the pancakes that everyone else was raving about that I was craving.  The coffee was sting but a bit bitter. The total was just under $20 without tip. \n\nThe decor is old, doesn't bother me too much, but looking at the filthy carpets, it was disgusting and I was a bit afraid since I was wearing flat sandals.  Before I forget to mention it, the place smells like smoke when you first walk in, I was completely expecting to see ashtrays at the booths.\n\nThe service was excellent... If you are a regular. If not, plan on spending about three times too much there. We waited for about 5 minutes for our waitress ( one of the owners) to shout sit where you want.  We grabbed a table. My husband had to take a work call, but had given me his order. After waiting 10 minutes, I had to flag our waitress down to place our orders, and she looked at me shocked that I would want something to eat. Trying to get the check out of her was terrible. By 12:15 the lunch regulars had started coming in, so she was chatting about a recent wedding, showings hem the wedding pictures, talking about what the place looked like, etc. by 12:30 I had out cash on the end of the table hoping to move things along.  She walked past us three times without making eye contact, finally, I put my arm out and asked for the check, which had not been prepared, wait for another 5 minutes while she served more regulars and FINALLY she got back to using we were out of there by 12:50. \n\nIn short, we will never return.

We visited the cafe after church to grab some brunch because we had heard good things about it.\n\nThe outside of the building looks absolutely abysmal. It's at the level that it feels like you may get food poisoning just by walking by it. It looks like a scary dive dinner. Fortunately, Cottage Cafe is NOT a scary dive dinner, and it will NOT give you food poisoning. Think of the Cottage Cafe as a scrappy stray dog. He's dirty on the outside, but he just needs a bath because inside his heart is gold.\n\nThe interior of Cottage Cafe is clean and feels like a classic country eatery. When we arrived it was absolutely packed, but it had a sort of \"home\" feel to it. We had about an 8 minute wait, it wasn't anything terrible considering the number of customers, which we took as a good omen.\n\nOur server ended up being the sweetest lady, and she hooked my friend up with his ridiculously custom breakfast burger order. It arrived just as he asked!\n\nThe menu prices were surprisingly low and portions large that it almost felt like stealing. The \"baby pancake\" ended up being the size of a human head. Do not let the name fool you.\n\nI ended up ordering the \"big breakfast\" for $6, which has amazing value. I had 2 scrambled eggs with cheese, bacon, hash browns, and 2 pieces of toast. The melted cheese on the eggs was just a slice of sandwich cheese, which was kind of strange, and I like my hash browns a little on the crispy side. Both of these are personal preference, though. Overall, the meal was incredibly considering what you pay for it. It would cost you almost this much to get a breakfast meal from McDonald's.\n\nI am recommending Cottage Cafe because of the value and the incredibly sweet servers that will help you customize your meal. I would not be recommending Cottage Cafe if the prices weren't so low. For the price, the food is great. I would just expect  higher quality if the prices were to jump immensely. \n\nGo to Cottage Cafe and get a meal that will fill you up for cheap without feeling awful afterwards.", "business_id": "MONajnUQ5-IRtv8PSPn_yA", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-06-10", "type": "review"}

I think I'd have done better had i gone to Sam's, bought 3x the steaks for twice the price and cooked them at home.

Normal baked potato don't exhibit that kind of toughness near the ends of naked taters.\n\nAll in all, I'm quite a bit disappointed with this visit.

The food is very inexpensive and it has the best french toast in town. The seats are quite uncomfortable but fit in with the ambiance. For a while they served Lebonese food on some evenings but stopped doing that. I wish they would bring it back. It was excellent, high quality and reasonably priced.", "business_id": "2UAbUSTMsR9G26A8AYO3dA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-06-01", "type": "review"}

Because the greasily myopic server will remind you of this no matter how frequently you visit.  You could get the best damned French toast in the world at Sam's every weekend, and I'm pretty sure he'd still point out the special.\n\nDid you read what I wrote there?  Best. Damned. French. Toast. In. The. World.\n\nHow is it so good?  That's a good question.  Somehow the combination of totally ordinary white bread and totally ordinary pancake batter transcends the potential of both parts to result in something truly drool-worthy: a giant slab of golden brown toast in a pool of butter and syrup.  If you like French toast, there's no reason to consider anything else on the menu.\n\nBUT if you do, you'll find that they also have grits - a rarity above the Mason-Dixon line - swimming in butter, crispy bacon, truly over-medium eggs, and delicious pancakes.  The coffee is, well, blackish, but it's really not fair to judge a diner on the quality of their coffee.  Your mug will always be full, for better or for worse.\n\nMy husband and I moved away from Champaign in 2007 but make a point of having breakfast at Sam's whenever we're back.  There are better-for-us breakfasts in Champaign.  There are fancier breakfasts in Champaign.

I will talk of the awesome Tapas 'experience' at a later date, but this blog is devoted to our last night in The Dining Room.\nWith an exceptional wine-list, dinner at RM always begins and ends well in terms of drinking options. One of the best things for me is that no matter what mood I am in financially, (from big-night-out, to my typical tuesday-night-budget) there are so many choices of great tasting vino. Although RM changes its menu about once a year, they (thankfully) keep many of their favorites available, such as the Coffee Filet, Peppercorn Tuna steak, New York Strip and appetizers Seared Avocado with Quinoa salad and Grilled Goats Cheese Medallions in pesto. All dishes have latin-fusion inspired flavors, plenty of warm chile, spicy cream, mole and guacamole sauces.\nService at RM is impeccable. Quick, but tastefully so, timing is almost always perfect, polite and sophisticated. Their knowledgeable sommelier staff are very helpful for beginners and experienced wine-drinkers alike. Dinner is not cheap for the average mid-west dining clientele, but compared to similar dining rooms in larger cities, I think Radio Maria is worth double whatever the bill is.\nALWAYS order the special, their young, fashionable chefs always deliver.

Do not rest on your laurels because that way failure lies...\n\nI don't get to go to Radio Maria as often as I used to. It has a fond place in my heart, which is probably good for them as I'm not dinging them as much as I could in this review. RM was one of the first hip businesses that launched the downtown revival (along with The Blind Pig, v 1.0) and for that I have much love.\n\nThe last few times we've gone, we've sat outside and had tapas. Now I'm no tapas expert, but I believe you usually order a bunch of tapas and they come out one-at-a-time to your table so you can experience each dish on its own merits.  RM, however, always sends out all the tapas all at the same time. Everything becomes a mish-mash and it's overwhelming and nothing stands out.  You also immediately get abandoned by the waitstaff so you have to wait forever to order another drink or get/pay your check. \n\nAlso, the pretty pretty people who work there don't like kids. That would be fair if we were dragging the kids inside and interrupting the restaurant. But even if your kids are well-behaved and you're sitting outside, you catch a real snotty attitude. I am happy to report, however, that they do have a real highchair. When my eldest was a baby they had a beautiful vintage deathtrap highchair. They now have one that is still aesthetically pleasing, but without all the metal.\n\nThe restaurant itself is still lovely. I just wish they'd shape up their staff so it wasn't so depressing to interact with them.", "business_id": "AB5RgQ0ZnMThdqgFS3cPuw", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-07-26", "type": "review"}

The bar is truly outstanding.  They probably have the best beer tap rotation in town (yes, that's right) and it's constantly changing.  Probably 25+ beers on tap, and good nightly drink specials.  This is usually one of my top late-night options for that reason, along with DJ Belly on the tables (old school hip-hop is usually on rotation after 10 pm). \n\nThe food always pleases. My favorite is the paella, but they will put out a good beef tenderloin or other special on occasion that has always impressed.  The chef there is very talented, and the staff in general is very courteous.  If it gets crowded, you might be in for a long meal, but that doesn't really bother me much for this type of place.  We have done birthdays, graduation dinners, or stopped by at 1 am drunk as a night-cap.  It's a very versatile place that can appeal to a variety of tastes.  Definitely the most unique place in town, and should be at the top of anyone's Champaign restaurant lists.", "business_id": "AB5RgQ0ZnMThdqgFS3cPuw", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-06-10", "type": "review"}

Try getting a slice of beer bread! It's hearty and is flavorful. The churros are fluffy and not too sweet. I am not familiar with real churros, but this one tasted good! The service for a Sunday brunch is slow. I had to flag the waiter down to take our order after 15 minutes of sitting and waiting. \n\nThe tapas menu is extensive. Hands down, my favorite dish to order are the lamb meatballs. They are made with pinenuts and tender lamb and then are stewed in a seasoned tomato sauce. You have to try them! I also love the Paella. There are several different kinds, but I like the mixed because you get to try all the different seafood and meats.

It comes with several options of sides (as do all their sandwiches).\n\nIf you work anywhere along Central Avenue from downtown to uptown, or anywhere between 7th Avenue and 7th Street and McDowell and Camelback, call Cranberry Hills for delivery for lunch at least twice a week!  They deliver further than that for a five dollar fee. The reason their prices are so reasonable is that in order to keep their regular office workers happy and ordering several times a week, it must be cost-effective.  But their low prices don't cut into their profits because they have so many customers.\n\nThey are near the corner of Central and Catalina.  You can pull in easiest heading west on Catalina (from 3rd Street).  The parking lot is small, but you'll be outta there in no time, and you will want to come back, especially if you ordered the Indian Salad and/or Vermont Chicken sandwich.

I explained the situation to him (Peter) and he said he'd send out another sandwich and apologized for the poor service and incorrect orders.  Guess who delivered it?  Monica!  Apparently she volunteered to drop it off to me.  After handing me the sandwich and telling me to check it, she storms off and says \"Next time, you aren't to talk to me like that\".  No problem, I'll just speak to your manager.  The receptionist heard the entire thing and was on the phone to her manager again.  The manager (this time Jerry) said she bagged my order and Monica volunteered to drive it over herself.  We informed Jerry that it wasn't bagged and Monica just handed us the sandwich.

I was surprised that they had finally gotten rid of that name and changed the signage to The Good Egg (not sure if this is recent or not, I haven't been down this part of Camelback in a bit of time).  Upon seeing the new signage, I thought perhaps there would be a better experience to be had.... no, nope, not at all.\n\nI met my party that was already seated in the WAAAAAAY outdated restaurant... I mean seriously people, the bakery cases that haven't been used in decades, the wood, the wallpaper, the metal chairs, and all the BRASS... oh my goodness all the brass....YUCK!..... Give this place a little attention Good Egg.\n\nWhen I sat down I found half of the table wet and no napkins, a little puzzled I asked what the deal was.  Apparently the waiter had spilled the water all over the table and used our napkins to try and wipe it up.... I repeat TRY to clean it up, he didn't succeed. Perhaps if he had went to get a towel he could of gotten all the water up, but apparently he never did (as this happened 10 min. before I got there and there was still puddles all over the table.  Nor did he come back with fresh napkins...nice buddy, nice.\n\nAfter being there for about 5 minutes the guy came to ask if I wanted anything to drink... Coffee and cream please. And walks away before we can say that we are ready to order... Now I am the ding dong who was a half hour late because my ass slept in, so friends were huunnngggry.....He comes back with coffee (lukewarm at best), no cream, and walks away...AGAIN.  We sit, and sit, and sit.  He finally comes and ask if we are ready to order, umm.. we had been there 45 minutes and 15 minutes...yeah, I think we've got it.   We order and remind him again of the cream and napkins.\n\nHe comes back with cream, no napkins.  sigh.\n\nFood finally comes, order is right, but haphazardly prepared.  Maybe the kitchen guy overslept too?  \n\nI have the Monterrey, it is missing tomatoes and you can tell that it was almost forgotten about because the eggs were starting to brown, my english muffin is nearly burnt and looks like it was toasted on a grill that needs some scrubbing, the cook compensated by soaking it in butter. Dollar Pancakes were shaped like road kill, and the side plate they came on was placed on my main plate.  That's no big deal, I don't care.  But as I am going fork to plate the server takes the side plate off the main plate...umm...eew, don't touch my food once it has hit the table.  I worked my way through high school and college waiting tables, I have a high tolerance for eew, but some things just bug me right away... this is one of them.  Dude, if you touch my food while it is in the kitchen, ignorance is bliss, but if you do it in front of me once the food is ON THE TABLE for goodness sake then that shit just be NASTY yo!  I know damn well there is a good chance your hands aren't clean.  Practically no food workers wash their hands as much as they are supposed to unless the health inspector is there....sorry people, its true.\n\nFriend 1 had an even more crispy looking omelet.  Friend 2 got a turkey sandwich.  It was dry, and lacking in well... turkey! It looked as if they had folded up one piece of lunch meat to make it look more substantial.  Her salad was pretty lame looking and had the runniest ranch dressing I had ever seen.  What was even worse is that there was one sad runaway strawberry in her sandwich... wtf? Check your cold storage bins people!  If Friend 1 had been the one to order the sandwich instead of Friend 2 then I wouldn't be writing this review right now because I would be supporting Friend 1 in the HOSPITAL!! Friend 1 has a major strawberry allergy.  i understand shit happens, but how does a STRAWBERRY get put on a TURKEY sandwich and the cook doesn't notice?!??!!!\n\nWe could of said something if our server wasn't practicing his disappearing act again. Only time we saw him after he dropped off the food was when he dropped the check, and kindly paused out of his busy day to say \"Everything ok?\" ...kind of waited for a response and walked away.. no \"thank you\" \"have a good day\" \"come again\" \"bugger off\" nothing....  Mind you I use the word \"busy\" lightly, there was about 6 tables in the whole place full at 10am, and at least 4 other servers that I saw.\n\n\nThis was the third time I had been to this location... shitty experience as always, you know what that means people.... three strikes you're out!

Guess they didn't have to since our plates were only missing a couple fries and the warm cold slaw was untouched.We had doctored our sandwiches with condiments so I saw no reason to not take them home.", "business_id": "PxeX1M8WtyPxX1MuuGIh-g", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-07-09", "type": "review"}

Everyone I know that has ever mentioned the Duck tells me they like it. Yes I have been several times over the years. But a few days ago I was at our office which is on 7th ave just south of Thomas. I was really hungry and wanted something to eat, this in it self is kind of unusual as I can more than likely wait until the end of the day before I have to eat. Plus the fact I have enough fat on me to last a few months I would not be starving to death any time soon if I missed a meal or three. So I asked Bruce, you remember Bruce he is the guy I am always asking things when down at the office. I wanted something delivered as I wanted to stay in the office to get a contract ready for signing. The only place he could think of was the Duck, but he said he could go and get it much faster. So I said ok and gave him my card and told him to get what he wants and order me I think it is called the Ducky or something like that.  Man he was back much more quickly than I had expected him to be, so they must have been on the ball in making the food. But the food as I always find; just nondescript. NO discernable flavour just a mish mash of textures and blandness. So I can say I like the building, the quickness they have gotten my food out and the patio. I guess the folks are also nice, but do not remember them so they were not not nice. I just do not get the praise this place gets, I find much better food for less elsewhere.

Italian Dry Salami on sourdough with mayo, mustard, lettuce, tomato, and swiss cheese. Just do it. \n\nGet the tea of the day. Browse the wine and beer room, consider getting a coffee drink at some juncture, and peruse all of the knick knacks and food stuffs.

No, I HAVE had everything on the menu. \n\nI am partial to the swiss cheese because I have not been able to find cheese like that anywhere else, but if you like cheddar (some of  you do) then try the Longhorn- it is the same price as the swiss, any other cheese will cost you extra. If you like cheese in general, then do yourself a favor and get a cheese tray, call some friends, get some wine, and relax.

I had the breakfast burrito with egg, cheddar chz and black forest bacon for breakfast one morning. It was pretty good. Adding their salsa is really what increased the flavor and brought it up a notch. \n\nOn another day, we stopped in for lunch and had the marinated roasted chicken sandwich on sourdough bread. This was a game changer. The fresh, delicious roasted chicken was so good. It tasted like something your mom would make for you if she really loved you. Yeah, that's right mom, I'm calling you out. This is the sandwich I needed growing up. Not bologna and processed cheese. We can still salvage this relationship. Balls in your court lady. \n\nThe food here was great but they're also a specialty store. They have an assortment of greatness throughout. Barrels of coffee beans, containers of different teas, wine, cheeses, beer, different kinds of oils, all kinds of stuff. \n\nThere's seating all over, including outside, but I chose the upstairs loft both times. It was relaxing and there are giant photos of AZ wildlife all around upstairs too... I like animals... and free WiFi. Yup, they have free Wifi.

It's in a tucked away corner of a strip mall.  It neighbors a furniture store and a couple of other places who very  explicitly do NOT want you parking in their store spots if you are visiting Duck & Decanter.  It's huge on the inside.  There is a little cheese section, a wine section, espresso bar with a large selection of loose teas, foodstuffs area, indoor & outdoor seating, an upstairs seating gallery, the deli...like whoah.  It's kind of like an old mercantile of days yore.  You order your sandwich and then have time to peruse the store.  They have lots of Haribo gummi snacks, including my favorite twin cherries.  There are many options for sandwiches.  I got a spicy pulled pork bbq sandwich with cole slaw inside, served in a onion-y kaiser roll.  At least I think it was supposed to be spicy.  It was good, the BBQ sauce was a little sweet for me.  The cole slaw didn't really have a \"bite\" to it, but did keep the bbq and sammie moist and stuff.  I got some seriously overpriced for the size macaroni salad, and it was some of the most mayonaissey mac salad I've had outside of Hawaiian mac salad.  You can take as many pickle spears as your heart desires.  They have a dessert case that looks delicious.  Can't really say that their customer service was stellar.  I initially walked around the store trying to figure out if I wanted to stay for a drink or whatever.  There were a lot of people working. Somebody followed me from section to section, but never bothered to ask if I needed help.  Just tailed me like a store security guard.  Maybe I looked particularly suspicious on this day...without even wearing my escaped convict prison jump suit.  Then when I opted to just get a sandwich, the staff just totally disappeared except for the sandwich maker, who had to finish up what she was doing to help me.  Kind of a weird vibe.  \nSo, would I go back?  Sure, one visit does not make a complete story.  Heat does crazy things to people and it was a CRAZY hot day.

I've been eating here since I was 12 years old, and when I grew older and lived in the neighborhood I ate there almost once a week, many times even daily. Clearly, I'm not even exaggerating a little when I say that I love this place and think the food is amazing. Lately, however I have been experiencing a lot of issues with my orders being made improperly and a lack of support from the staff in compensation for the issue.\n\nI haven't eaten there for a long time, it might be my actual favorite place to eat and for the most part if I could eat anything at all this is what I would choose, so I recently decided to place an order. I got home with my food and realized that everything was made improperly. I called them before they closed to make sure they knew what happened and they gave me credits for free food.\n\nAfter remembering how good their food is, despite the mistakes made to my order, I was left craving more and decided to try again so I could use the free credits they gave me. When I got home the food was made incorrectly again, but I live far and really didn't feel like driving back, so I picked everything off that wasn't supposed to be there and moved on with my day.\n\nSoon after I took a friend of mine there because she had never been and despite these two past experiences I still considered it my favorite place to eat. We ordered, waited, got our food, and sat down. I opened my sandwich to find it made incorrectly, yet again. After becoming quite sad, my friend encouraged me to go back inside and tell them. They remade the sandwich for me and everything was fine.\n\nBecause of my recent issues, when I placed my latest order, I made sure to ask the person taking my order to have the person making the sandwich double-check the bag to insure my food was made exactly as I ordered it.

I question why I bother going into my kitchen when such simple food can be made this good, why do I bother to cook myself...which brings me to price. Watch out,  wrights' is not cheap, not value, not frugal, no, no, no. You pay full freight at Wrights. The concept of wine by the glass, not so much here. You will be paying 'bout $18 for a glass, it will be awesome and you will recognize the fact that the wine you are drinking is never sold by the glass, hence the price but it will be just about $18...the tasting menu is $25 and you can fit all 3 items on a small dinner plate- not filling up at this rate.

The buffet had a great assortment of cheese and antipasta, assorted salads, pastries, huge shrimp and crab legs, a tasty ceviche, a couple types of sushi and more.  The star of the show was the dessert table.  I literally tried EVERY dessert they had out (don't worry... I was sharing!)... my favorites were the coconut cream tart, molten chocolate cake, peanut butter chocolate cup, cheesecake and toffee-chocolate chip cookies.  Mmmmm...

The buffet had shrimp cocktail, 4 diff sushi rolls, assorted pastries, cheese, smoked salmon, smoked duck, caviar, varieties of desserts. I am not usually big fan of shrimp cocktail at buffet place, but theirs were really good and cooked perfect. A bit disappointed that they put all the large shrimps on top but the bottom ones hidden under the large ones were the small ones. The smoked salmon and smoked duck were awesome. Desserts were very pretty and decent but mostly too sweet to my taste. Sushi rolls were pretty good. We tried all the 7 hot plates to be shared among the 3 of us, the lamb was soooo delish that I had two orders of it and I don't usually even like the smell of lamb, but this didnt have the heavy smell. The waffle and pancakes were really good, except that I didn't quite enjoy the combination of the bacon bits on the waffle. I also loved the lobster mini sandwich. Polenta was yuck and the most raved egg benedict was not special. I didn't get to try the beef and mac n cheese, but hubby said the macncheese was good but beef was just average. We called ahead to let them know that it was also our anniversary and they would take note of it, but it didn't appear that any note was made. I know it's only brunch and not full dinner but would still appreciate a bit recognition on it, so I ended up asking the host if they could do something. So came an empty plate with chocolate writing saying Happy Anniversary on it and was told to get some dessert from the buffet to put on the plate.

The only food available were a choice of 5 sandwiches:( hot dogs, chicken, burger, brats, mahi-mahi with a choice of one side.) Although I understand it was meant to be like a barbecue, and possible special event for the holiday, there were no options if you were a vegetarian such as a simple salad. The beer choices were Bud light, miller light, I think Corona and Michelob, so if you like a craft beer you are out of luck. I recommend the option for a selection of a few craft beers, and a little more variety in food. The Patio was definitely beautiful with a fantastic view, in a cooler weather situation would be optimal---there were no misters set up and there were only two umbrellas in the middle that shaded about 2 tables on the entire patio, so most of the seating was in the sun, and here in Phoenix it is a little too hot to be sitting outside for long periods without some relief from the sun and during the summer months it does not get dark until around 8pm.

In the 2 yrs since we've lived here, we haven't been to the Wrigley Mansion, so we were very excited to come check it out. \n\nWhen you pull up to the mansion, it's a bit confusing to figure out where to drive....there's a self-parking lot at the bottom of the hill....walk up a large hill in 90+ degree weather, um....no thanks.  Ok, so we drove up the driveway assuming that's where the valet parking would be located....and it was.  \n\nBeautiful views from the top of the hill.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-wrigley-mansion-club-phoenix?select=v_KnIKFpeibBVvefO6ujPA#v_KnIKFpeibBVvefO6ujPA\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-wrigley-mansion-club-phoenix?select=7qDCP4mv_Ws2sdJtqmlvOA#7qDCP4mv_Ws2sdJtqmlvOA\n\nWe walked inside the mansion and were greeted by a hostess who directed us to the private event area to the left.  We enjoyed Wine and Cheese/Crackers/Fruit, etc that you normally find at a Wine tasting.  The Wine was very good and the room was comfortable.  After 30 min or so we were asked to move into the dining room area where we would start a formal Wine tasting with 8 glasses (4 White, 4 Red) of Wine.\n\nThe sommelier did a nice presentation about each Wine....however, she took too long and was a bit too in-depth for this group of people.  There were over 80 people and many of them were not Wine enthusiasts, so they were bored very quickly.....too much time between sips.  I personally enjoyed it, but afterward many people said it was too much info for them. \n\nSince the building is very old, the room we were in was not well insulated and got a little stuffy/warm....so if you're coming here during the Summer months, dress light.\n\nAfter the event, we wandered around the mansion and took a bunch of pics of the artwork and rooms.  I'm sure there's a story behind all of this, but we were on our own and didn't have a guide to explain anything to us.\n\nWe picked up a flyer for a social club you can belong to here...?  Not really sure what that entails, but it's available.\n\nOverall, I'd rate this experience 3.5 Stars, but I'm rounding up for the views and Wine.\n\nReturn Factor - 70%", "business_id": "yPfvOB63thP5t3pGZPJExA", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-07-04", "type": "review"}

Since I heard that their dining selections were OK at best, I decided to bring two of my friends to Geordie's Lounge during Happy Hour for some appetizers and cocktails. Unfortunately for us, the lounge had been rented out the day we arrived, and we were seated in the dining area, so we didn't get any of the discounts. \n\nWe each ordered the Cocktail of the Day, which was a Prickly Pair Margherita served Martini style ($13). Then we ordered the Pancetta Mac and Cheese ($10), Roasted Vegetables with marinara and mozzarella cheese ($10), and flourless chocolate cake($9) to share. We originally ordered the Trio of Gelato, but were informed that they only had the pistachio, so we decided on the chocolate cake instead. We were informed that the sides we ordered were enough to feed 2.5 people and when the food arrived, we decided it was definitely an appropriate amount of food for us. We were also given complimentary garlic bread (which was delicious).\n\nTo rate the food, I would say I definitely enjoyed the Pancetta Mac and Cheese the most. It was very delicious and creamy, with bread crumbs and pancetta (Italian bacon). I would definitely order it again. The roasted vegetables were good as well, but overpriced, seeing as I could easily make something similar at home. Finally, the flourless chocolate cake was good as well, nothing I'd have to order again. I had never tried flourless cake before, but I don't know if it's supposed to be a little drier than a regular floured cake. Nonetheless, I enjoyed it.\n\nIn order to dine at the club, there is a $5 membership charge per table. My party and I took that as an invitation to give ourselves a self-guided tour of the property. It is a large, beautiful property overlooking Phoenix and since it was nearing sunset when we arrived, there were plenty of beautiful photography opportunities. \n\nI agree with the other reviewers. The view alone is worth the trip here. I would definitely come back and order a few cocktails or appetizers, have a good conversation, and watch the sun set again. \n\nAnother tip: my friends and I were able to easily walk up from the self-parking lot to the entrance and it took only 2 or 3 minutes. However, if you're dressed up nicely for an event, wearing high heels, or you are walking in 115 degree weather, I would suggest valeting your car and walking straight up to the entrance.\n\nOverall, I am glad to have been able to visit a Phoenix point of pride while I'm still living here in Arizona.", "business_id": "yPfvOB63thP5t3pGZPJExA", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-08-09", "type": "review"}

Anything Vincent's does I love. Whether it's the 5 star dining in the front, the market bistro in the back or the Saturday morning marketplace outside. They really know how to frenchafy AZ. \n\nI've been to Vincent's Market Bistro several times and most recently, last night for a friend's birthday. The Market Bistro is the more intimate, kitchen style dining at Vincent's and actually my favorite way to dine there. I walked in and immediately felt like I'd entered a cozy and intimate restaurant in the heart of Paris. The food was cooking, the guests at the tables were laughing and having a great time and the waitstaff knew almost everyone by name. The authentic french decor helped the cause as well. \n\nWhen I hear the name Vincent's, I immediately think \"oh yikes, here comes a pricey night,\" but the best part about it is that the market bistro keeps the evening at an incredibly reasonable price without losing the quality of food. Are you ready for this? I got the pre fix meal that began with a delectable crab cake on a salad with avocado garnish, followed by the lobster chimichanga and topped off with the chocolate tart which was really a chocolate souffle. How much? $20. Only $20 my friends! It was delicious. With each savory bite, I became a little happier. The wine by the glass was only $5-$6 dollars and at the end, the waiter brought us a couple additional desserts to make sure we tried them all. Just what my waistline needed...but I had a bite, and I think the lemon tart is my favorite. \n\nVincent's Market Bistro has definitely been added to the rotation of favorite places to dine with character.

The first time we went was this past March. The food was so good. I had the lobster bisque for a starter and coq au vin for my main. My partner had the same starter and beef bourgogne for her main. We both had profiteroles for dessert. Yummy!! Everything was spot on. Our only complaint last March was that it was so hot in the restaurant, I almost had to leave. We gave them a pass because we thought it was kind of between seasons so we thought maybe they just weren't ready to turn the air on yet but really, it was way too hot!\n\nSo, we decided to give it another try. We ordered the tart flamb\u00e9 and e goat cheese nachos for starters. They were both out of this world, so good. For mains, I again ordered coq au vin and my partner ordered mussels and frites. The coq au vin was a little dry this time around but we were there at the end of the evening, so... Not really a good excuse. I was totally looking forward to the profiteroles but instead, we didn't get the chance to order them. They brought us out a brownie with ice cream. It was good but def not the profiteroles, those are amazing, maybe they ran out.\n\nHere's the kicker, it was beastly hot again, even the servers were sweating like crazy. They seemingly had the air on but not high enough. It was miserable, so while the food was great and def worth repeated visits, I can't take the heat so I'll sadly have to stay out of their kitchen.

But in the case of the vast Phoenix sprawl with its inorganic population growth, (basically it's three major cities shoved into one) you've got an ever evolving diaspora of generational clusters with it's own microcosm of habitual norms...\n\nThe easiest way to observe the human condition is in it's eating habits; we had the pleasure of staying in the Scottsdale area this time, where an intimate little outpost of a Bistro bustles like a hive, hidden away from it's older, larger sibling, Vincent's on Camelback.\n\n\nClick below to read more...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you're on Camelback Rd, you likely to see Vincent's on Camelback first facing the street.

I mean, is there any wrong occasion for buttery Croissants?? It was devoured immediately, only to be refilled instantaneously, like a buttery Croissant Genie popped and gave us three wishes!!!\n\nWhat was true to it essence was the menu: I found old favorites like Coq au Vin and Country Quiche.  And the price point was definitely not French!\n\nThe Coq au Vin was too irresistible to pass up, and when it came to our table, it delivered as promised; a wonderfully rich Bourgogne sauce covered Chicken leg on top of an equally decadent mound of Mashed Potatoes.  With portions that would satisfy the French diet, the rich dish sated our American belly...  And looking at the other tables, it seemed that it did equally well around the room... \n\nAnd what would be a price fix course at Vincent's without our knowledge, a complimentary dessert arrived.

A rolled moist not too sweet yellow cake with perfect blueberry mousse.

Postino is great for any occasion!  (Although maybe not a big group based on what I read in previous reviews).  \n\nI've been for pretty much all of the occasions listed above, and every visit to Postino, I leave a satisfied customer.  My favorite lunchtime menu items are the brushcetta (perfect for sharing as an appetizer and fun to choose from the variety of delicious selections), the Mixed Greens Salad (which comes with shaved pears, candied pecans, red grapes, gorgonzola, and crispy leeks served with poppyseed vinaigrette - and I usually add turkey to it too), and the Raspberry Chicken Salad.  LOL at my long description, but had to include it all!\n\nI'm not usually a daytime drinker but I'm all for starting happy hour early and taking advantage of 'wine by the glass' $4 special - great wine list! The ambiance and service is fantastic and it's fun to people watch at Postino as well.  It's a fantastic little neighborhood place, and there are several little details that make Postino stand out in my eyes... next time you're there, check out the sugar / sweet'n low dish thing on the table - there's a little something special there if you need to spit out your gum before digging into your meal :)  Also check out the branded rolls of TP in the bathroom - so cute!\n\nCan't wait to go on a Monday night sometime soon to take advantage of their special: $9 off a bottle of wine and pizza from LGO!  Postino has a regular loyal customer in me and I don't see that changing anytime soon!", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-08-23", "type": "review"}

This is a very filling choice, but with groups of four you can extend up to 8.\nI cannot do these delectable eats any justice if I don't give them a name.\nRecommendations below are my tops, my do or dies:\n\nfresh mozzarella with tomato and basil\nsmoked salmon\nprosciutto with figs and mascarpone\nbrie and apples with fig spread\n\nthe flavors are bold and fresh, even the flavor combinations seem daring on some.\n\nsoups and salads are available here, as well as paninis.I am not a fan of paninis, but the prosciutto with brie was very well done.\n\nBest night to come:\nTuesday after 8p  ($20 tuesday, where you can enjoy a bottle of wine and bruschetta for only $20)\n\nHappy Hour:\nNot exactly, but wines by the glass are $5, seven days a week, from 11-5\n\nDessert menu:\nTammy Coe Cakes is next door, so you can sample a selection of her decadent cookies and cakes.

It was on a Tuesday, and I was fortunate enough to stumble onto the online menu beforehand and find that Postino offers $20 bottle of wine AND bruschetta on Tuesdays after 8pm.  I was a little wary that it seemed very noisy inside, but there was no way I'd have my cousin steam outside in the patio after she had just recounted how perfect the weather was in San Francisco, a stop she'd made before arriving in PHX.  \n\nWe had a blast!  For $20, the two of us enjoyed a nice bottle of Heron chardonnay and a platter of six HUGE bruschetta halves (ricotta with dates and pistachios; smoked salmon with capers and herbs; roasted red peppers and goat cheese; and prosciutto with figs and mascarpone). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/u-SJ5QUwrNquL9VnXwl8cg?userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA#oGjoq-y0BpTf_Ug6K6vmgQ  My non-sweet-toothed cousin's fave was the peppers and goat cheese.  It was good, but I always have red peppers and goat cheese, and since I have a ROARING sweet-tooth, my #1 fave was the ricotta, dates, and pistachios.  Tied for 2nd place were the mascarpone and salmon.  I'm not much of a prosciutto fan, as I find it a tad too salty, but the sweet mascarpone cut through some of the saltiness.  The salmon and capers were so tasty!  \n\nNice atmosphere- lots of positive energy.  Our server was efficient, friendly, and never overbearing.  Cute restroom.  My only complaint is that it is so dark indoors!  I know I've said this before, but I'll say it again- I like to feast my eyes on the food's presentation!  Please, add more light!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/u-SJ5QUwrNquL9VnXwl8cg?select=zsIkd6EUxXYbejAx8Srdeg#zsIkd6EUxXYbejAx8Srdeg\n\nCousin has made me promise her I'd take her back to Postino (or perhaps someplace similar?) on her next visit.

So, when I set out for Phoenix to spend some quality time with family, my one goal for the low-key weekend was to hit up a local happy hour.\n\nMy great-aunt had heard good things about Postino's and Yelp confirmed it was a solid happy hour bet - coming up 2nd in the search queue. So great-aunt & grandmother in tow, I headed for Postino (quaintly named as the location formerly housed a post office!) for their Sunday afternoon reggae and white sangria. I first noted the full parking lot, which I came to find out later - has discouraged some other relatives from visiting Postino. But for an LA-kid, the fact that free nearby lots and street parking was available - well, ain't that a novel concept?\n\nI also noted was that we did have to add our names to a waiting list; happy hour is not at the bar, per se, it's to be ordered from your seats. So we bopped around the adjacent La Grande Orange shop to bide our time - it also seemed like a good time with good food (albeit loud & busy). Thankfully, our wait was short and we were sat outside, which was fine in the 95 degree temperature - almost everywhere seems to have nice shading and misters.\n\nMy gang of three forwent the $5 wine and beer deals and instead opted for the Sunday special - $5 white wine sangria. I quite enjoyed mine, but my HH partners thought it a bit sour and added splenda. There are no food deals on the happy hour menu, but the prices are not too wallet-depleting. I got the  1/2 Italian Market Salad (greens tossed with roasted beets, goat cheese, bacon (no bacon for me!) and walnuts topped with crisped root vegetables in herb vinaigrette) and  1/2 vegetarian sandwich (grilled Asparagus, roasted artichokes, red onion, vine ripe tomatoes, goat cheese, and house-made pesto) for $9.50 and a cup of the Brocolli-cheddar soup for $2.50. \n\nI didn't leave any room for the bruschetta, but it sounded great - you pick four options of toppings (including brie & apples with fig spread; smoked salmon or salami with pesto; white bean with chopped tomato; ricotta with dates & pistachios, and more) for $12.75.\n\nThe crowd was pretty homogenous - youngish professionals on family time listening to the one-man reggae band. I think it'd be a great spot to catch up with a girlfriend over the weekend. And I'd love to see what kind of crowd the early evening/evening brings. To me, it seems weeknights would be optimal for a date night.\n\nI also wonder about the 11-5 happy hour, which is great for the weekend, but I wonder who can partake on weekdays...", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-07-20", "type": "review"}

In a foodie way, too.\n\nMy boyfriend and I came here on a hot humid Thursday night. The lightings were great to bring a date or to catch up with a friend and there were fairly good amount of room noise to keep your conversation on the privacy level. The service was just lovely. Oh, the little \"Gum\" note-card was utterly cute. You can either spit your gum on the note-card or exchange phone numbers. :)\n\nThe first time I visited Postino, I wanted to come back for more of their bruschettas. My boyfriend and I shared the various bruschetta platter: \n1. Brie & Apples with Fig Spread - He quickly picked this because the first time he had it became his favorite and was confident that I would absolutely love it, and I did -- I loved the sweet taste of the fig with the crunchiness of the apples. yummm! The composition of the brie, apples and fig gives this bruschetta a sweet taste.\n2. Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato & Basil - Since we had 3 more bruschetta options to pick, we went for something light and simple. Everything was fresh! The combination of the mozzarella, tomato and basil was simple yet blended wonderfully together. \n3. Smoked Salmon with Pesto - This was probably my least favorite out of the four, but it was okay. Although the capers were mouth bursting with favors -- which was delish, but it didn't do much justice for the slight fishy taste of the smoked salmon.\n4. Ricotta with Dates and Pistachios - By the end of the night, he declared that this became our favorite bruschetta, evar! I think they toasted the dates a bit or something of that sort, but it was perfect. The pistachios weren't dry and the ricotta wasn't an overload. All three components made it tasted like sweet heaven in your mouth. When I think of bruschetta, I immediately think savory, but there's nothing wrong with a dessert bruschetta, right? I think not. The texture of this was just perfect. No complaints here!\n\nHe and I tend to order enough to feed 4 hungry men when we dine out. So we also called for the Panini -- the Vegetarian Panini on ciabatta to be exact. We had the side salad with crumb goat cheese. Meh, I didn't care much for this panini, maybe because I was already full off of the tasty bruschettas!\n\n\nThere's a $3 charge for Valet.

That said, mad props to Postino for preserving this landmark.\n\nToo be fair, I'm not a wine expert nor a frequent wine drinker.  If you are, you're more than covered at this neighborhood hangout.  The food, while a limited selection, is excellent.  I've had a couple of the paninis and the bruschetta and I've never been disappointed.  My favorites are the Turkey Panini and the Smoked Salmon and Pesto Bruschetta.  Light and flavorful and a nice complement to the Syrah I had.  \n\nThe atmosphere is very urban and industrial and is absolutely jam packed at night.  A little noisy at times for my taste as sometimes I've had to yell at my friends for them to hear me, but I pretty much expected that with the crowd this place draws.\n\nAll in all, a nice addition to the neighborhood.  Postino's reputation in the Arcadia neighborhood brought me in, and the good food and relaxed atmosphere has made me a believer.

Their soups and cheese platters are yummy too.\n\nBeware, parking stinks but they do offer complimentary valet during limited hours.", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-06-27", "type": "review"}

Pretty much the best thing you can order is the Bruschetta board because its SOOOO AWESOME! \n\nAs many other Yelpers with great taste have mentioned, a couple of the best bruchettas (although it's tough not to just order 2 boards and get them all- except the artichoke, that one should be avoided). \n\nHighly Recommended (I don't have the exact names down, but here's the main); the salami one, the one with fig, apples and brie (****BEST*****), the roasted red pepper and mozz/basil/tomato. \n\nThe first time you go, you may just have to order 2 boards if your party is big enough, because they are all so good, except for the artichoke one- that one is NOT good. \n\nThe wait staff does a great job, and I love everything about Postino! After writing this review I need go, like this weekend... Like now, wait, \"Can we go to Postino for lunch?\"", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-07-01", "type": "review"}

There's also a location in central Phoenix, which offers up all of the same.\n\nWhen I went there for dinner, I had one of my favortie paninis, the Nine Iron ($9.50), which came with a small side salad and was topped with tomato, mustard and mozzarella. It's very filling and tastes super-fresh, and the regular one comes with chicken and bacon, too.\n\nMy pal got the Italian Picnic salad ($8.50) and Tomato Jam and Sheep's Milk bruschetta ($12.75).

We went on Monday, when they have a $20 deal for a bottle of wine and a plate of bruschetta. The wine that they serve is their \"house\" wine, but it knocks the socks off of your typical house wine. The Bruschetta makes a great meal by itself if you want. There are 11 choices (various toppings) and you can have up to four different ones per plate (really a long-handled cutting board, which makes for a nice presentation). The Bruschetta is carefully sliced into smaller pieces so that several people can try each kind. Be prepared to eat and drink a lot; it is such a deal that you will have a hard time saying \"no.\"\n\nI mostly stuck to the beer that was on draft. There were only two choices, both very good. The draft beer was fresh and refreshing, plus at $7.50 for a small pitcher anytime it was quite a deal. If you come for the earlier happy hour it is $5/pitcher or $5 for a glass of wine, so you can't go wrong. It makes sense to have a small draft beer selection since they are a wine bar and it helps them move through the kegs quickly. I ordered the prosciutto with brie panini, which I had no trouble sharing with my friends. You get the choice of ciabatta or focaccia bread and fresh-made chips or salad- the chips and ciabatta bread were great. Our server helped me pick the ciabatta bread, which she accurately described as the \"thinner, crispier\" one for my panini.\n\nThe service here is amazing. Our servers were very patient and helpful. The busser would give any Indian restaurant a run for their money with his diligent water-refilling, plus he was thoughtful enough to get our server's attention if we needed anything else. Everyone was dressed nicely and very friendly. At one point a piece of bruschetta fell onto the table or the floor. Without even mentioning it, out server brought over a replacement. She must have noticed from somewhere else in the restaurant and wanted to help.\n\nThe restaurant had a very appealing atmosphere. Lights were dim, but not dark. The colors on the walls made it feel vibrant. Chairs and tables were comfortable, well-maintained, and fit in with the style of the restaurant. It might have been louder if we sat inside, but we were on the patio. Outside we sat in the shade (we arrived when it was still daylight) and the water misters helped keep us cool. The bathrooms are in the back corner, opposite of the front door. You might have to ask a server to point out where to go, but they are glad to help. The fact that the bathrooms simply say \"Both\" could be an interesting conversation point if you have to wait in line.\n\nThe parking is valet, but you shouldn't be driving anyway. Take a cab if you can help it, or bring a designated driver. The experience is so nice that you won't want to leave, unless maybe you make a friend to bring with you.", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-07-25", "type": "review"}

We went on a Sunday afternoon (right around 12pm) and had no issues with parking.  We scored a spot in front of the restaurant just as someone else was leaving.\n\nThe place was fairly busy and our party of two was immediately seated at a low table in the front (right by the acoustic musician).  Postino was well decorated and has a ton of seating options.  We wanted to fall in love with this place but just ended up liking it slightly. \n\nWe ordered the butchers block and the bruschetta plus cucumber lemonade and iced tea.\n\nWhile everything was okay, I wasn't knocked out of my socks.  My favorite part ended up being the butchers block rather than the bruschetta.  I think the issue that they have is that it is not crispy enough.  The bread was under-toasted and it made for a very chewy experience.  We ordered the Salmon pesto (the smoke flavor is weak and the pesto is strong so it misses there), Burratta, bacon, arugula and tomato (while our waitress claimed this to be her favorite, we were underwhelmed here too.  The bulk of the flavor came from the bacon and the arugula), tomato, basil and mozzarella (my favorite combo done wrong!  There was NO flavor to this and they should have at least provided an olive oil or balsamic drizzle to give it some pop.  The tomatoes weren't fully ripe either and were at the pink stage so they hadn't developed their true tenderness) and Prosciutto, fig and marscapone (by far our favorite since the flavor profile gave us a little bit of sweat, savory and salty).\n\nAll-in-all the place wasn't bad.  Based on the reviews though I just expected a wee bit more from my experience here.  I liked that they have live entertainment on the weekend although it makes it hard to hear when you are seated to close.\n\nI saw some folks sitting outside although I am not sure of how they survived in 110 degree weather.  On cooler nights though, I can see that being a nice place to hang.\n\nOh, I also didn't appreciate having to battle flies for my food.  They kept the door open which meant every critter wanted to beat the eat and join the tables. \n\nNot sure about returning as I've had this food concept before except with better execution.", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-08-08", "type": "review"}

The Arcadia location is in a cool neighborhood and the building opens up on one side to an outdoor patio... which is awesome on an evening with nice weather.\n\nI have to admit, I haven't tried very much from the menu.  Every time I come, the rest of the table and I order bruschetta to share and some wine.  Although I'm sure the rest of the food is great, I really do recommend bruschetta.  There are 12 different varieties to choose from, with everything from the classic tomato, mozzarella and basil to brie with apple slices to prosciutto.  Every single one is delicious.  They work well for one order for two people, so order accordingly.  For our group of 4, we got 2 orders.  With four varieties each, we got to try 8 of the 12 available.  It was easiest to say that we'd try one of everything, with the exception of the ones that had an ingredient someone at the table would prefer to skip.\n\nWe also split a bottle of wine, which complimented the meal very well.  Our server was knowledgeable enough to recommend a bottle based on what we were in the mood for, and he really hit the mark.  We were amused that the woman whose job it was to fill water glasses would come around so often that the glass never got below half empty.  It was almost too much, but hey, we stayed well hydrated.\n\nThe atmosphere is very \"cool\" with dim lighting, modern decor, and a definite wine theme throughout.  Service has been excellent each time I've dined here.  Those are perks for sure, but the bruschetta would keep me coming back anyway!  Check out any of the Postino's that may be near you!

I have been in the Phoenix area for a total of 7 days since January and I have ended up at various Postino locations 4 times in those days. That says a lot from somebody who normally would always try a new place instead of frequenting the same spot over and over. Here's why:\n\nFun vibe - casually bougie without the pretense (it's possible!). \nAwesome servers - attentive and personable without being annoying or overbearing.\nAmazing bruschetta - perfectly toasted with great combinations of toppings. I prefer the savory over sweet. \nExcellent wine and beer selections - they've got your standards plus the locals plus some unique options that'll keep you busy.\nPrice is right - I'll gladly share my student loans + interest with Postino, even after 5pm as I did last night with a group of friends.\n\nI will say the cheap Asian in me isn't a fan of the valet parking (it's not always there, though). They are lucky I'm too lazy to walk in the heat of summer. My mother would be so disappointed if she knew I paid for valet.  \n\nAs a new transplant just down the road, I have a feeling I'll be back many times.  For those of us busy during the day, I am so happy they have weekend happy hour and date night specials.

I'm sure by now you all have heard of the great Monday night deal which includes a bottle of wine and their yummy bruschetta, and it doesn't really matter what kind of bruschetta you get, because its all delicious so they are all good choices. Other than the good monday night deal, this is simply just an overall cool little quaint spot to spend a couple hours, especially great for a date. It's dark, and intimate, nice baby-making music playing in the background... \n\nNot too many drawbacks I can think of other than parking being limited, and since it is a fairly small location, it can get crowded quick.

They also usually have really delicious hearty soup and I love their salads and paninis. They have $5 glasses of wine before 5pm every day and their peach bellinis are perfect for Sunday brunch.

On the way back home from the airport my friend and I decided to stop for a nosh and wine.  When we got there late afternoon, we were welcomed immediately and cheerfully and seated promptly.  As soon as were seated, one of the wait staff brought us water and took our order for a bottle of Caparza.   It was a lovely Italian, a fill bodied Sangiovese Tuscan but not as murky as a Chianti.  It was delicious from the first sip to the last drop.  If you like Italian reds, this is a really good one.                                                                                           We next ordered our food and my friend ordered the bruschetta, I wanted a panini and settled on the autostrada.  One of Postino's delights is to choose your favorites when ordering the bruschetta s there are some wonderful choiced. He ended up with the salmon, caprese, artichoke and the green apple toasts. Each one offers a unique blend of flavors and no one does it better than Postino.  The Autostrada panini has all the right meats and cheeses but I am not a fan of the arugula and tomato.  I took those off and added them to my side salad and took a bite.  Each bite took me back to a stop I made on the way from Naples to Salerno where I had a similar panini with such wonderful flavors.                                                                                                                  The food and wine would earn this wonderful restaurant five stars but the Postino service by committee is not my favorite.

We are a Sunday Morning look for a great breakfast kind of people.  Our best friends told us that this place in the Arcadia district was now serving Brunch from 9AM and to check it out.  We arrived like 9:15AM with much apprehension as we were the only couple in the place.  The menu was limited but looked decent.  Oh My Goodness!  My wife ordered the Ciabatta French Toast.  Now she claims to just hate Ciabatta bread, but she was not in the mood for eggs.  ***** That was the 5-star rating she gave the dish as it was (as she admitted) the best French Toast she ever tasted.  I on the other hand always go for the biggest dish, so I ordered their Farm Scramble - Eggs, potatoes, onions,  \"secret\"  herbs of some sort and two kinds of cheese.  It came with a  salad of mixed greens and cherry tomatoes.  I had to take the salad even though I don't \"ever\" have salad for breakfast.  I moved the salad to one side and licked off the fork .... The best tasting dressing I had tasted in years.  So I finished off the salad (that I never eat) and dug into the eggs ... Yum Yum Yum, I now have a new favorite breakfast dish.  You want a Mimosa to go with the meal?  Order  up.  We are going back this Sunday with our friends and I would highly recommend it to everyone.  A couple at another table told us that if we thought that the Brunch was good, we should come in for dinner as those meals were out of this world.

Just order what looks good and they deliver it right to your table.\n\nStarted with the Butcher's Block Starter plate and an ice cold Italian Beer. It was beautiful and tasty at the same time.

There are so many choices.\n\nBrie & Apple with Fig Spread, Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, Warm Artichoke Spread, the yummy Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios and a few others that were not so great.\n\nWe all enjoyed anything with Figs on it. The plates were very colorful and the quality of the food was very high and fresh. Sounds like a good portion of their products come from right here in the valley. Nice!\n\nRecommend coming here during the day and not at night. The lighting is very dim and we had to use a flashlight app on my phone to see the food and menu. Maybe I'm justing getting too old for the late night thing.\n\nSeen other reviews saying that the best areas to sit are on the patio or right between the inside and outdoor seating area. Not sure how that works when it is a crisp 118 degrees outside. I bet the cheese starts melting rather fast.\n\nDefinitely a fun and enjoyable time. The Bruschetta is out of this world and a new favorite of mine. Looking forward to trying out some of the other locations.

Expectations may have been off, as we came here for a nice dinner, but this place probably should be treated more as a trendy appetizer or drink spot. Great atmosphere and service, and at one point could picture having a large group together on the large seating area in the back. Not really sure what I'm missing though, the bruschetta was good-not-great, and if you don't feel like a salad or panini for an entree, your options seem limited. For a trendy drinking hole, there could've been a few more than 4 beers on tap. As tasty as Deschutes River Ale is, there are usually more options in most other bars that offer any craft beer. Didn't take a serious look at the wine list this time around. Trying many different kinds of bruschetta in one order was a nice way to taste many things, and appreciate that they were trying interesting ingredients such as the tomato spread, but again, nothing I'll be remembering or craving. Would like to try the butchers block if there's another visit. Didn't try the dessert, as La Grande Orange is right next door, and our loyalties are there for sweets.

Without getting into details, management/ownership at Postino Arcadia is completely unprofessional.  The food is below average and the service is atrocious.

Today is my Birthday & thanks to them my day is ruined & I walked out crying & I still am.\nI called them on the 29th & asked if I could make a reservation. They said they don't take reservations & since it was a party of 3 it would be ok & won't be too full either as it's  a Tuesday .\nWe went to Postinos on College Avenue Tempe. They said our wait was 1 hour. We got there at 8.30.\nThen I called Postinos in Arcadia & told them we were at College Avenue & the wait was 1 hour & it was my Birthday & we didn't want to wait here outside in the heat & I asked if they were full as well & if there was a wait there as well. The guy who answered said there was no wait & they were not full & that the restaurant at College Avenue is always full. I told him we were heading  there & if we could put our name on the list. He said they don't take names over the phone.\nWe took 17 mins to get there & with parking I would say 20 minutes. \nWhen we went in the lady there tells us the wait will be 40 minutes. I had my old Mother also with us. She is 82 years. There was no place to even sit & wait. My Husband went in again to ask if we could sit somewhere & they tell us we can sit at the bar. The bar stools are so high & my Mother couldn't sit there, but we thought we will try as anything was better than standing in that warm air outside. When my husband came out & went back in with us, the lady says Oh! Someone just sat there so there's no space. She then says she will ask the Manager to talk to us.\nThen we asked if we could sit at the table outside, at least while we wait. We waited there for 25 minutes & couldn't take the heat anymore. Someone was nice enough to give us 3 glasses of water. The Manager never came out to talk to us.\nI was so disappointed & fed up. Tears just rolled down my cheeks as it was my Birthday & this is what I got. \nI couldn't take it anymore, I told my Husband let's just leave. I just wanted to go home.\nI went in & cancelled my wait & I told the lady please thank whoever answered the phone & said there was no wait. Thanks to him my Birthday Celebration was a total disaster. I asked her what happened to the Manager who was supposed to talk to us. Then she says she thought I said I didn't want to talk to the Manager.\nEverything was an excuse made for their benefit.\nShe says she didn't answer the phone & there was nothing she could do about whoever told me anything. I told her it was not her fault & that I was only telling her what happened, as she was the only one there.\nI even showed her my call log to prove I had called them. I then requested to speak to the Manager & explained to him what happened. He really didn't seem to care. He said from the time I got from College Avenue  to Campbell Avenue, they could get busy & there could be a wait. He said maybe when I called there was no wait but it got full in 20 mins. \nIt seemed unbelievable to me that in 20 minutes a whole restaurant just filled up so much inside & out & also caused a wait of 45 minutes. Just cannot happen.\nHe was not apologetic or didn't even try to check if he could get us a table or offer any options at all. He was very off handed & just couldn't be bothered. He didn't even check how long more we had to wait or ask us if we would want to wait a few more minutes. Nothing at all. He just seemed happy that it was 1 group less & he could wash his hands off. He Just said it is what it is.\nI walked out then & heard the Manager & the lady who seats Customers having a good laugh. It might be a laughing matter to them, but I want them to know that they ruined my Birthday. I planned so much & wanted to go there as that's always my special occasion restaurant. We went there for our wedding Anniversary for brunch & last year my Husband had a surprise party for my Birthday also at Postinos. I wanted it to be my Celebration there this year too.\nInstead I am now going to bed hungry as I just lost my appetite & I am so very sad. I came home & cried so much. It was past 9.30 & too late to get dinner from any place & I was not in the mood to sit & order. We went to a drive through & got some food for my Husband & My Mother.\nSo thanks to The lovely people at Postinos my Day, I planned so much for was ruined.\nI will never go back, as it will be bad memories.", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-06-30", "type": "review"}

I was so touched when The District Manager himself had replied the very next Day.\nI will certainly go back & I thank Mr.Cox for being so kind to me.

Your staff is so lucky to have you, & if they decide to take you as an example, I am sure the Manager who was there that night, would learn to be nicer to his customers & not laugh at them.

I was certain it was going to be one of my new favorite places. \n\nWe entered into a brightly painted orange restaurant and stood at the hostess stand for a few minutes waiting for the hostess to finish flirting with the server and notice us.  She clearly didn't want to be there and could care less where we sat, so opted for the table in the window.  \n\nWe sat and waited and waited and waited.  Tables that were sat after us already had their drinks and they were not busy.  Finally I tried to get the attention of the hostess who was standing half asleep at the hostess stand, mouth open wide, eyes half closed.  A few minutes later we finally had a server.\n\nOur server was not very friendly.  I don't even think she said good morning.  We ordered.  Tables sat after us already got their food and we finally got our drinks.  She bought out 2 cups of coffee, but I did not order coffee so I made her take that back. \n\nOur food finally arrived.  We ordered french toast which came with strawberries, bananas and a cinnamon sauce, eggs benedict with crab cakes and two orders of country potatoes. \n\nBreakfast was pretty good.  I enjoyed my crab cake and the cinnamon sauce on the french toast was a nice added touch.  The potatoes were not good, they had WAY too much pepper on them, I couldn't even eat them.  Gary ate a few of his after he drowned them in ketchup.\n\nWe never saw our server again.  We got a water refilled after we finished our meal.  AND THE WAIT BEGAN.  We waited and waited and waited for our check.  Tables that were sat when we finished eating had already finished their food.  We never saw our waitress. I guess we were her only table, if not I felt bad for her other tables as well. \n\nFinally some guy brought us our check and tried to drop it off and run, I said WAIT and gave him my card and said, \"If I don't give this to you now it may be 20 more minutes before we see someone again\"\n\nBecause I didn't look at the bill first when he brought it back I didn't notice until after I paid that they charged me $12.05 for the eggs benedict when their menu actually said $10.50.  I didn't say anything...  I just left a sad tip.\n\nWe were there for OVER an hour, they had lots of empty tables, and we only saw our server once.\n\nGary and I always over tip, because he and his family owned restaurants in the Valley for 35 years.  He has spent a lot of time being a chef and serving tables.  We know that when food comes out wrong, it's probably not the servers fault, and things happen, so we still tip well.

Taylor's is located on the NE corner of 44th St and Camelback and, if you want to find it quickly, you should turn into the complex when you see Cork 'N Cleaver.  Otherwise, prepare to drive around in circles wondering if the map on Yelp was wrong.  It's a little hard to spot at first.\n\nInside, you'll find a cute little cafe with cute little tables and a cute little patio.  It's so cute I could just squeeze it.  Seriously though, it feels exactly like a breakfast joint should.\n\nBut let's get to the good stuff: the food.  I'm a big fan of morning grub and Taylor's certainly delivers.  My first visit, I had a chorizo and egg dish that was perfectly cooked and reasonably priced.  More recently, I had the poached eggs with salmon which was a giant mouthful of delicious.  If I remember correctly, all the poached egg dishes were priced the same regardless of meat choice, so I had to make it count.\n\nI did knock off one star for the lackluster service we received on our most recent visit.  Still, if you're in the mood for some breakfast eats and the Good Egg sounds about as exciting as a Coldplay mixtape, give Taylor's a try.", "business_id": "UxvOXcoCRFRAVhRB0D9imw", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-07-03", "type": "review"}

So now on to my second dining adventure and I am still not impressed. \nThe place is cute, it has a great charm and ambiance, really a perfect setting for a causal breakfast or lunch. The food is decent, but nothing exceptional and extremely overpriced.. My first time I had the huevos rancheros and they really should have been called huevos gringos. The dish consisted of beans folded into a wheat tortilla with a fried egg and very bland tomatillo sauce, what side do you get for 9.25$ - chips...needing more than chips I added a side of potatoes ($3),  I split this dish and was charged ($2) without even being asked.. Bringing the total dish to $14.25.. Get real for breakfast? .  I compare this dish to Harlow's huevos rancheros.. there is $7.95 and comes with potatoes and beans and tortillas..\nMy second visit I ordered the \"create your own omelet\" for $10.75, this seemed high for an omelet but I went with it.. It was pretty good, but again the side... toast or a bagel, order the potatoes ($3) and another split plate charge ($2) without being asked.. Let me rant on this one for a moment.. They charge me $2 to cut my omlettee in half.. The bagel already comes sliced. LAME, bring it on one plate and I can cut it myself..it is not like we got double portions.. very annoying. So now the omelet is $15.95 ridiculous. Add an OJ.. $5 bucks! When most places have $3 mimosas on Sundays I found paying $5 for an OJ ridiculous. So in all Taylor's food is decent, but with so many good and lower priced options in the nearby area, I don't seem myself going back.", "business_id": "UxvOXcoCRFRAVhRB0D9imw", "stars": 2, "date": "2008-07-14", "type": "review"}

Oh, and what's with the charge for splitting a meal?

I ended up ordering an egg white omelet with asparagus, mushrooms, and cheese.\n\nThe food came out faster than I expected and I was certainly not going to complain about that.

Read my most recent review on how that went (ie, a bust.)\n\nWe stopped at Starbucks at the Safeway next to Over Easy and got our kids a pastry each while we figured out what we'd do.  I turned to trusty yelp on my droid and they said that not only was Taylor's Cafe open, they do breakfast, and they were only about a mile from where we were.  We decided to give breakfast one more try, called Taylor's and put our names on the list.\n\nWhen we arrived it was a little hard to find, but we called and they told us where it is.  The decor is cozy and inviting.  We waited at the bar for a few minutes while a table was readied, the manager was very attentive.  I told him what happened at Over Easy and he was horrified.  We live in Avondale, we're willing to drive for a good breakfast and also pay a bit more for good food and good service.  Let me tell you, Taylor's Cafe really turned the morning around for us!\n\nMy kids each ordered an apple juice, and one got chocolate chip pancakes, the other got strawberry waffles.  Their kids menu is $8 each, but the portions are huge, it's easily something an adult would put away.  I stole a bite from each, they were very tasty and there was enough for doggie bags.\n\nMy husband got a build your own omelet with 3 different cheeses and chicken sausage.  With his omelet he got 2 choices for sides, so he chose hash browns and cottage cheese (he almost went with a bagel but was pleased to hear about the cottage cheese.)  The chicken sausage was an interesting option that we had not expected.  He also ordered a mocha, which at $4 was about the size of what you'd get at Starbucks, and my husband said that it was on par with their quality.\n\nI ordered the Joe's special, intrigued by the list of ingredients.  It was flavorful and delicious.  The country potatoes were very tasty.  I ordered the homemade raspberry lemonade, it was tangy and sweet, really tasty on a hot summer day.\n\nWe came to the decision on 4 stars because the food was good, but not out of this world.  They have fantastic options for the health conscious, and it seems to be popular with the patrons of a local gym because there were tons of people coming in work out gear.  There is plenty of space (you don't feel like sardines in a can), the staff is polite, competent, and professional,  and the ambiance is nice.

I think I spoke too soon...\n\nThe food... uh... well, it is a hotel restaurant.  Translation: expensive and can be disappointing.  We visited on 2011-05-21 for dinner during restaurant week in Phoenix.  The special was one appetizer, an entree, dessert, and a glass of house wine for a fixed price.  As far as appetizers go, the calamari was good - lightly battered, warm, fresh.  The shrimp skewers were very disappointing; 3 shrimps standing up like feathers mounted on cubes of cucumbers.  Looked good.... until you realize that it is cold (looks hot), overcooked, and it's literally just 3 shrimps on this huge plate.  Not a good start.... but the glass of wine helps dull the senses...\nThe entree - we went for the steaks and fillet mignon.  Both were good size portions, properly cooked, but nothing special to write home about.  I've had better at other places in town.  I have to say the fillet mignon was nicely done; without it, I'd have dropped to 2 stars.  \nDessert -  we went for the lava chocolate cake.  Warm chocolate center flows out when you cut into the cake... it made up my shrimp appetizer.  \n\nOverall, I have mixed feelings about the experience.  Food had some good points and some bad points, but the price point - if not for the restaurant week special deal, it would have been a letdown.

Portion sizes were so humongous that I couldn't even finish more than 1/2 of either item.  The pancakes were delicious - and the waiter brought me margarine instead of butter and a sugar free syrup as well.  I can almost talk myself into believing that this was a guilt free breakfast, but not quite!\n\nService was fine... our waiter was sweet and i was pleased that everything arrived exactly as we ordered it.  3 stars because it's a chain but it's a consistent one at that - I would not hesitate to return!", "business_id": "p1ntTC9-CI6x5Y_nUoo6Ag", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-06-05", "type": "review"}

I was in a rush to try this place out this weekend before it closed.  (FYI, it closes every summer from June - September.)\n\nYou pull up to the place in the midst of this vast city of ours to find a huge, and shady (in a good way) farm before you.  At the Morning Glory Cafe, the small menu has just the right mix of items to please just about anyone.  Lots of veggie options to be had here, btw (Bonnie would DROOL with desire here).\n\nThe food is really incredible.  They had my favorite dish on the menu - croque madame.  It had eggs, and some delicious asiago cheese and black forest ham on some crusty artisanal bread.  Ahh.  It was missing the bechamel sauce, but it made up for it with freshly-grown asparagus.  How did they know that's my favorite veggie?  I attribute it to kismet, of course.  It was accompanied by some terrific oven roasted potatoes baked in some spices and oil.  Nice...\n\nThe patio is cute in a rustic way.  Think checker tablecloths and white plastic chairs.  Not exactly sexy, but hey, it fits in the grand scheme of the farm.  They have a self serve area for water, lemonade and tea.  \n\nThe mimosas here are the best part.  For only $7.50 you get your own mini champagne bottle and orange juice.  So you're getting the better end of the bargain with about a mimosa and a half! \n\nService here was a bit slow to start.  But after paying the check I spot a wandering blueberry scone that is calling my name.  (Even better, is their scones are featured in Cooking Light magazine too.  Man I love this place.) So I give in, place an order and ask for it to go.  She brings it out.  I ask to pay in cash, since she already ran my debit card, and she says \"Don't worry about it.\"  \n\nCLASSY.  Classy, with a C.  The scone was DELICIOUS, btw.  Nice touch, and I leave her an extra tip for it. \n\nPrices are higher than average for Phoenix.  Expect to throw down about $40 for two.  But let me tell ya, that will be the best $40 you've spent in a while. \n\nI am now eager to try the other restaurants here.

Being from the northeast and him from the Midwest, we feel starved for green grass, deciduous trees and rustic, wooden fences. The Farm really delivers those wonderful feelings of reconnecting with nature and socializing in an outdoor setting that doesn't feature poured concrete flower beds and overly watered tropical plants. \n\nFor wedding reception/ceremony: We used Mike Kennedy, the nondenominational officiant The Farm recommended for our ceremony, he was excellent. The staff at the Farm as well as Santa Barbara Catering (You must use them to be married here) were outstanding! Our guests said it was the best food they have ever eaten at a wedding, which is a huge compliment. We choose the grove (under the white tent in the pecan grove) for our reception (they have a few other locations to pick from depending on location on the property) and our ceremony was under the large wooden, vine covered arbor - perfection! As wedding prices go, it was definitely reasonable - no idea why the world thinks that in order to have a lovely wedding you need to drop oodles of loot - the Farm is a great option for nature lovers, people missing trees, grass etc, great food, amazing service and a memorable location for their wedding (it was actually less expensive than 90% of the hotel/buffet options out there)\n\nFood: there are three dining options at The Farm, Quiescence (fancy, high end dining) Morning Glory Cafe (breakfast/brunch), The Farm Kitchen - (lunch) I could write a novel here, but overall: the food is a little expensive (lunch is usually $10-$15/person with drinks or if you want desert tack on an additional $3-5 bucks) but it is very good, plus you get the great ambiance of dining under trees on a picnic table or in their little courtyard area. If it's busy prepare to wait awhile to order  and get your food (self serve, you gotta pick it up at the window when they call your number)\n\n For breakfast/brunch at Morning Glory expect similar pricing, but this is located towards the back of the property in a cozy little brick patio area - simple waiter service.", "business_id": "MLcXtnpzygZvQ9BtseLLlw", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-06-24", "type": "review"}

It was a lovely experience (from the environment to the service - having asked for my \"any style\" eggs to be hard boiled.  They didnt bat an eye at the request.) and I wanted to come back for Mother's Day with my family.   \n\nMother's Day - It's crowded.  I mean like WAY over 1+ hour wait for MG, crowded.  But that's understandable.  It was Mother's Day afterall.  If you want to come here for an event like the Mother's Day Brunch, reservations ARE required.  If you miss out on reservations for brunch, and decide to go to MG, go early!  \n\nWe decided to skip MG and were going to eat at The Farm Kitchen, but we ended up having to leave because Little C ended up having a major asthma attack.  We had used the valet service for parking, which offering valet on a busy day like Mother's Day is great.  BUT only if the service is organized.  We hustle back to the valet stand and I had over the ticket.  I look at the valet stand and there are key piled up everywhere.  No organization whatsoever.  They're digging for my keys, meanwhile Little C has just puked all over me for a 3rd time.  2 minutes go by and J and I ask them a couple times if they could please hurry and find our keys.  They find our keys and one kid runs off.  Next thing I know, the head guy (I'm guessing he was the guy in charge over valet), turns to us and says in a snarky manner...\"I'm SORRY your child is having issues.\"  \n\nUmm...excuse me?!  \n\nThank gawd they found the keys and got our vehicle up in a flash or else I would have had to not only call 911 for Little C's breathing, but for my putting my foot up that guys ass.   \n\nI think if we decide to come back, (which I'd like to go back because the atmosphere, service, and food at MG was great) we will self park across the street.", "business_id": "MLcXtnpzygZvQ9BtseLLlw", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-06-30", "type": "review"}

I know the French Dip ($5.99) sounds strange on a bagel, but it was surprisingly really good. The roast beef was decent, and the garlic bagel he chose added a little something special.

The lemonade was sugary goodness! The zucchini were fresh and hot and we read they were hand breaded. They came with a side of ranch and a side of marinara. They were well liked at our table.\n\nFor lunch, I ordered the pot roast sandwich with fries. Friend 1 ordered a salad with fresh fruit and chicken breast with a cup of corn chowder. Friend 2 had a chicken parm sandwich on ciabatta bread.\n\nFriend 1's salad came with a fresh baked muffin of her choice. She chose carrot cake. When all of our food arrived, Friend 2 ordered a muffin for fear of stealing an unapproved bite of Friend 1's muffin!\n\nMy food looked SO good when it arrived. I took a BIG bite of my pot roast sandwich. Booo.... SO BLAND! No seasoning whatsoever. What did they cook their roast in? Water? Just plain water? After doctoring my sandwich with creamed horseradish and salt, it was passable. The meat was tender and warm, but that's all it had going for it. It came on a thick sourdough bun which was good, but I ended up taking most of the bun off to just eat the meat, lettuce and tomato. The french fries were crispy and hot and the ranch I dipped them in was good! I'm very picky about my ranch.\n\nFriend 1's meal was \"eh...ok.\" She said the chicken and fruit was supposed to be on the side and not all cubed up. The corn chowder she got with her meal was tasteless. She said she didn't even taste the corn.\n\nFriend 2's meal was \"Decent\" he said that he was starving so he just wolfed it down, but his favorite part was the fries, not the sandwich.\n\nWe suspect, due to the \"older\" crowd we were surrounded by, that the lack of seasoning and the cubed bites of fruit were for their sake. \n\nWill we visit Mimi's again?

The service was good--the girl was nice (bc of an earlier review I was expecting the worst) and she told me the street tacos were the way to go.  I got the three tacos, one chicken, one carnitas, one steak (asada).  Plus rice and beans.  On corn tortillas.  And I got a sexy-looking bottle of coke.\n\nWhen the food came out, I was devastated.  Where my three tacos should have been, I had three walniut-sized excuses for tacos.  Where my beans covered in mexican cheese should have been, I got beans covered in an afterthought of some white cheese (which isn't what I wanted.  Sue me).  Where my rice should have been there was rice.  1 for 3.\n\nThe street tacos all tasted ostensibly the same.  That punk Guy Fieri on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives on Food Network made it sound like I'd wet myself with glee upon eating the carnitas, and the lady making the batch acted like they'd be good enough to keep part of the recipe a secret.  They aren't.  That recipe should be open source for sure, so that maybe someone can come along and improve it.  I certainly could.\n\nAnyway--maybe it was because he was high as a f*&^ing kite but the food did not taste like magic, it tasted like hot sauce.  And I am all for hot sauce--I'll bitchslap a habanero or two, no problem.  But the issue is that whatever I ate, it tasted like only the hot sauce.  I added green sauce--still the same flavor.  I wanted to be wowed, but instead I thought, \"Meh.  I've experienced better.\"  Which is why you see two stars here.\n\nIn fact, I don't blame Los Taquitos for doing what they do.  Whatever is fine by me.  But now I kinda wanna slew-foot Guy Fieri just that little bit more for telling me that this place was so good.  If you're gonna tell the world what's delicious, don't smoke out first, because I've been there and eaten a piece of my cat's litter and it tasted pretty decent to me at the time.  Hardly a reliable indicator of a culinary masterpiece.\n\nA couple of disclaimers: I don't hate Guy, I have no idea if he smokes out, I'm not judging him or you, stoner.  But I am judging that very average set of tacos.", "business_id": "rDvz5jX65gpfONFu7er9Tw", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-08-08", "type": "review"}

The room mate and I made the drive down one afternoon for some lunch hoping that the experience would make the 30 minute drive worth it. I was kind of surprised when we pulled up. From the outside it wasn't quite what I was expecting. The place is located in a strip mall and nothing really makes it stand out from the road...but figured maybe all the awesome was on the inside. \n\nWe get inside and there are quite a few people. There aren't too many tables and almost all of them were taken. I grabbed the only one available that someone had been recently sitting at and just cleared some of the mess left on the table away. I stepped up to the counter and placed my order for a chicken chimi. It ended up taking a bit longer than I would have expected, but when the food came out it was pretty good. Let me say this now, I'm comparing this place to the Filabertos and Rudolphos and etc. With that in mind, this place is great. The flavor of the chicken is unlike any you would find at those other locations I mentioned. If you compare it to that of items found at other diamonds in the rough, I think it falls short. It is for that reason I give this place 3 stars. If I lived closer to this place I'd eat here on a regular basis I'm sure since the food is not at all bad and the prices are worth it, however I'm not sure why this place ended up getting a spot on triple d.", "business_id": "rDvz5jX65gpfONFu7er9Tw", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-08-11", "type": "review"}

I put this on par with Si Senor and Rosa's Taco Shop but... more casual if you can get more casual without losing clothing.  My favorite was the tacos - the street carne tacos are so well seasoned. And the refried beans - unique taste and very flavorful. And for $6 I got a plate of food that filled me for two meals easy.  I actually didn't see the Diners drive in's thing until we sat down and saw the painted stamp that Guy put on the wall. I had seen this in a few other places in town which was a good sign.

Whether, Chinese, Mexican, Greek.  We are open for anything.   I checked out this place on Yelp for reviews and all of them were great.   I was looking forward to finding a \"gem\" of a Mexican restaurant.  We all agreed that the dishes were mediocre.  It wasn't the cleanest place either.  I ordered my usual chicken enchilladas  with green sauce.  Very tasty and a little different.  They marinate the chicken, pork, and beef which makes the chicken, pork and beef a little bit mushy.  The rice was tasty though.  My other half ordered the chille relleno which was also a little bit different from what we are used to.  It was served in a brown sauce with cheese, onions, and diced potatoes.  Pretty tasty. He also had a lengua (tongue) taco. Small but also very tasty. There is no waiter service.  You go up to the counter and order.  I'm not crazy about the plastic plates, but no tipping is a good plus.  We went for lunch about 2.00PM and the place was crowded.  So obviously lots of people enjoy this place.  The menu was plentiful with lots of choices.   I understand the place was featured on Diners, Drive-Ins-and Dives.  I guess you could label this place in the Dive category.  Prices were quite reasonable.  All and all, if you like Mexican Street food, Los Taquitos might fit the bill.

I was turned on to Los Taquitos by a friend who, despite certain dietary restrictions, will indulge in the tacos here when she needs her street food fix.  Coming from California, I have been mystified and befuddled by the lack of good, cheap Mom-and-Pop Mexican food joints in the Phoenix Metro Area.  It seems that when I have gone out exploring, I have been completely disappointed with bland, underseasoned, cafteria-style Mexican food that seems to be de rigeur in these parts.  This is not the case with Los Taquitos.\n\nThe food here is a tremendous value.  You spend no more than you would at any other Mexican food hole-in-the-wall, but the flavor and attention to texture and food preparation is exceptional.  The hard-shell tacos have the proper jaw-rattling crunch, and the meat is well-seasoned and tasty.  They don't require too much hot sauce because they are so savory on their own, but the house-made green and red sauce condiments, add the perfect amount of heat and brightness.  I have also sampled the carne asada burrito, served enchilada-style (i.e., smothered in red simmer sauce), and found it to be spot-on as far as texture and taste.  The flour tortilla is soft and sturdy, whereas the beef is toothsome and appropriately salty and spicy.\n\nI fear that I have been ruined for all other quick-and-dirty Mexican food joints after eating here.

I ordered the Chicken and Dumplins no \"g\" in dumplins cuz were tryin to be authentic here. for my sides I ordered the Fried apples and steak fries. Okay the dumplins are not like my mommas these are the noodle flat kind of dumplins but they also had no flavor. I had to douse them with salt and pepper to get flavor into them. The fried apples were the best part of the meal. Also you get your choice of bread, I love corn bread so I picked that. My wife picked the buttermilk biscuit. I should have taken the Buttermilk Biscuit. Maybe my taste buds took a vacation but the cornbread had no flavor at all, She ordered the grilled chicken tenders mashed potatoes and Fries. She said all of her food was good, she asked me if I wanted to try them but I told her it might mess up my review of the restaurant.

I frequent quite a few different Einstein's locations in the Valley, as I am all over the Valley for work.

I ordered from the first line (where they take your order) my \"usual\"- cinnamon sugar bagel toasted with honey butter and cinnamon sugar on top. There were 4 employees on the \"line\", one taking my order, one putting paper in baskets by where you pay, and another one restocking the self-serve chiller in the middle. I proceeded to move over to the \"paying\" line and sat there as the employee putting paper in the basket just looked at me, not acknowledging that I was waiting to pay. The lady restocking the chiller (who was the only decent employee I had during this visit) came over and said that someone would be right with me. Nobody came to ring me up, so she went to the back and got someone to ring me up. I filled up my drink and turned around to see my bagel JUST going into the toaster, as 4 employees on the line talked and kidded with each other. My bagel popped out of the toaster and Zach (I found out his name later when I called to complain) took the bagel out of the toaster and set it on the counter. He then turned to a fellow employee and started chatting with him. When there was a break in the conversation, he spread butter on my bagel. It was apparently one of the employees' last day and she was leaving work. So Zach stopped making my bagel to say goodbye to her and chat with her before she left. All my bagel needed was cinnamon sugar sprinkled on top...as I sat there and waited. \n\nI finally stepped up and said, \"Hey guys, can I get my bagel? I have been waiting for a bit.\" Zach turned to me and replied \"You have only been waiting for 3 minutes and 51 seconds.\" Obviously, this didn't sit well with me, so I responded, \"Well there are a bunch of you standing around doing nothing and I am the only customer in here\". He finally gave me my bagel and I left.\n\nI called later and spoke with the shift manager who clearly remembered me. He explained to me that he would \"talk to\" Zach about his inappropriate/disrespectful response to me and that they are the 4th busiest Einstein's in the Valley. Funny, because I have been to busier locations who served me quicker and treated me with respect. Calling and speaking with the manager didn't accomplish much, so I will be calling corporate (1-800-BAGEL ME for anyone else who needs it).\n\nIN SUMMARY: long wait times, employees standing around not helping customers (like the other reviews), bad traffic flow, disrespectful employees\n\nTHE ONLY GOOD THING GOING for this place was the bagel was decent...hence the one star.\n\nI wonder how many people/reviews saying the same thing it is going to take before the store manager and corporate step in?", "business_id": "IYWTOj970XqG2z9Xft_8SA", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-07-01", "type": "review"}

Being the awesome wife that she is she remarked on it and proceeded to cut them up to eat anyways. As she was doing so, our server (Hope M.) approached and asked if her eggs were undercooked. She explained that she also eats them over-medium and saw that they were not perfect and already put in an order for perfectly cooked eggs. My wife and I were both impressed that without any complaints, the server paid so much attention to us that she noticed a little dissatisfaction and acted to remedy the situation.

The first time we were there we enjoyed it and thought the food was great, but this time around was just a bad experience with a horrible waitress.  My boyfriend order a coke and I had an ice tea with a lemon in it, and the slice wedge lemon was old and smelled like it was sitting in a fridge for awhile uncovered and the coke was warm and flat and the ice was melting away already, but she did take the coke back and brought out a new one.  Than I ordered the chicken fried steak with broccoli and mashed potatoes and it is suppose to come with a biscuit too, but instead I received Texas toast, which disappointed but ok with, however the waitress never even said anything why I received Texas Toast rather than a biscuit.  And my broccoli was cold and by the looks of it old too, did not taste very well either.  With my meal it was either a soup or salad and was not offered either and didn't even have the chance to tell her which one I wanted too.  So did not get my soup or salad. My boyfriend just had a turkey sandwich with a Cesar salad and the sandwich, which he said was ok. The waitress dropped our food off with the ticket and we thought that was rude and didn't say a word after. She never came back to refill his coke or my ice tea or even to check on us if the food was ok or if we needed anything and after we finished our meal we sat there for seven minutes until she finally came by and asked if we were going to order pies... umm yeah we wanted two slice of pies and with a new ticket she came back and seeing our cups were empty we hoped she would come back to refill our drinks but no. We ate our pies with no drink. We both sat there thirsty waiting for her to come by at least so we can tell her we would like a refill or water but she never did. My boyfriend did not finish his pie because he needed something to drink because the peanut butter pie was overly sweet and sticky in the mouth.  Hard to finish without liquid.  We were  disappointed, plus the other waitress for the table behind us was amazing she was great too bad she was not our waitress.  top it all off they were not busy and we kept seeing our waitress doing nothing and walking back and forth in the back doing nothing too and tended to another table more than us. And the other table was just one guy that was a regular there. We waited to see if she would at least stop by our table to check up on us but never did once so we just got up and paid for our meal and left!! Just horrible service and not so great food at this Village Inn.  It is not a very hard job to be a waitress and serve your customers and make sure they are satisfy and have what they need and drinks filled, but apparently its hard for her.

However, no longer will that be the case. Deciding to go here for my birthday breakfast we come in and get seated in the back by the kitchen. Being an non-average looking couple, we expect that seating placement by the kitchen to be from places who really don't want us there. I should of used my experience to know this was the first red flag and leave. Took a long time for anyone to come over to get our drinks. I guess its really hard to see an odd looking couple in the back corner by the kitchen. Finally the manager comes over and asks if we were served yet. Nope. So he took our drink orders and came right back with our drinks. Then we waited. And waited. And waited.\n\nFinely our waitress comes over and takes our orders. Being my birthday I was really craving crepes. Its something I only get on special occasions. I was really excited to get them. It was closer to lunch time so my husband ordered a sandwich. She took our orders and left us to wait. Wait, wait, waiting. Bummer the service is so slow today. I was in no hurry so I could wait. Bet those crepes are going to be great!\n\nAbout a good 25 minutes later, our waitress comes over with my husbands sandwich. And before she places it on the table she informed me that there are no crepes left and will be an additional 15 minutes before they could get any more and make them.\n\nWait, what? Ran out? On my birthday of all days? Couldn't you have told me that 45 minuets ago? Before we put the time in the sit there and enjoy the Village Inn kitchen ambiance? Really? \n\nMy husband refused his sandwich and we left. So disappointed. On my birthday too. Sigh.", "business_id": "dbh72sNyNeHUgJqQye9Vbg", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-07-08", "type": "review"}

Denny's is never on the list for a breakfast spot, but since we were on a job that was miles away from anything but a Dennys, we decided...What the hell. First off its always annoying being seated at a table between two huge families full of bratty, carpet munching, screaming children when the rest of the entire restaurant is empty..Browsing the menu in which even in the pictures of the food, the food still looks shitty... in rolls a man in a wheelchair with his leg literally sawed off at the knee. It wasnt bandaged or covered, just there for everyone to enjoy over breakfast. Our waitress hobbles over and we are assuming she is pulling a double after working the night shift. I order the 2 egg breakfast and my hubs orders the western omelet. When the food comes it seems not only the plate, my coffee cup and the food are all the same color. There is no color, no flavor, and no life to this food. Basically whatever ihop throws away, dennys recooks  and serves it to customers. So we are sitting there basically separating our food with forks, and even only after taking a few bites I wish to God I could force myself to throw up. Slowly my energy is being sucked out of me as my body tries to digest this salted load of crap...when the raging gas begins.

To summarize, it was a disappointment.  The coffee was the best part of the meal.  \n\nThe waffle was a bit overdone, thin, and just looked plain sorry.  The waffles at the Best Western complimentary breakfast beat the pants off this one.\n\nThe \"butter\" wasn't butter, it was some gawd-awful corn oil based \"spread\" with an unnaturally dark yellow color.

There were 2 other customers in the restaurant & 3 crew members working - 2 servers and a cook. \n\nThe food took twice as long to arrive as usual.  The waffles were burnt, there were eggshells in the eggs, the toast was cold, and food items were forgotten.\n\nWhen we received the bill, the amount was $15 more than usual, yet we had not ordered anything different from previous visits.  We observed that possibly this was because they had itemized every single food item instead of grouping into meal specials as regularly advertised on the permanent menus.\n\nI had to leave early with a few of our children.  My wife stayed behind to pay for the bill.\n\nAfter my wife requested they re-calculate the ticket, the servers were surprisingly rude.  They said that their manager told them that they were not allowed to combine items into the meal deals and they refused to accomodate our request.  My wife was more upset about their poor attitude in their reaction rather than the actual initial concern of being overcharged.  \n\nThe staff's unprofessional and rude interaction (combined with the longer-than-normal wait times and poor quality food) was the main reason why my wife was so upset when she left the restaurant. \n\nThis is by no means the average experience that we have had as regular customers.

Too many poor experiences have colored what good things I have to say with them.\n\nThe GOOD: \nThe food is typically and consistently good. Some of the gems on the menu are the turkey dinner, the onion soup, and the scallops with mushroom ravioli. The bread -- carrot walnut, dinner rolls, and occasionally banana -- are a treat.\n\nThe BAD:\nThe service is horrific. A couple of waitresses are ok, but most are slow. They regularly screw up orders and make us wait forever for a first greeting at the table or a drink refill.\n\nThe seating is also frequently a problem. We (two adults) have been seated at a small table between two big tables full of screaming kids, despite the restaurant being only half full. The half-moon shaped tables are also very uncomfortable because they are too big for the booth space. You are guaranteed to end up sitting on (and pulling out) the too-long table cloths.\n\nSome of the food is an issue. They rely too heavily on Thousand Island dressing (which is awful in a breakfast sandwich). Other dishes do not have all their ingredients revealed on the menu -- such as green onions, which my boyfriend hates, and nuts, which I can't eat.\n\nOverall, Mimi's is ok for an occasional meal during a quiet hour, but I wouldn't recommend them to anyone.", "business_id": "qLXxp0rpzT4kG9tT3wZwfA", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-08-08", "type": "review"}

I was initially interested by the crabmeat Eggs Benedict but when it came it tasted just like fish, not crab and it was short on hollandaise. Overall it was average except in the price - the final bill for 2 breakfasts (even \"fancy\" ones) and coffee came to about $25, which seems like a lot to pay. Ok, way too much for breakfast.

Of course, I filtered by \"Open Now\" and it was Sunday morning.  Crackers is our default breakfast spot in Mesa, so to Crackers we headed.  I don't even know why I look at the menu, because I always get the \"Breakfast 222\" (scrambled).  It's 2 eggs, 2 slices of bacon or sausage, and two ginormous pancakes.  The service is super-fast, and the portions are huge (as evidenced by the number of obese patrons).  The food is yummy, and they keep your beverages full.  We noticed a sign twirler for Crackers on the corner of Country Club and Iron, and we were a little surprised, because you usually have a brief wait for a table there on Sunday morning.  Today, we were seated right away, and there were several empty tables.  This is NOT typical of Crackers, and potential guests should probably expect a short wait.  Crackers serves breakfast and lunch.  I've had lunch there once or twice.  My friend had the soup, and was not impressed.  I'm not a big salad and sandwiches type person, so I'd pass on lunch there again, but I will always recommend it for breakfast.

We have been there at least six, if not seven times, and they have yet to disappoint. \n\nYelp won't let me type all of the wonderful things that I feel about Crackers, so I am going to make a quick reference list:\n\n1. The California Eggs Benedict (without tomato) will change your life. I have gotten this every time I have been to Crackers.\n2. The blintzes that you eat at Crackers will be the best you have ever tasted. I always want to order 15 to go.\n3. I have never had to wait for longer than 5 minutes at Crackers. Even though they get super busy, they are incredibly efficient and make sure you don't have to wait forever.\n4. The food comes out fast and hot every time we have ordered it. Don't know how they do it, but they do.\n5. I have also tasted the steak eggs benedict (yummo), the New Princess (yummo), the apple pie french toast (not my favorite, but still yummo), and the mexican skillet (HOLY YUMMO).\n\nSeriously. The boyfriend and I adore this place and are continuously pleased when we go there.

Food came out quickly, had good presentation and was hot! I felt the crab cakes were not the best I've ever had but the hollandaise was super flavorful. Peach pancakes were just what I expected, which means they were delicious. They served a peach infused maple syrup which I found a little too close to Peach Schnapps (bad memories) but my girlfriend loved it.

Its hard to explain, but i guess if you are ever in the area, you may see what i am trying to explain in words.

It sounds delicious and could have been the perfect breakfast to start the morning. I was looking forward to my breakfast until i tried to cut the egg. In a benedict, the eggs are poached and a little runny. So when you cut/break the egg yolk, you will see the yellow lava flow out. that would be a perfect poached egg.

We came from Los Angeles to visit with my brother, and HOLY SMOKES! This place rocks! Why don't we have these in LA?!\n\nIt was too hot to cook, so we needed to find a restaurant. I was a little hesitant to try them, because I live off of Yelp reviews, and the ones for this locations are not so good. But one of the girls travelling with us desperately wanted to go here, so we gave in.\n\nBeing the weirdoes we are, we all decided to go to the restaurant wearing ridiculous hats and speak in different accents. We had a train conductor who said \"choo choo\" after every sentence, an Australian explorer, a Russian spy, a hillbilly, and a Texas cowgirl. We were seated right away with no judgments, which already was amazing, as I'd judged myself. haha!\n\nThe waiter LARRY was super nice; took our drink orders, and didn't question our strange appearances or bad accents. When asked where I was from, I panicked and confessed that we were just dorks having a fun family outing... He loved it, barked a laugh, admitted he thought the \"choo choo\" girl was kind of strange, and went on to have a great conversation with us. Turns out Larry is fricken awesome. :)\n\nThe food was OMG good! I had the chicken fried chicken with macaroni and cheese, apples, and mashed potatoes. Seriously delicious! It was a huge serving, so I took over half of it home with me, and cost less then $10! My daughter got the sampler plate with meatloaf, ham, and chicken & dumplings.... all 3 were delicious! Definitely not something you'd want to eat when counting calories, but we were on vacation, so it's ok. :p\n\nThe ambiance is super cute. Old antiques gave it the country vibe, tables were clean, and there were little games on the table you can play while you wait for dinner! There was a country store at the entrance selling all sorts of knick knacks, tshirts, old fashioned candies, etc. We didn't buy anything, but had fun exploring the store and seeing all they had to offer!", "business_id": "g5csdtYUt97hkexFMCVf-g", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-07-16", "type": "review"}

But my wife and I agree that the one in Casa Grande is a hidden gem. \n\nThe food quality is good for a chain restaurant. The menu is varied. Sure, there are a lot of disgusting, unhealthy items on the menu. But I am a vegetarian on a diet and can always find meals that suit me just fine. And the food is usually fresh. For example, I ordered a bowl of mixed fruit, which I normally am hesistant to do at a restaurant. But this fruit obviously had been freshly cut.\n\nWe have always found the servers to be friendly and attentive. One time we went there on my wife's birthday so that she could get the free birthday Grand Slam. She also ordered a malt, as I recall, and the server brought me one too--just to be nice. Of course, it didn't help my diet, but it was a nice surprise.\n\nFew restaurants offer better value, particularly if you're old enough to take advantage of the 20% AARP discount after 4 p.m. And yes, there are a lot of old folks in Casa Grande, most of whom seem to eat at Denny's. If that bothers you, don't go there. But we like old folks.\n\nLast time we visited the Denny's in Casa Grande, we were pleased to see that it had been newly remodeled in a retro theme. That is cool.\n\nOf course, the customer experience at Denny's varies greatly depending on the restaurant. But we feel that the Denny's in Casa Grande is one of the better ones.", "business_id": "Mx_IcFzTaPiPMm5SQY743w", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-06-27", "type": "review"}

From the chrome interior, with the puffy red booths and jukebox stations to the overwhelming menu and cheap prices, this place is a winner.

The staff is overly friendly and ready to keep your coffee cups filled to the rim! Oldies rock? Check. Milkshakes?- yes they make 'em fresh and with real ice cream. The classic diner checklist is pretty full with this one.\n\nI've eaten breakfast and lunch at Chase's. Let me give a quick review of the plates I ordered. The egg salad was fresh, with just enough mayo and placed atop toasted bread of your choosing. The side options were plentiful but I stayed with french fries. The grease-o-meter reading was relatively low with this order. For breakfast I stick with the 2-egg meat combo. So 2 scrambled eggs, hash browns, bacon and toasted rye. Greasy town! The bacon was literally dripping with diner grease- stuck some napkins on there to soak it up! Order lots of water with this meal- may save your tummy from a future disaster.\n\nCome here for the atmosphere and friendly people. You can decide if you want to stay for the food. ;-) It;s your typical diner fare- cheap prices and decent food.

I had some great takeout over the weekend from Mucho Taco.  I ordered a carnitas taco, the Chimi de Asada, and a churro.  \n\nI was a little nervous as I walked in because I've heard this place is pretty authentic and the only Spanish I know is from watching Sesame Street.  But the young woman working at the front counter smiled and greeted me right away, which put me completely at ease.  \n\nAfter I placed my order I had time to look around and this is really a cute place.  Very clean, and I like the d\u00e9cor on the walls and the painted tiles.  It's small, but really has a nice atmosphere.\n\nMy food was ready in about 10 minutes and as I drove home the first thing I noticed was how good it smelled.  Oh my...the whole car smelled like carne asada and rich, seasoned enchilada sauce.  (They serve their chimis enchilada-style).  \n\nWhile I was unpacking it, one nice little touch I noticed was that someone stuck a tortilla chip between the guac and the sour cream just to keep them apart for transport.  It may end up a rich gooey mess on my plate, but it's not going to start out that way.  That made the presentation very nice when I opened the container.\n\nThe carnitas taco was small, street taco style and had a very good flavor, but the meat was slightly dry.  I added a few chopped tomatoes and a little guac and it was perfect.  I would definitely get that again.  \n\nThe chimi was full of delicious carne asada.  They really know their stuff here.  The meat was good quality and so tender it melted in my mouth.  I had half for dinner and then the other half the next morning with an egg on top.  DEE-licious!  \n\nAnd the churro was a nice sweet way to end the meal.  My total before tip was $10.42.  I was very impressed with the attention to detail and the flavors.  The enchilada sauce had a great blend of seasonings that was way better than any I've had before.   I look forward to trying more items on their menu.

Unfortunately the quality of the food and service has been truly awful for about the last year. I keep trying because I remember all the good meals we've had there but the last 3 times have been so awful that I will not be back. Ordered an old favorite..pot roast. It came out cold and dried out. Next time I ordered the beef bourguinon which turned out to be cold dry pot roast with a wine sauce poured over it. I was offered another choice so I took the pork chops. They came out in about 5 minutes raw. The manager came over and said she was sorry and that I wouldn't be charged for the meal. No kidding.  Last week I tried again. This time I ordered fish and chips because my wife told me she would divorce me if I ordered anything remotely related to pot roast. The fish came out overcooked and dried out which required tearing it apart rather than breaking apart in like most flaky fish does. I ordered garlic sweet potato fries with the fish which turned out to be cold soggy non garlic fries. When I questioned the waiter he told me that sweet potato fries were supposed to be soft cuz they don't fry crispy. I told him to ask the kitchen to try again which they did and were delicious the second time.

So I went alone on a Sunday morning around 9:30 & sat at the bar area.  The atmosphere was great.  The restaurant was full of people which led me to believe that it was a awesome place (I love packed establishments more than empty ones).  I didn't have to wait to be seated at all.  \nI had to take a considerable amount of time looking at the menu because I hadn't the slightest clue what I wanted or craved.  Finally I ordered something that was not exactly on the menu, but it still had the basis of what I wanted.  I wanted a Skillet with country potatoes, scrambled eggs, bacon, ham, & cheese.  That's it.  Nothing else.  The waitress, Yvette, was so helpful.  She created my order on the ticket anyway & the way I like it.  She said I can order the skillet however I want it.  Wow.  No one says that anymore.  Most restaurants always tell me if its not on the menu then they can't make it.  Rubbish!  Of course they can, they're just being lazy & don't feel like asking the cooks to make something non-standard.  But not The Good Egg.  These guys will please you.  Now just don't go asking for an egg with a Filet Mignon on the side because that would just be dumb.  My requests are always within reason or within the bounds of good sense or practicality.\nI opted for the choice of English muffin as an included side.  I almost always drink apple juice if I'm eating a breakfast meal, whether it be at home or out.  I didn't want to overdo it on my bill so I stayed with the refreshing water they have.  I don't know if it's filtered but it tasted like it was.\n\nAlso I wanted a side item like a slice of french toast, but she said it would have been $3.50 or higher for one slice.  I told it her it must be huge.  She said yeah they are normally pretty big.  She told me if I just wanted something smaller I could get one pancake for a buck.  Of course I took the one pancake because that's all I needed.\n\nSo I got my food in a good amount of time & was marveled by the sight of my skillet.  It looked so good.  It was a decent temperature, the eggs were cooked to order in my style (hard scrambled), the potatoes were seasoned just right, the bacon & ham was scattered all over, & all mixed in with melted cheese.  I ate well that day.  The English muffin was nice with the gourmet strawberry jam that was there for me to grab.  The pancake was not small.  It was huge!  For a buck?!  Whoa.  It was buttery & of course I plastered it with syrup.  It was a nice touch on the side of my lovely skillet.  I couldn't even finish everything.  The skillet has a lot of food in it!  \nLike I said before, Yvette was sweet & gave me everything I needed.\n\nWhen it came time to pay, I handed my free voucher to Lisa, the front greeter/seater, who sat me.  She looked it over & saw what I had for breakfast & decided it would all be covered under the free meal voucher.  So NICE of her!  I mean, I didn't order much, but still, that was nice of her to include the pancake as well.  I love this chick, already.  :-)\n\nSo my Sunday turned out to have a real good start to it.  I had a nice chat with the nice woman at the front counter, Selena, about how I never do this type of thing, which is go to a full service breakfast restaurant & eat well, & ALONE to top it all off.  I mean I used to go to the \"Hop\" & the \"Den\" all the time but that was because other people always dragged me to those places by force.  Now this, here, is a place you would not have to drag me to.\n\nAll in all, the staff is on top of it.  Everyone working here is friendly, UNLIKE the rest of Arizona, or Phoenix, or wherever this general meanness originates from!  People in this state are always angry at something or I think the heat is getting to them!  Nope.  Not at The Good Egg.  This is good old Texas style hospitality.  The employees at Good Egg don't act like you are bothering them, but instead like you are a pleasure to have as a guest of honor.  \n\nThank you, Good Egg.  There was no way I was going to let this one go by without being mentioned on this website.  Yelpers, read carefully: This is good.  \nThe name suits them well.", "business_id": "oSDf6BHiMlKGZdFFmIo6NQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-08-02", "type": "review"}

However, it was about 1 pm and I wanted lunch so I order a club sandwich with a side Caesar salad.

Where do I start...\n\nFirst off I'll say that I'm pretty fair when it comes to eating out. I've lived around the globe and have eaten things that would make most people... well, you know.\n\nBut sometimes there are places that have strikes against them right from the get go. Such was the case with Lulu's Taco Shop.\n\nThe restaurant was well kept with the usual Mexican decor strewn about the walls.  Mariachi music filling the room. Tables, chairs yada, yada, yada. Nice place for a taco shop.\n\nNow the strikes -\n\nStrike One: \n As another poster noted, 75 cent charge on all cards. ALL CARDS? Not a huge deal but a ding none-the-less. Fortunately I had some cash on me (which is unusual). Yes, I know the burden of paying that fee falls on the restaurant but that is made up in the cost of goods rendered is it not?\n\nStrike Two:\n My wife and I ordered the taco plates (two tacos, rice & beans). When asked if we would like chips and salsa with that I replied \"sure!\" To which the young lady behind the cash register said \"That'll be $4.00\" O.o??? Four bucks? For chips? They weren't even freshly made chips! Needless to say, after all was said and done, I got out of there $24.00 short of cash. For that I could have eaten at Arriba's and been served my food and have all you can eat chips, salsa and bean dip. At Lulu's you pay a high price and are still expected to get up and get your meal when they yell out your order. Just rubbed me the wrong way.\n\nNot happy so far....\n\nStrike Three:\n Location. If it wasn't for the fact that one of the best restaurants in Gilbert is literally 50 feet to the south, it may not have been so bad but as I sat eating my (ahem) $4.00 little basket of store bought chips, I kept looking over at Flancer's wishing for a Chili Verde Birdie Turkey sandwich. That was almost unbearable.\n\nOne other little thing that I noticed was their beef is obviously grass-fed and not corn-fed. You get the distinct smell of hay or a stable as you chew your meat. Maybe it was just me but it was definitely there.\n\nAll in all, Lulu's is just okay. Not terrible food-wise but for what you pay, service could have been way better. Will I go back? Probably not. You'll find me 50 feet to the south.... ;-)\n\nCheers!\nShawn", "business_id": "CRvVvR6aE1eWVRtzQ0UC6g", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-06-11", "type": "review"}

Salsa was very flavorful if you like slightly bad to real bad.\n3rd Strike - We both ordered the Super Fish Taco and the counter person (CP), I call her that because that is where she works and there is no one else in the place, and that's where she stayed, except I think the cook in the back who dishes the food out of some nondescript container. CP was pleasant and suggested the \"grilled fish\" instead of the breaded because the grilled fish was, Mahi Mahi , if that was Mahi, I'm Capt Ahab and this was Moby Carp. \nThe fish tasted like something out of  a 3 day old hand cart from the back streets in Tijuana, and I'm sure that would have a better flavor.\n4th Strike - \"Oh that's right you only get 3, oh what the &(*), here goes anyway, since we won't be back and I can't imagine how they survive.  The rice was not even eatable, the re-fried beans were slimy, and both were slightly, and i use this term carefully, warm.\n\nI have had wonderful Guadalajara style food, it is great experience and this wasn't Guadalajara it was not even a good.

I also tried their cinnamon roll which was A-OK. Not the most amazing pastry i have ever had in my life but it was Okay.  \nAs much as i love eggs and scrambles  you would think this place would get 5 stars but i just love my crispy potatoes and eggs and meats at Crackers and Co SO much more. From what i can remember of the farmhouse with my very very late review i just don't remember The farmhouse blowing my mind. =\\\nAs far as service goes they did an Okay job as well. Nothing stellar or over the top just your average every day get in get out kinda service.

No hanging out in the aisles, or else you block the servers!  Despite being crazy busy, we were waited on almost immediately.  No problems there.

The veggies were cooked but NOT over cooked like so many places do and you end up with mushy veggies and that's just no good. The egg did not have a single brown mark on it, it was a moist and delicious adventure of flavor.\n\nNext up was a side of the ham and bacon.

We stood there for a minute...or three and everyone just stared at us like we did something wrong. We looked down and there was a chair next to the entrance with menus. Ohhh, must be seat yourself. We took menus and sat down, at a table which turned out to be dirty with crumbs, and water from old soft drinks. You didnt notice it until you sat. We watched as waitresses finally emerged from the back. They glared angrily and just walked past us. Im sorry, did we do something wrong? Eventually, after seating two tables that walked in, immediately by the way, a lady came over. She apologized, not for not seating us, not for walking past us repeately without helping us, but for the dirty table. We almost walked out, but decided we will give them one last shot. At least the mystery was solved, wait all day for the rude servers to seat you!\n\nWe both had omelettes, both were average at best. Their bread is good, and the breakfast potatoes were average. \n\nAs if it couldnt get worse, the dining room had a smell of sewage.

The final disappointment came in the form of their pickles, or rather a lack there of. One of the many reasons I lust after deli is because I live for traditional deli pickles. The pickles at Goldman's weren't good either, they seemed strangely similar to Claussen's brand, and they were pretty stingy with the pickles in the first place, we had to ask for pickles throughout the course of our meal.

I miss this from delis back in NY.  It's hard to find them on the west coast.  For lunch my wife ordered their famous sliders (yes, the ones on the Man vs. Food challenge) although she only ate one of them.  They were very tasty though.  I had the Pastrami Reuben which I liked very much.  My mother-in-law had some Matzah ball soup... to be honest I didn't care for that very much... (and yes, I grew up with it and know good matzah ball soup). My daughter had the sauteed perogies which were very good too.  My sons had burgers.... they liked them, but then again, they're just burgers.  We also had a side of onion straws which were OK.  Overall the food was good though.\n\nWe also picked up some bagels, knishes and italian pastries for the hotel room since we were going to be there all week.  The deli counter looked fantastic: more pickles, cream cheese spreads, fish (salmon & whitefish) and salads.... as well has hebrew national salamis.  I felt like I was almost back in NY.  The bagels were good...but then again, after spending the past 8 years out of New York... any bagel had to be better then what I get in California.  I had a potato & onion knish later that night... it was awesome.  Just like in a new york kosher deli.\n\nBREAKFAST:\nWe came back on Saturday morning for breakfast.  breakfast sliders, bagels & lox, pancakes, etc.  All were very good.  My \"All Salmon\" bagel (with cream cheese, lox & nova, capers, onions & tomato) hit the spot.  Very good. \n\nMy ONLY complaint is that we sat in the back room.  It had an awesome mural on the wall of some of the great New York Yankees (which I LOVED) ... From right to left was Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Mickey Mantle, Roger Maris, Reggie Jackson and Don Mattingly.....  My complaint?  Where's JOE DiMAGGIO??  Really?  Ok.  A very minor gripe from a true Yankee fan. :)\n\nMan Vs. Food:  \nAdam Richman was here for the \"Ultimate Slider Challenge\".  He didn't win.  But there is a small wall towards the back of the restaurant which is the \"Wall of Fame\".  I took a pic of my youngest son there as he LOVES that show and always thinks that HE can win the challenge.  Maybe someday.... but there was no way he was going to eat all those sliders. \n\nBottom line?

I was more than happy to oblige and as I'm out her for 6 weeks or so an extra few hours really don't mean that much. So with a $30 gratuity from the airline I thought, what shall I do?\n\nAn then the idea occurred to me that I wasn't all that far from Chompies deli in Scottsdale, a place I've wanted to try for a while.  I hopped in a cab an headed into deepest darkest Phoenix!\n\nSo Chompies is a New York style Deli and I believe they now have 4 venues in the Phoenix area., I wanted to visit this one as its the only one I'd ever known anyone visit. This place was made a little famous when it featured on Man v Food. Id' heard about it prior to that show but it was seeing on there that planted the seed for me to actually make an effort to go.\n\nOkay, this on appearance is just a regular deli and on entry I was greeted warmly. I was shown to a booth and presented with the menu.\nNow when you look around the place you soon realise that the portion sizes are generous even by US standards.\n\nThe menu has plenty of choice sandwiches, burgers bagels and traditional Jewish food too. There's also a kids menu which I have to say sounded pretty good and there was a dedicated gluten free menu too.\n\nI picked Bobs Brisket from the Colossal Reubans section of the menu priced at $14.99 you would be forgive for thinking its a little pricey. However when it arrives it is huge, and I mean huge! It was full of flavour, tender meet, perfect onions and beautiful seasoning.\nHaving seen the size of it I was glad I didn't order a side of wedges billed on the menu as 'full portion sides'.\n\nChompies is the home of Chompies slider challenge which was featured on Man v Food. Its essential 12 sliders filled with brisket, mini potato pancakes and Jack cheese served with gravy and 5lbs of onion strings. Many have tried few have succeeded. At $39.95 its actually pretty good value, and would certainly be worth having as a sharer.\n\nI loved this place, the food was great, the atmosphere great and the prices reflected excellent value, my sandwich and a coke came to $22 (inc tip).", "business_id": "IM-9thHqQbBK5tX5MfTzBQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-08-07", "type": "review"}

Ordered the chicken matzoh ball soup, nova plate, chopped chicken liver plates (with bagel chips) and a whole wheat bagel.  \nThe matzoh ball soup gets a 3.  Lots of celery and carrots in a kinda of leaning toward salty broth.  Matzoh balls had no deliciousness about them but weren't hard.  A little black pepper and minced parsley would do miracles for them not to mention a dusting of garlic powder before you mix them.  Trust me I know.  Hubby will kill for my matzoh balls.  \nThe Nova plate had a generous amount of nova with a bagel, capers, red onion.  Nice.  But hubby who is an expert on nova says on a scale of 1-10 it is just a 7.  Considering this is a jewish-type deli that is NOT good.  It should have a wow factor and it does not.  Supermarket nova is not too far behind Chompie's nova and that should not be.  \nThe chopped chicken liver was uneventful.  I left most of it.  Lacking in chopped egg and onion and perhaps Schmaltz.  Does anyone use schmaltz anymore?  Finally and sadly,  I cannot get a good bagel at a bagel/jewish deli????? Are you pranking me? Was there a hidden camera in Chompie's catching my reaction when I tasted the \"whole wheat\" bagel.  It was sooooo mealy I cannot begin to describe it to you.  I expected to able to crunch into my toasted whole wheat bagel.  When I asked the waitress about it, she said it was a multi-grain/whole wheat bagel--they kind of combine it.  Ah-ha!!!!!  My bagel radar does not deceive me.  It was the most awful texture I have even experienced in a bagel.  As a kid I used to buy frozen \"Lender's\" bagels and toasted them.  I will tell you right now that the whole wheat Lender's bagels was 1000% (not a mistake I wrote one thousand) better than what I experienced today at a Chompie's.... R U kidding me.?  Sorry Chompie's but I speak the truth.    \nThe two stars are for the service which did not miss a beat despite the crowds on Father's Day.", "business_id": "IM-9thHqQbBK5tX5MfTzBQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-06-21", "type": "review"}

When dealing with any situation that has both good and bad points I always take the bad first.  Here it goes:\nEven though the staff was friendly I was giving only a spare few minutes to scan the menu before the waitress was back asking for my order.  I was a server for years and it is bad form to ask someone for their order while the menu is still open in their hand and it is obvious they are reading it.  When I asked for some more time, it was given to me but I felt it was somewhat reluctantly which lead to feeling more rushed.  So I rushed and ordered something so stupid and the moment my order was out of my mouth I regretted it, tacos.  I know, horrible!  I don't know what I was thinking, I was hungry, only a granola bar was eaten to satiate my hunger hours ago.\nTaco Bell is better, these had very little meat, one was so scarce I wasn't sure if the meat was left off until I bit into it.  The meat iself left the tacos sitting in a pile of grease, gross.  The only toppings were a sprinkling of lettuce and smidge of cheese.  They brought tabasco to the table and when  I asked for tapatio or cholula I was brought sriracha.  Finally I got some hot sauce that I didn't recognize the name but it was spicy enough. The taco shells were store bought and stale, ugh.\nBasically I thought I would write it off on a bad choice but the bottom line to me is if you have it on your menu it should be good.  I have hesitated in writing negative reviews for other places because I have decided for one reason or another to try it again before I review it.  Even though this place is cheap I know I won't go back there again, hence this review.\nOh yes, I also think it is pretty lame to have an establishment that size and this day and age  letting you pay cash only.

Good prices and even better food.  My wife and I have eaten multiple meals here and were never disappointed.  We are typically one of the youngest in here when we go.  This is nice because there's not screaming kids or anything like that ruining our meal.  Try the pies!  My personal favorite is the peanut butter ice cream pie!", "business_id": "68_EJEA9Ibo55EDp3d-nOg", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-06-19", "type": "review"}

The freshly made-to-order caramel apple pie among all the others are wonderful hostess gifts to bring when nvited to the home of friends or family or clients for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  \n\nThe establishment requires a $20 refundable deposit and returns the money when the pie plate is returned.   The pie plates are substantial and add to the pretty presentation of the pies.\n\nOur family has supported this establishment through many happy times with memories, since it was located on the other side of the parking lot before Safeway expanded.\n\nIt's so nice to see the proprietors year after year enjoying seeing to the satisfaction of us and other customers.  I'd stay for a piece of pie instead of ordering a whole pie to go if they started serving really great coffee to give other coffee shops a run for their money.", "business_id": "68_EJEA9Ibo55EDp3d-nOg", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-07-31", "type": "review"}
