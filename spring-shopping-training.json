I'm a thrifter and a film buff but in all the years I've had a Screenie pass to the Regent Square Theater, I've never been here.  I've always been promising myself I'd stop in here sometime.  So f-i-n-a-l-l-y I was able to get my butt in here & do some serious thrifting.\n\nAmbiance Boutique is not like any other thrift store.  They don't sell crap here.  You won't find any Kmart knock off brands.  And if you take a close look at their website, you'll notice they are v-e-r-y picky about what they accept http://www.ambianceboutique.org/html/documents/consignment.pdf http://www.ambianceboutique.org/html/faq.html\nBut this totally benefits the consumer.  You'll find a lot of great high end, gently used brands here.  You'll also find that this store is clean 'n' bright, well organized, and the sales staff here really knows their stuff.\n\nWhat's truly wonderful about Ambiance is it's part of Bethlehem Haven.  Bethlehem Haven is an organization that provides services to homeless women, giving them housing and teaching them life skills in order to be self sufficient.  I'm all about vintage wear, thrifting, and reusing still-viable goods.  And if by doing so I'm supporting a valuable charity, so much the better.\n\nWell the upshot was I didn't quite find what I was looking for.  I wanted some spring and summerwear, particularly sundresses and halter tops.  But I came away with a nice gently used Michael Kors brown leather bag and a sweet men's Polo button down shirt.

The owners and staff are all incredibly friendly, knowledgeable and very attentive. This store has a wonderful atmosphere, a very local and family-owned type of feeling. \n\nThe selection is not as big as a mall jewelry store, however, it is obvious that they know what sells, and carry only that. They have a wide selection of precious gemstones (including sapphires and tanzanite), set in earrings, pendants and rings.\n\nThey also offer a good selection of wedding band sets, and in designs that are both unique and timeless. \n\nIn addition to their fine jewelry they also offer costume and sterling silver jewelry as well as assorted trinkets and home decor. \n\nI came in to have a pin put back into a watch and the service I received was phenomenal! They were able to repair the watch within minutes and at very minimal cost... literally next to nothing! \n\nIt is nice to see a local jewelry store going above and beyond to help their customers! This is what makes a local store so much better than a chain store, and you know that your jewelry is in good hands here. \n\nFinally, they are very low pressure. This is an ideal location to stop in for a cleaning or repair... then you can check out all of their pretty merch!

He convinced me I wanted to buy an Ellsworth Evolution despite that their silly graffiti-style branding makes them look like bikes for skateboarders. Well, I'm not paying $5,000 for a bike without test-riding it first. So I put my name down to take their demo for a spin. In the following weeks, I went back into that shop 3 times and the Ellsworth was never there; at one point, a Beard told me it belonged to the owner and I had to get his permission to ride it. Yeh, dude, I did that. We spent an hour talking.\n\nI ended up buying a Pivot Mach 429 at another store, and I ain't never been happier. Their loss.\n\nBut back to the Pig. I also own an old hand-me-down Bianchi road bike that I use for getting around town (two wheels are better than four, people).

I had originally planned to just order one online (I was due for an upgrade), but didn't want to wait for it to arrive by mail....instant gratification was key.  \n\nSo i went to the store, but had already researched what type of service and features I wanted to include.  I told the guy that I wanted to add Rhapsody, but asked him if he could explain how it worked first (for those that don't know, it's supposed to be a $10/month music download program - unlimited tunes).  He was quick to state \"oh, that's not available on the iphone\"....confused, I asked why it was offered in the package online then.  He was adamant that it was not a feature available to the iphone, until I asked him to research it.....Whaddaya know. It WAS available.  He said nothing and we moved on.  Next, he asked if I wanted insurance.  I said no, but i wanted the extended warranty for $1.99/month.  He stated again \"that's not available with this phone\".  AGAIN, i asked why it was offered online.  He said it probably wouldn't have let me check out with it.....and then clicked a little button, and low and behold...it let him add the extended warranty.  I then informed him that I wanted to reduce my minutes from 900 to 450, since i have not gone over the 450 in over 6 months....He looked at my account and said that i should absolutely stay with the 900 minutes because I would definitely go over.  Mind you, I had just checked my account earlier in the day, so I knew where I stood.  He told me that I was already at 380 minutes, and I would have to pay extra for any minutes I went over.  I looked at him for a minute....then told him that since my cycle restarted tomorrow,...I was clearly still going to be ok.  He said nothing and kept going.  He then asked me if I wanted to look at cases and I said no because I had already found a specialty one online that I planned to order.  He stated that I should definitely look at their selection first, because they had a ton to choose from and could probably get me discount.  So I said ok and he walked me over to their turnstile....with a total of 8 choices (and three of them were variations of black).  When I asked what the discount was, he said he could get me a discount....if i bought a package that included about 5 other things that i didnt even need or want.....\n\nOverall, he was nice and I got the phone and plan i wanted....but only because I had researched it myself.

He was very personable and explained each appraisal to me.  He also told me to come back in three to six months to have my rings cleaned free of charge and said that no jeweler should charge me for that service.\n\nI will definitely be back and would highly recommend them to all my friends.

I did a bit of hunting for a quality frame shop and found Framin' Works.  I stopped in with my print and was greeted by Alan.  He was extremely friendly and helpful.  We had a frame and mat picked out in no time and I left the print in his capable hands.  Upon my return to pick up the finished product I was extremely pleased with the quality of their work.  So pleased that I brought in a couple other small prints that had been packed away for years to be properly matted and framed as well.  Once again, Alan and Neil helped me make excellent framing and mat choices that really show off each piece.  I just picked them up a few days ago and they look fabulous. \n\nProfessional framing done right is totally worth it.  The folks at Framin' Works really know what they are doing technically and they have a great eye for what will make your piece of art really pop.

I felt so taken care of at this Home Depot!! :)\n\nThe Boy asked me to stop and pick up 2 gallons of paint on my way home because he'd run out.  As soon as I got to the paint aisle and had a gallon in each hand, he called and asked that I actually buy 5 gallons of paint - better to have too much than run out again. :) Not even thinking about it, I put my 2 gallons back, grabbed the handle of a 5 gallon bucket of paint, and started walking down the aisle to get it tinted.  I didn't get very far before I realized how heavy the stupid thing was and wondered how I would make it all the way to the car, let alone get it more than 3 inches off the ground and IN to the car.  Just then, Friendly Guy #1 from the paint section came down the aisle and asked if I needed help.  YES PLEASE!  He carried the bucket to the tinting area and I went off in search of a cart.  Once my paint was ready, Friendly Guy #1 loaded it onto my cart, told me to have a nice day, and off I went to check out.\n\nAs I pushed my cart to the check out, I slowed by the self-checkout lanes - wondering if I could scan the bucket without having to lift it.  Friendly Guy #2 running the self-checkout area spotted me and said, \"Let me help you!\" He motioned to one of the registers and then scanned it with his scanner.  Voila!  Then Friendly Guy #2 told me to have a nice day, and I was off!  I was pretty stoked at this point because now all I had to do was get it in the car! :)\n\nEnter Friendly Guy #3.  The second I walked out the door, before I even got my sunglasses on, Friendly Guy #3 spots me and offers to help load the paint into my car.  He helped pull the cart to my car and loaded it up for me.  Then HE told me to have a nice day and off he went (returning my empty cart for me).  \n\nThanks to The Boy, I frequent a lot of different Home Depots and Lowe's locations.  I'm usually not impressed with their customer service because, let's face it - they're guys helping guys...conversations are stereotypically short and to the point with very few niceties.  The 3 (count them - 3) guys that helped me today were nothing but genuinely friendly.  I would gladly go back without The Boy in tow and feel comfortable knowing at least some of their guys are the good ones there and actually want to help me. :)  (Wish I'd caught their names....I think I was just too busy counting my lucky stars that I didn't have to lift that stupid bucket....)", "business_id": "DC77ROlgfnpxQNFKQbbpnw", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-04-13", "type": "review"}

I also liked that she ultimately she left the choice up to me.  \n\nI was between a Trek FX size Medium and Size large. Honestly the medium felt so awkward, the size was just not quite right. I felt crunched, too small. When I tried the large it feel much more comfortable but almost seemed too big.  I have Trek road bike and wanted to love the Trek Hybrid but the fit was not right.  Disappointed in Trek on that one.\n\nWe came back a week later when they had ordered more bikes in more sizes (4 stars for forgetting to calling us when the orders came in, as they had told us they would). I tried the Trek one more time. Still not the right fit. Finally I tried a new brand, Specialized, and low and behold, it was perfect! All my fit problems solved. The medium was a dream.  It was a little more pricey but having the right fit it always worth it. They even threw in a women's seat for free! \n\nAfter riding my new Specialized Sirrus Hybrid to work, I am so pleased!  For all of our bike needs we will definitely be coming back here :)\n\nAlso 4 stars for one of the other reps who took my drivers license because I was test riding a bike.
