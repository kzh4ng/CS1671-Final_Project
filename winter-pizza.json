Now that my palate has matured and I no longer think chicken fingers and french fries are gourmet cuisine, I really can't find anything to eat in a place like this.  \n\nMy husband and I were running errands at the Waterfront, and we needed to find a place for lunch.  We decided on Uno because pizza sounded good to us.  My husband is a meat lover, so I agreed to let him order us a meat-covered pizza.  To counteract this a little, I ordered a tomato mozzarella salad, so we'd at least have some vegetables in the mix.  \n\nWhen the salad arrived, it did NOT look like the picture.  The menu description is thus: \"chopped lettuce, roma tomatoes with basil and garlic, buffalo mozzarella, drizzled with balsamic syrup.\"  This description is accompanied by a bright, colorful picture of a salad with bright green lettuce, bright red tomatoes, and a delicate \"drizzling\" of balsamic syrup.  It looks light and yummy.\n\nWhat we got, however, was soggy yellow and white iceberg lettuce, COMPLETELY DRENCHED in dressing, a total of four tiny pieces of tomato, and some cheese.  It was DISGUSTING.  There was so much dressing dripping off of this dish, it was more like a soup than a salad.  I suspect that the lettuce was so wilted and brown, they figured they could disguise it by completely soaking it in dressing.  Not only was it disgusting, but it cost us about $10.  $10 for complete inedible slop.  \n\nThe \"numero uno\" pizza we got was nothing to write home about either.  It was ok... very mediocre.  The crust tasted like it was undercooked, and the sauce tasted like plain tomato sauce with no seasoning whatsoever.  I have been to Chicago many times, had real Chicago deep dish many times, and this just doesn't even come close to the real thing.  \n\nThe ONLY positive I give this restaurant is they have the kiosk in the front where you can look up the calorie count of the food right there.  It would be better if they'd actually print it on the menu, but they are still doing better than most restaurants in this effort.  They are making strides, too, with their whole grain crust options.  I'm sure there's still a lot of room for improvement, however.  If you're listening, Uno, please work on providing your customers with healthier food - not just healthy options like salads, but work on making the main dishes you serve better for your customers (low-fat cheese, low-sugar sauce, less sodium, etc.).   Their hearts will applaud you.  \n\nAnd lastly, why does every chain restaurant have to decorate with old signs?  Is there some sort of chain restaurant decorating requirement I don't know about?  It's baffling.", "business_id": "6p9TlP2I8S4agxYMNFSDjg", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-12-27", "type": "review"}

Reading the other reviews, it makes me wonder if people were a the same restaurant I was.  Sure, it isn't a world class dining establishment, but it is decent considering it is a chain.  You should know that going into any chain, really.  It was basically exactly what I expected in terms of food quality and price.\n\nWe were greeted immediately upon entering, and while the hostess went to grab menus, another server asked us if we were taken care of.  Service at our table was very attentive and water and other beverages were promptly refilled.  I ordered soup and two appetizers instead of an entree or pizza and the server made sure to ask me about the order in which I would prefer receiving my food.  \n\nMy fiance ordered a deep dish pizza and we know they take longer to make than other food items.  It was quicker than we thought it would be and he really enjoyed it.  I had the potato skin appetizer.  It reminds me of a \"baked potato pizza\" that I used to enjoy at a local place back in Buffalo.  It was delicious, especially with the addition of a little bit of hot sauce.\n\nOverall, it doesn't even come close to visiting an Uno's in Chicago, but then again, when does a copy every live up to the original?  It won't be a regular location in our  dining rotation, but it is good to know that when we have a craving for deep dish, Uno will do the trick and cost a lot less than a trip to Chicago.", "business_id": "6p9TlP2I8S4agxYMNFSDjg", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-02-05", "type": "review"}

I love everything about crunch crust, a nice rich tomato sauce, and a thick layer of melted cheese. I have never tried Chicago style pizza before and when we had to rescue our friends from car troubles, Uno's was right there so we decided to try it out. \n\nOnly a 30 minute wait for a Saturday is pretty good for any restaurant in the Waterfront. We were seated at a booth in the bar area. The tables were clean and it was a big booth so the four of us were not squished. Only complaint, the bar was loud and when they did blended drinks you had to pause your conversation because the blenders were so loud. Good news, only happened twice!\n\nThe four of us decided to order two pizzas, the Pepperoni and the Farmers Market. I also ordered a Caesar salad because I needed more vegetables in my life.  \n\nThe salad. It was a big salad that I shared with my boyfriend. The croutons were huge and very crunchy. The Caesar dressing was not creamy, it was vinegar based and had a little bit of a \"bite\" to it as Chris kept on saying. I thought the bite had more to do with the vinegar than anything spicy, but who am I to say.  The lettuce was fresh and crunchy and they even added tomatoes like I requested. \n\nThe main dishes came out about 10 minutes later. I do not know what I was expecting but the pizzas were not as large as I was imagining. Two of the larger pizzas looked like personal pizzas to me. But!!!! I was soon to see that even if they are a bit smaller they were filled to perfection. \n\nThe Farmers Market pizza had caramelized onions, spinach, SUN DRIED AMAZING TOMATOES, regular tomatoes, eggplant, pesto as a sauce, and a blend of cheeses. The crust was perfection being so crisp and light that I stole Chris' extra from his plate. The sun dried tomatoes were great adding just enough sweetness to the pizza that I went looking for the slices with the most on them. It was a really really good pizza. We even ended up taking slices home with us! My eyes deceived me at first with the size! \n\nThen our friends told us that we had to try the cookie pizza. Cookie pizza? What sorcery is this? Matt, the one who suggested it said that we would not be disappointed. This cookie came out in a really large, bigger than our pizzas, dish. It had three scoops of icecream on it with a pile of whipped cream. WARM, right out of the oven, fresh cookie pizza. Oh sweet heavens, it was good. I am glad that I had enough room in my stomach to pile in that sweet goodness. \n\nChicago Pizza, I would absolutly try again.", "business_id": "6p9TlP2I8S4agxYMNFSDjg", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-01-06", "type": "review"}

My only encounter with my beloved Uno was when my mother came home with a take out box that she ordered for lunch that day.  I would scarf down the thick wedges of pizza and greedily pick off the loose toppings from the box. The cold 4 hour old pizza has since plagued my mind.  I desperately tried to find an Uno but found that the nearest one had closed down. CLOSED DOWN. My dreams were crushed, my psyche disturbed. I had become a changed person. I wanted more. I needed more. My mother stopped coming home with Uno take out boxes. I stopped eating pizza.

I called my order in for an XL pizza ahead of time and was told that I would have a 15 minute wait until it was ready.  Since I only had a general idea of where it was located I ended up parking near it trying to locate it and then driving past it before finally locating it in a small strip mall right next to Lincoln Ave.  There isn't too much to say about the inside of this pizza place except that they have a counter up front with a little bit of room to wait and no customer seating, not that this is a bad thing.\n\nPizzas in general can be broken down into three separate components: cheese, crust and sauce.  This pizza actually had the least amount of cheese on it of all of the pizzas that we tried but ended up being my favorite which would be surprsing if you know me.  The cheese was not that strong in flavor but the amount of it let it pair perfectly with the sauce which had a nice spice profile (strong on the garlic and maybe some oregano?) coming through it.  The crust on this pizza was the thinnest of the bunch that we tried and was cooked nicely which also had a little crisp which I loved.  \n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would head back to R & B's again in the future for pizza.  It was easily the most expensive of the bunch that I bought last night at $12.79 after tax for an XL but as the old adage goes \"You get what you pay for\" and if you like garlic then you should like this pizza.", "business_id": "T49ZvBa6mD4xHSmjHe-ArA", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-01-16", "type": "review"}

I bear the friendly people of Pizza Parma no ill will.\n\nBut their pizza was remarkably terrible.\n\nWent there, hungry, a bit past midnight, looking for a little something before going home to sleep. They don't have slices--this seems to be a (terrible, stupefying, egregious) trend in these parts. Fine. The smallest pizza, a \"personal\" pie, costs $7 and is 7\" in diameter. The cashier and I agree that that's a very small amount of pizza, and since I'm hungrier than one and one half mouthsful, I get a \"small,\" which is 10\". I add a mushroom topping. I pay my $11.21 and wait.\n\nThere are two seating options inside the store: a small wooden bench, and two fold up chairs around a little table. Conveniently, they were using the wooden bench to store a rolled up carpet that laid across the whole thing, and they'd also elected to fold up the two folding chairs, probably because they were tired from a long day of being used as chairs. So I waited outside the store on a bench.\n\nThe friendly cashier and the friendly patrons waiting for their order indoors called me over when my pizza was ready. I took it outside, sitting in the cold to eat it, thinking, \"I hope this $11 pizza is pretty good.\" Opened up the box, saw how pitifully small a 10\" pizza is, and started eating.\n\nLet me say something about pizza: if you have decent cheese, decent tomato sauce, flour, water, and a hot oven, you can make a passable pizza. I will eat it and think, \"well this isn't the best pizza I've ever had but it's fine.\" That is not what I thought when I ate Pizza Parma's pizza. I thought, \"it would be too rude and insulting to ask for my money back. I'll just try to eat as much of this as I can.\"\n\nI ate three out of the six \"slices.\" (One sixth of a 10\" pizza is a total of *25/6 = 13 square inches. That sounds like a lot of pizza, but in fact is a tiny amount of pizza.) I couldn't stand to eat more than half. The mushrooms were fine; I fished them out and ate them. The cheese was actually terrible; it had a strange chemical taste and plasticky appearance. The crust was poofy and not crusty.\n\nAshamedly, I threw half of a pizza away tonight. Folks, I am not a food destroyer. I eat things I don't like, and expired foods, because I don't want to waste. It takes a legitimately terrible pizza for me to actually throw the thing away.\n\nWent home, made some eggs, and guess what? The terrible cheese taste from an hour and a half ago? It's still in my mouth. I'm not making this up.\n\nI know there's good pizza around here. Ordered two back to back slices at Spak Brothers--delicious! Tasty! Reasonable price! But whoaaaaaaa whoa was this terrible, overexpensive pizza. Sheesh.", "business_id": "B9C6j80ob0f1pwi1Cnnd1Q", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-12-16", "type": "review"}

This previous weekend my boss bought us lunch from Pizza Perfecta. \n\nAfter ordering pizza at home twice that week (we DID NOT feel like cooking), I decided to go with a grilled chicken salad. Meh. I'm not saying it was bad, but it wasn't really that great either. I thought they could have dressed it up some more. It was loaded with (too much) cheese and it melted due to the fries being warm, making the top of the salad kind of gross. Underneath the melted cheese was the lettuce, tomatoes, onions and cucumber. I guess this is all standard for a salad, but it really just didn't impress me. Plus, I thought the chicken tasted pre-cooked which should be a big no-no for restaurants. One perk, however, was the size as it was pretty big!

It was love at first bite. I went there frequently and tried to recruit as many allies as I could. The insanely crunchy crust, the zippy tomato sauce, the CHEESE! The first slice of the day with completely cold, unmelted cheese was always just as good as the last one which would have melted the cheese slightly and gotten the tiniest bit less crunchy. It doesn't matter because the ingredients themselves are just tasty. But tragedy struck and Cranberry failed hard again at supporting good pizza and the store closed. I did some research online and discovered that, yes, DiCarlo's did still exist, but only in faraway lands that I would likely never travel to for pizza or any other reason.\n\nBut one day, I noticed something exhilarating. Is that a DiCarlo's location IN PITTSBURGH?! HOW LONG HAS THIS BEEN HERE? I felt confused, excited, bashful, sleepy, doc, but most of all relieved. That is until I decided I would need to confirm their existence with a quick phone call. See above.\n\nThat very night, I traveled to the south hills (a rare treat...) to rekindle my love affair.

But it backfired on me and the one thing I didn't expect was her to order extra cheese. \n\nWe sat down and I explained to her the total stupidity of ordering a large drink in a place that offers free refills. Order a small, it's way cheaper and this really sounds like a scene that could have played out on an episode of Seinfeld.\n\nPizza time! The look on her face was one of shock, like mine when I realized that America was indeed stupid enough to elect George Bust for a second term. The cheese was piled high, and no visible evidence of anything under this massive mass of diary goodness. Like a trooper she picked up a slice and dived in. She liked it!\n\nAfter we downed our slices I told her how sitting here has brought me back to my high school years.

It's right down the street from one of my old schools, so I have a lot of fond memories of eating here once a week or so with my mom during the school's lunch break. \n\nWith that in mind, because I often come here craving pizza and I was a child patron, I tend to just forget that, oh yeah: they have a full menu, and they serve alcohol as well. Not only do they serve alcohol, but my family has actually purchased six-packs from the bar since Bado's is easier to get to than a beer distributor. I think they have a decent but obviously not expansive beer selection if we're taking the time to buy and carry a six pack home.\n\nAs for the food? No complaints. The pizza is delicious, and Bado's also has a bunch of other meal options like sandwiches, soups and salads, so you're sure to find something here. All of my personal favorite dishes here are cheesy and come with standard but still tasty sauces that just complete the meal. One of my favorite things from Bado's is actually their calzones, which are enormous and yet, oddly enough, \"light.\" Not light in calories, but light in the amount of grease and oils in the meal. This, of course, is compared to take-out chains, so I'm sure it's still way too much and not that good for you. But still, I've always felt that their calzones have the perfect blend of toppings, sauces, and so forth, and they're borderline divine - the perfect local splurge.\n\nJust keep in mind, Bado's is popular and it gets crowded. Fast. Be prepared for a wait or try to show up during slow hours, i.e. not right after work - especially on a Friday. But really, other than that, I can't complain about this place.

It doesn't help that the place tends to be pretty empty, at least from what I've observed - a lack of visible patrons definitely can keep people away. But today I decided to give them a shot, because I really didn't want to stop in anywhere for a big meal - I just wanted a cheap piece of pizza.\n\nThough the place does have a \"dive-y\" feel to it, it did look very clean and had a welcoming atmosphere once I ventured on in. The tables and chairs - which were mostly the elevated and interconnected kind - admittedly looked a little worn down, but they weren't gross or anything like that. Since I knew I'd likely be eating in a few hours I opted to just eat a plain piece of cheese pizza to hold me over. One piece of cheese pizza and one bottle of Dr. Pepper to go with it cost me $4.25 - not bad, in my opinion. And while not fancy by any means the pizza was pretty tasty; it had the right blend of cheese and pizza and the sauce was very flavorful. It was exactly what you'd want when enjoying a plain ol' piece of pizza.\n\nI'll definitely keep this place's super quick service, relatively cheap prices and impressive portion sizes in mind from now on - it's good to know that there are places you can get into while downtown like this, and from what I'm hearing/reading it's worth exploring the menu and eating something other than pizza here. I admit, however, that I may get some food to go next time if I can, as the old elevated and connected chairs and tables in here sounded like they wanted to break apart at any moment...maybe it's time to update them.

She had suggested that we eat there because she had heard that they had some good pizza.  The outside of the place doesn't have the appearance but is consistent with all of the buildings on the block.  Once you are inside though the place is pretty clean.  There are probably around 10 tables in the dining room portion of the restaurant with a single flat screen hung in one corner so that you can watch as you eat.  Just past the dining room and on the way to the register were about 6 beer coolers filled with everything from your normal adjunct lagers to Four Loko and even some more expensive 22 oz Dog Fish Head bottles.  As a beer lover who normally doesn't drink adjunct lagers if I can help it, I was really impressed with their selection.  As a matter of a fact in the hour or so that we were there, I actually saw more people get beer to go than order their food.  For our dinner we decided to get a large pizza with chicken on it.  It came out piping hot and I was surprised at how large it actually was.  What I was not as big of a fan of was the amount of grease that was still on the pizza but I understand that is what happens with cooked cheese  As with most pizzas, there are the three major components to them cheese, sauce and crust.  The crust was definitely the standout of this pie as it was crispy while not being too think.  The sauce was merely average as I did not really notice any spices in it or anything to distinguish it from anything else.  Finally the cheese was decent, there was a lot of it, and I enjoyed the garlic flavoring that was with the cheese.  Overall it wasn't the best pizza in the world but I enjoyed eating it and it got the job done.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I may head back here in the future.

Shame, shame on me for not doing so earlier.  \n\nI trusted my friend when I was informed that not only was the pizza good, but I'd be wanting more.  There was no lie in that statement whatsoever.  We got a medium and large pizza with pepperoni.  Unlike typical places where you get the big slices of pepperoni thrown on top without a care, here you get the smaller, more true pepperoni that is strategically placed to maximize your chance of getting pepperoni in every bite.  What's also good about this pepperoni is that it curls up perfectly to create that awesome little bowl for grease to collect.  You know, that grease that you have to just dip your crust in.\n\nYes, I did rip my crust off before I got to it just so I could enjoy my fattening myself.

The lack of pretentiousness and extraneous decor in the building are mirrored in the food that you get here.  I would recommend staying away during popular hours due to the fact that the parking is somewhat difficult -- the scant parking is on the side of the building and on the side of the road going up the steep hill.  \n\nIt really doesn't matter if you will be dining in or carrying out, you need to walk to the counter first to place your order.  If you have more than one person in your group, all the better since they can be on the look-out for a coveted table.  Once you order, pay for it.  On my first time here, I sat down and waited to be served -- they won't come.  I then ordered at the counter and was given the option of paying before or after the meal and I chose after -- the people making the food will assume you haven't arrived and will go slow in the preparation, PAY!\n\nWith the niceties out of the way, you can focus on finding a table or just sit back and relax if someone in your crew already found one.  I have been here twice already and these people just don't stop.  It is a well-greased assembly line that only lets you down if you don't follow the proper path (look at the above paragraph).  Both times I contented myself to watch the large numbers of people that enter through this pizza parlours doors while we waited on our order:\n\nFirst Trip only:\nGarlic bread\nHot wings\n\nBoth Trips:\nMeatballs (x2) and red sauce\nPepperoni Pizza with Extra Cheese (12\" - 8 cut)\n\nThe meatballs, wings, and bread came out rather quickly.  The garlic bread was nothing special, just a loaf brushed with a garlic oil and warmed.  Very simple, but somewhat weak in the garlic department.  The buffalo wings were good.  They were not hot/piquant; but they actually had good flavor and that is really what counts.  They were slightly more acidic than many of the wings that I have had in the area and that went well with a little bit of blue cheese.  The meatballs were about the size of a racketball.  Very little to no seasoning in both the sauce and the meatballs.  I was quite surprised to find that I enjoyed them.  The small number of ingredients that go into making this simple sauce and meatball had to be in proper proportion each time to get that wonderful flavor -- so far they are batting 2/2.  \n\nOur pizza arrived steaming hot and smelling wonderful.  I could tell from the small bits of brown that were beginning in the cheese that the pizza had been cooked fully and to the proper temperature.  There is nothing worse than a pizza that is pulled too soon.  I ate my first piece and was amazed at the flavors.  The pizza, overall, had a sweet undertone.  As I started on my second piece, I began to take more note of the flavors.  The crust had a slightly sweet flavor, was a tad doughy/soft, but was super thin and had a very good flavor.  The sauce was also sweet; it tasted like the sauce that came with the meatballs.  Tasting the pepperoni, again there was this sweet undertone to it.  \n\nI must say, I am not usually a fan of sweet foods, but this wasn't unnaturally sweet and it was tasting good.  What amazed me the most was the near-perfect execution of the pizza with so few ingredients and none of the usual and stereotypical Italian seasonings.  Yeah, I enjoyed this pizza.  It is definitely the best I have had in Pittsburgh.  I will be returning for my pizza fix again and again and again...  \n\nThey only accept cash, if you have none there is a convenient ATM near the singles/kiddie bar.  They are open until 3am on the weekends, so if you get a late night hankering for pizza you are in luck.  Just be advised you will have to then battle the post-bar crowd.\n\nNOTE:  If you must have the Italian seasoning, you won't like this pizza.  Also, be careful of ordering too many toppings or extra cheese as the crust is so thin and has a hard time holding it up -- not an issue if you eat with a fork.", "business_id": "r8jeeS3k_diihMDSu9IjlA", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-12-05", "type": "review"}

My quick bite of pizza took over two hours from finding a parking space, standing in line to order, waiting for my pizza to be made, getting a table with said pizza (there is very limited seating for eating in), eating and finally wriggling past the other waiting people to get out to search for the car. The place is CASH ONLY, no credit cards so make sure you got a twenty to buy your pie. (Fortunately they have an ATM on site but the fees!)\n\nAll my complaints aside, I did enjoy my pizza. The sweetness of the sauce was balanced by the saltiness of the olives they exuberantly provided on my pizza. The crowd of people in there provided for a quite interesting people-watching experience.

It's wonderful, especially when it's fresh and the dough is still floury and doughy.\n\nSo anyway, my second time at Fiori's - not as good. The pizza was okay but it was definitely nothing special on my second visit. Maybe it's the best in the Pitt area, but it doesn't hold a candle to Buffalo or Chicago Pizza, so I have to reduce it by a star.

Definitely not the easiest city to drive around, but one of the most fun (except in snow or ice, which is common).\n\nThe people here are friendly (yes, I said friendly, Pittsburgh sometimes gets a bad rap), and as I said, the side of white cheese is an absolute must - mmmm.

The sauce definitely isn't for everyone - it's a departure from the typical corporate pizza crap that everyone has gotten used to.  But the sauce is INTERESTING, and the crust is PERFECT.

They do not deliver and its pretty hard to find parking on the Aggro Crag-esque hill that the shop sits upon.  The interior is dirty and uninviting...I would even go so far as to call it \"rapey\".  After illegally parking with my 4 ways on and waiting for a few minutes one of the employees gave me my pie and I headed home.\n\n\nThe pie it self was a real mess. It is obvious just by looking at the pie that whoever made it took no pride in making it well, they just threw everything together and plopped it in the oven on a wing and a prayer.  \n\nThe dough is some of the worst dough I have had yet in Pittsburgh.  They are using regular deck brick ovens and cooking the pies directly on the brick so there is no excuse for not being able to achieve some sort of crunch.  It is very dense and flavorless with no crunch at all.  The taste of salt and sugar come through a little bit in a very generic way, almost like a Papa Johns tasting dough.  The main problem was that  the dough obviously didn't rise at all and was very dense and hard to chew.  Its a dry dough too, very dry.  Plus the pizza was made so poorly that the middle of the pie was paper thin and inedible while the outside of the pie was way too thick and was hard to chew.  Basically what we have here is another bowl-like pizza where all of the ingredients pool into the middle because it was made so poorly.  \n\nIt is pretty clear who is wearing the pants in this pizza, good old Uncle Cheese....and the pants are soaked.  I watched the kid making one of the pies and he just filled up both of his hands with 2 pounds of cheese and tossed it into the middle of the pizza and just kind of scattered it towards the outside and said \"yeah, that will do\".  They are using a really high quality cheese and it does have a great taste and it has that gummy effect that you would get if you ordered extra-cheese.  Unfortunately there is just way way too much of it for the pizza to even be edible in some spots.  You couldn't even pull a slice off of the pie to put it onto your plate without pulling all of the cheese off into a big pile in the middle.  They are using lots and lots of cheese to compensate for how bad the best of the pie sucks.\n\nThe sauce is very forgettable and watery.  They put very little sauce on the pie anyway and its applied with no pride in the traditional lazy bulls-eye pattern where you sauce in some spots and none in others.  The sauce has a bit of a sweet taste, un-offensive and maybe tasty if they were to ever put enough on for anyone to taste it.\n\nIn general this is just lazy pizza where they would rather give you 2 pounds of cheese than actually have to take pride in their food.  I feel my butt hole starting to cry as I near the end of this review, save yourselves the T.P. and just leave this one alone.  \n\nI am giving it a 4 out of 10.", "business_id": "r8jeeS3k_diihMDSu9IjlA", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-01-10", "type": "review"}

You open the box and that's what it looks like. Just thrown together with no care at all. I love cheese but the amount of cheese they put on is ridiculous. I guess they do this to cover the taste of the non existing crust. This pizza felt like I was eating a pound of cheese mixed with sauce. The pizza is a 1.5 stars max. \nThe Italian sausage I really enjoyed. Again way to much cheese. Seriously, what's the deal with all the freaking cheese!

Pizza that while eating makes you feel like you're in another country. The first bite was absurdly amazing...I wasn't expecting my taste buds to explode with delight. And the rest of the bites until the pizza was done were equally happy. The flavor of the pizza is completely different than any of our chains and independent pizza places (whose pizza I also love...this pizza is just different). I would recommend getting the pizzas with their sauce because some of the pizzas on the menu don't come with sauce and their sauce is probably what makes the pizza so good. I mean, the crust is special and the topping ingredients are fresher & a better quality than other pizza places...but the sauce has all the flavor. \n\nThe other food we had was good, but it pales in comparison. I had the mistacanza (spelling i'm not so sure on) salad, which was just ok (I would skip it next time). My boyfriend ordered one of the paninis which was pretty large & had a lot of meat and cheese, but I doubt it was nearly as good as the pizza (the pizza was finished, half the panini went home). The menu had a lot of homemade pastas, which we didn't try but are probably great. The other standout part of our meal was the complimentary bread & olive oil served at the start...the olive oil was fantastic tasting, much better than any other restaurant I've been to in the past few years and one of the breads (it was buttery & had coarse salt on the top) was delicious. \n\nThe only warning I have is they are quite finicky about changing their dishes. The bottom of the menu does say \"please no substitutions\" but they really mean it...as in we asked to have sauce added to our pizza (an easy & normal request at most places) and the waitress actually had to go ask the chef if it would be ok because they reallllly don't like to change their dishes.

The decor was also contemporary with a traditional flair.  What I didn't expect was the hostess informing me that I can wait at the wine bar if I'd like - what a welcome twist.  Out of the back of the restaurant and into what should have been someone's kitchen, was a wonderfully decorated wine bar and lounge, with a small seating area adjacent to it.  It was nice to sit back and relax for a few minutes and take in everything.  The wait time wasn't too bad for a Saturday night at 6:30 pm, my guess it was only like 15 minutes (but I think that was because a large party had ended up leaving, but who's counting =) )   Anyway, after being seated I ordered the pizza (like everyone else who left reviews).  and it was out of this world awesome.  I laughed because I spent as much on the wine as I did on dinner.  I ordered Tiarmisu for dinner, which was perfect.

Nothing was overly amazing but the food was decent. Decor is your typical Tuscan style and the wood fire oven is interesting to watch. \n\nI had one of the veal dishes which reminded me a lot of Chicken Marsala and cost $28. There were no sides, salad and even bread to go with the meal but the size of my portion was ok. The only issue I had, besides the high cost, was that my meal had no surprises.  It was a very simple dish and for $28 I would expect something more complex. The sauce was everywhere, overpowering the cheese, prosciutto and mushrooms and there was nothing to counter it. A vegetable or anything would have improved the meal and helped me get through the overwhelming taste of the sauce.  \n\nMy husband had the lasagna which was very good but cost $19 and I know it did not fill him up. Again it was simple in design and we were expecting something more coming from an Italian background.  Maybe my family is full of over-achievers, so my opinion may be harsh but for the type of food they are creating the price is outrageous. \n\nIf prices were lower my review would be higher and I say this with years of dining experience in Mt. Lebanon. For the same amount you would be better of going next door to Bistro 19, one of the upscale restaurants in the area.

Supposedly, they have an extensive Italian beer selection and a wood-fired oven, so off my hubby and I went. I looked over the menu and discovered they only had two (2) Italian beers (Moretti, Peroni). Disappointed but not giving up, we ordered one of each and proceeded. The waiter (Adam) comes over and tells about the specials before leaving again so we have time to make a choice. FYI - the wait staff tries to class up the place by acting as if they've lived in Italy and personally prepared the food so we played along. We ordered a few appetizers to try, salads, and I ordered a Pizza Margherita and my hub-a-bub ordered a Calzone. After we order, Adam brings us some squares of wood fired bread with EVOO. The bread was thick and doughy (clearly a filler). Then comes the appetizers along with the salads. We ordered Rice Balls (both cheese and cheese and meat), which had *no* flavor. We also ordered the the Potato Croquettes, which tasted *sour*. The salads looked fresh but was all green until you dug down to the bottom of the plate where there were two small pieces of red and orange pepper, a cherry tomato, and an olive. Said salad would have been really tasty, had the vinaigrette not been too sweet. Next came the entrees. The place is suppose to be known for their pizzas (that Adam said was a thin crust personalized pizza) but what I was served was a big blob of pizza dough with some cheese and sauce on top. My hub-a-bub's Calzone was a huge blob of thinly stuffed dough with some cheese and sauce on top. Clearly these folks haven't been to Italy or know what true Neapolitan Pizza looks like. Needless to say, I couldn't bring myself to touch or eat what amounted to a loaf of bread (aka an Il Pizzaiolo Pizza) but paid for it anyway. A $100 later, we would have been much happier, and better off to stay at home enjoying a good red wine, a fresh loaf of Italian bread, and a hunk of Parma cheese!    \n\nLater that evening, my iron stomach started to gurgle.

(Because of the price-point, I would acutally rate this place 2.5 stars instead of 3.) \n\nIt is your typical Italian-American corporate chain cuisine. If you are hungry and want to find something \"nicer\" than the Olive Garden but not on the level of gourmet authentic Italian dining, this is an ok choice... especially if you are a family with lots of hungry mouths to feed.  \n\nIf it were totally left up to me, I would not choose to go here. Ever.  However, we have a lot of good friends who really like this place (??!!), so on occasion, I will suck it up and take one for the team.  \n\nOne problem from my perspective is the \"family style\" dining.  Typically, I am much pickier than my dining companions and I feel like I have to settle for something that I would not order if it were just up to me.  (And the same is true in the reverse, my dining companions try to find something to order that I'll actually eat). \n\nBut, they do have enough options that I can find a chicken or seafood option. There are also a couple of selections of baked pasta that do not include meat sauce. \n\nWhen I eat \"Italian\" food, I typically like to enjoy a glass of wine or two. As expected for a place like this, the wine selection is not very good and is  more overpriced than the typical restuarant wine mark-up.  \n\nEven with a coupon and not ordering the most expensive things on the menu, I generally end up paying more than I feel this place is worth. I'd prefer to take my business to a smaller locally owned restuarant any day - and especially when it comes to Italian food. \n\nI have only been a few times, but on each visit the service was a-ok.

We decided to start with the mixed green salad, and added Gorgonzola and prosciutto on the side. Typically when I think of mixed greens, I think of mesclun, arugala, frissae, and other greens. Though I wouldn't expect these particular greens to be served in an Italian restaurant, I don't understand why they considered this salad \"mixed greens\". The only thing mixed about this salad was the iceberg and red cabbage. I counted maybe five olives, and three pepperoncinis. The prosciutto and Gorgonzola were plentiful, though I'm not sure of the quality of prosciutto they use. It looked burnt and perhaps prepackaged like bacon bits. It was just okay as a whole. For our main dish, we got the large order of spicy chicken rigatoni. This is where the experience failed in my mind, as the chicken and peas did not taste fresh, and the sauce was lacking in depth and flavor.

Maybe more, I lost count.  And I'm not a a purist or a dogmatic devotee to any particular variety of pizza.  I grew up in Chicago, where I was weaned on deep dish, pan, and thin crust pizzas.  I lived in NYC for years, and tasted some of the finest thin crust on the planet.  (for the record, my favorites are DiFara's in Brooklyn and Coalfire, a relatively young pizza joint in Chicago).\n\nBrixx does a fine job of the thin crust.  We had a wild mushroom pie and their pear and gorgonzola variety for kicks.  Both were pretty tasty.    I'll go back for more whenever the opportunity arises.\n\nBut here's what they could do a little better:\n\nGet that oven hotter, and change the flour blend so that there's a crispness to the bottom and edges of the crust.  There's an axiom for thin crust pizza that goes something like, \"if that shit don't crack, that shit is whack.\"  So, when the pizza is folded, the bottom of the crust should crack.  Ditto for the edge of the crust.  (Allowances can be made for pizzas that have been ordered with soggy ingredients that necessarily soak through the crust, like spinach, ricotta, etc.)\n\nBrixx's pizza did not exhibit cracking anywhere.  It was cooked only to the point of being bread-like.  Still tasty enough, but not quite there.  I hate to sound snotty about this, but I think it really adds to the pizza when parts of the crust have been cooked almost to the point of burning.  That crunch and underlying chewiness is irresistible.\n\nAlso, the mushroom pizza was finished with a sprinkling of what appeared to be shaved romano and a tossing of arugula, but when that was added, the pizza had been allowed to cool to the point where the romano didn't melt at all, and the arugula didn't wilt.  The result was a bit like having a salad on top of a pizza.\n\nPizza aside, they offer local beers, at least one NC wine, and have eco-friendly waterless urinals in the men's room (I applaud the effort, though that probably won't be the highlight of the review).\n\nNext time I go in, I'll see it they can crispify my pie.", "business_id": "kAid56AY_laxGYslMdsYJw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-01-21", "type": "review"}

My pizza preferences are mid-western and Buffalo style - not too thin, not too thick, nice and greasy, and baked in a deck oven.  However, I love Brixx pizza.  I have been to this location at least 50 times, usually before or after Checkers games.  The menu is simple.  It's mostly personal size woodfired pizzas which can be altered.  You can get their pies on wheat crust, you can get vegan cheese, and they now even have gluten free pizza.  The pizza and toppings are delicious and are fresh cooked.  I really like the pear and Gorgonzola one, although it's not always on the menu.  \n\nThe rest of the menu offers some very good salads, some decent wraps, and a few pasta dishes.  I tend not to order the pasta before going to games because it's too much to eat - the pizas, sandwiches, and salads are perfect.  They have a small but respectable beer slection with different specials every day.  They usually have something from Olde Mecklenburg Brewery which is good too.  They have beer flights too if you want to try several different beers.\n\nThe service has always been good to excellent here (last time it was excellent).  The manager who has worked here for the past year or so seems to know how to run this place and is a nice guy.  Even if you're not a fan of this style of pizza, Brixx is a cool place to have a decent meal.", "business_id": "kAid56AY_laxGYslMdsYJw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-12-21", "type": "review"}

Despite the extended time between visits, i always considered it a 3-star establishment. However, i've changed quite a bit over this time and upon my return to Brixx, i found they have always had what i never knew i would someday want. For one, they have a solid beer selection. i've always drank beer and they always have some beer on special for $3 (New Castle last time in)  which used to be all i require. Nowadays i'm a little craftier than i used to be and they satisfy with a good selection of local beers along with some nationwide favorites. Also, $1.95 domestic drafts on Monday.\n\nThe other great thing about Brixx is the fact that they offer Vegan cheese. After trying vegan pizza one time at Mellow Mushroom, i was kind of turned off. Fortunately i tried again because i think i've had it probably 5 times in the past month. Love it here. We've done the wood-roasted vegetable and a modified Mexican and will order both again. With the wood-roasted vegetable, i like to get a side of marinara for some crust dipping action. This might be why they don't get 5 stars. i don't think i've had a server remember to bring my side of marinara. Not a huge deal, but every time? \n\ni also recommend the hummus plate as a starter. Their black bean hummus is really good.  \n\nYou can park in the 7th street garage and they will validate at the hostess stand, so no need to fret about finding parking. \n\nApparently vegan options and good beer is all i need in life these days.", "business_id": "kAid56AY_laxGYslMdsYJw", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-01-08", "type": "review"}

I recall seeing somewhere that they were only putting personal pizzas on the buffet these days, but that isn't the case, at least at this location.  They are full-fledged pies.  Pizza Hut pies, to be sure, but they are the real ones, not the baby-sized ones.  That can actually be both good and bad.\n\nIt's good because you can get a decent slice from the buffet.  It can be bad because with room for only four pizzas at a time, and with one of those at any given time being a dessert pizza, it means if one of the three main pizzas isn't one that you like, you may have to wait for one that you like.  This is an issue because the restaurant isn't very busy - probably the reason for the banner outside.  As such, the three pizzas don't go very fast.\n\nStill, if you're at Pizza Hut, chances are that you like their pizza at least okay.  It's not like you're out on a limb to try something adventurous.  If you want more variety, go to CiCi's Pizza.  If you want something good, try Big Guy's Pizza instead.\n\nAnyway, the pizza isn't bad.  You just don't get a lot of choices.  They also have pasta, but in my experience, it's usually almost gone.  I don't know if this is because people don't like the choices of pizza and eat all the pasta, because they don't put much out, or some combination of both.  There are also bread sticks, but they don't usually have many of those either.  There is a good bit of marinara sauce, but I'm not sure what you're supposed to use it on, since the pizza has plenty and there is usually little pasta or bread.  You can also get a salad, but it costs extra.\n\nThe service is generally friendly, but not very good.  The price is a bit much.  For all this and a drink you'll pay more than you should.  The one bright spot is the sweet tea.  It is sweet and syrupy, just like it should be.

Saturday night at 5 pm. There were no vacant tables because so many people were using tables as a base camp for their coats, etc. After 15 minutes of wandering, we finally found a table that was dirty but unoccupied, so we asked an employee if he would clean off the table for us. He said, no, sorry, but they were only letting folks sit down if they bought food. I got a little miffed and told him we just paid $50 bucks for two pizzas and some tokens. Only when we showed him our order number did he clean off the table. \n\nNext, it was another hour before our cheese pizzas arrived at the table.  Then,  the pizzas were HORRIBLE.  How hard is it to mess up a plain cheese pizza?  These had hard crust, almost no sauce, and very well done cheese. I complained to the manager (who turned out to be the man that refused to clean off a table). He said the only thing he could do is give us a guest pass for a future visit, but that if we didn't like the pizza we probably wouldn't benefit from a guest pass.  Had to go through a McD's drive-thru after we left, since they wouldn't eat that pizza. They do not have Coke products nor Dr. Pepper.\n\nThe games were busy, and I know people don't have to watch their children closely here, but little BABIES were just wandering around, getting in the way of my kids' games.  A couple of the games didn't work or didn't give tickets, and that wasn't received well by my kids. When our tokens were gone, we went to the ticket counter/muncher machine...but not all the ticket muncher machines were working, so the lines were long...took the kids about 20 minutes to wait in that muncher line, and then another 20 minutes at the prize counter.\n\nSome of the games were fun, but my kids said they would not want to go back.

I figured people must like them. Last week I brought a couple of large pies to feed the men working at my house. \n\nNot only the guys loved it, but two of them asked permission to take the leftovers home! I've fed employees countless times over the years and this never happened to me before. \n\nAs I mentioned it doesn't look or taste quite like a traditional pizza. The dough is some sort of deep dish, but nicely crispy. I think they use a fair amount of yest to make it rise and stay light. It's not Chi- style nor any of the pizza hut concoctions. also the tomato sauce is used sparingly which I like.  I asked the owner about it, he told me he's been making pizza for 30 years and everything was prepared in house, including the dough, sauces etc. \n\nMy favorite still is the individual pie with mushrooms, well cooked onions ( I can't stand undercooked onions) a mild sausage more knockwurst than Italian and my twist: a fried egg on top, sunny side up.  No it's not pizza, a Tuscan style pie maybe. \n\nBTW the lunches are cheap, $6.95 for lasagna, ravioli etc. More to Charlotte's taste than to mine , but good in spite of being mild.", "business_id": "-2NCvK5807Nxs9GUb2Eo1g", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-01-18", "type": "review"}

I am disappointed.  \nWhen I read the reviews I was a little surprised but I figured somehow I must have looked over this place after all these years and I was actually regretting it!  Now...not so much. I quickly realized there was a reason I grew up right around the corner yet never visited this place.  I realized there was a reason I never even stepped foot in this place on a lunch break while working at the neighboring Food Lion as a squeaky teenager with braces. Back then I thought Ragu was gourmet so I wasn't even picky but STILL knew to stay away from Juliana's  There is a reason why our Italian family of 7 never bothered ordering from here even though it was cheap and close by!  You have to realize this was before the restaurant scene really even popped off in Charlotte!! There were no options!  Uptown was downtown, the arboretum was for the wealthy and Ballantyne didn't exist.  But still....Juliana's was never an option....now I see WHY!!\n\nWe opened the door and immediately fell back into 1973.  The diner feel of this place gave me the creeps and the whole restaurant turned to stare as we entered.  It was awkwardly quiet and just didn't have a comfortable feel AT ALL.  I wanted to leave from the moment I stepped in but I figured I needed to get over myself and give it a try.  Sometimes the best food comes out of little hole in the wall restaurants.  I wasn't expecting much but I realize decor is not the only thing that matters.\n\nWe decided to stick with the absolute basic.  I ordered Spaghetti and meatballs and my husband ordered the chicken parm 12 inch sub.  My husband isn't as picky as I am so I was counting on him to enjoy this sub.  It is pretty hard to mess up a chicken parm sub.\n\nMy pasta came out and all I can tell you is that the sauce was brown.  It looked like gravy.  When I mixed it in with the spaghetti it somehow just vanished so it was basically like eating noodles with a hint of brown gravy.  It was the most disgusting thing I have ever tasted.  I took one bite of the meatball and thought I was going to throw up.  It was atrocious.  It was spongey and tasted like deer meat.  It was so gross.  My husband's chicken parm sub had the same doo-doo brown gravy on it and the chicken was like rubber.  Literally.  He could hardly bite through it.  When he said he couldn't eat this sub, I KNEW it was bad.  He eats anything.  I for darn sure wasn't eating my dish so we just sat their staring at each other.  I forgot to mention the salad and texas toast that was served with the meal...the salad was frozen iceburg with nothing else and the toast was a piece of lilly white bread with some butter and garlic slapped on it.  BLLLLEH!!!!\n\nEventually the waitress made her way over to us and we weren't sure what to say but I can tell you I have only not been able to eat a meal due to COMPLETE dissatisfaction twice in my whole life.  The waitress noticed that we didn't eat our meals and asked if we wanted a box to go.  Um, WOW.  No, we want to just get out of here.  We asked for our check and told her we weren't really satisfied but that we didn't want to make a big deal, no need for managers, etc.  Well, one of the \"managers\" (son to the woman who owns and cooks) came over.  He offered us anything else off the menu to replace our meals.  We didn't want anything else from this dump.  We wanted to just LEAVE and go eat.  We were starving and on a time crunch.  \n\nLong story short--They made us pay for the meal that we didn't even touch.  The owner came out and was extremely nasty.  She said she posted that they do not refund for food.  She then pointed to this itty bitty note on her cash register.  She said she can't please everyone's taste buds so she is not going to refund anyone.  What?  So does this happen often enough that you have to have a disclaimer on your food?  That is TERRIBLE servie for a small mom and pop, or just mom shop.  It was like they were used to people not liking their food so they were prepared to argue their point.  IT was bizarre.  I don't understand that concept.  They said you can order a pizza or something else so they are still losing money by having to make a whole other meal!  Either way, it was their approach and the fact that the food was absolutely disgusting.  I would NEVER want to support this place, local or not.\n\nI asked them where they were from because no one that was born and raised in Italy would have created the mess that they did.  They were actually greek.  I suppose they just have a different way of preparing Italian food because it was NOT authentic.\n\nI looked back at those who offered such stellar reviews and realized that most of the people were from random towns/areas.  Maybe they haven't been exposed to the real deal in terms of Italian food so somehow this place was okay to them.  Not me.  I'm telling you...If you love Italian food and have had real authentic Italian food...DO NOT GO HERE.

You could have fooled me.\n\nThe good news is that I didn't have to pay for the pizza.  It was brought in as part of a \"party\" at work.  I always enjoy a free lunch. \n\nFor better ingredients, I beg to differ.  I had the sausage & mushroom, which was servicable.  The italian sausage was nondescript - it may have well not been on the pizza.  That was disappointing.  The mushrooms had a good flavor, and that saved it from being a total loss.  The sauce and cheese were run-of-the-mill large-chain quality.  Nothing to write home about.  Thankfully the pizzas came with some garlic dipping sauce, which I used on the entire slice, not just the crust.\n\nSo, better pizza?  Hardly.  I went web surfing to see what these pies go for and almost fell over when I saw they charge $14 for a large sausage pie.  Are you kidding me?  A $5 Little Caesars deal is on the same plane of quality as these things.  For less, I can get a safe Pizza Hut pie that I know I will be fine with.

One of the better Groupons I've purchased. \nNow that I've had their pizza a few times I can genuinely say it's not too bad. \nIt's a great change of pace to the usual triangle sliced pizza in a box, and I appreciate that.\nI wish the they put more cheese and toppings on. It seems rather cheap, so for that they got demoted to 3 stars instead of 4. \nThe thin style crust was nothing special, it was crust dusted with corn starch. So yeah....\n\nDefinitely not the worst pizza for take out on the east side of Madison, but not the best.\nAs for pricing, I would suggest looking for a coupon or Groupon. The pizza is not really worth what they are asking for full price.", "business_id": "QfCHvy6v39xPH7CvCASlFg", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-12-04", "type": "review"}

I didn't care much for the prosciutto, but the buffalo was pretty bomb. Ordered some small ranches (50 cents per though, what a rip) and it was delicious. It's deceptive that they cut their pizzas into smaller squares because you feel like you can eat so much more. We had 6 slices left over and it was about 42-ish dollars with tax and tip. So a large probably feeds 4 people comfortably, 3 uncomfortably.\n\nWeird thing though is when we asked for a box, the waitress asked if we wanted anything else. We said no and assumed she would bring us the check. But didn't and we sat there for like 10 more minutes. Had to grab her attention and then ask for the check.

My primary interest here is getting Bianco pizzas to go.  The menu has 4 of the 6 pizzas that are featured at Pizzeria Bianco plus a market pizza.  In my previous review I had expressed severe displeasure with the fact that although they do carryout orders they will not take orders over the phone.  I think that is a flaw, and should at least be better communicated.  \n\nAnyway, this time I called in advance and found out what the market pizza was (smoked mozzarella and sopresata), and asked them what the typical wait time was.  I was told about 10 minutes, which seems very reasonable.  I drove over there (it is only about 2.5 miles from my house) and put in my order for a Magherita and a Rosa.  There was some in-door seating available (it was a bit too cold to wait at the outside tables) so I sat and waited.  Chris Bianco came by and we had a nice chat.  My pizzas were indeed ready in less than 10 minutes.  I actually lost a couple of minutes when they failed to notice that they were to-go orders and put them out for table delivery.  They were a little colder than they should have been because of this, but the new setup (with seating in the part where Lux once was) was only in its first week, so I ave them the benefit of the doubt.  The pizza was wonderful, I had just partaken of a Rosa at Pizzeria Bianco about 3 weeks earlier and could not see any difference.\n\nI am withholding one star due to the phone order issue and the screwup on the to-go order, but this is the deal:\n\nPizzeria Bianco has what the NY Times claimed to be among the best pizzas in the country.  You have to wait an hour or two for a table.\n\nPane Bianco has the same pizza, and you can have one, either to eat in or take out, in about 10 minutes.", "business_id": "-AAig9FG0s8gYE4f8GfowQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-12-07", "type": "review"}

My gorgeous dining companion and I tend to split the fresh mozzarella, basil & tomato (so delish) and their market sandwich (their sandwich de jour) - and normally we can't finish the entire second half, which makes for a nice afternoon snack.  We like to sit outside, weather permitting - which really people, we live in Phoenix, so that's almost always - and slurp Coke from the bottle.\n\nI was a little disappointed with my experience today, although I am sure it was somewhat tempered by the fact that I wasn't accompanied by my man, but was instead grabbing food to go for us.  Apparently you can call in to go orders, which I didn't know, but numerous people cut in front of the long line by simply saying \"I called in my order.\"  Well, excuse me!  The long lonely line is one thing, but the kicker was the tuna salad that didn't have olives as advertised and the bean/veggie soup that really wasn't anything to write home about - it lacked salt for sure.\n\nThe girl in front of me wanted to order pizza and was told you can only order pizza at dinner time.  She was pissed and really, I can't blame her because we stood in line a long time.  But sweetie, really, go to Pizzeria Bianco if you want their pizza.  (PS: We ate there for dinner last night and I will post a separate review...I guess the holidays bring out my Bianco cravings...)\n\nAs I'm re-reading this, I realize it kinda sounds negative.  Which really doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things because this place is hugely popular and will continue to be I'm sure.\n\nTake away: yummy sandwiches, not cheap but that doesn't bother me if the quality is there - and it is.

It's a little pricey for a sandwich, but when the bread is made in house in a wood-fired oven, the mozzarella is made fresh in house, it is all worth it to me.

I left a bit bloated, but I would have definitely ate more had they set another plate of that delicious mozzarella in front of me. I seriously can't overstate how fantastic the cheese was. And they had fresh (not dried or old) whole black peppercorns on the table to grind onto the salad! They tasted almost as good as the pepper we used to get fresh right off the trees in our backyard.\n\nReally impressed with the quality of the ingredients here.

I know it is the little sister to Pizzeria Bianco, but this was the first restaurant we tried and it has become our favorite.  \n\nThe pizzas are brick oven style.  The crust (which is great!) is very thin and perfectly cooked with maybe a slight amount of char.  The sauce and topping combinations that they serve are all great.  The margerita pizza is our favorite.  I also really enjoy their Rosa pizza, and I usually despise onions!  The Biancoverde is also great.  You really can't go wrong with a pizza.\n\nOnce, we had an amazing vegetarian lasagna.  It was light with lots of veggies in it.  More recently, we ordered the lasagna on the menu, but it was much richer with TONS of cheese.  It was good, but not as good as what we had previously had.  \n\nGreat place to eat on Central & I've never had to wait.

When I was attending college in Tucson, Oreganos was just opening up. In fact my roommate and I attended a group interview in an attempt to snag a job, but unfortunately they did not find our request to wear diner outfits and call ourselves Dot and Myrtle amusing. Perhaps we were just too excited to serve pizza. \n\nI enjoy the pizza (I am not above thin crust), pasta, and atmosphere- in fact it is my in laws favorite place to go when they are in town. The pesto pasta with chicken added is my go to on the menu. The chicken is thin, almost shaved, strips and they absorb all the yummy pesto goodness. The one thing that keeps me from making the drive to Oreganos more often is the wait. No reservations, first come first served type of place and despite them having plenty of seating options, and on occasions open tables, I never seem to get out of there with less than a 30-45 minute wait. Regardless of the time of day, day of week, season, etc. there is always a wait. Once you get past the wait for the table, then you wait a little more for your server, then your food and when it is all said and done my dinner has stretched out to 1 1/2 -3 hours (depending on how many of us) and sometimes there is not enough goodness on a plate that can make up for that amount of time for pizza. \n\nWhile some people complain that it is a chain, it is a local start chain, which keeps it out of the axis of evil for me. I will continue to return to Oreganos on occasion, when I have absolutely no plans to follow my meal.", "business_id": "ML1RJdeZ7bbfMrHvJ7m99A", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-01-11", "type": "review"}

WTF? Umm when did you start taking take out orders in increments? Whose brilliant idea was this? It seems that Oreganos must have had a meeting.. \"How Can We Throw Money Out The Window\".. I know! By not allowing people to call in and place take out orders to be picked up within 30-40 minutes! That person needs to be fired. seriously, you lost a $100 order this morning..who knows how many more you lost today or will continue to lose with this kind of  business practice. This would have been repeat business no less. I guess we'll take our repeat lunch business elsewhere and make sure we get the word out to all companies that enjoy ordering from Oregano's that you can't accommodate multiple togo orders at lunch time during the week M-F. You can't be oblivious to how many other restaurants can and will gladly accommodate? Can You?

The wings are really good and they are all drum stick wings and three kinds of sauces. The original is best. The Italian wedding soup with a meat ball is so tasty. The Big Ravioli is really good and stuffed with lots or cheese meat and topped with marinara sauce. But the Chicago Style deep dish pizza is awesome. Its huge very filling so don't order unless your with a group of people. It takes about 30 minutes to make but its so worth it. Just remember to save room for the pzookie.

However... this location is my least favorite.  \n\nWe show up with a party of 6 at about 6PM and of course there's about a 45minute wait if you want to sit inside.  The only time Oregano's doesnt have a wait is on Sat afternoon about 1PM.  Literally the only time..   So they tell us that we can sit outside with the heat lamps and be seated right away.  We opt for the lamps and are seated.   Our waiter comes over and takes our drink orders and quickly returns with almost all the drinks.. he forgets our friends drink and when we mention it.. he scatters away and returns about 4min later with the drink.  By this time we order some wings and salads and the pizzas.  \n\nWhile waiting for our food, we notice our heat lamp above us is not on, and ask to have it turned on.  they come over and do it.  For some reason I notice that our waiter is no where to be found.  I start seeing other people filling our drinks, giving napkins, cheese, etc.  Oh well.. multi-tasking I guess.\n\nSo our food arrives via our waiter and he begins serving with an apology.. he put the olives that were supposed to be on the side.. ON the pizza.  One of our bunch is allergic to olives.. yeah..  So he brings out the stuffed pizza and we begin to work on that and the few start eating the olive pizza.  They keep saying sorry and will be bringing out the cheese pizza with olives on the side.  I swear it seemed like 30 more minutes before we saw someone with the pizza.  Within those minutes, our waiter vanished again, only to be seen in small  blips across the back of our minds.  Finally.. the pizza arrives and while we're all mostly done, our friend gets to start eating.   The manager is very kind to take to not charge for the extra pizza of course, but to make things even better, he throws in a pizza cookie.  it was our friends birthday, so that's two cookies we get.. yummy.\n\nSo we're all finished, and it's time to wait for our bill.  (checks watch). Oh there he is finally..  he drops the bill off and I ask him for change for a $100 bill..  he leaves.  (checks watch).  \"Wow, did he just leave??\"  At one point I see him come back about 10 minutes later and serve another table a drink and I notice the 100 in his hand.. lol . Wow.. Finally he goes back to get me change.  \n\nBy now we're all ready to leave and we start to split the bill up.. here's the best part.  Our bill came out to around $77 and change and a friend throws in the tip, another throws in $20.. What do I do because Im not paying attention and my mind is all over?  I shell out 77 in cash (along with everyone elses money) and say \"20 on the card and the rest is yours.\"  \n\n... I wonder why he was so nice when he came back with the card.    I guess I would be to if I got a $32.00 tip...    You would think he would have caught that.  \n\nI think this is the most of said on any of my reviews.  Will I go here again? Of course I will.  I live in Glendale and unfortunately, until they build one in Glendale, this is the closest one..

The bar was packed and so was the dining area - apparently others had the right idea, too!

First, the order was done perfectly. There was even extra marinara without charge that came along with the baked raviolli. The pizza did come with half light cheese, too. The most impressive part of this midday meal was the salad, a hill of romaine lettuce, parmesean cheese and the best croutons I've ever tasted. \n\nAlthough it was a little early in the day, the Dirty Monkey was freaking awesome and packed a nice little punch to help me get on with the rest of my day. \n\nWithout a doubt, I would return here with a group of people to share similar foods. The reason it was not five stars is because there was cheese on everything, so if you don't do well in the lactose-digesting department you may want to make sure you can handle it that day. The second issue was for some reason the pizza crust seemed like it was sweet. I've never heard of a sweet flat crust before, but the garlic on the pizza certainly masks the sugary crust. \n\nOther than that, a fabulously bustling environment with super friendly staff, drinks to get you drunk faster, and a hearty menu for those who really like cheese and sweetness.", "business_id": "ML1RJdeZ7bbfMrHvJ7m99A", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-01-28", "type": "review"}

The waitress gave me a weird look but was totally accommodating and even went in the kitchen to make sure they understood my order.  I got one with mushrooms and spinach and one with sausage and pepperoni.  \n\nThe pizza \"slices\" were much larger than I was expecting.  I figured 2 slices would fit in 1 box but no I got 2 slices and 2 boxes.  So with my luggage in tow and 2 boxes of oregano's, I was off to the airport.\n\nBaked it the second I got home and it was DELICIOUS!  My friend loved hers too.", "business_id": "ML1RJdeZ7bbfMrHvJ7m99A", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-01-23", "type": "review"}

I've always wanted to try a Chicago style deep dish Pizza since I first learned about it on Travel Channel back in 2005! During visit in Phoenix some friends took me to try this place out. They swore up and down that it was good. Reason for being adamant was because I've been to other places and have been majorly disappointed by claims of being so called deep dish when in reality is was bread fluffed up with smeared tomato sauce. I can attest, none of that was evident here. Ordered a pie... LOL... PIe! Kept is simple with Pepperoni and sausage. It was amazing! I felt like every other pizza was blasphemy compared to eating this! Puts everyone else to utter shame! So if your in market for deep dish and happen to be in the city of Phoenix, this is the place! Aside from being in Pizza Heaven, service was great. Our waiter along with other staff worked as a team and made our visit enjoyable.

He said that their meatball subs were good and he described it as a \"nice little spot\" that he remembered enjoying.\n\nLooking online for their web site before-hand, I discovered a simple godaddy placeholder page with their logo and address along with a \"coming soon\" notice. Every business out there needs a web site, and it's especially important to put your restaurant menu online, so this should have immediately been a warning sign for what was to come.\n\nWhen my friends and I arrived at the Manhattan Pizzeria, we were surprised to discover a total absence of sausage or pepperoni options. Apparently, the restaurant has recently been \"koshered\" and now only serves vegetarian options and fish-based meats. This came as quite a surprise, because the name of the restaurant was still the same, and we didn't have any fore-warning from their web site.\n\nWe decided to roll with it anyways and give it a chance, ordering a couple of slices of pizza with various vegetarian toppings. One of my friends ordered a sub sandwich that had salmon on it.\n\nAs we sat waiting at our table, ten minutes went by, then twenty. Right as we were really starting to get antsy (after waiting for almost a full 30 minutes), they brought our pizza slices and the sandwich out to our table. This struck all of us as a bit of an excessive wait. The place wasn't busy with other customers, and the food we ordered was pretty basic. Any decent pizza joint should have been able to toss the various toppings on their pre-made cheese pizza stock slices, pop them into the oven, and deliver them nice and hot to our table within 15 minutes (at the most). The idea of having to wait a full 30 minutes for this really put a damper on the overall lunch experience.\n\nTo top it off, the pizza was mediocre at best, and the salmon sub sandwich was a bit bland.\n\nIn summary, if vegetarian (or Kosher) pizza, pasta, and sub sandwiches are what you're after (and the idea of fish meatballs sounds good to you), then this is the place for you! Don't go unless you're willing to wait, though.\n\nAlso, I *really* think that the new restaurant owners should have completely renamed the place if they were going to take over and completely change the menu the way that they apparently did. Phoenix is a big place with a lot of people who have no doubt gone to the Manhattan Pizzeria over the years, and if you keep the same name, they are going to expect the same experience and the same types of food that they had in the past. Completely changing the name would have avoided the disappointment of un-met expectations.", "business_id": "-S7aL8dVIiXjCdbTZVn8uA", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-02-17", "type": "review"}

Pizza Heaven is another one of those hole-in-the-wall eateries that you hear about via word-of-mouth. Oh sure, I can sit here and spout out multi-hyphenated phrases all day, but in the end, Pizza Heaven is a great little place to get a slice or two.\n\nYou can do just that. Their menu offers pizza by the slice. Or if you're in a mood to share, you can order a whole conventional pie. Each slice is individually baked, so you should allay those fears of eating something that's been sitting under a heat lamp for who-knows-how-long. They come out of the oven piping hot and delicious. The ongoing daily special is Two Cheese Slices and a fountain drink for $4.00. Toppings are 50 cents extra, per slice, which is still not a bad deal if you want to add pepperoni and still not break the bank.\n\nI first heard about Pizza Heaven when some of my coworkers, during their several-times-a-week (I'm trying to stop with the hyphenates, honestly) ritual of ordering take out, started to pass a menu around. Now, I may not be accustomed to traditional Italian calzones, but something that caught me off guard was the fact that the calzone came with ricotta cheese as opposed to mozzarella. On recent visits, I've specified mozzarella be used rather than their default of ricotta. Other items ordered by my colleagues included Angel Bread Sticks, Meatball Parmigiana Stuffed Sandwich and the Insalata Caprese. There wasn't one item that they delivered that didn't look good. The menu also offers a whole wheat crust option and you can order your pizza with soy cheese if you feel the need. Other items on the menu I have yet to try include various pasta dishes, chicken wings (your choice of Mild, Medium, Hot or the painful-sounding \"Suicide\" variety) and desserts which include Cheesecake and Tiramisu.\n\nI had actually eaten Pizza Heaven's dishes several times before actually setting foot in the restaurant thanks to their quick delivery service to my place of business. When I ultimately made it there in the flesh, the first thing I noticed was how clean it was inside. The menu touts that Channel 3 News gave them the distinction of  \"Cleanest Kitchen in the Valley\". I would have to agree that if the kitchen looks anything like the rest of the interior, then they keep things in excellent and sanitary condition. The restaurant has also been awarded New Times \"Best of Phoenix\" award and although I haven't tried too many other local pizza places, I would have to agree that the award was well-deserved.\n\nFor those of you who don't want to pull yourself away from the comfort of your couch and your precious XBox, you can have your food delivered for a minimum of a $15 order. Whether or not the driver will be gracious enough to feed it to you so you won't have to pause your gameplay is entirely at his or her discretion, and I'm sure will require a larger tip.", "business_id": "auorqdHiATGZHVd-sd79ZQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-01-09", "type": "review"}

I am ALWAYS on the hunt for decent pizza wherever I go. I have traveled extensively and am a big fan of \"New York Style\" pizza and even better, Northern Italian and \"Neapolitan\" style pizza.\nSo I like to think that I know pizza.\nThere are certain things that can make or break a pizza: Sauce being the biggest. Followed closely by cheese and dough. And then the freshness and variety of ingredients. Of course if you are a diner, the atmosphere and service and also make or destroy a meal.\nI don't give 5 stars lightly!\n\nSauce: the dude that slammed the sauce here must be out of his mind. PH's sauce has the perfect \"marinara\" flavor with just the right amount of \"zing\". One of the best anywhere.\n\nDough: Brick-oven baked to a prefect golden brown...not too crisp, not too doughy...and clearly fresh. We tried the whole wheat as well. Nice flavor...\n\nCheese: We tried both the regular and soy cheeses in the many times we have eaten there. I always order the soy cheese now for health reasons. But even the regular mozzerella is not just some \"lets-get-the-lowest-priced-mozz-we-can-find-cheese\". You know what I am talking about: more grease and no milkfat. The cheese they are using may not be the best from Italy, but it is certainly a flavorful \"creamy\" mozz.\n\nIngredients: Pizza heaven does not lack fresh ingredients. They make their own sausage (my fav). While the pepperoni isn't the best I have ever had, it is certainly flavorful and not too greasy. I often like a pizza with a load of toppings... The Works! (With anchovies of course) But I typically try to eat healthy. So it is usually a White pizza on whole wheat crust with fresh spinach, tomatoes, red onion and artichoke hearts.\n\nI have watched this family-owned restaurant grow from a whole in the wall to a service restaurant with live entertainment, WiFi, and fast delivery. I can't get it delivered any more, but still enjoy dining in. I have never experienced \"bad\" service. But I would imagine any restaurant is going to have some of that now and again. I have always been treated well, with a smile, and gotten fast hot food. This is no suit-and-tie establishment. But for a great pizza, some great wings with a coupla beers, you can't miss.

This is why:\n\nTwo days after posting my last review, I was contacted through Yelp by the owner. She had even found my phone number and email address and contacted me there as well, after I didn't respond promptly she tried me again......it was evident she wanted to make things right and talk about my experience at Pizza Heaven. Over the next two weeks we discussed the issue and she apologized more then once and explained what had happened. We talked a bit about the compromises and challenges to running your own business and I found out all about where she sourced her Vegan cheese from, how to order other items Vegan at the restaurant, and about a new vegan sausage she was trying. Suffice to say that the owner cares immensely about her business and her customers. If all owners cared this much we might have a real dining dilemma (does Yelp exist in a society if every place warrants 5 stars??).\n\nI am happy to say that the owner made things right to my satisfaction (and then some) and I am also eager to let veg heads know about the new Vegan sausage - its pretty damn good. I have gotten two pies since my last review (sausage and green pepper) and they have been much better.\n\nI am glad that Pizza Heaven is now back on my pizza rotation.

CARBS!!! I decided to finally give Pizza Heaven a try. I was hesitant at first & I asked the waitress too many questions. My diet is vegan so I am always used to fresh quality food & as of a couple of months ago, I dropped sugar out of my diet as well. I was hesitant on the vegan cheese, because it stated that it was soy so I wasn't sure if it was non-gmo or if it contained sugar. The waitress was amazing, she brought me out a folder that had all the ingredients of the foods that they use. The vegan cheese brand is Follow Your Heart & it did not have any added sugar nor genetically modified ingredients. I started to be more opened to this menu & decided to order a vegan calzone w/ mushrooms, onions, & spinach. \n\nOh my gosh, DELICIOUS! And, it's also huge so I will have lunch for a few days too. The calzone bread was amazing & it only contained four ingredients, sugar not being one of them. It was topped off with EVOO, not butter, so it was just as vegan as it could be. The sauce was amazing, it complimented the calzone perfectly.\n\nI talked to the owner for quite a bit, who is wonderful. She informed me that her French fries are not fried in the same frier where wings or other meat products are fried. That is beyond amazing because not many restaurants will invest in a separate frier to accommodate to their vegan population, not even big cooperate restaurants, & I know this for a fact. She also uses purified water when she cooks & not tap, she is very passionate about her business & the quality of her ingredients.\n\nI cannot wait to go back.

I've never even tried the pizzas but my friends have and seem to enjoy them all - and I can attest they look and smell great - and as I'm so hungry right now it's going to be tough to not re-route my trip home for one of those tonight.   Sub sandwiches at $7 or $8 also a pleasure. The ones I've tried include the Meatball Parmigiano, the Heaven's Ham, and I think the Italian Stuffer, well-filled with salami, pepperoni, mozzarella, lettuce, tomato and mayo.  A bonus for the gluten impaired, brown rice pasta available as a substitute on most pasta dishes, at no discernible loss of taste or texture.\n  Service is always friendly if not exactly spot-on.  The young wait staff may not ask if you want wine, dessert, or a refill on your tea or soft drink, but it otherwise so affable and everything so affordable, you can overlook it - and just look forward to that cheesecake or tiramisu on a return visit.

Unfortunately due to traffic (we drive 40 minutes to this side of town) we got here rather late and had to call in at 9:10pm instead of dining in. We explained the situation to the front desk who called Patricia who was unfortunately not in at this time, and verified our story to her. It really says something about a company who goes the extra mile not only to write an apology letter about unpleasant service, but also give your next meal on the house. Despite having to take out, our meal was still warm once we got all the way to Chandler again, and was absolutely beautiful in flavor and quality. While we were originally disappointed in what must have been a bad night for our server, this night and the owners respect and consideration really blew me away. We are definitely going to be visiting many more times to come, especially because it's hard to find a delicious, classic pizza taste that is vegan, (and it's much better to support local businesses anyway!)

My favorite so far is their roast beef sandwich. I've always found the waiters to be good and accommodating and I even like the patrons that will come in, which are either families in the dining area or people just sitting at the bar drinking a glass of wine while they wait for their take out order. Never found it to be too crowded, or too loud, or otherwise obnoxious. All of which is why I really like the place.

I would have been better off only having one slice, but they were so delicious!  They had 80's music playing while we were there and I looved it!! So far, great place, great food, great atmosphere... however, the only reason for not giving it another star, is because upon ordering and paying, they gave me a number to put on the table.  You'd think that would  be so they knew which table to bring the food to, but this wasn't the case.  The lady who brought our pizza out, just stood there, confused, she looked over the dining room, turned back around and went back into the kitchen... then she came back out, looked at all the tables and diners again, then went back to the kitchen still holding our plates.  I could see that she asked someone which table the order belonged to, twice! and when she came back out the third time, she started asking random tables if it was their order, I called to her and asked if they were with the toppings we'd ordered, and she said yes.  The place was busy, but not crazy busy.\nPerhaps it was just an off day for the server or maybe she was new, but what was the point of giving me the number if they weren't even going to use it?", "business_id": "TqHTtjPANCBKGsjGBjDoQQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-01-18", "type": "review"}

We hadn't been since the remodel and we were very shocked at how nice the dining area looks now. We had rarely eaten at the restaurant previously because it felt too cramped, but now it's definitely a lot more open and inviting. Since it was a nice day, we sat outside which was also very nice. Our table wobbled quite a bit but our served fixed that quickly. The only negative about sitting outside was there was a man who kept comimg outside to smoke, even though it cleary says no smoking all throughout the patio. We were not affected since we were far enough away, but other tables asked to be moved inside due to his smoking. I was surprised that none of the employees said something to him. Makes me wonder if he was also an employee. \n\nWhen we order take-out we normally get the Brooklyn, which is our favorite.  A 16\" is normally a good size for the three of us. This night we decided to order our own 8\" pizzas. My husband did the brooklyn, I got the chicken pesto, and my son got the cheese.  If you're hungry get a larger pizza. The singe pizzas are very small. For me, it was perfect, but my husband was still pretty hungry at the end of the night. If you have a bigger appetite I definitely reccomend ordering a larger size. Overall the flavor was very good on all three.\n\nDrinks, I ordered their locally brewed Phoenix St. ale and it was very good! my husband had a mojito which was too sweet.

All this time the waiter acted as if he were doing us a favor, as if we were disturbing him from sorting his receipts from his other poorly served customers!\n\nWhen the food finally arrived, my dish was even colder, just mildly warm!#!$#!  \n\nI recommend that if you are out to impress a guest in any capacity, this is not that place to take them...Go next door to the Cheesecake Factory!  I'm not sure about the service, but the whole layout at least,  looks inviting and clean.", "business_id": "ut-kla-EA23nJOij_dcL0Q", "stars": 2, "date": "2008-02-15", "type": "review"}

I have not had a chance to review until now.  It was about 2 months ago on a Friday evening.  It had been a long week and my daughter and I wanted to grab a bit to eat and then browse the Borders next door.  I knew there would probably be a wait since it was Friday night.  We walked in and there we some other parties seated waiting.  I went up to the hostess and gave her my name.  I asked where the restrooms were and told her we were going to use them and we would be right back.  She said \"that's fine\" .  There was another party of 3 ahead of us, a mom and two children, that had been seated there when we walked in.  They came in the restroom too and we all came back out at the same time and sat down to wait.  They were seated about 5 minutes afterward.  I watched the hostess as she folded napkins and did other things at her station.  Another couple walked in and they were seated immediatly.  Then another mom and child walked in and were seated.  When the hostess came back I told her we had been waiting ang gave her my name again....this was at least 15 mins later.......and she said \"I called your name\" very rudely.  I told her we had been in the restroom (for not more than 5 mins) and she said \"oh well\".  And then she said well, I guess I can seat you now.  This girl was maybe 18 or 19, tall, thin, pretty, but certainly did not have the brains god gave her!  She was rude and clearly did NOT pay attention to her job.  She was too busy trying to look pretty.  \n\nThe rest of the experience was fine.  Our server was pleasant and fast. However, on the basis of that hostess.....stay away!  Management needs to keep a close eye on these kids.  They could take a lesson from the manager at Grimaldi's in Chandler.....that manager knows how to keep her staff in check and on the ball!\n\nI won't be going back to this particular CPK.", "business_id": "ut-kla-EA23nJOij_dcL0Q", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-12-18", "type": "review"}

It is a basic Italian linguine covered in a garlicky, peanut sauce, there are is some bean sprouts and carrots in the mix. However I do have to add a large amount of red pepper to this dish to have adequate flavor for me.  This is also one of the cheaper items on the menu.\n\nI have also tried the salmon when I was trying to be healthy, however it was clear that their blacking process involved a good amount of butter.\n\nAs for the pizzas there is a eclectic mix of pizzas topped with items not traditionally seen on pizza, at least until the California pizza scene had effected out world.  I opt for the mushroom pizza. It is a sourceless style pizza with a \"mushroom pesto\" that is quite earthy and greasy. \n\nIncluded with a meal is bread and butter, the Italian bread here is fairly good with firm crust and airy body.", "business_id": "ut-kla-EA23nJOij_dcL0Q", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-02-05", "type": "review"}

They have a wide selection of food and everything at least USED TO BE great. Seems to be a few months ago something changed... Delivery now takes forever, orders are wrong, customer service is nonexistent, the wings contain little meat now, and no managers to be found. \n\nThe way they've changed their business makes me regret that I had my whole office ordering from them. Granted if you order a cheese steak sandwich, it could be confused with cheese sticks. That's why an order taker should repeat your order back to you. \n\nLast time I had a problem with them was the first time I've ever had a problem. I was hoping it was a one time thing. The manager at the time rectified it with fixing my order and offering me 20% off my next order. Good deal. Even though I had to wait 2+ hours to receive the wrong order, I try to be understanding. \n\nThis time there was no rectification, not even a call returned. I had to wait over an hour for my food when I was quoted 30 minutes. When I called to find out where it was, I was told they were busy. When the delivery driver had to inform me they were out of something (the reason I ordered from them in the first place) AND the order was wrong, I was hungry and cranky to say the least. I called back in to speak to the manager because they gave me an appetizer instead of a sandwich, he was conveniently not there. The order-taker offered to make me a sandwich and deliver it to me personally. I was satisfied with that. To my dissatisfaction, he called me five minutes later with another excuse that it was the end of the night and they had turned off the machines. It's obvious lack of management when a business is open for 15 more minutes and should be taking orders in that time to maintain profitability. So lazy employees decide to take off early. \n\nHopefully they will change back to the way things used to be and I can order in confidence once more. Until then, if you order from them - pick it up so you know if it's wrong right away and you don't have to wait at least twice of the quoted time. If you order delivery, I suggest ordering the exact opposite of what you want. This way, they might get something right. \n\nWhy, Frank's?

In fact, you could sum up the valleys breakfast nooks as vacant or un found.  There is one beacon of breakfast hope that can be found in the central corridor, and Vincents be thy name.\n\nObviously Vincents is a culinary staple in the valley that is known far and wide and adorned by all.  What is somewhat unknown to valley foodies is that right behind the main Vincents restaurant sits \"Vincents Bistro.\"  What does that mean to the food masses? The best price point in the valley on fine dining in a great setting.  Before you engage the menu, make sure to enjoy the house made croissants and butter, this little treat will get your senses going in the right direction.  \n\nThe menu at the Bistro is not complex(neither is the main dining room), but has staples such as Vincents famous smoked salmon quesedilla($10) and main lobster with handmade basil pasta($14).  The Bistro has a daily prix fixe menu that uses the following methodology. An appetizer of choice, a main entree of choice and dessert.  The price tag is never greater than $20 for the prix fixe and I challenge another restaurant in the valley to beat it.  Choices can range from prime new york steak, to lamb chops to a wonderfully cooked piece of fish.\n\n\nWhat are the cons? Good luck coordinating a take out order with the normal busyness of the operation.  Wait times for pick up can range from forty-five minutes to over an hour.  If you feel like your caught in the middle of a whirlwind circus when picking up your order, don't worry, that's just the normal pace.  \n\nIn 1982 Vincent Guerithault catapulted Arizona into the beginning phases of the culinary elite the other larger metropolis cities were already enjoying.  Now, thirty years later, he has done it again with the Bistro.

I don't care that they forgot my pepperoni at first and I had to wait a whole 45 seconds or so. The pizza is just really good, the staff is friendly, and it is such a deal. And I never get tired of reading the randomly odd stuff on the walls... like how Sean McLaughlin stopped there for a slice after getting married... or a Xerox certification of Elvis' check for the purchase of three Caddys... or the poster for the maiden voyage of the Titanic. Just odd stuff, but I did learn today that they have a catering menu too. \n\nA huge thank you to my friend Tina, for fronting me cash after I realized I didn't have any. They still don't run plastic under $5. Oh yeah, and after Tina went on and on about how she doesn't often find pizza she likes, I got an IM from her later... \"yummy pep pizza\". Yes, it is. :) \n\n_________________________________________________\n\nMy hubby introduced me to this hole-in-the-wall joint. For under $4, you get a lunch special with two YUMMY slices, one topping each, and a drink. I like peno's... they came freshly chopped, sans seeds and membranes.

April 3, 2013 I did my weekly visit to the restaurant to enjoy pizza and drinks with some friends.  In walks a young man and a young woman who were set at the table just next to me a few feet.  On his waist band was a 9 MM pistol.  I am fully for gun rights, as I own one as well, however what I am not for is eating dinner in a family establishment with loaded handguns strapped to other patron's waists.  Every one with in distance of the gun (which had a significant clip attached to it) asked why he felt he needed it in the restaurant.  What we all concluded was this establishment must not be safe if he feels it is necessary to arm himself as he did.  Spinato's allowed this man to carry this in to their establishment as under Arizona law they could choose to keep them out.  I loved you Spinato's, but I simply don't feel comfortable sitting three feet from a random stranger who is armed to the hilt and could take every one out in a matter of minutes.  \n\nI think it is fair to say we can all enjoy your pizza without a 50 clip strapped to our waists.

They may have a Pizza Hut sign and Pizza Hut food, but with the service you get, you would think you are in a back alley getting surgery from Michael J Fox. Metaphor aside, this location is TERRIBLE. Spend the time to go to a different location. They have an average of 2.5 stars for a reason. I placed an order online at 8:09 that was followed immediately by the email saying my food will be delivered at 8:39. At 8:20 I missed a call because I'm busy enjoying a laughter filled night in with my boyfriend. I check my phone to see the time at 8:21 and saw that I just missed a call from a number I didn't know.  FYI - I'm new to the area and AZ in general so every number is foreign to me.  I check to see if I have a voicemail from that number......NOPE....I go on about my night.  Fast forward to  8:59 when I checked my phone again (20 minutes after my food was supposed to arrive), I get frustrated thinking the food should have been here.  I look up their number and give Pizza Hut a call **SPOILER ALERT** It was Pizza Hut at 8:20pm.\n\nI call back, asking what's going on and instead of getting any information, I get told, \"Hold on.\" Then I'm talking to someone new. Adam. Who I can assume is a manager, maybe? Anyway, I come to find out that my card was declined (thanks Chick Fil A and your security breech) and that they cancelled the order after I didn't answer my phone (because no American has more than one credit card). I bring up that I didn't have a voicemail from said caller which contradicts their policy/protocol which IS to leave a message. Said manager ADMITED that she (female caller) didn't follow protocol and had no sympathy that now an hour has passed and I'm a very unsatisfied client. Did you get that?.. The manager ADMITTED that they didn't follow proper protocol for this situation.  Adam, like a robot, kept repeating, \"the best I can do is give you a $5 credit.\"  Adam said they canceled the order after I didn't pick up the phone.  That's how disposable of a customer I am?? You're too lazy to leave a voicemail?? What if I was taking a shit? Screw me, I guess since I missed your call I don't get dinner tonight.  I'm supposed to have pizza hut's number memorized and know that a random 623 number was them?? Oh wait.... I would assume any reputable business would in fact leave a Voicemail if they needed to get in touch with me. \n\nOk well I'll remember that the next time I'm hungry. Oh balls, that's now. Well at least I have credits. They're low in fiber, just like everything else...because they're NOT FOOD! What could have made it right? Say \"I'm sorry,\" I'll give you a different card and you get someone to bring me the dinner I ordered. But who am I? I'm just a simple girl with simple expectations.\n\nJust do yourself a favor and DO NOT expect any customer service from this location. Go elsewhere. I will be driving to a different Pizza Hut just to avoid this kind of awful handling of issues that arise. I know things happen but the way you deal with them is how you retain customers. Shame on you Pizza Hut.  I asked Adam, \"Is it worth it to you to lose a customer who just moved to your area over a $16 order?\"..... Apparently the answer is YES.  Employees don't follow protocol and do their due diligence to ensure their running a smooth a customer focused/customer satisfied business.

Typically with chicago style thin, some of the toppings will be under the cheese and it's generally a sweeter marinara than most are used to.\n\nIf you're not in the mood for pizza I can also recommend the spaghetti calzone which my wife will order from time to time, I recommend ordering this with meatballs.  but personally I'm a sucker for the pizza, also the prices are pretty reasonable and expect to have leftovers unless you've got a real A-game appetite\n\nIf you don't know the story behind Spinato's originally it was under the name Aurelio's which if you've ever been in the chicagoland area is a local family owned favorite throughout the state. and my personal favorite, and one of my \"we have to eat here\" places when I go home to visit.  Aurelios started out in AZ by a relative of the Aurelio family and eventually the family owned franchised took off the aurelios name, but continued to deliver the same high quality pizza under their own name Spinato.\nthe pizza is not verbatim to Aurelios in IL, but it's damn close, damn tasty and good enough to inspire childhood nostalgia and a drive from surprise to 16th st and Bell.\n\nI'm almost a little sad that I didn't discover Spinato's up until last year. My wife has in the past even looked into getting mail order frozen pizza from Aurelios dry ice and absorbinent fees and all. and the closest thing I could find was deno's which was made in  the same style but the flavors were different.  fortunately they like to order this pizza at work and one day I tasted some pizza and was immediately reminded, I looked at the box did some googling and was amazed that they were here all along.\n\nI hope to frequent Spinato's and hope they setup a location further west.", "business_id": "pF7uRzygyZsltbmVpjIyvw", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-01-05", "type": "review"}

There's a giant hole in our hearts from missing her. She knows we love Spinato's pizza, the sauce with it's sweet and savory goodness, the family friendly service and the affordable prices in a time of vast economic uncertainty. It's a little slice of comfort. So, she wanted to surprise us with a gift card to our favorite restaurant but that's a little hard to do from so far away. Spinato's stepped up in a big way. Not only did they sell her a gift card, but they sent one of their managers, with a bouquet of twelve red-heart balloons, to deliver her gift to our doorstep. Spinato's act of service for one of our military members went above and beyond the call of making great pizza. They showed their patriotic spirit by helping an airman reach out with a comfort-food hug to her parents. Thank you Spinato's!

Didn't end up arriving until 7:43. Which i was a little Hangry about.. Total was $53.00, gave the driver $70. Keep the change.  Open up the pizza, first thing i notice is its terribly smashed to the top on the box. (well at least it's hot) NOT. Like it had been sitting around for quite some time. Open the bruschetta..just some bread, and tomato bits strewn about in some tinfoil. (maybe the mozzarella sticks will be great) Cold. Just like the Super 6 i ordered. Sad day in pizza eating history. I am not sure if regular management was away.. Or they had new management? But i was incredibly disappointed in the feedback i received when i called to complain that i just spent $70 on some Cold,Smashed pizza to be delivered to my house. AND tipped quite well.

Everything was delivered hot, fresh, and on time, complete with plastic ware, plates, and napkins. \n\nLast year, due to the location of the convention, I used my local McDowell Red Devil. This year, it was at my school in NoSco, so we went with the Bell location. It's great to know that there is consistency in the quality of the food, generous quantity, and outstanding service at both locations. \n\nRed Devil, te amo!", "business_id": "0gQrhOYWdO0XVZEKtOrvaA", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-02-06", "type": "review"}

We picked this place based on the positive online reviews. The place was unimpressive looking, but there was quite a wait which I took as a good sign (nobody lines up and waits for bad food...or at least they shouldn't). After half an hour we got seated. They placed us in what looked like an addition to the building and it was freezing! They had the A/C blasting and a ceiling fan going. Our server was very nice, and our drinks and salads came out rather quick. Then it took a turn for the worse. Well over an hour passed between receiving our drinks/salads and when our meals where finally brought out to us. During that time, none of our drinks were refilled, our used plates weren't removed, and no one came to check on us until the hour mark. When our food did come out it was nice and piping hot, but it was also unrecognizable. Every plate was drowning in marinara sauce. You had to do some serious excavating to uncover your food. And the food was pretty mad. We ordered spaghetti, eggplant parmesan, and the manicotti. Ragu tastes better than the sauce that they seemingly have an neverending supply of. And the eggplant was mushy and unflavorful. To add insult to injury, the prices were absurd! They charged prices on par with higher end Italian restaurants...yet this place is a far cry from anything upscale. Maybe this place is only good for the pizza, but based on this experience I'm not willing to give it a second chance.", "business_id": "0gQrhOYWdO0XVZEKtOrvaA", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-01-01", "type": "review"}

Then order your white pizza, asking for anchovies in addition to the chicken and garlic.

One by one they refuse, making sure to squinch-up their nose while doing so....a telltale sign of their disgust for anchovies.

A discussion with a friend the other day reminded me I needed to write about this place.\n\nWhile out shopping with my parents the day before Thanksgiving, they suggested hitting Red Devil for lunch.  Being happy that they didn't try to suggest one of the big chain places they tend to frequent, we bought in.  From the very dated and drab outside appearance, I was worried.  When we walked inside and I saw the decor that clearly hadn't been updated in about 30 years, I was even more worried.  First impressions are important, and if I was reviewing this place on its appearance and decor alone, it would be two stars at best.\n\nFortunately, appearance isn't everything.  There is a reason this place is still around: the food is great.  The calzone I had was massive, far too much for one reasonable person to eat.  It was delicious, the bread was soft and perfectly cooked, and the ingredients (spinach, artichoke, sausage and of course, cheese) were plentiful and flavorful.  The antipasto salad my parents and fiancee shared was large enough to feed a small village in the Dolomites.  Food portions are not lacking, and food quality is excellent.\n\nI love wings, almost to a fault.  I want to order them any time they're on a menu, but I show restraint sometimes.  On this day, I did not.  I ordered the wings.  My fiancee asked \"You're ordering wings at an Italian restaurant\", to which I replied with a hint of indignation \"Uh, yeah.\"  I am glad I did.  And so was she.  The wings were incredible.  Seriously some of the best wings I've had in a very long time.  They were decent sized, perfectly cooked, and evenly coated in some of the most balanced wing sauce I can remember having.  A straightforward buffalo sauce, they were a little spicy, just enough kick to compliment the explosion of flavor.  I was shocked by how good they were.  My taste buds were pleased throughout the meal.  \n\nBasically, this place gets four stars because of the food.  The service was decent, but not great.  The ambiance and decor was so dated that I felt out of place because I was not wearing stonewashed jeans and a Hypercolor shirt.  The prices were reasonable enough considering the portion sizes.  But the food quality...all win.", "business_id": "0gQrhOYWdO0XVZEKtOrvaA", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-12-23", "type": "review"}

It was on par with Little Caesars and Eats-a-Pizza.  The crust was hard and overcooked.  The toppings slid right off since it was cooked to death and arrived with the center BOILING hot.  If your a big fan of cheap frozen pizza, I think you'll love Fatso's Pizza because it's totally reminiscent of Red Baron pizzas you'd find for $5 at Walmart.  I'm not going to go deep into what was wrong simply because everything was bad about the darn thing.  I ended up just leaving 75% of it there and paying my bill.  It's not the waitress fault and I tipped her, but only the old standard of 15% because she was no help making our meal any better.  Wouldn't you think she'd offer to take it back, remake it, or offer something better on the menu?  Nope, she just looked at us like this was the first time she'd ever heard their pizza was dog food on a hockey puck and went about her way.  \"Sorry you don't like it\" is all we got from her although she seemed to be a nice lady.  The wings were baked and that's okay as long as I know that going in, and the menu told us so very clearly (I liked that).  Although I definitely prefer fried, these were okay.  They were nothing special since they just seemed to be un-doctored hot sauce and butter.  My issue with them was that they were tiny, teeny, itsy-bitsy, little baby wings.  Seriously, if you're going to charge that much for wings, offer up wings that are at least thicker than the celery sticks.  An average person could eat 2-3 dozen without spoiling dinner.  All in all, I'd have to say this is a great place if you want a local drunks hangout and high school cafeteria food in one convenient location.

If you like Taco bell, Berger king, Dominos, Pizza hut and other low grade food thats fine. There is a time and place for that. When i eat pizza i want a nicely risen crispy crust, an appropriate to conservative amount of sauce and quality cheese.\n   What i received was loose doughy crust, not crispy. I don't know if it was pre bought, pre made or frozen. It was wet with tons of over sweetened sauce and had a little cheese. The cheese swimming in sauce. I really wanted to like this pizza because the guys were so nice but i left sincerely believing i had just tried the worst pizza i have ever had in Phoenix.

There's something magical about it. The bottom of the crust is just firm and thick enough to withstand the weight of the fresh and flavorful toppings. The combination of the bottom of the crust and the fresh and homemade toppings is just the beginning. \n\nThe edge of the crust steals the show.

The crust is a big component on why their pizza is so delicious.\n\nI've only been to their Ahwatukee location but I'm sure the other locations are just as good.

This place had been made out to be one of the best pizza places in Ahwatukee. I started off the meal with a basic dinner salad with the house dressing and ordered a veggie thin crust pizza. The dressing is delicious, and I would definitely consider buying a bottle of it to keep at home.However as our pizza arrived, I saw the first hint that this pizza place was not going to live up to its reputation. First of all, I ordered a thin crust pizza, however, my pizza looked as if it was just regular crust. The pizza itself wasn't bad- fresh ingredients, good amount of cheese and toppings, but the sauce could use a little more basil or oregano. I was thoroughly unimpressed. My boyfriend ordered a deep dish pizza, and suffice to say, it wasn't really deep dish. It looked like regular pizza just with super high pizza crust walls. The topping and the flavors were good, but the deep dish pizza wasn't really filled enough to be considered deep dish.

The Chopped Chicken Gorgonzola Salad is just as delicious as I had hoped it would be. And I thought that would be impossible if it didn't have Nello's famous house dressing. We got the special pizza of the night, thin crust with bacon and onions, again delicious. Also, I think Nello's has the best beer on tap, it has just a tad more bubbles than other places. Dare I say Four Peaks Hop Knot is better at Nello's than at Four Peaks? Nah, I better not, but it's still pretty good! =)\n\nNello's is one of my favorites!  Whenever we can't decide what we want to eat, we can always go to Nello's and know it's going to be good!  My favorites are the Old World Classic salad (always with HOUSE DRESSING) and the Classic European pizza on thin crust.  Thin crust is only available in 12\", but it is crispy, crackery thin, just like I love it.  Last time, we went with some friends, so we decided to try something new.  We got the Mozzarella Platter for an appetizer, the Antipasto Salad and a thin crust pizza.  Everything was just as delicious as always.  The one thing that didn't seem to fit was the carrots and celery on the appetizer, other than that, perfection as usual!", "business_id": "RYZ08XAToBaN-bS5HHVEhQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-01-30", "type": "review"}

Food at this local pizza joint is high quality you can taste. As a chef dining out for a casual lunch, I left pleased and with cash still in my pocket.\n\nFirst we had the Roasted Eggplant Bruschetta, the baguette was toasted to perfection. The crust was crisp with a nice light sourdough flavor and chew, not over toasted a bit and still tender on the inside. The four baguettes were topped with a beautiful creamy, tangy goat cheese. The eggplant was beautifully roasted and naturally rich in flavor. Sun-dried tomatoes added a nice acid element to this dish, which was served warm with a well balanced Balsamic Reduction. \n\nNext we tried the Smoked Chicken and Broccoli Pizza. The crust, oh gosh. THE CRUST! Perfect. Thin and crunchy, tender, caramelized in the wood burning oven to a perfect golden brown. The smoked chicken was still moist, the broccoli still had a nice bite to it as all vegetables should and had a fantastic roasted flavor. No sauce here, just a little olive oil and garlic went down before the toppings. The Mozzarella and Smoked Provolone were appropriate, but a nice nutty Asiago or Parmesan-Reggiano would have been a welcome touch.  Bacon? Of course we added bacon! An Applewood Smoked Bacon. Although in recent years bacon, and especially Applewood Smoked has been overplayed in the culinary world, Nello's kept it organic in style. The bacon has a wonderful fatty crunch, just the right balance of salt and smoke and cooked just so. The half slabs of thick, delicious bacon were simply laid over our pizza towards the end of cooking. Very pleased this bacon wasn't chopped up into tiny bits. \n\nThe Banana-Nut Bread Pudding was tempting but Tiramisu has my heart. Being half Italian I know Tiramisu and Nello's has made a great play on this classic dessert. First a thick layer of creamy mascarpone was sweetened to not over power the cheese itself. The ladyfinger layer held its integrity and wasn't soaked to the point of sogginess which is a pleasant surprise. Another generous layer of mascarpone and a surprisingly thick dusting of cocoa powder was a great touch. \n\nNello's is worth every penny, the bill for two of us was just over $30.00. We left full and happy, too many dining experiences can be disappointing if the little details are left out. They don't miss a beat! David was a fantastic server with an upbeat attitude, the rest of the staff was also attentive and helpful. Beer and Wine selection is nice as well, there is definitely something for everyone here. \n\nLike Nello's on Facebook, they post special items with fantastic seasonal ingredients that any food lover would get pumped over!  \n\nI will be back time and time again.", "business_id": "RYZ08XAToBaN-bS5HHVEhQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-12-19", "type": "review"}

With all the lunch providers in Ahwatukee and with the holiday season you would think Nello's may have been apologetic and even a little generous.   We weren't expecting our entire $40 ticket to be comped, but when we asked if I could receive some compensation, Shea responded by saying they can replace the half sandwich/salad if my co-worker came back in that day.   Not even an apology and a $10 gift card.  I guess the Ahwatukee Nello's has a manager who doesn't really believe in a high level of customer service.

We arrived an hour later, only to be told that our pizza hadn't been put in the oven yet. We asked when that would happen, and were told \"I don't know.\" We inquired, \"well, how long does it take to cook a pizza?\" and were told \"I don't know. The oven is full, so whenever there's room, I guess yours will be put in.\" We waited around 5 minutes, asked again, and were told again \"I don't know. Yours isn't in the oven yet.\" We would have loved to speak to someone that actually knew what was going on, but the only person in there over the age of about 18 was running around like a chicken with it's head cut off. Yes, it was a Friday night, yes they claimed to be busy. But there were a total of two other customers in the place. \nThe restaurant is incredibly poorly managed, and staffed by a bunch of people that couldn't care less if you ever get the food that you ordered. Basic questions, such as \"when we my pizza be ready?\" are met with a blank stare and \"I don't know.\" \nI wouldn't have minded waiting for my pizza if I was told an actual time it would be ready. My first job was at a pizza place, and I still remember (several years later), that our oven took 14 minutes to cook. \nOh, and to top it off, the place is incredibly smokey and I know smell like I've been sitting by a campfire for hours. \nGet it together, Rosati's.

I mean, I've had their personal pizzas on multiple occasions while waiting in the airport. So, I knew the food would be good. It only stands to reason that the actual restaurant would be nothing short of amazing, right? Sadly, no.\n\nMy daughter and I decided to stop in after a nice long play date nearby. When we arrived, it was 2:00 in the afternoon. The restaurant was almost completely empty. We were immediately seated, which was nice.\n\nFrom there, however, things kind of went downhill.\n\nOnce we were seated, we sat...and waited...and waited. In a restaurant where there were FAR more servers than there were patrons, you'd figure that the service would have been a little better. \n\nBut, here's the kicker. Since the place was so empty, it made overhearing conversations among the servers pretty easy. As we sat and waited for someone to come and see us, I could overhear the servers arguing over who was going to help us. I know what you're thinking...maybe they were seeing whose turn it was for fairness' sake. No, these servers might as well have been drawing straws to see who got the short one. Nothing like feeling like a burden to set your dining mood.\n\nAll of that time to sit and think ended up shedding some light on another negative thing. The plates they provided at the table still had some food caked on them. Had I not had all of that free time to sit and look around, I might not have noticed it as readily. \n\nAs expected, the food was still fantastic. We went the safe route and got the margherita pizza. Thin crust, and delicious! Our pizza ended up being plenty for two of us to share, and only set us back about $16 with two drinks.\n\nI really wish I could rate this place higher, because I really do enjoy their pizza. But my experience with the service was downright unpleasant. I'll stick to picking up their personal pizzas from the airport. That way I know I'll be getting a good pizza, but I won't have to worry as much about unexpected shoddy service.

While this chain doesn't produce a pizza that would compete with one served to the gods on Mount Olympus,  you can usually be assured of a decent pizza at a reasonable price.  At this particular Hut in Anthem I have \"dined-in\" and \"ordered-out\".  The dining room is small and pleasant but best of all, the service was superb.  We have also picked up pizza here and taken it home to eat.  Most of the time the pizza has been OK.  Unfortunately the last time we ordered out, we ordered a \"thick crust super supreme\"... which turned out to be far from super.  It was primarily a piece of flat bread with what appeared to be an artists rendering of what a pizza should look like from directly over head.  There was very little in the way of any real toppings on it.  It was just a tomato red color with some faint impressions of pepperoni, onion, peppers and some of the other normal condiments.  I am hoping this was just a one time slip and not an attempt on the part of Pizza Hut to cut costs by eliminating the volume of most of the toppings.  This was one of the \"specials\" that Pizza Hut runs periodically where you can get any size pizza for ten dollars.  I would rather spend more money and get a real pizza rather than a facsimile of a pizza.  Pizza Hut is usually a solid Yelp three star dining establishment, but on this one particular visit, it sunk to 1 1/2 stars.  As I previously stated, I hope this one time was an aberration.  I will try one more time... but only one more time; if the product turns out as abysmal as this last one was, I will go elsewhere in the Anthem area for pizza.

Needless to say, I will be back! An uber-dive to be sure, with low prices to match.", "business_id": "Cp5_NSJFNgylD5SUdmT8nQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-01-17", "type": "review"}
