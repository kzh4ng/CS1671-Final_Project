Steak he wants, steak he gets!  We did a little bit of research about where to get a great piece of meat in Pittsburgh, and we finally decided to check out Morton's.  We'd heard of it from Chicago, and it definitely has a good reputation there too.\n\nSo we came in for our 7:30 reservation on a Tuesday.  The hostess greeted us warmly, and led us into the dimly lit room to our booth.  I had told them on OpenTable that it was my boyfriend's birthday, and my mom called ahead to pre-order some things, so the waitstaff knew that we were celebrating.  And wow, somebody told him \"Happy birthday!\" every 15 minutes!  They all knew about it!  Our menus actually had \"Happy 28th birthday, Taylor!\" printed on them.  My mom had pre-ordered sparkling wine, which was waiting for us on ice when we arrived.  The sommelier (wearing a tux!) poured it for us.  After we toasted, a hostess came by with a digital camera and snapped our picture.  Five minutes later, she came back with a print out of the picture, and a birthday card signed by various servers.  Wowza!\n\nWe felt unbelievably welcomed.  We helped ourselves to a slice of the huge loaf of onion-y bread sitting on the table, while we listened to our server tell us about the various menu offerings.  It's a little funny how they have examples of the food sitting under plastic wrap.  It does give you a nice visual for the steaks, but it's a little funny for....asparagus.  Still, seeing the size of the meat helped us make our choice.\n\nFirst, we got the onion soup and the Caesar salad.  The onion soup was served bubbling hot, with a layer of cheese baked on top, of course.  It was very tasty - not the best I've ever had, but it definitely hit the spot for two hungry people!  Something about the broth was a bit too sweet perhaps.  The Caesar was great - they knew we were splitting it so they served it on two perfectly portioned plates - you could taste every single ingredient that goes in a classic Caesar.  You know they made this dressing perfectly - can't leave out the anchovy!  Delicious.\n\nWe each got the bone-in Ribeye, which was 20 oz of medium-rare amazingness.  Our steaks were unbelievably tender and flavorful.  The meat was pretty marbled, but the fat was so succulent that honestly I ate every bite of it.  The meat needs no sauce - just that luscious char on top and warm tender beef within.  Fantastic.  Loved every bite.  Our one wish was that the plates were warmed - since they were cool, it seemed like the steak was cooling down faster than it should.  But that didn't stop us from loving our wonderful dinner!\n\nMom had pre-ordered two desserts, their classic chocolate cake and the creme brulee.  I didn't taste the cake, but my boyfriend said it was incredibly rich and decadent.  I loved the creme brulee, and somehow finished every bite despite being stuffed already.\n\nService was always friendly, the ambiance was romantic, and truly I felt like we were royalty.  Come here on a special occasion, and you'll see what I mean.  It is a very expensive place to eat, but totally worth it for a special occasion.  With prices that high, you deserve to feel like their most cherished patrons of all time, and we certainly did.  I would very much like to come back the next time we have something to celebrate and want to have a big steak at the same time!", "business_id": "90Fqfzd8zD9AuuNBSv9lAg", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-08-18", "type": "review"}

I took my girlfriend here to celebrate some important events that occured all within a week. It took close to a week to decide where we had wanted to try and we decided first to make it upscale, and secondly about steak. Well we had our clear choice to be Morton's. \n\nWe enjoyed the ambience and atmosphere that was provided as well as the wonderful and informed wait staff. We had reservations and were actually sat early which was fantastic! I am a big lover of steaks so I chose the porterhouse, while my girlfriend had the double cut filet. \n\nWe started first with a salad wedge which I found to be tasty, very crisp and fresh. My girlfriend had the lobster bisque which she loved. Our steaks came out after we finished our staters and our wonderful bread loaf. \n\nI must say the steak was cooked exactly how I wanted it and I ate every bit of that monster!

Oh boy. The ambiance is more like a Wendy's that tries to be upscale: cramped, busy, somewhat noisy. Of the two filet mignons we had (different sizes, medium rare) one was horribly overcooked, the other one a little on the rare side. The meat wasn't special. The deserts were OK but the Creme Brulee was bland in the extreme. Service was OK but occasionally inattentive. For two adults, one child, a check of $150 would have been reasonable for the quality provided. It ended up being $350 or so. Oh well - I rounded up the check to $400 and left with the intention of never coming back again. Imagine my shock when I found that my credit card had been charged with $600! I'm sure this will turn out to be an innocent mistake, but if this restaurant thinks it provides an experience worth $200 per head, they need to call Chef Ramsey.", "business_id": "90Fqfzd8zD9AuuNBSv9lAg", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-06-18", "type": "review"}

Their portions are certainly in-line with the price.\n\nTheir Lobster-bisque is basically heaven in a bowl.  Don't miss it!  And the Balsamic reduction on their asparagus was amazingly flavorful and clearly a true reduction and not one of those lousy corn-starch reductions most restaurants are using now.\n\nOn my way out I slipped (due to my own inability to walk!) and fell, and the response from the staff was very caring and immediate.

The food is rarely a let down.  The steaks have been perfect, the potatoes delicious, and the desserts to die for.  However, the service, or rather the servers, leave a lot to be desired.  To put it bluntly, we have consistently better servers at Applebee's and Outback.  The men who have waited on us at the Pittsburgh Morton's act as if they hate being there.  We often feel like we're prodding them for information because they do not speak to us unless they absolutely have to.  Our most recent visit was three nights ago and we had the worst service to date.  The server was lazy, far too laid back, and truly should not have been working in such an expensive establishment.  We asked him questions about the special (he denied there being one and there was), about a chicken dish (his response to how the Chicken Christopher was prepared - \"It's, like, well, ya know, just regular fried chicken\"....he could not have made it sound less appealing and it's most definitely nothing like regular fried chicken), about the way a dessert is served (he told me the fruit crisp was absolutely berries, but once ordered what was served was apples), and he was obviously put out by such questions.

Salads were ok, probably my favorite part of the meal actually. The steak I ordered medium due to being pregnant but it was rare, he got his medium as well and was actually done medium. My baked potato side was pretty good, it's hard to mess up microwaving a potato. His side of Mac and cheese was laughable. We were warned numerous times how hot the bowl was it came in but the actual dish was cold, cheese was hard, boxed Mac and cheese would have been so much better. The desserts I can't really say anything about I'm not much of a sweets person.\n\nStaff was pretty attentive, you literally take one sip of water and they refill it. I guess I should complain about the service but it ruined the meal having them step in between us 20-30 times.

It doesn't have a grand entrance and looks kinda like a normal hole-in-the-wall restaurant since you have to go through a couple doors to get to the actual restaurant. \n\nPros: The food, service, and ambience is great. We ordered so much food and had a bunch of leftovers. I, personally, ordered the cajun ribeye and it was cooked perfectly medium rare and FULL of flavor. We also got many sides, such as truffle fries, hashbrowns, mac and cheese, mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts. The truffle fries were yummy, but the hashbrowns were soaked in oil. I did like the mac and cheese though! I didn't get to try the mashed potatoes or brussel sprouts. We got the hot chocolate cake and the lemon souffle for dessert. The hot chocolate cake was delicious. It comes with raspberries on top, caramel drizzle, and a scoop of ice cream on the side. Definitely WORTH. The souffle was light and fluffy! A big contrast to the chocolate cake. Oh yeah, and the bread they give you to start is AMAZING. It's crispy on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside. That stuff is soo good. \n\nCons: It was noisier than expected; since it's a classy place you'd expect there to be soft jazz and people having intimate, quiet conversations. However, it was quite loud. And of course, the prices are very, very steep, but that's expected of a steakhouse. \n\nOverall: This is a great place to celebrate a special occasion if you're willing to splurge! The food is so great and flavorful. Overall, my experience at Morton's was awesome, and I will be back.", "business_id": "90Fqfzd8zD9AuuNBSv9lAg", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-07-22", "type": "review"}

From start to finish, my meal of Monday, 3 August, was fabulous.  My dining companion is a regular here.  I am not, but the young lady host/manager, who had never seen me before, greeted me with warmth and enthusiasm.  She later came to our table to perform a quality check and later bid us a friendly good night.  The restaurant is attractive and comfortable and the tables spaced nicely.  I was disappointed to find no draft beers, but there is a spectacular selection of bottled beers and spirits.  We began our dinner at the bar where a genteel and gracious bartender prepared perfect martinis for us.  Our service from Tammie was attentive, warm, and gracious.  She made us feel welcome.  A large, warm onion bread with artistically-presented whipped butter begins the meal.  There is currently a $40 special which is a bargain for a restaurant of this stature, and that it what I ordered.  The diner must ask for the $40 menu and our server was initially not certain that the promotion had begun.  Included is choice of salad, entree, side dish, and dessert.  I had a caesar salad, 6 ounce filet mignon (the only steak on the value menu), mashed potatoes, and individual souffle.  The caesar salad was the best I have ever had, which is saying something, the steak delicious, but not hot.  I thought that the scrumptious mashed potatoes would be a single serving, but there was enough on this plate to serve three or four people with normal appetites! The individual souffle was the perfect ending to a great meal.  Water was refilled regularly.  We also ordered a side dish of grilled asparagus, served with a great dark sauce, quite pricey at $13 for an ample portion for two.

He definitely went with the better option. The pork was flavorful and delicious. The filet was undercooked, I ordered it medium and it was medium rare. Good flavor, but honestly not better than any filet I've prepared at home. \n\nThe sides left much to be desired. I ordered steamed broccoli and he ordered mashed potatoes. We had to send the potatoes back because they were cold. The broccoli and the potatoes were very bland not much flavor at all, and there was certainly a lack of presentation. \n\nFor dessert, I had the chocolate mousse and he had the key lime pie.

We enjoyed similar selections from their Restaurant Week menu which included the Ahi Tuna Tower, 6 oz. filet, Key Lime Pie and Creme Brulee (I had the Pie). We started the meal with a couple of cool cocktails and warm, fresh-baked onion bread - both delicious.  The Ahi Tuna tower was a solid \"good,\" though I'd probably try one of their signature salads instead the next time.  Dessert was also very good, but the star of the meal was the Filet. This filet. I don't even know what to say. I moaned...too much during this meal.  But it was SOOOOOOO good. I'll go ahead and say it - it was the best damn piece of meat I've ever enjoyed. Done perfectly medium rare, it's something I'll be thinking about for weeks to come, I'm sure.  Though Restaurant Week is officially over, Morton's has a \"Summer Tasting\" menu which offers the same choices for $40.

After eating several different meals at Tessaro's I can say with no doubt that my favorite thing there is the \"Bacon-Bleu\" burger with crumbled blue cheese (rather than creamy because they give you the opion). The bacon is amazing, the blue cheese melts to the bun within a coulple of minutes and the burger mean is so fresh that you can distinctly taste its freshness.\n\nThe ambiance of the place is really nice too. It is an older place which has kept that old Bloomfield feel still to this day. Everyone is extremely nice there. The owner is usually there at the door to greet you and is always willing to have a nice conversation with you in the time when she is not flying around trying to get people in their seats. \n\nThe only downfall with Tessaro's and this is not their fault is that they are alway's almost too busy. Because this place way a neighborhood bar at one point it doesn't exactly have a lobby for you to wait in while you wait to be seated so that part of your dinner may be a bit uncofortable but all in all Tessaro's will be a great experience, espescially for those who are a fan of the old fashion hamburger and beer.", "business_id": "vgXE1I7c9ElcfYyZfQiN1Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-07-11", "type": "review"}

What you find instead is a decent, run of the mill, average burger. The meat is pretty good and certainly juicy but rather lacking in seasoning and the toppings don't do much for the overall experience. I've had burgers that are 4 or 5 star burgers, just not here.\n\nI was famished the last time I ate at Tessaro's and so was my husband. I'd just spent the entire day at Shadyside Hospital having a minor procedure and hadn't been able to eat since the night before. We didn't get to Tessaro's until 3pm and both of us would have literally eaten anything at that point. While I spent the day waiting, I'd read one of those infamous Best Burger in the Burgh lists online and had been daydreaming about a big juicy burger literally for hours & Tessaro's was right down the street.\n\nThe bacon bleu cheese burger was on special that day so we both jumped. Peculiar that they offer the bleu cheese wet or dry. Guessing the wet is bleu cheese dressing and I like my bleu cheese straight up, so easy decision. Side of coleslaw for me, fries for hubby. \n\nWe both remarked that we expected it to taste better than it did. The bleu cheese had no flavor, the bacon was barely noticeable and I had to add ketchup to it to get anything going on. At one point, I even put coleslaw on it to try and wake it up. \n\nAs mentioned, the meat itself was good but I'm sorry even the best burger needs seasoning and flavorful toppings. If the bacon and bleu cheese had been 1st rate, this would have been a completely different rating and experience.", "business_id": "vgXE1I7c9ElcfYyZfQiN1Q", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-06-26", "type": "review"}

We couldn't decide where to eat last night and finally decided to drive over to Bloomfield & stop in.\n\nThe building itself is old-school looking. I feel like i took a step back in time. We were originally seated upstairs near the patio and asked the hostess to actually eat on the patio last minute. It was cloudy and chilly but it was still great to sit outside.\n\nI couldn't decide between the Barbeque Burger (& add bacon) or the Breakfast Burger. I ultimately decided on the breakfast one with home fries. I couldn't decide between those or their infamous potato salad. Our server mentioned i could do half & half, but i love home fries Bobby went with the Gourmet Steak Sandwich and went with the potato salad as a side (score) He also enjoyed a Hoegaarden while we waited. We were completely satisfied with our meal. It had to be the largest burger i've ever had. I took a picture of it as plated but should have assembled my burger for a pic to show the true size.

My wife and I went on a Thursday night. The place was less than half full, yet the hostess had us wait between 5-10 minutes for them to clean a table before seating us. Seems kind of asinine when there are plenty of empty seats throughout the restaurant. I understand that due to staffing they may have wanted to sit us in a particular server's section, but I believe customer service is all about perception. Our waitress did not seem very enthusiastic.\n\nThe food was a mixed bag. My wife enjoyed her LongHorn Salmon, but my Renegade Top Sirloin was ruined by being served completely drenched in oil. I've eaten at Longhorn in Maine a couple of times, and don't remember their steaks being served this way. If this is normal here, then I much prefer the steaks at Texas Roadhouse for this price range. My lobster tail was good, and not overcooked. For dessert, my wife and I shared a Caramel Apple Goldrush. This was most excellent, and almost warranted an extra star.\n\nThe main reason for the one star is what happened after our visit. I had left a $10 cash tip, and filled out the credit card slip to reflect this. A few days later, when the charge showed up on my credit card statement, I found that an additional $10 had been added. I immediately went back to the restaurant and spoke very cordially with a manager, showing him the receipt for my visit and my credit card statement. Everyone makes mistakes, but it's how a business handles a customer after a mistake is made that sets the tone for future business. The first thing he did, after researching the error in the back, is offer a $10 coupon. That is not acceptable to me, because to take advantage of this, I'd have to eat here again. He asked me what he should do (isn't HE the manager?), and I suggested that he credit the overcharge back to my card, or void/refund the full amount, and recharge it. I was told that I'd have to fill out a form that would have to be faxed to corporate, then I'd have to wait an unknown number of days to see the amount credited back to my card. I understand that there may be corporate policies that he has to follow, but there seemed to be very little compassion or empathy on his part. He should have still offered the coupon or maybe a comp'd entr\u00e9e for the trouble of driving all the way back to the store because of a pretty significant error one of their employees made. No such luck. I would not have necessarily accepted the offer, but the gesture would definitely be appreciated and goes a long way towards a customers' perceptions about how important they are to a business. I do have a background in customer service management, and this would have never flown under my watch.\n\nMy wife and I have never been disappointed at Texas Roadhouse in Matthews, where the staff has always been enthusiastic and the food is exactly what we expect at this style of restaurant. I guess we'll stick with that when we're in the mood for a slab of beef and all the fixin's.", "business_id": "AUDuCSWYzzRP3H2w7TxtuQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-06-23", "type": "review"}

I realize that the bar bite dish consisted of 3 small pieces of filet - but if it is a challenge to cook medium rare on that particular dish they should have said so when I made the request. I have issues with steakhouse not coming close to the temperature I requested, worse when they didn't even bother to pretend they cared. Good thing it was $8.\n\nOverall the food was ok - the filet trio came with 3 different sauces and the blue cheese butter was the clear winner. The crab cake BLT was good as well.

We waited for about 40 minutes for a table, and when we were finally \"seated\", we had to stand at a high top table because they had run out of chairs. The waiter was obviously busy and when he came over to get our drink order, we went ahead and gave him a standard order of 20 sandwiches for the table. He brought us our drinks and then left us to converse. Then we waited for our food.\n\n20 minutes\n\n40 minutes\n\nAN HOUR.\n\nWe started noticing that other patrons were receiving their food when they had sat down well after us. One of the guys at our table tracked down the manager because... oh yeah... we hadn't seen our server since we sat down. If anything we wanted another round of beers.\n\nThen the manager came over and gave us some less than thrilling news. The waiter NEVER PUT OUR ORDER IN. He simply forgot, and we had to listen to the manager ramble on incessantly about how crowded and busy they were and this should somehow make us understand. \n\nSide note: had the waiter written the order down, he wouldn't have forgotten! This is doubly important when the manager was falling over himself in a hungover stupor, pleading with us to see from their perspective that it's all okay because of how busy they were. \n\nOur food was rushed out and when we called for our checks, we expected the sandwiches to be taken off the bill (I mean it was $20 for 4 grown men) and he only took off 50%. That saved us each a whopping $2.50. Gee thanks grandma!\n\nThen the cherry on top was that the server (or was the manager handling our table now?) didn't come collect our credit cards, so we had to walk the bill up to the bar so we could get out of that godforsaken place.\n\nFinal note: This was the first occasion I have ever left zero tip for service at a restaurant, but it simply was that bad. I will never go back, and we are telling all of our friends about our horrible experience.\n\nHey Morton's! 1) Write down orders so you don't forget. 2) Don't complain to the customers about how busy your restaurant is when you are providing a deal that is going to fill your bar area to capacity!

It looked like there were enough \"suits\" in the place to write a check to clear the federal deficit, but I liked that. The decor had an old world feel blended with a wall street vigor. The hostess was gracious and we were seated immediately and noticed the restaurant was quite busy for a Wednesday night. \n\nAlissa explained the chef features for the night and we agreed to try it. We received complimentary champagne and I ordered the smoked salmon as an appetizer. It was a good portion and was served with aioli, capers, chopped onions, and crisp pita triangles. I enjoyed it immensely as smoked salmon is one of my favorites. The hubs ordered a salad, and we ordered the lobster mac-n-cheese and truffle fries for our son, the Gabe-meister (I kept theifing the lobster out of the mac-n-cheese it was soooo good) and the truffle fries were amazing, it had this parmasen flavor to it. I do not eat red meat regularly but wanted to try the feature 4 oz filet medallion at medium with a fennel based sauce. The hubs opted for the 12 oz. filet mignon at medium rare with crab (out of the shell) in butter sauce. Needless to say we enjoyed the meal and left completely satisfied and impressed with Capital Grille. The food was great but it was the service that really impressed, two managers came by and wished me a happy birthday and checked on us to see if everything was ok.

This made a ridiculously expensive restaurant cost about as much as it would cost us on an average night out. We skipped drinks and dessert (we were really too full of other stuff anyway!) and our bill still came to $114 before tip. I was surprised that the dress code was so casual for such a nice place; my husband and I dressed up (hey, it's not every day that we eat so fancy!) but we saw folks there in shorts and flip flops, too.\n\nWe started with the delicious bread, and calamari. The calamari was spicy, and it would have been better with some sort of dipping sauce, but I guess that isn't classy enough for the Capital Grille! I just squeezed lemon juice all over my plate and it was delicious.\n\nI ordered the citrus-glazed salmon for my entree, with a spinach salad and warm bacon dressing on the side. The salmon was a very generous portion that was very well done. I'm very picky when it comes to salmon and I found this to be fresh and delicious. The salmon also came resting on a generous bed of asparagus, onions, etc. which was an unexpected surprise as we'd been told that all sides were a la carte. I definitely could have skipped the spinach salad, just because I already had so much food and we were staying in a hotel without a mini fridge. But the salad itself was delicious- more of a dinner portion than a side, actually.\n\nMy husband ordered the steak and lobster. At $49 it was one of the more expensive entrees on the menu, yet is was a LOT smaller than my salmon (which was $33). He was disappointed at the size for that price, actually. But it still managed to be large enough that he couldn't finish it, with the bread and calamari he'd already eaten. The steak and lobster were both delicious, though.\n\nThe service was impeccable.

Your dining room is very nice and your staff so very polite and accommodating as saints.\n\nI'll echo what Adam R. said and say that steakhouses are not usually my dining preference when choosing a place to eat at but I had really enjoyed the good eats at the Capital Grille Generous Pour event recently I decided to give it a shot. Warmly greeted at the door and reservations confirmed even though we had arrived a bit earlier than expected, their hospitality is as good as ever. The problem is I didn't exactly enjoy my meal as much as I would have hoped even though I still had a good time surrounded by friends and family.\n\nAppetizers came out in a very timely manner once menu choices were made. I chose clam chowder based on a recommendation. Well it wasn't amazing but it wasn't bad either, a well made clam chowder is one of my favorite things to eat so this was a bit of a let down. My entree a Kona crusted dry aged sirloin was perfectly cooked and served with a nice composite shallot butter how old school! The only problem is that they didn't cook all the steaks as well as mine. One person had ordered a medium steak and it came out well done and extremely charred (It was comped when she mentioned it and the waiter and manager were very sorry and concerned about this so I'll have to thumbs up them for handling a situation so graciously). The shallot butter though didn't really add anything to the dish for me and the steak wasn't so flavorful that it could stand on it's own. The best part of the meal? Dessert! But not my dessert, I was talked up on the ice cream and decided to order it instead of creme brulee. Well that was a major mistake on my part. My whole meal had been heavy and if I had went with sorbet I might have been able to finish it, but I decided on ice cream. Peanut butter, chocolate, and vanilla ice cream was just too much to handle for me and I called it quits after a spoonful of each. The creme brulee was still as addictive as ever from what I tried on someone's plate though!\n\nI would go back here just for the service alone. It's really nice to be treated like they really care about your visit.

Now that I am in Charlotte, I was able to try out another Capital Grille location and enjoyed a lovely lunch with my mom in uptown Charlotte. This outpost of The Capital Grille was bustling before noon on a Monday. Many business meetings and lunches are held here and the obviously enthusiastic staff kept things running smoothly and truly went above and beyond even with a close to full a house. At lunch parking is validated for the lot behind the Dunhill Hotel, making it a reasonable $2.\n\nThe Plates menu features choice of a soup or salad, an entree and a side dish for a set price of $18 at the Charlotte location. For the summer menu, a new entree of seared scallops with sweet and sour tomatoes is available. I love how the scallops are served with a grilled lemon wedge for a citrus taste that goes perfectly with the beautifully presented and cooked shellfish - delicious. The other new additions to the menu include a carrot ginger soup (hot) which I also really liked (the tasty classic New England clam chowder is still available as well) and a tomato and watermelon salad with feta cheese - a refreshing option for a side dish. The Wagyu beef burger with fried egg and crispy onions is back on the menu following multiple requests after it was featured last summer and then removed. My mom ordered this and LOVED it - and she is not usually a fan of burgers at all. The truffle fries go great with the burger, which is really a treat.", "business_id": "CChwRoYVXA3QZulS8a6xOQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-07-30", "type": "review"}

Reposting here...\n\nEvery once in a while, you have an experience at a restaurant that's so lovely, you know you'll remember it for years. The meal we ate at the Capital Grille this week doubtlessly falls into this category.\n\nI know that Capital Grille is a chain, and an expensive chain as well. I'm not usually super excited about corporate steakhouses (Ruth's Chris: meh), and I usually wouldn't have chosen one for a Restaurant Week outing. However, Capital Grille treated us so well during the Yelp Generous Pour event, we decided to return. I'm glad we did: the food and the service were both amazing.\n\nI'll talk about the food first. Their Restaurant Week menu is not very varied: they offer three steak entrees and one salmon dish. However, I don't see that as a downside, since if you're looking for something lighter and/or vegetarian, you're not going to go to a steakhouse, anyways. For my entree, I ordered the Kona-encrusted sirloin with shallot butter.. oh my. This was a good steak, folks: tremendous flavor and perfectly cooked. I've learned that this steak is on their regular menu as well. This could be bad for my credit card. The appetizer of clam chowder was good, if not exceptional. My dessert of creme brulee was delicious. Nevertheless, it was all overshadowed by that steak.\n\nOk, now let's talk about the service. Yes, my steak was amazing, but you can get an amazing steak at other venues. What really set this night apart was the level of service we received. Even though it was Restaurant week, and even though we had nibbled and sipped for free the weekend before, we were treated as well as they could have treated any bank executive or local politician. Our waiter, James, was unobtrusively attentive and poured us multiple glasses of wine on the house. The manager checked in on us and shook our hands on the way out. I've never been treated better in a restaurant, especially when eating a meal at such a considerable discount.\n\nIn case you can't tell from the above, we really had a fantastic evening. I suspect that we'll be back the next time we have an excuse to splurge.", "business_id": "CChwRoYVXA3QZulS8a6xOQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-08-01", "type": "review"}

It's rare I feel like I've been \"wowed\" when I go out, but The Captial Grille had that effect and they did so in a way that seemed effortless and second-nature.\n\nWe were lured in after the recent Elite event (and actually made our dinner reservations within an hour of the event). The ambiance is exquisite without being extravagant, with many formal-looking portraits, iron, and a wealth of masculine darkly-stained wood.\n\nThe kitchen was spot-on during our visit - not a single thing came to the table that wasn't outstanding. We both started with the bacon clam chowder - smokey and rich. My entree was the filet Mignon, a timeless classic (and a personal favorite). I ordered mine medium rare: my first experience in Charlotte where my steak was brought to me a true medium rare. It's a tender cut that the chefs worked wonders with. A had the dry-aged Kona crusted sirloin - his was equally amazing with explosive flavors. Dessert brought chocolate espresso flour-less cake. Exceptionally rich and decadent - the perfect end to the meal.\n\nAs an experienced oenophile, I am in heaven at The Capital Grille. The wine selection has no comparison in the area - many, many phenomenal producers represented from around the globe, a survey of the best-of-the-best in wine. We mentioned we had attended for the summer Generous Pour event earlier and paid for it again tonight. This time, though, the server turned it into a guessing game: we'd order one, he'd bring two, seeing if we could identify the mystery wine from the list he recommended with our food. \n\nSpeaking of the service, TCG is in a league of their own in the area. The staff, who had or reservation, greeted us by name at the door and at our table. The manager recognized us from the week before and made it a point to stop by and welcome us and to wish us well at the end of the evening. Down to the very smallest detail of folding your napkin if you need to leave the table during your meal, this team embodies every stellar trait of the service industry.\n\nWhile The Captial Grille is not in the budget for a regular meal (yet), they are now my first choice for a venue to celebrate and to show off everything Charlotte has to offer.", "business_id": "CChwRoYVXA3QZulS8a6xOQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-08-08", "type": "review"}

I thought is would be a very nice meal and someplace I had not taken them before.  Eating in the best restaurants in town and when we travel is not unusual.  The food was very hit-and-miss and so was the service.  \n\nLet's start with the food.  We ordered two appetizers for the table that were not part of restaurant week.  The Calamari and the Mozzarella wrapped cheese.  The calamari was excellent and cooked perfectly.  The Mozzarella was good but not the tastiest or smoothest mozzarella I have eaten.  Both were worthy.  For the first course, my oldest son had the clam chowder which he enjoyed.  The rest of us ordered the mixed field greens salad which was awful.  I have had a better side salad at Wendy's.  It was totally tasteless and un-inspired.  None of us even finished half the portion.  When the waiters helper asked if we were done, we told him to please take them away and how horrible they were.  The three men had the filet for our main course.  It was a very middle of the road filet.  I am not sure if they lowered their quality for restaurant week but it tasted no better than an Outback Steak.  Even my 15 year old recognized the poor quality of meat.  My wife had the Salmon which was better than the filet but nothing exciting.  She only ate half the portion and it was not worth packing up to take home.  The mashed potato side was amazing and the creamed spinach side was average.  The creme brulee and flourless chocolate cake for desert were both amazing.  I would recommend just hitting the bar for these late night after a show.  \n\nThe service was also only marginal.  A big let down compared to the service received at lunch.  The waiter reached across the table versus walking around, and he plated the food close but not just right so you had to re-arrange the positioning of every dish before eating it.  The atmosphere is beautiful.  I would return for a business lunch but don't waste your time or money on dinner or taking someone you want to impress.", "business_id": "CChwRoYVXA3QZulS8a6xOQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-07-29", "type": "review"}

Bone-In Kona Crusted Dry Aged Sirloin - with shallot butter, which was far more steak then I'd normally ever have in one sitting but wow! It was so good I couldn't even leave a bite left on my plate. Cooked to perfection the meat with sharper taste of the shallot butter just melted in my mouth. It cames with the Sam's Mashed Potatoes & Fresh Creamed Spinach.  The potatoes were really tasty but the spinach I could've done without. This is easily enough food for two!\n\nOrdered a Stoli Doli to go with my meal. It's the signature drink at Capital Grille and definitely worth having more than once. \n\nAnd the Flourless Chocolate Espresso Cake! Oh the cake...

For the price I felt the food could have been better.  For starters we ordered mozzarella and tomato salad and the Caesar.  The salads were both chilled, crisp, and the vinegar and spice balance for the mozzarella was very good.\nFor the entrees we got the salmon and the special bleu cheese encrusted fillet with grilled shrimp.  The salmon was cooked perfectly, but lacking on seasoning.  Where they were short on flavor on the salmon they made up for on the shrimp.  They definitely weren't shy with the seasoning which left something to be desired for the surf of the turf.  The steak was cooked to perfection and was extremely tender.  The waiter had sold the bleu cheese as a cream base infused with pepper and garlic.  Unfortunately it was just a few morsels of blue cheese pressed into the top of the meat.

I dine there during Queen's Feast Restaurant Week yesterday. i was very excited because i only heard good things about the place . To Start the evening off there weren't any seat left inside the restaurant so we were escorted to a dining room outside the lobby. There were so many terrible things that occur that evening where do i begin. First the ceasar salad was the worst salad i have ever had it taste like a 2 day old bag salad you get at your local grocery store. it wasn't fresh, i was missing courton in mine. Next it time for the entree.  2 of my  guest ask for a med-rare skin their  steak came   super well done . so dry i didn't know if i was filet mignon or A cheap dry roast beef.  She returned her and it came back out much better . I had the chicken breast that  once i got to the bone it blood and under cook.  and to finish the even off they were out of the cheesecake, and some of the guest  got the flourless coco cake which had molded rasphberry on her plate. yikes . it almost went in her mouth. I would have expect better quality of food for a 4 star restaurant.  She got her meal for free due to all the mistakes. but i didn't get antything for my bloody chicken. I will never go here again. :-(", "business_id": "CChwRoYVXA3QZulS8a6xOQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-07-29", "type": "review"}

I've never been to Capital Grille so I was excited to try it out.  I have only heard good things so I can't say that I wasn't a little disappointed with a few things...\n\nI thought it would be safe to try a place like CG for Restaurant week because it is truly a chance to get more bang for your buck.  However, I am pretty sure everything switched once we said we were there for Queens Feast.  The server had been so polite and accomidating up until the point of our decision to order from the Queen's Feast.  After that moment I don't think we saw him the rest of the night, not even to bring us our food.  Seriously!  You may think I am kidding but I'm not!\n\nHe brought us bread with literally only 2 small rolls in the basket.  We had bread envy because we could see all the other tables with with bountiful bread baskets!  We figured it was because there was only two of us but the other tables only had two people as well but they had way more!  Well, we ended up asking for more bread and he never brought it.  We asked the other gentleman that was supposed to be assisting with our table as well and he brought it about 15 minutes later.  \n\nOur glasses of water were empty the majority of our time there.\nWe both ordered Filet Mignon which was very tasty.  It was warm, not hot when it came out but still very tender and nicely flavored.  We both ordered it medium rare and it was cooked perfectly.  Two sides came with our meal and I think they were supposed to be family style but they were really what you would see if they were served on an individual plate.  The mashed potatoes were sticky/gummy and lukewarm.  They were served in the smallest family style portion I have ever seen.  Unless it was a small family of ants, I would say we got screwed on the potatoes.  The string beans were cold and hard (undercooked) and inedible.  Didn't touch them.\n\nThe desserts were decent.  The flourless chocolate cake was so rich it was unbearable.  It was the dark bitter chocolate flavor that just wasn't very good.  The small bite of cheesecake was good though.  Just....small.\n\nOverall, I would say this experience was subpar, especially for the reputation of the restaurant.  Why does service and quality AND quantity have to suffer because it is restaurant week?  They did all seem overly busy so I understand that everything isn't going to be perfect but we didn't even see our waiter the rest of the evening until he flung our check at us.  I guess I would say it was just overall disappointing.  The steak saved the day.  That was some darn good steak.\n\nNot in a hurry to come back....other competitors have won my heart.", "business_id": "CChwRoYVXA3QZulS8a6xOQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-07-31", "type": "review"}

We chose to go out to eat here as we had only heard great things about Capital Grille. We will never return to this establishment for a meal again. \n\nOur waiter was very nice and the decor of the restaurant is beautiful as well. For starters I got the mozzarella basil tomato salad. It was pretty good so no complaints there. I chose the special of the night for my entree which was three small steaks prepared in three signature ways. I loved two of them the balsamic one was pretty bad but not inedible. Our water glasses were left empty several times which I thought was weird considering how much a meal like this costs. My husband ordered the porterhouse and he asked for it to be medium. Well it was bordering on the side of well-done and I tasted his and didn't like it at all. He thought it was very dry and it wasn't hot it seemed as though it had been sitting around before they brought it out to us. Honestly the steaks he grills from Teeter have more flavor than this dish. This was obviously very disappointing but we just thought ok not worth the money but we would possibly return for the specialty dishes at a future date. \n\nThe main reason I am giving a one star review is because I woke up in the middle of the night with awful stomach pains and have been sick for the past 10 hours. My husband was nauseas but not as sick as me.  We didn't sleep practically at all last night and because of this i would never ever return here. I would recommend grilling steaks on your own grill and not wasting a ton of money to get an underwhelming sickening experience.", "business_id": "CChwRoYVXA3QZulS8a6xOQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-08-03", "type": "review"}

All the wines are on a tablet, which was really neat cause you could easily scroll through the bottles and filter. We ended up settling on a Zin/Shiraz blend. It was absolutely delish....I wish I got the name of it!\n\nSince we were dining for restaurant week ($35 per person), the menu was limited. However, I would love to return cause I heard their lobster mac was fantastic! I decided on the clam chowder, 8oz filet mignon, and chocolate flourless espresso cake. My husband picked the wedge salad, ribeye (i think it was crazy big like 14 oz) and chocolate flourless cake. \n\nUnfortunately, the clam chowder wasn't anything special. I have a huge love for chowders and this one simply didnt do anythign for me. I took a bite of my husbands salad and it was very good. Our steaks came out next. They were cooked absolutely perfectly! The filet mignon literally melted in my mouth. My husbands steak was seasoned so well. This is definitely where Capital Grille shined! The shared potatoes that came with it were perfect. Additionally, the meal came with shared green beans. I thought the green beans weren't cooked enough, but that is just a personal preference. The taste was excellent though. Lastly, the desserts. Oh my gosh, rasberries, cream, and the fudge like cake. Perfection. That dessert was spot on!\n\nThere was one small incident that I wasn't super thrilled with how it was handled. The waiter brought over our steaks and sides. In the few seconds it took me to grab my fork and knife and almost cut into my steak, my husband (and at the same time, the waiter) realized he brought over the wrong steaks. Like, our entire order was for a different table. Literally, not a big deal at all. Misstakes happen. However, without even an apology he grabbed all the plates, including the veggie sides (that come with all restaurant week meals!) and cleared our table. It was just awkward cause he made something that wasnt a big deal into a scene. Our neighbors sitting beside us literally leaned over and said they couldnt believe he did that and took the sides off the table too. Additionally, I would never complain about this, but the new steak I got was definitely not as nice looking or as large of a cut (not that it completely mattered cause I didnt even eat all my steak anyways) as the one that was accidentally served to me.

The two story high ceilings made the space soar, but the cozy dark booths lined up one after the other made it intimate too.

I'm always a bit surprised that I like it so much, and I shy away from chain restaurants, their food is always so sub-par, but the Palm constantly delivers a meal that makes my heart all aflutter. \n\nI had a chicken Cesar salad, the lamb chops and we all split sides. I do have to give this location a shout out because their mashed potatoes were SO GOOD. I mean perfectly prepared. I was excited about this because it's the only complaint that I have with Palm One in NYC - terrible mashed.

I ordered a wedge salad with bleu cheese and Bacon (delish) after toying with the idea of lobster bisque. Although I intended to eat steak, the seafood options on the menu looked amazing.

Everyone was very happy with all they ate.  Detail wise, I'll stick to just my meal for this review.  Took advantage of one of the summer specials and went with the Filet and Lobster tail.  This also came with a choice of a starter and a side and yes, of course I super-sized the steak and tail once I found out I could!\n\nFor the starter I had the lobster bisque which was poured table side.  It was hot, creamy and delicious although it did require the addition of a tad bit of salt at the table.  The steak came cooked to a perfect medium-rare with a great crust on it and the lobster tail was as big as my head and very moist and flavorful.  Had the three cheese potatoes au gratin for the side.  It was cheesy and good though it also benefited from a wee bit of table-side salt.\n\nService was once again friendly and impeccable and they are very accommodating to various special requests.\n\nCan't wait to go back next time!", "business_id": "1gKBusJMk66ypwEKF0vOAA", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-08-08", "type": "review"}

The crispy potato chips was a great edible garnish. \nI also ordered a mojito from their classic cocktails menu.  Unfortunately that was not good.

Their pricing was average for a steakhouse but a little bit high for the environment and service. \n\nTip: the last reservation/seating they take is 8 pm.

Palm is the kind of place where that deal is worth it. The service was fine, although our server was a bit of the anxious type. I started with the mixed green salad, which was completely unmemorable. I say this because I literally had to go to the restaurant's website to figure out what the heck I ate for the first course. Apparently the mixed green salad. I vaguely remember the baby tomatoes.\n\nHowever, we also had some sides as appetizers, which were truly phenomenal. The green beens were all oiled up with chunks of bacon in them. Wow. And the mashed potatoes were garlicky and very delicious.\n\nFor my second course, I had filet mignon medallions, which were also very good. I ordered them medium rare, and although the meat didn't quite \"melt\" with my knife like I wanted it to (perhaps due to the smaller size of the medallions), they were still quite tasty.\n\nApparently the Palm is known for its cheesecake, and I ordered that for dessert. Quite frankly, I'm used to every steak house having some sort of cheesecake, and they are all more or less good. But no. The Palm's cheesecake truly takes the cheesecake. It's HUGE and LOADED with sugar and a bunch of sweet fruit sauces are DUMPED ALL OVER IT. It was the best cheesecake I've eaten in years, possibly ever. I can't say for sure it was the best every, since clearly my memory is suspect, due to the fact that my memory of that mixed greens salad remains a little hazy...\n\nEverything was washed down with two \"Strawberry Fields\" a sweet rum drink.

I went for Summer Queen's Feast and I highly recommend it.\n\nMy plan all along was to have an All-American steak house meal. I started with the Caesar salad, which is not something I normally order, but I was pleased with the result. The romaine was crisp and sturdy, which showed that The Palm was not skimping on freshness or flavor just because it was restaurant week. There was a generous amount of cheese and croutons, which I am a huge fan of, and the Caesar dressing was creamy and slightly acidic and didn't drown my lettuce.\n\nFor my main I went with the obvious choice and ordered the twin tenderloin filet medallions. My steak hit the spot; it was perfectly rare in the middle, and had shallot butter generously melted on top (with some crispy onions as well). I love it when chefs have an in depth knowledge of meat temperatures (just talking about it is getting me excited) and whoever cooked my steak at The Palm definitely knew what they were doing. \n\nThe one downside about the restaurant week menu was that it did not include a side dish with our main courses; but for only $3 a person, we ordered a family style side of Brussels sprouts, which were almost as amazing as my steak. The Brussels sprouts were bathed in a delicious lemon brown butter; and the tanginess of the lemon, coupled with richness of the brown butter, perfectly offset the Brussels sprouts natural funkiness (or should we say bitterness? Sour taste?). I would eat those over and over again.\n\nTo complete my three course meal, I ended with the classic New York cheesecake (but stole a taste of my friend's Key Lime Pie, because I was having such a hard time deciding). The cheesecake was good; it was creamy, light (sometimes cheesecakes can turn dense), and not too sweet. But after a sort of heavy, on heavy, on heavy meal, I wasn't able to finish it all (it still made a great snack the next afternoon).\n\nRead the full review here: http://offtheeatenpathblog.com/2013/08/15/the-palm/", "business_id": "1gKBusJMk66ypwEKF0vOAA", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-08-25", "type": "review"}

Really?!?  I just laid out $200 and your idea of a wonderful close to the meal before dessert is to present me a brochure and encourage me to join a dinner club?  I could not have been more surprised and for a moment thought I was flying coach on US Airways on my way back from Cancun.  Imagine my greater surprise that I was pitched again AFTER dessert, too.  Yes, they did (and no, I'm not joining)!\n\nLastly, we made our reservations through Open Table, which was honored.  I made comments on their site that this was our 37th anniversary.

My son especially loves the \"Yum Yum\" sauce (the pink sauce) and has me convinced that he would eat \"anything\" if he could dip it in Yum Yum sauce!  \n\nWe opted for the $10.00 birthday package.

Speaking of entrees- the sizzle plates that come with grilled orders were dirty. Dried cheese and muck from another diner were stuck to these plates. We advised the manager. His response was, \"well, the plates are supposed to get washed- there are two piles in the back, one clean and one dirty....sorry, you did not get clean ones.\" And, that was it. He did not offer to take the meals off the bill, or anything else. He said, \"thanks for the feedback,\" then he left.\nThe food itself was eh. The spinach artichoke dip, which we would normally get, must be a new recipe. It was bad. We ordered two caesar salads, and she brought two house salads. Sure, she changed them- after we clicked that mechanism on the table that flashes, and then waiting another five minutes for her to reappear from some where and us vigorously flagging her down. The bread that came with an entree was like a brick- one bite was enough to determine that you could break your teeth on it. And the chicken that I ordered, had a funny taste.\nNeedless to say, if you want a decent meal with at least decent service, DO NOT come to this restaurant.", "business_id": "98hOHm56D0Boz2LCg0-irg", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-07-02", "type": "review"}

It is where boaters come to watch and to be seen. It is common to have quite a few beers while watching the boats try to aimlessly dock in a narrow slip with amateur boaters.  I will refer to this event as the bumper boats at T-Bones.\n\nI am perplexed at the statement that they take reservations, but they do not do call ahead seating.  Tonight, was only a 5 min wait, so I was able to entertain myself by watching two boaters trying to dock their boat.  (very cheap entertainment if you ask me)\n\nNow for the T-Bones review.\nI have been craving oysters lately, and prefer Oyster Rockefeller, but since this was not offered, I opted for the Angels on Horseback...it is bacon wrapped oysters deep fried on a bed of rice w/ a side of oriental sauce.  I give this a 1/5 stars,yes one star.  The bacon was burnt (black) and the rice was very dry and hard.  The sauce did not really help, but it did add flavor to a very bland dish.  Definitely not worth $9.99 ( I have added a picture) \n\nNow for for the Burgers / Chicken sandwiches.  The burger was very nice, juicy, the provolone cheese was properly melted and the bacon was cooked perfectly.  The Chicken Sandwich, which I requested plain, was very juicy, moist, and without any extra help, from condiments, lettuce etc, was very tasty and flavorful.  \n\nNow you may ask,how can bacon be burnt black and then be cooked perfectly at the same time.....remember that one was on my appetizer (burnt) and the other was on the hamburger.\n\nOur server was very friendly, prompt with the drink refills and attentive, all the way up until we were ready to leave......after she took our plates away, it was 5 minutes before she returned with the check.   She apologized, but by that time.....I was ready to go!\n\nHere's the breakdown of my rating:\n\nLocation: 4/5 Stars  \nIt is right on the water at Buster Boyd Bridge.\n\nAtmosphere: 3/5 Stars  \nNeeds to be updated somewhat. Original posters and calendars from the 80's, even a John Wayne poster clock in the hallway.\n\nService: 3/5  Just meh.\n\nParking 4/5  Has the boat landing area to also park in.\n\nBoat Parking: 4/5 Plenty of boat slips available\n\nFood: 3/5 Good, not great, a little pricey for the quality of the food.\n\nEntertainment 5/5\nWatching amateur boaters park near expensive boats = PRICELESS!\n\nJust remember what the fellow Yelpers Yelp, do not go here for the food, but just enjoy a few cold beers and enjoy the scenery.\n\nNCFoodGuy", "business_id": "Zc2IwSzGY63zkyhfNrr7HA", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-06-04", "type": "review"}

I went expecting rather a brunch - i.e.: breakfast AND lunch items - after all, they weren't even open until 11 and I'm not much of a breakfast food-type eater anyway. For the price they charged the following was served: fruit (nothing special- cantaloupe, strawberries and honeydew), your typical institutional scrambled eggs - rather plain, bacon, sausage links & patties, biscuits and gravy- thin gravy, short on any sausage mixed in, frenchtoast sticks - which were hard as rocks already and they had only been open 20 minutes! It took a while, and I do mean a WHILE for our server to even show up to begin with and she didn't come back to check on us very often.

We were looking for a place to get a good steak that was more of a homey, comfortable place rather than the upscale/glitz offered at a number of other steakhouses in the Madison area.  We were happy with our choice.  If you are looking for upscale/glitz or culinary innovation, this isn't the place for you.  The look is a little dated, but clean and well cared for.  I'm a little old fashioned I guess, when I go to a restaurant it is for the meal and not the \"experience.\"  \n\nBetween myself and my family over the three visits we had a number of entrees, including prime rib, filet mignon, broasted chicken, barbeque ribs and fettuccini alfredo.  My daughter reported the fettuccini as mediocre, but each of the other entrees was tasty, cooked to specifications and well portioned.  We tried most of the side dishes and the only one we would not order again was the rice.  We had several appetizers including cheese curds and onion rings; all were very good.  Fresh, warm bread was served (and more offered when it was finished) and the soup/salad bar, while not extensive, was very good.  Prices weren't cheap, but were reasonable for what we got.  Service was very good without the pretentiousness we've encountered at more upscale places.  \n\nNot the place for everyone, I'm sure, but we were very happy with it and I'm sure we will go again the next time we are in town.

We were told it would be about 20 minutes to seat our small group, and that was just fine. The bar was cozy, the beers fresh, and the service attentive, friendly, and helpful.\n\nSoon enough, our name was called and we were seated in one of the \"auxillary\" dining areas. Clearly an add-on, not a single decoration, but definitely welcomed; the place was packed and we were seated quickly, so it's all good by me.\n\nOur waitress took our orders and brought us a round of Whiskey Old Fashioned Sours. We gnoshed on the deliciously fresh rye bread, which was unlike any other rye I've had. It featured a very mild rye flavor and a very light texture. It was delicious.\n\nFish arrived within minutes: fried ocean perch and battered cod, one order of fries, and two orders of cheesy hashbrowns (cost an extra $2 per).\n\nThe fried ocean perch is all you can eat, and it's fresh, lightly breaded, flavorful, grease-free, and easily some of the best fish I've had at a fish fry. I scarfed down three heaping plates, and I do mean \"heaping.\" They're not skimpy with the refills.\n\nBattered cod was equally good, but it wasn't all you can eat. Three large, beautifully brown, battered and flaky filets are what you get.\n\nFries were outstanding as well; crinkle cut, fresh, hot, crispy. Yum. Hashbrowns were cooked perfectly but the slab of Velveeta that was slapped on top to make them \"cheesy\" was disappointing.\n\nService was the best yet. No complaints. Three fish dinners with coffees and a couple of rounds of drinks was $70 + tip...

We both order the same meal, steak and shrimp with broccoli. My girlfriend asked to substitute the broccoli with mushrooms and add grilled onions. I want to add more shrimp to my order. Our meals arrive, mine looked fine but hers had two orders of mashed potatoes,  mushrooms and onions.

She takes it out and it looks like a piece of toilet paper or some kind of white paper. (We had brown paper napkins only, not a single white napkin or paper on the table.) The bad part is, this was one of her last bites and didn't think of returning the food at that point. So, to not make scene we just inform our waiter about the piece of paper and advice him to let the cooks know to be more careful. He grabs our plates, grins and doesn't say a word....ok.

The conversation was in full swing about politics, which they tried to drag me into but I politely declined and said \"I don't discuss politics while trying to digest food.\"\n\nI ordered one of the specials which was a smoked hot link drenched in bbq sauce on a po-boy bun. It was served with coleslaw, but I ordered some Texaz fries with it. The hot link was dry and almost jerky-esque, possibly due to the smoking process, or maybe the links were just old. They were still tasty, and being a girl that is used to smoked meats around the house, I kind of enjoyed eating the semi-dry little discs. I tossed aside the top half of the po boy bun, and just ate the meat with the sauce soaked bottom half of the bun. The sauce was dark, with a smoky sweet flavor. The coleslaw was creamy and the cabbage was finely chopped. The Texaz potatos are chunks of seasoned, and fried potatos. I only ate about 3 or 4 before I was stuffed. \n\nAs is always the case with Texaz Grill, I wasn't overly delighted, but I wasn't overly disappointed.

The reviews on Yelp were good and I was told by a fellow steak lover that if I wanted a great (not the best) cut of steak at a reasonable price, then Texaz is the place to go.  I went on a Thursday evening and the place was pretty busy.  I was seated right away by a very friendly hostess.  You could tell from the looks of the place that it had been around a while.  I could have sworn my booth was going to fall apart, but it was ok.  The d\u00e9cor is a bit eccentric with anything and everything having to do with Texas all over the walls.  All the patrons seemed to be having a good time and enjoying their meals.  There were also plenty of wait staff bustling around.\n\nWhile everything on the menu sounded delicious (but NOT diet friendly), I opted for the filet.  Next time I am going to order the prime rib or the chicken friend steak because I hear those are excellent.  My salad came quickly and was very good.  However, it was a bit odd because it contained diced green olives (which I normally don't like), but I said what the heck and ate it all anyway.  I was pleasantly surprised.  When the steak arrived I was surprised again at the size.  I was expecting it to be much smaller but it was a pretty big cut.  I'm guessing around 8-10oz.  I love it when steaks are cooked in plenty of butter (gross to some people...I know) and I guess this place knew that because there was plenty of the hot, melty goodness all over the steak and plate!  It was soooo good but soooo unhealthy.  It was cooked perfectly and I ate every bite.  The potatoes were just ok but I ate them anyway.  Nothing a bunch of salt and ketchup couldn't fix.  For dessert I ordered the homemade pecan pie and it was probably among the best I have ever had.\n\nIf you are looking for an upscale steak/bbq joint then this is NOT the place for you.

One of the worst meals I've had in awhile.\n\nMy husband and I came here for some Chicken Fried Steak because he went about 3 years ago and said it was awesome. We showed up and knew that we wanted to order the Chicken Fried Steak right away. They took our order, we waited shortly and our salad came out. Wasn't the best salad. Wasn't really fresh..had a lot of ranch on it, but I can see how somebody might like it. Ate some of it and pushed it to the side.\n\nSoon our steak arrived. I was so excited to try it! I took my first bite and was shocked to find that it was completely bland. I added some salt and ate some more. The meat wasn't the best, which I understand because it's chicken fried steak, however it tasted frozen to me. After the 4th bite, I had to ask my husband if it tasted the same as before. He shook his head no and commented on how disguising it was. Even the mashed potatoes were bland. I agreed and started to feel gross thinking about eating any more of it.  \n\nWe both pushed out dishes to the side, with lots of food still left on our plate. When our waitress came by about 10 minutes after she dropped the food off, we told her we were done. She asked if we wanted a box, which we declined, but otherwise no questions or concerns - she didn't even seem to notice that we ate almost nothing off of our plates. Didn't feel like bringing it up at the time, so we just paid our $35 for and left.

Catfish isn't my favorite fish and far too many places can't make it properly, the sweetness of the catfish almost overpowers things. Not here, the flavor of the breading and the work in harmony. I will definitely get catfish again here! Oh yeah, their Texas Potatoes (or whatever they are called) are good as well, basically they are potato chunks that are fried, in fact I am willing to bet they double fry them to give the outerlayer a crispy texture. \n\nThe restaurant itself resembles your typical small town restaurant, and that is fine with me since I grew up with restaurants like it. Their walls are covered with pictures, posters, signs and whatever else they can put up on it, it gives it an unique look. If you want a \"nice\" restaurant then you better look elsewhere, but if you want a hometown family restaurant and bar setting this is your place.\n\nService is fantastic as well, our server was constantly refilling our drinks and extremely friendly. One nice aspect of this place is that they give you large glasses for your beverage, so you usually only need a refill or two, we had a bit more because we were recovering from the summer heat.  Also for the record they carry Pepsi products, which is a bonus for me, but may not be for others.\n\nIn regards to price, they aren't cheap (the chicken fried steak is around 13 and the catfish for two big filets was around 12), but you will have more then enough food so it works out in the long run. \n\nOverall a great small town style restaurant and bar if you are looking for a hearty meal that is made right.", "business_id": "18TUn9oiW0k0yB6lheiOvw", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-06-03", "type": "review"}

Next, I came with my husband and two year old daughter and the hostess told me that they don't have a high chair that can accommodate a two year old so she had to use a booster seat.  The problem is that she's at that middle age where she's almost done with high chairs and still too immature for a booster seat.  What a mess trying to keep her in her booster seat and contained.  She wasn't noisy or badly behaved, per se, she just wanted to stand up in the booth and look around and fidget with all the condiment bottles on the table.  Also, can I mention that the booths have a weird half wall that obscures the other diners from the chest up, but is open from the chest level down, so someone in the other booth could easily reach underneath the wall and dig around in your purse if they wanted to, or your two year old can peek underneath the booth wall to play peek-a-boo with the diners on the other side?  It's pretty weird.\n\nSo the waitress came over took our drink orders with a minimum of small talk (or overall friendliness).  We perused the menus.  My husband chose a beef brisket sandwich.  I wanted a t-bone steak, I had been craving one and I was looking forward to it.  We ordered our dinners and it's worth mentioning that at NO point did the waitress acknowledge that presence of our daughter.  She never asked us what she wanted to eat or if she needed anything to drink either, apparently she was invisible.  Seeing as how there weren't any kids meals on the menu, I just assumed we'd feed her from our own plates, but interestingly the waitress just assumed that too because she didn't even ask if she'd be having a side order of something as her meal,  She just looked right past her.  If I sound pissed it's because I was.  I don't need the waitress to pinch her cheeks and make baby talk with her, but to merely acknowledge the fact that there were three human beings sitting at the booth that night would have been covered in 'Basic Manners 101'.\n\nSo my steak was very flavorful and tender but BADLY undercooked, terribly fatty and a sickly color gray.  (It didn't have a nice sear or a good caramel color to it.)  I ordered it medium rare, but instead I got bloody, almost blue meat.  And there was so much fat that I only got about half meat, the rest was all scrap fat and the bone.  My sides were non-descript.  I think my mashed potatoes were probably decent, I honestly can't even remember that's how non-descript they were.  The roll and bread 'basket' that came with my food (one little roll and one little cold biscuit) were hard and tasted store bought.  And my hungry toddler didn't even want them.  My husband's beef brisket sandwich was a pathetic, dried out, flavorless waste of good money.  We didn't even bother with desserts.\n\nI had a margarita; it was very good, but beguilingly strong for how petite the rock glass is that it was served in.  After I finished it the waitress came around and asked me if I wanted another and I declined, but my husband (a non-drinker) immediately piped up and said \"Yes, she'll have another!\" and shot me a playful look, and rather than looking to me so see if I *really* wanted another $7 margarita or not she simply walked away and had the bartender make me another one!  WTF?  So within a couple of minutes I had yet another very, very strong margarita sitting in front of me.  Now I'm no cheapskate but I don't like to waste money so I choked down that second margarita and it was the proverbial 'straw that broke the camel's back'.  I may have finished it, but it definitely finished ME.  I spent the rest of the night stumbling and mumbling to myself about someone slipping me a mickey.  I've never, ever had a margarita that strong and I am a very well seasoned drinker.   What of Earth did they put in them??\n\nSo to sum it up I spent over $60 (includes the tip) for 2 small Molotov cocktails disguised as margaritas, an undercooked, fatty, t-bone steak, an inedible, dry beef brisket sandwich and a big serving of NOTHING for my child.  \n\nNever again.\n\nThe two stars are for the flavor and tenderness of the otherwise failure of a steak and the extreme value for your money on the alcohol.

The noise level was too high, but we had so much time invested already that we decided to stay. \nMy salad consisted of a mountain of lettuce on a plate that was too small for it. As I ate, bits fell off my plate no matter how careful I was. I gleaned so many pieces of lettuce from the table and my lap that I built a little hillock. When the waitress came for the plate I quickly scooped up the pile with my hands and put it on top of the remainder of the lettuce on the little plate. She asked me if I wanted a box for my \"salad.\"  Really. The lettuce mess was neither my fault nor hers, and I realize it is the server's job to clear the table, but it did happen on my watch so I would have felt churlish leaving it for her to clean up. She had liberally sown the floor with morsels of food fallen from over-filled plates being carried to diners, but least the hostess was constantly sweeping up the mess on the floor.\nAfter asking whether the rib eye or the New York would be the most tender I ordered the rib eye. When it came it took a monumental effort to cut it. I am strong, so I managed to hack off a couple of bites and finally complained that it was too tough. I was scolded for not ordering a filet in the first place and was asked if I would rather have that. It was a clumsy job of upselling, but I agreed to try one. As I waited for it to be cooked I couldn't keep from staring in morbid fascination at the ocean of gravy sloshing over the gunnel of the overfilled plate across from me. The so-called filet finally came and had the stringy texture of tenderized meat, not the buttery texture of a good filet, and it would have been a nice touch to comp me the difference between the rib eye and the filet, but I was charged the difference. The time to recommend the filet would have been when I first asked about tenderness, not after I had wrestled with the tough rib eye.\nOur visit to Texaz is not one we will repeat.\n\nPS Although we are seniors we would agree with the post below about the lack of seasoning. Some salt and a couple of squirts of Sriracha would work wonders.", "business_id": "18TUn9oiW0k0yB6lheiOvw", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-07-07", "type": "review"}

This donation yielded the opportunity to meet Steve the owner. Steve was awesome we chatted about Tex-Mex food and life in Texas. It was delightful meeting him. \n\nNow on to the food. We ordered a dish on their daily special of biscuits topped with a chicken fried steak topped with eggs. This may sound weird but that's how you eat them in Texas. Food was killer. Steve was also generous in bringing us a sample of his BBQ brisket and mash potatoes. Again legit Texas style food. As BBQ competition person whose tasted some of the best BBQ in Texas I have to give two thumbs up, all the food had great flavor. And we even tried the cobbler topped with Bluebell ice cream.

As other reviews have stated, CP is pricey, but hey, you get what you pay for.  \n\nParking is easy, located at the Biltmore they have valet but its not usually entirely necessary.  \n\nService was prompt and polite and everyone is extremely buttoned-up.

Capital Grille was my second choice -- my first choice was closed for the holiday weekend. And am I ever so glad it was.\n\nWhen making a reservation I dropped that it was a birthday dinner. Upon checking in, the hostess immediately wished him a happy birthday by name and took us to a table adorned with a tasteful amount of birthday confetti and a card signed by the staff. Nice!\n\nFrom there on out the service, food and ambiance was outstanding. It far exceeded my expectations from all the wonderful reviews I had read previously. Our waiter, Chad, was very helpful in helping us select items as we were a little overwhelmed by all the good reviews on yelp and the things people have told us personally. Drinks - a gin and tonic for him and a Stoli Doli for me. Appetizer was calamari, which was delicious. He got the 24 ounce porterhouse, which he ate every bit of. I had the bone-in kona crusted sirloin - AMAZING. A cup of lobster bisque is mandatory. The Lobster Mac and Cheese was an interesting grown-up take on the kid friendly dish. Not as creamy as the microwavable stuff, a little on the soupy side but it was definitely working. We got a creme brulee for dessert, which I discovered upon receiving the check that they comped it for the birthday.\n\nThe service is very well worth noting. I'm not big on fluff and getting my rear kissed as a customer, and the service exceeded standard customer service with genuine sincerity without flirting with that rear-kissing fakeness. Although I suspect if you are of that type that appreciates that, they'll do that too.

Camelback Road\n\n(602) 952-8900\n\nWe arrived for our reservation at 4:30 and were promptly seated. Our waitress was friendly and attentive. We began with cocktails - a Chocolate Martini made without Godiva Liquor and a Mai Tai. The chocolate martini was sent back and was promptly replaced with a correct one made with Godiva Chocolate.\n\nWe quickly dove into the appetizers. Steak Tartare and Lobster Bisque. The Steak Tartare was arguably the finest I have ever eaten, and I have eaten this dish perhaps 40 or 50 times. The texture and seasoning were complete perfection. Were I to return to this restaurant with the ability to order only one thing off the menu, this would be it. Perfectly balanced with capers that weren't too salty, and some wonderful greens with a drizzle of what appeared to be and tested like an aged balsamic. Companion had good comments about the Lobster Bisque, especially the fact that there was more than one piece of lobster in the dish. The bisque is brought to the table with a serving of sherry which is ceremoniously poured into the dish. Personally, I prefer the sherry added at the end of the cooking so that the flavor remains, but the alcohol does not.\n\nThe menu at The Capital Grill is similar to other high end restaurants, in that all main courses are a la carte. Be warned, portions are huge, and unless you are a dyed in the wool carnivore, you will bring home a doggy bag.\n\nAfter perusing the menu and changing our minds a dozen times, we settled on the Steak au Poivre and the Delmonico Steak. I asked for the Steak au Poivre to be cooked rare, and that is exactly what I got. Perfectly cooked with a Courvoisier cr\u00e8me sauce. The sauce was nothing to rave about, in that it added nothing to the flavor of the steak. The steak though, was perfect and huge. I will make at least one more meal out of it.\n\nAs a side dish I ordered Roasted Seasoned Mushrooms, perhaps the only poor selection on the menu. The mushrooms were without any seasoning at all - not even a pinch of fleur de sel or a touch of garlic or even some chopped shallots. Our waitress told us that they had been taken off our check, but looking at it after we left, we found that we had still been charged for them.\n\nCompanion had the Delmonico Steak (rib steak for those not in the know, and usually considered one of the most flavorful cuts of beef) served medium rare. If nothing else, the chef cooks meat to perfection. A huge cut of prime beef, tender and juicy. It's hard to go wrong with this recipe for success. Companion also ordered Cottage Fries and Onion Strings. A table of four would have had trouble finishing a portion the size of what was brought to the table. As with almost everything else, beautifully done.\n\nWe saved room for dessert, and I for one am glad I did. While companion had a scoop of Vanilla Ice Cream, which was nice and tasty and served with a tuile cookie (Pirouine perhaps), I chose the Fresh Berries in Vanilla Cr\u00e8me Sauce. Lush, succulent raspberries, blueberries and strawberries swimming in a nice cr\u00e8me anglais with a sprig of fresh mint on top. What could have been better? A perfect end to our meal.\n\nDings? A few - The mushrooms were terrible. I didn't finish eating them even though I love mushrooms. Some of them weren't even cooked properly. The music is terrible - not only is it way out of style for the restaurant, but also way too loud. Many times it intruded into the conversation, making it all but unintelligible.\n\nCudos? First and foremost for our waitress, who helped make the meal so enjoyable. Definitely for the meat and how it was cooked. Absolutely for the Steak Tartare, which I am going to be dreaming about. And strangely enough, for the immaculately clean restroom, which is something that is too often neglected.\n\nOverall: A top restaurant that I will definitely return to if only to have the steak tartare.", "business_id": "QdbZyl-LWFS54u93Vjd5SA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-07-19", "type": "review"}

However, the rest of the meal was near perfect so let me move along. I decided to order a special- a filet topped with lumb crabmeat and red pepper hollandaise. WOW. It was so tasty! It was also smaller than the regular filet which turned out to be a good thing. We shared the au gratin potatos and the lobster mac and cheese and both were phenomenal!

You will never be disappointed when going here, whether it's for a special occasion or just for dinner. You can't go wrong when you go here. It doesn't matter if you like steak or not, this place will make it your favorite food. Their impressive menu of nationally renowned dry aged steaks and the freshest of seafood will ignite your culinary imagination as their award-winning wine list of more than 5,000 bottles awakens your inner sommelier. I can never think about steaks the same again after eating here, the best by far is the Kona crusted sirloin. I have never heard of it before but wow was it amazing. Great cut of meat and the sauce was to die for. The French onion soup was great, very light. The soup didn't really grab my attention until I got home and was craving it. Every side dish I had was also great, the mashed potatoes were by far the best; they were hot, cheesy, and just wonderful. I never even though about putting salt or pepper on anything. Everything was perfectly seasoned and amazing. I never have really liked coconut cream pie but I enjoyed this one, so moist and creamy. The cr\u00e8me brulee was a little rich but the fresh fruit they put on top made it much better. Dinner ran about 60 dollars a person not including the wine. It was by far one of the most expensive meals that I have had but it was well worth it and I will most likely be going back. The service is customarily outstanding and the staff's wine and food knowledge is exceedingly above board. The waiters were well dressed and were well spoken. It was great not to have some ditsy waitress for once! No matter what questions you have regarding the restaurant they know it all. The decor is just what I expect from an old school traditional steakhouse, dark wood, cigar humidor, and oil paintings. It not overwhelming and it has this sort of calming effect. It is so much quieter than other restaurants, people talk in a low voice so you can actually hear what your waiter is saying. Everything was very clean; I don't think I could find a piece of old food anywhere if I tried. I would definitely dress a little nicer than you would at other restaurants. They don't care if you just show up in jeans and a tee-shirt but you will definitely stand out. When I went it was a surprise and wow was I underdressed. I felt so out of place and like I didn't belong. I wouldn't recommend this place to bring your children, so I would get a babysitter. You don't want your fantastic meal ruined by screaming children. For larger parties, they have a conference room in a secluded, closed off area. Whether you are having a business meeting or just a party, it is perfect for any occasion. Reservations are not need except for Friday and Saturday nights; don't expect to even see a table on these days without one. On a crowded night parking is a nightmare, I would recommend that you either make reservations really early, really late, or use the valet that they have. I wouldn't recommend going here if it is last minute because you will be waiting for a long time. The American Culinary Federation recently bestowed upon The Capital Grille the \"Achievement of Excellence Award.\" The Arizona Republic said the dry-aged steaks are, \"gloriously beefy and juicy, lightly seasoned and utterly delicious.\" You cant get a review like that if you are just any restaurant, they earned that award for sure. The only part that wasn't one hundred percent to my liking was the temperature that my steak came out. It was perfectly cooked but it wasn't that warm when I got it. It seemed like they had it out on the counter waiting for the other part of the meal, but that was the only thing that didn't meet my standards which is very good for a restaurant. I would highly recommend The Capital Grille to anyone wishing a special dining experience. The place is a little pricy but great places like this should be and believe me, it is money well spent.

I don't mean to be harsh, but I expect A LOT more out of restaurants that charge this much for their food. My mom, brother, boyfriend and I visited Capital Grille, mid-May, for an early birthday dinner for myself. We have never dined at a Capital Grille, but have been to the Palm several times, as well as BLT Steak restaurant group. This was our first experience and last one. We wasted almost $500 on this horrendous dining experience. Number one, we ordered a bottle of wine, it literally took our server, Ken, around 20 minutes to find the bottle of wine in their cellar. We were seated near the cellar where he was searching for the bottle, and watched him. At one point he became flustered and went to check on another table. Finally, he came to table with the wine. My brother and boyfriend started with the French Onion soup, it was decent, but overpriced for what it is. I started with the Lobster Bisque, which had to be sent back because it was cold and had butchered overcooked lobster floating on top. Ken returned with a proper bisque at the correct temperature, also decent but overpriced. My mom had the Spinach salad, very small portion, and the knife cuts were a joke. Mushrooms sliced at different widths, onions, some sliced thin, some sliced thick. Mediocre at best. We didn't even mention the salad until the end of the meal, when things had just become too much. The excuse we received was that this was the \"corporate recipe\", this is how corporate wants the vegetables sliced, in random different sizes, isn't it about presentation, especially when you pay this much? My brother ordered the Dry Aged Porterhouse, my mom ordered the Kona Crusted Dry Aged Bone In Sirloin, and I ordered the Delmonico. We also ordered their \"signature\" potato gratin, creamed spinach, and the Truffle Fries. Unimpressed in the quality and flavor of meat, I'm not sure if they were even serving Prime that day. Maybe a corporate decision? The gratin was a joke, topped with crushed potato flakes, seriously? Creamed spinach mediocre. The Fries were very good actually, but how can you mess up fries? The most disappointing and shocking moment is when Ken tried to argue with my boyfriend that the steak her ordered, the Dry Aged Steak Au Poivre, which he ordered rare, and came out medium, was rare, until he took to the kitchen and put it under the light. Then comes back to tell us that the salad is on them since we hated it, which my mom only said that it wasn't the best and it wasn't the worst spinach salad she has had. They gave us an on the house coconut cream pie to go. Which I took one bite when I got home and threw it away. Very disappointing when you spend this much money and receive this type of service and quality of food.

That is very important to me, because when I go out to dine, the last thing I want is for my experience to be ruined because of other diners not being considerate. \n\nNext, we were greeted by our server Ken, who by the way happens to be about one of the best servers I think I have ever encountered in this type of establishment.  That isn't to say that our local haunts that we frequent often are not just as good because they are, but this is about this particular experience.  Ken was extremely knowledgeable about their very extensive wine list and very knowledgeable about the specials and how things in the kitchen were prepared.\n\nThe first thing we ordered were the lobster and crab cakes. We asked if they were more meat than breading and he informed us that they were very meaty and he wasn't exaggerating.  I have a very hard time eating much especially if bread is involved.   These were amazing.  I ordered the double bone lamb chops med rare and they came out perfectly, perfectly seasoned and were very good.  My husband ordered the steak delmonico (spelling) and he ordered it med rare also (there is no point in eating it any other way)  Well Ken actually suggested that my husband order this steak medium because of the way the marbling cooked, and so it was ordered medium and he was not steered wrong.  With that we shared the lobster mac & cheese, and wow, just wow.  I am not a lobster lover by any stretch because I've always found it to taste like dirt and be very tough.  I guess the difference here is claw meat rather than a tail. Whatever the difference was, we absolutely loved it.  The only issue of the whole night was SO MUCH FOOD. That isn't a bad thing, we have a teen at home, and how many teens get rack of lamb as a doggy bag?  We did take home some desserts to share with the young one.  \n\nNow to praise the management team.  It isn't all that unusual for managers to come to your table and ask how your meal is, but I have to say that Torri and Bow went out of their way to make sure we were having a wonderful experience, and we noticed that it seemed to be just the way of doing business at the Capital Grille.  It is so nice to be just an average joe and feel like you are a VIP on a night out.  So a personal thank you to both of them for making us feel so special. \n\nIn short, you can't go wrong here.  Excellent service, excellent food that is quite frankly just as simple as it gets, and beautifully done.  A peeve of mine is having a bunch of useless stuff on my plate that just gets thrown away.  Plating can be beautiful without all that, and the Capital Grille has that down.", "business_id": "QdbZyl-LWFS54u93Vjd5SA", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-06-17", "type": "review"}

The waiter, seemingly disappeared during our dinner and I do not believe we saw him more than the initial order and perhaps the bill. Even at that, we had to track him down to get the bill. We left 3/4 of the food on our plates, so obviously it was not good. However, he did not ask us why or inquire about the food. Very bad service overall.\n\nThe food. My husband's was mediocre as he had described it. Mine was horrible. I ordered fish, although I can not recall which type. The meal was so salty I could barely eat it. Not simply from the fish itself, although it was very \"fishy\" but the preparation tasted like 90% salt. Really horrible. I hate to say it, but it reminded me of going to Olive Garden where they pour salt all over your food to mask the lack of quality. This perhaps was even worse than Olive Garden with a steep bill at the end. Horrible. Even their infamous Pineapple Martini was a bust this time.

Most places think when you order rare you really want medium rare. They did cook the meat exactly the way I like, a little fleshy in the center. My steak was good but not excellent. A little tough. We ordered the green beans. This was a huge disappointment. I am not sure where this started but green beans need to be mature and cooked, not picked before there is a bean in it and warmed up. Yes I know this seems to be the way you get them everywhere. I was raised where you go into the garden, pick the beans, string the beans, break them into 1 to 1.5 inch pieces. When cooked they are to die for.

This location at Biltmore has always been spot on. Made a reservation for our anniversary here the night before Valentines Day. We arrived about 10 minutes early and our car service was met with awesome valet guys. We sat at the bar and had pre-dinner cocktails. I've always been treated so well at this particular Capital Grille from valet to valet. I love that when your table is ready they take your tab and your drink for you to your table. This night was our anniversary of a year and our table had rose petals scattered all over it. How nice is that?! We started with a seafood tower. It's our one year and hey, relationships these days that last, deserve pomp and treats! Well.. We like bubbles and food! This seafood tower was divine and we aren't large people; as soon as it arrived, I knew we were in over our heads! Oh well, you only live once .. Spend well! Next we both ordered the filet mignons. My go to steak. I know they do it right and perfect it was this night. We opted for the mashed potatoes and a salad, as well. I think we both had two bites and were stuffed! Our waiter was spot on perfect. So friendly, you can see why Capital Grille is one of the top notch steak houses. He suggested the perfect merlot to pair our filet with and even brought us a complimentary vodka Stoli vanilla cream cordial after dinner drink, just because! As if we weren't stuffed enough and had not been spoiled by the staff enough on our special night, out comes a dessert tray with a chocolate cursive writing of, ' Happy Anniversary!', around several small dessert samplings. So wonderful! I love a classy restaurant like this that loves it's customers and shows it this way. It's a splurge and it's worth it, every single time! Oh..

Three words: Coconut Cream Pie. I'm not even a fan of coconut or these types of desserts, but whatever they put in this dessert is addicting. It's the combination of creamy coconut filling, with a flaky yet soft crust and then the very best part is the caramel. I could eat an entire serving on my own. So whatever you do, don't stuff yourself too much on the delicious steak so you miss out on this dessert!\n\nNow on to the rest of the meal. This Capital Grille has a great location, very friendly staff and a great environment...not to mention the amazing food! Not only do they have a large selection of comfortable booths, but they also have a private room in the back that's perfect for hosting a large group. I've been to a luncheon in the private room before and it was very comfortable. \n\nThe steak here is top quality and fresh! It's tender to the touch and better with each bite. I absolutely love their Lobster Mac N Cheese along with their Au Gratin potatoes. Get both and happily roll out of their like I do! My favorite meal consists of a the Capital Grille chopped salad, the Filet Oscar (topped with crab meat), sharing the Lobster Mac and Au Gratin and completing the gluttonous experience with the Coconut Cream Pie. It's worth every calorie and then some. \n\nImportant Notes:\n\n- They serve lunch and often do amazing three course lunch specials. \n\n- During the summer, they do dining after dark which means they offer a special prix fix menu starting after 8 PM that includes an appetizer, two entrees, two drinks and dessert all for $50!\n\n- Make a reservation, especially on weekends and during the busy season. \n\nA special fun fact: \n\n- I learned an amazing piece of information about their giving.

We went here for my birthday dinner and it was one of the worse meals I've had in a long time. I ordered the Chef's special - a steak served with shrimp on top, served scampi style. This came out on a plate with gigantic grilled shrimp on top. The shrimp were actually really good. Which is sad when it's suppose to compliment the steak. The steak, which is drowning in this scampi (greasy buttery sauce) is completely bland and has no taste - like not even seasoned with salt and pepper. Appears as if the Chef thought hey, all this greasy buttery sauce will cover up the need to season this piece of meat! I would expect this from a Denny's restaurant after a night of clubbing while in college - not for a nice sit down restaurant. I think I've had better steak at Outback Steakhouse. My boyfriend had the filet on the bone. It came out looking like a barbaric slab of meat from the stone ages - again the most bland seasoning you've ever experienced with a steak! Thank God this place had A-1 steak sauce to save grace - he drowned his steak in this to give it some flavour. Pretty sad when you have to ask for steak sauce at a fine dining establishment. Typically a good steak, seasoned and cooked well would require NO additional sauces used so that you could enjoy the full flavour - well this is not the case at this restaurant since the steaks have NO flavour at all. We ordered sides of lobster mac and cheese - this was good with big chunks of lobster. The potatoes were bland and unimpressive. The 2 impressive things about this place were the calamari for starters and the free cheesecake birthday dessert. The waitress gave us each one refill of our drink (I had soda and he had ice tea). The cups were literally the size of a kids cup - towards the end, she didn't even stop to ask if we would care for a refill - we must have hit our 2 drink maximum. Overall, a truly disappointing dinner experience for a hefty price tag of over $190 - with no alcoholic beverages. To pay this price for dinner and still walk out hungry is sad. Save your money if you want mediocre steak - go to Texas Roadhouse. If you're willing to spend the big bucks and want a good steak - go to Flemings or Mortons.

It's in the Camelback Esplanade, easily the most screwed up yet supposedly upscale shopping center in the valley that smells like poo.\n2. If one of the things that makes you \"cool\" is a verbal menu, you might want to make sure your servers know the menu. As a teacher, I have a fair amount of patience and mercy.

If Big Wong's Chinese on Indian School can consistently serve me a flawlessly cooked and completely grit-free dish of scallops for $10, why can't you manage it? \n4. You're a steak place. If you can't cook my burger correctly, do you think I'm going to risk $50 on a steak? Just sayin'... I know Ruth's Chris and Capital Grill can do it right.\n\nAlright. It wasn't a TOTAL waste of time and money:\n1. Hubby liked his 5-onion soup. I thought it was too thick and had an odd herbal or even floral bouquet. But I am not the French Onion soup connoisseur.\n2. In spite of the done-ness issue, the burger was very well seasoned and tasty overall. You had a choice of 4 cheeses, onion and mushroom saute, and a side dish (any of their potato options or their standard salads). The Lyonnaise potatoes were really good, as was my baked potato, and as large as my two fists together).\n3. The drinks were tasty and strong, but expensive. Their beer selection is crap. \n\nOoops.

I try to be very fair.  \nSo on the plus side:\nGreat Ambiance and Decor\nStaff was very polite and friendly\nOn the negative side- \nRather then  write  it all out again, I will simply place what I sent as a complaint through Morton's Website. \n\nTo whom this may concern:\n\nI want you to know that I will be placing this on yelp and also on my face book account to document how seriously upset I am at the night I had at Morton's.  The location I visited was 2501 E. Camelback Rd. Phoenix, AZ 85016. I am not a person that looks for free stuff, nor am I a person that normally goes this far with a complaint. Tonight is different, tonight was the night me and my wife were to celebrate our 2nd year anniversary. \n\nWe got to your establishment early and everyone was exceptionally nice. The only issue we had with your floor staff was we had to wait for a while for tea and water refills. Other than that everyone was very accommodating.  Now unfortunately our table had a direct view of your pass through window and the two chefs standing there.  This is where our story takes a drastic turn for the worst. You see your restaurant had a total of 4 tables occupied so your chefs were bored.  \nOne chef , a younger man wearing glasses,  folded his arms and then placed his hands inside the pits of his arms.  Now I understand that he has a chef coat on, but it seemed a little unprofessional. That is until we saw the second chef,  an older man with a mustache.  I will never in all my days forget this disgusting person.  This man started by picking what was either scabs or calluses on one of his hands. Notice I said picking them, not scratching his hand,  but actually picking  things off his hand and throwing them to the ground.  Then, he took off his chef hat and started scratching his scalp. Now at this point my wife was giggling a little bit because she was so shocked this was happening.  Then I think I threw up in my mouth a little when I saw the man actually pick his nose and then run his hand back and forth across his nostrils.  \nRight after we see this our salads arrived.  They were nicely prepared and tasted great. A couple bites into my salad I noticed something strange on one of the anchovies. That's when I pulled about an inch long whisker out of my salad. It had a nice large root  on the end which tells me it was pulled and not one that just accidently fell in. So it is very obvious to me that your kitchen staff in general doesn't understand the importance of hygiene and food preparation.  My wife walked out of the restaurant and I called for the manager.  Now the manager took my information and stated Morton's would be contacting me.  He also was very empathetic and apologized several times.  However, he said something to me that astounded me. He said this is not the norm for Morton's. He said you strive to be the best and give your customers great food and service. He told me that Morton's employees never do what this older chef did and that he would be dealt with immediately.  Now I really believe the manager believes what he is saying, However, I am not sure if he is truly looking at his employee's with unbiased eyes.  If Morton's employees hold such high regard for hygiene and service then why didn't anyone of the other employees ever say anything about this older chef? There was a third person, a stockier build gentleman in a white shirt that was leaning over the pass through talking to both chefs while all this was going on. Why didn't he say anything? Why, was he there talking to the chef's anyway? He didn't even have a hair net on, yet he is leaning through a pass through were food is being prepared,  cracking  jokes and  distracting people from what is actually a fairly dangerous job. My salad which probably was never touched by either one of those chefs had a whisker in it. A whisker that had been pulled out of someone's body as you could tell by the big root on it. So I am sorry to say this but either the manager who was truly nice and trying to do damage control is not is not paying attention, or he has other responsibilities that are taking him away from quality control and staff regulation. Then to add insult to injury, I had to pay for using the parking garage.", "business_id": "_BhzcKojv1gjdRINe3Gkig", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-07-29", "type": "review"}

I always look to yelpers to help me know what to order.  So here you go.\n\nThe bartenders always say that the filet sandwiches are the most popular but the hamburgers are the best.  I've had both. Both are good - but you know how awesome a good burger is don't you?  Get those.\n\nAlso must get the iceberg wedge bites.  How smart to make them small - and easy to divide up between the husband and I.  So happy.\n\nThe chicken - skip it.  Or just drive through McDonalds and get some on the way home if you want chicken nuggets.\n\nThe crab is good.  We only got it once cause my sister-in-law was visiting and insisted on getting them (we're stuck in our burger and iceberg wedge bite rut).  So ok, they are the best crab cakes I've had in years - really almost all crab and not all breading like other places.  But they serve them on little buns with bacon and lettuce - which is ok and if you're inventive you could pull the crab cakes off the buns eat them as crab cakes, then eat a little blt sandwich.\n\nThe drink menu is limited, but it's one reason we go there.  Why don't more places have a Manhattan on the happy hour menu? grrrr - leaves us going here or Donovan's all the time (which btw has the bigger and better Manhattan on the happy hour menu - they use Woodford Reserve - mmm - but the food is limited, and I find Mortons bar more cozy).

We ordered steak of course, with garlic potatoes and some veggies. The potatoes were good, but the steak was just average at best. It wasn't juicy enough or moist.

Based on this experience, it will be a long while before I decide to go back to Outback.", "business_id": "4mZ__NR8jLD1k0rYpSbplA", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-08-12", "type": "review"}

It wasn't even that busy where I could understand him having B.O. We orded soup and mac and cheese for our dinner. Im not a big fan of the steaks from here. Its hit or miss and id rather not risk a miss and end up with a steak that isnt tender. We could tell right away that our waiter had an attitude after we ordered. We werent very hungry and i was craving the mac and cheese. It is a kids dish but i would order it if they raised the price and made it a dish on the menu. Its so good when they dont make it watery, which they did this time. We had to wait almost 10 minutes after we ordered for our bread and for my drink. After we got our food our waiter never Checked on us. He walked by a dozen times but no refills and no more bread. There was also a small fly buzzing around and a Tiny gnat on our table. When we got our check there was a charge for 2 drinks we did not order! I was furious at that point. When I told the waiter he didn't even seem surprised but rather almost annoyed! I get that our bill was not going to be huge but it doesn't mean our service has to be so bad. Whenever I split a dish or order small items as my entree I always leave a good tip. The bill usually comes out to about $20 like this time and normally I would have tipped $5-6 if the service was good or even decent.

This establishment is historical and has been around forty-seven years! A steakhouse rated as one of the 85 best restaurants in Phoenix, I was eager to try it as soon as our plane touched down. It was even mentioned in the in flight magazine as one of the best steakhouses in the United States. \nUpon our arrival, we found that Stockyards was located in a more industrial section of the city, not downtown. It had a more formal feel with historical photos of the stockyards on the walls and a saloon, but not in the touristy sense, more somber and dark.\nOur waiter was attentive and had a great sense of humor. I think he may have been mentioned in other Yelpers' reviews.\nNow for the food...I had a beef brisket sandwich with many slices of lean meat on it. The meat was smothered in barbecue sauce, which had a flavor I was not wild about. My sandwich was accompanied by a large helping of fries, tasty and crispy.\nMy husband ordered the steak sandwich. When it arrived it was a large juicy steak, but served open-faced. My husband didn't like this. In fact, he requested a another piece of sandwich roll for the top. The steak was ultimatey too chewy to eat in this fashion, and had to be cut in pieces with a knife. In other words, the steak was not very tender. His meal also came with fries. Our waiter had recommended a roast beef and cheddar sandwich that is a Stockyards specialty instead, but my husband did not listen to him! \nOverall, I would give Stockyards a solid three stars. It did not quite live up to our expectations, but it was not bad, either.

It was nephew's birthday and he loves steak so I wanted to take him special. Since this was the oldest steakhouse in Phoenix and a historical landmark for the city, it fit the bill. We all enjoyed our meals. My fillet was cooked perfectly. Nephew said his ribeye was a little salty but personally I enjoy some seasoning on my steak. I don't like it when places serve it totally plain... or worse, with a bunch of butter. A steak should be juicy enough to stand on its own with just a little salt and pepper to enhance the flavor. I did enjoy that we also got a very rich and beefy demi-glace as well (served on the side). I also liked that you get your choice of starch included with the steak as well as a soup or salad. I ordered the sweet potato mash which unfortunately I did not care for at all. There was something off about the taste and it wasn't as smooth whipped as I would have liked. I did really love the soup, though. That night it was a cremini mushroom bisque that was delectable. It would have gone really well with a good earthy red wine but unfortunately I wasn't drinking that night. Other people at the table enjoyed a few beers. They have the usual domestic and European choices as well as some taps from local Sonoran Brewing Company. For dessert hubby and I split the strawberry shortcake and they also brought out a chocolate brownie a la mode for my nephew. So nice!\n\nOverall, maybe the food was only worth about three stars but checking out the old photos of downtown Phoenix and all the cowboy art on the wall made it a cool experience. I really liked the old school saloon as well. This is definitely someplace every Phoenician should come at least once.", "business_id": "7U8TYNW4Mvx6m3zexsO0sg", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-07-25", "type": "review"}

Been here many of times and always enjoy my time here. This time we came here with a large group. They basically have a large main dining area, a smaller back group which is quieter, and the bar area. Not too many people hang out in the bar area so it's pretty quiet there. Today we got all the tables in the bar area so it was almost like a semi private party. \n\nThey start you off with their jalape\u00f1o muffins and raw vegetable tray. Everything is so good but I always have to watch myself cause I don't want to fill my self up. Next came their seafood chowder. One of my favorites. It is so good. All I remember is the salmon in there but I know other seafood is in there. \n\nI ordered the 16oz ribeye with a baked potato. The ribeye was cooked perfect. Juicy. Not too much fat and just melt in your mouth meat. I'm an fan as you can tell. \n\nMy wife tried the buffalo meatloaf and she really loved it. I stole a bite and it was so tender and smooth. Really liked it with that gravy. She had sweet potato mash and grilled vegetables. The veggies where cooked perfect and tender. It's a really good dish. \n\nTo top it off I had the pecan pie. It's was good but I had better. Taking nothing away from this pie. It was really good and not to sweet with a nice flaky crust. \n\nOur service was great. Got our drink orders and always filled out glasses without being asked. We had one person at our table who had there steak cooked a little too much for their liking and they made no fuss about it and brought her another one while continuing to apologize to her. \n\nSo I've been here and had multiple ribeye, prime rib, and baby back ribs and it's all really good.

We had been researching nice steakhouses and saw plenty of raving reviews for this place. We were not impressed. \n\nRight off the bat, our waiter seemed to be annoyed with us. I don't know why, the place was empty on a Tuesday night, but I presumed because of our age (all about 25), he might have thought we would not tip well. I am only making assumptions though. Since I always leave at least a standard 20% tip, I had a very hard time giving our server that. I did though due to my guilt and not wanting to be hated, but my colleagues I was dining with all gave me a hard time for leaving such a decent tip. The couple of busboys who came out with the bread baskets & water, on the other hand, had a lovely attitude. I hope they got some tip share with what I left our server.\n\nPrices are reasonable as far as this type of steakhouse goes, but not worth the price. I ordered a NY strip steak which was pretty flavorless. I ordered medium rare, and it was just not juicy at all. Our server did not even have us cut into our steaks and ask how they were. I would have expected that at a place like this. I have had a much juicier and flavorful steak at much more casual, chain steakhouses. \n\nWith the steak you get a choice of a couple of the sides (not the exhaustive sides list). I asked if I could get a different side and the server told me there would be an upgrade charge. Fine I said, thinking it would be like a differential amount, but not the full price of the side. Sure enough, when I got my bill I was charged the full amount for the side. So I paid for my additional side, but didn't get a side which I was entitled to with my meal. It would have been lovely if he would have told me to get one of the included sides as well if I was going to be paying full price for the side I picked. Speaking of this side, the creamed spinach, this was definitely the highlight of my meal. Well lies, my glass of Malbec was the best part. The creamed spinach was the second. The third most delicious part of the meal was the jicama on the raw veggie plate they bring to each table as a starter. \n\nThe others in my party were equally unimpressed.

It is just very westerny.\n\nThe place was pretty packed but we didn't mind because it would give us time to check out the place and maybe sit at the bar and get an ice cold Shiner that is on tap.  Well we tried that while waiting for a table but it looked like there was only one bar tender getting drinks for the bar patrons as well as the entire waitstaff for all the tables in the place.  Oh well.  After a few minutes were were seated and yes, we both took the slide down.  Oh, there was also a live band playing some country music and it was pretty good and not overly loud.  If I had a couple more drinks in my I probably would have tried to dance country style. \n\nOur waiter was very nice but some things took forever because the poor guy had like 17 tables.  I don't understand why places can't hire more waitstaff.  I mean they work basically for tips and there are probably plenty of people wanting jobs so wtf?  Anyway, he was very nice and did the best job he could.\n\nI love the Indian fry bread and biscuits they give you to start.  I could eat that stuff all night.  They give you like 3 different kinds of butter and honey to play with so it doesn't get much better than that.\n\nMy wife and I split the bone in rib eye and it was juicy, flavorful and delicious.  It was a bit fatty but that is how I like it.  My wife took the less marbled part so it all worked out.  With an entree you get a nice big salad, beans and corn.  It was all good and was plenty for 2 people.  I would definitely order the steak again but I think next time we are going to share some of their ribs.  I had them years ago and I remember them being very good.\n\nI know some people like it, especially the kids, but I don't like the random guys walking around making balloon animals and others doing magic tricks.  I try not to make eye contact with them so they don't come over because I just want to sit and enjoy my meal.\n\nAnyway, this place is pretty good and perfect to bring out-of-towners because it is very westerny and has a perfect view.  Kids also seem to love the balloon animals, magic, the slide, and the little paper bull horn hats they give them.  Also, when you go, I would recommend sharing your entree.  The amount of meat they give you is more than enough for 2 people. \n\nAlthough a monsoon didn't end up rolling in which would have been nice to watch up there, we had a good time anyway.", "business_id": "wZwZcte4lcbu51NOzCjWbQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-07-13", "type": "review"}

I walk in the doors and I'm immediately offered two options to get to my table: the quick route -- the ever-so-popular slide -- or the boring way -- the stairs. The six year-old child in me screams \"take the slide you coward!!\" OK, what the hay right? After I've recovered, I walk through sawdust lined wooden floors on my way to my seat. During my journey, I pass by a live band playing on the stage, the energetic waitstaff teaching visitors how to two-step, a magician mystifying the crowd, a photo prop inviting me to be a plump cowgirl and stuffed rattlesnakes peering at me from their containers. \n\nYou have just re-visited many, many of my nights throughout my life at Rustler's Rooste. \n\nRustler's Rooste is a classic and a must-visit if you're in town vacationing, you want to throw a party or you simply want to make it a cowboy adventure of a night out on the town. I've been coming here since I could barely walk. As a child, I rarely left the slide area and would join the group of other children waiting in line to go up and down the slide the entire night while the grown-ups ate. Place a slide in a restaurant and it's endless hours of childhood fun. \n\nThe food is good and hearty. From flavorful BBQ chicken to tender ribs to juicy steak, I never leave hungry. Oh did someone say rattlesnake? Well yes, yes they do happen to serve that southwestern delicacy, but only if you're really in the mood for an adventure. I normally stick with the basics. \n\nI've been to several events at Rustler's Rooste, including one of my favorites in the main ballroom equipped with long picnic tables and a stage for live music. Plus, the entire restaurant is situated on the rim of South Mountain and has spectacular views of the valley. Go during sunset. It's a romantic must. \n\nAs if the night couldn't possibly get more fun, they now serve cotton candy to all the guests at the end of the meal. The child in me screams with happiness every time I enter Rustler's Rooste and the adult in me loves that this is one of the only remaining restaurants where you can walk in and receive the true southwest experience. And even though I live in AZ, I absolutely love it when I visit and receive the reminder from Rustler's Rooste just how authentic and special AZ is, especially with gems like Rustler's Rooste!", "business_id": "wZwZcte4lcbu51NOzCjWbQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-07-28", "type": "review"}

Nothing like the smell of excrement and urine right before dinner. Second, the NOISE! This is a country western themed steakhouse, so whatever, be warned. Third, the service was the worst. Since we had a party of 8, an 18% gratuity is automatically added to our bill. That's fine, I get it, but apparently our waitress felt she didn't have to work for it since it's mandatory. She was rude and not very helpful...at all. I never experienced ordering a $20 appetizer (the fried rattlesnake) and having it thrown on our table, she didn't even stop! I was also looking forward to finishing our biscuits and fry bread, but apparently there's a time limit. She took them away without even asking. Fourth, the food was mediocre, at best. I ordered the 16oz T-Bone and it was under seasoned and not very good. The green bean and corn on the cob sides were soggy. At least try to hide the fact that it was over cooked and soaking in hot water before it was served. Fifth, when it came time to pay the bill, we were given the right check, but our credit card was charged for another party's dinner! Really???? We over-paid for a terrible experience!

We arrived at about 6:30 and had a tough time finding parking sober decided to use valet. It's no charge so it's really a no-brainer. We were seated right away. Server was friendly and food came out pretty quick. I had ribs and steak medallions. Flavor of the ribs was spot on but the cut was awful. A lot of gristle and fat. Steak was incredible. I was disappointed with the sides though. They didn't really give you any options. You get whatever they roll out like it or not. Anything extra and you have to pay. Kid had a burger (a $16 burger!) and it was good. Pricey but good. Wife had fried chicken. It was also pretty good. For dessert we had the cow pie which is ice cream under a chocolate shell. This thing was so frozen solid that we needed to break it apart with a knife to eat it! It was way to big of a dessert! No way a small party could eat it all. We didn't even get halfway through it.

It's funny that I went back and read my last review and I was surprised to see that I had ordered a filet again. I guess I must be a creature of habit. My tastes have not changed, but the service and quality of RR sure has.\nLet me start off saying that I made reservations weeks in advance. I reserved a booth like last time, and wanted this to be a special Saturday Night Mother's Day Dinner! Things just did not pan out that way. As we drove up there were no more handicap parking spots available. I asked the valet if there were anymore, and he said, \"This is a busy place at 6pm and obviously there are a lot of retired individuals here\". Well I'm not retired, but my Mother was planning on having us park in a handicap space. No biggie handed the keys to the valet. We were sat right away at a small table downstairs at the far East end. We had a nice view of the city, as well as being right next to the wait station. The evening went downhill from here.\nWe ordered a shrimp cocktail, and some deep fired mushrooms & zucchini. They were very good, came out hot and the shrimp were large and tasty. We ordered Iced Teas & water and our server had a tough time refilling them throughout the night. Even when we would ask for refills ahead of time we had to wait. The salad was terrible! The lettuce was wilted with too much dressing. It tasted like it had been premade and holding somewhere waiting for the busy dinner push. My wife had a nice burger with onion rings and it was the best meal by far. Everything was hot and there was a lot of food. But one would expect that with a $14 burger. My Mother-In-Law had the ribs and she said they were done well and very tender. My Mother & I ordered the filet and I must say that it was plain, tasteless, and not worth it at all. It looked like it had been cooked and held in au jus or a steam well, and possibly microwaved to a hot temperature. I ordered mine medium and it was gray all the way through. I took one bite and was done. My server never asked how my steak was, or why I had not touched it or my beans and corn. When we were getting our plates cleared I asked if my meal could be taken off the bill and that I was not interested in anything else. He returned and said that the manager took my meal off our bill. My Mother on the other hand ate more than a few bites and hers was not taken off the bill. We did not order dessert and when outside to watch the sunset. I had made our reservations for 6pm so we could be outside by 7:19pm for the sunset. The views were awesome as always. It was unfortunate that there was a private party taking up over 75% of the patio, including the prime locations on the Westside where I enjoyed the fire-pits on our last visit. \nI do have to commend Tom Mills for getting back in touch with me. As I mentioned I've been a GM for some time, and I don't believe that 20% off was enough to entice me to go back. This is place that you take out of town guests to experience something special in Phoenix. I live in Ahwatukee and love to try and support local businesses'. Rustler's Rooste did ask to follow me on Instagram and inquired if they could post a picture of my Mother and I on the patio with the wonderful view in the background. This is my reply to Tom, I never heard back from him.\n\nTom,\nFirst off I would like to thank you for getting back to me. I did follow Rustler's Rooste on Twitter for a bit, I even tweeted about how excited I was to take my family there. But all and all it was not a good experience. \nI pretty sure that Brain asked my dinner companions how their food was, not sure if he addressed me, pretty sure he did not. Obviously it doesn't take a mental giant to figure out that I did not touch my plate. \nThe overall experience was lackluster at best. The food to me resembled something like a public school cafeteria meal. Like I had mentioned the salad was awful, and the green beans had been holding somewhere for a long time. \nI appreciate you extending an email to me. I am well aware of guest first service; every guest is my guest, want for nothing service, secret shoppers, and whatever Rustler's Rooste 10 Commandments are for steps of service. I have been a local restaurant general manager for years. You are welcome to look me up on LinkedIn. \nThanks again for reaching out to me. I can honestly say that I don't think that I will take you up on your offer. I appreciate it and will save your email. Like I have previously mentioned I have been going to Rustler's Rooste since I was a bartender at Bobby McGee's in the late '80s. It used to be some place special to take out of town visitors, kind of a land mark if you will.

My friends were in town staying at the resort, they invited me out, so up the hill we went. \nFirst impression-stinky cow by the front door...? Yuck! Our wait was about 5 min. Not bad (it was a Thur, around 8). Our table was great, the view of Phoenix was awesome. \n\nAs for the food... first they bring out a basket of strange little flatbread things that weren't very warm. Almost like hockey pucks. Then out comes a salad with wilted iceberg lettuce that is covered in ranch dressing. Not great either. \n\nEveryone at the table ordered steak. My friend said her tenderloin was really good but I didn't taste it. I ordered the sirloin, it tasted good, it was tender, but it was just barely warm. It was obviously sitting in a warmer, and I would have liked a fresh cooked steak better.  The meal came with green beans, which I didn't even taste because they looked awful, and corn on the cob which looked like the little frozen cobs you get at the grocery store. The best part of my meal was the baked potato. It was delicious. \nWe ordered a kids meal sirloin and the steak was cold and tough.The kids burger was decent. \n\nNow, the end of the meal was the strangest thing I've ever seen at a restaurant.  The busboy comes and motions to us to hand him our plates. He proceeds to dump ALL our food into the salad bowl, utensils included!! It looked just plain nasty.

She says \"you only get one.\" I say \"well, then we will purchase 2 extra.\"  She says \"you can't buy extra\" I'm like fine whatever. I'm all about kids sharing, but you're out to a nice dinner.. maybe a special occasion.. give each kid a cotton candy for cryin out loud. \n\nThen you leave and pass the stinky cow again. Fun.

Both steaks were overcooked!\n\nWe went there on a Thursday night as a treat to ourselves. Hadn't been there in years. We had our 2 yo with us since it was kids eat free, we thought it would be kid friendly. Saw that hh is only offered in the saloon upstairs so we decided to have a drink and app before going down to eat. The hostess let us know we could sit at any of the low top tables w/o a reserved sign or any hightop table. We chose a low top by the window because of our child. We sat there for awhile wondering if we had to go to the bar ourselves. Finally a lady comes up to us and says she was sorry and nobody wanted to come tell us but the table we were at was actually reserved. I guess if they have a red napkin it means reserved, the hostess was not aware either. So we ask where else we can sit. She says any of the high tops or at the bar. So I ask again to confirm that there is not a single low top table we can sit at with our 2yo?!? So since they can't accommodate us, we ask if we can get hh downstairs, no. They cannot do that, but we can grab our own drinks now and take them down with us, fine. So we get our drinks and take them to the table. Great view!! Skip ahead to ordering. Be prepared to pay extra if you are a meat and potatoes lover. All dinners are served with green beans and a tiny corn on the cob. Both were gross! Table gets a dish of cowboy beans that look and taste like they are just a few beans mixed into tomato sauce. My husband did not eat them and thats saying a lot!! A side of any type of potato is an extra $2-5 and hopefully everyone at the table agrees on one because they are huge sides. He ordered his prime rib med-rare and I order the filet med- well. When they showed up, I would have ate his steak! Both were overcooked. Mine had no pink at all but thats fine to me but his was so tough looking for a prime rib and had a sliver of pink only in the middle. In any other moment he would have sent it back but since at this point it was such a bad experience, all we could do was laugh and so he sucked it up and ate it. To top it off, the waiter tried to sneak one by us and charge us for the child meal. When we pointed it out he says,\" oh oops I gave you the old copy\". Ya ok.

That's where the two stars come from, because they know what they are and you get exactly what you'd expect: mediocre food at a high price while surrounded by heavily-themed EVERYTHING.\n\nAs a foodie, though, I do have to knock the prices and food quality separately from the 'gimmick' side of this place.  It's not bad food, but it definitely isn't great either.  Very mediocre.  On the plus side, my steak was cooked perfectly (med. rare) which I always appreciate, but that's about the only thing that stood out as positive.  The salad was way too heavy on the dressing and the biscuits in the bread basket tasted like canned biscuits.  The real downside to this is the pricing...very expensive! It helps to think of it as you're paying for the gimmick experience and the great view, not just the food.  I've heard their cocktails and margaritas are good, so that's a plus.\n\nOverall, come here once when you want to bring out-of-towners, but don't plan on it becoming a regular favorite.  They do what they do relatively well, but it's not really worth multiple return trips.  Come at sunset!", "business_id": "wZwZcte4lcbu51NOzCjWbQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-06-03", "type": "review"}

I was worried, to say the least.  The reviews I saw were terrible.  My parents, my son and I went together at about 5:30 pm on a Monday night.  Here are the points:\n1. Our waitress was attentive and very adorable.\n2. We enjoyed seeing the longhorn at the front door.  He was lying down, so his odor was at a minimum.\n3. The \"mine\" entrance was fun, and my 14 yo had just toured a mine the day before, so that made it more interesting to us.\n4. My son wouldn't go down the slide, but my dad and I both slid into the restaurant.  The little kids sliding there were adorable.\n5. The upstairs bar area looked nice, and had a better view, so next time I might opt to stay upstairs and just go for the appetizer menu if that's what they serve there.\n6. We were seated quickly at a window seat down stairs by the patio.  The view is good.  We could see Camelback Mountain.  The view upstairs would be a lot better, in my opinion.\n7. There were a lot of small children.  A lot.  But they were well behaved and it didn't get too noisy.  Some have complained about the noise, but being early on Monday, the place wasn't full\n8. The live band was good and where we were seated it wasn't too loud for talking to each other.\nOverall, we enjoyed the Wild West theme.  It isn't too overwhelming if you are ready for it.  The view and the theme are the reasons to go to this place.\n\nNow for the food.  Remember that this place is more about atmosphere, and less about the food.  And the food is meant to be simple cowboy food, not gourmet.  It was good for me to start with very low expectations.\n1. We were served a bowl of bread.  The Indian Fry Bread was really pleasant.  I would like to learn to make those little breads.  The biscuit was not good.  It was dry and hard.  I ate mine.  It was a waste of space in my stomach.  I recommend skipping the biscuit.\n2. A family bowl of salad came next.  It is pre-tossed with ranch dressing.  The salad was fine.  It is like a standard iceberg/red cabbage mix.  We thought it had just the right amount of dressing tossed on.  It was not drenched in dressing.  Thank goodness.  After all the terrible reviews I had meant to ask for the dressing on the side, but forgot.\n2. I ordered the Big Burger  It was definitely good.  I ordered medium-rare and it as perfectly cooked, and was large and juicy.  It came with fries and onion rings.  I love onion rings, and I felt the onion rings at the Rooste were very good.  The french fries on the other hand, were just OK.  I didn't finish them because they were not really crispy.   \n3. My Dad ordered the veggie burger.  It was just OK.  Unless you are a vegetarian, don't get this.  It was more expensive than our delicious real beef burger.  He said the vegetarian chili was good.\n4. My Mom ordered a steak and vegetables.  Her steak was medium-rare just as she ordered.  It was big and juicy.  She loved it.   Very good.  Her vegetables were steamed, not seasoned, but she said they were good.  The corn on the cob was good.  Not over-cooked.\nI wanted to order dessert, but was too full.\n\nI doesn't get a four or five star because the food is western, which to me is rather plain.  There was nothing outstanding or exotic about the food.  Plus it was a little expensive.  $14.95 seems like a lot to pay for a burger.  Although, it was huge and came with a lot of bread and salad...\n\nOverall we had a great experience.  When we left there was a cowboy roping metal calves on the patio, and the band was singing pleasant country music.  I would definitely go back.", "business_id": "wZwZcte4lcbu51NOzCjWbQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-06-23", "type": "review"}

It took forever for the food to arrive. They brought out some salad and Indian fry bread and biscuits while we waited. They topping for the breads were margarine or cinnamon margarine. Sorry, but at these prices I expect butter. The salad was ok. It was drenched in ranch dressing over what looked liked that bagged salad you but at the grocery store with a could shreds if carrot and cabbage in it. The goulash was topped with a lot of croutons. A LOT! The flavor was fine but I recommend dressing on the side. \n\nOur tables order included the vaquero with was sirloin with enchiladas. The sirloin was ordered medium well but it was cooked to the point if being leathery. The enchiladas might have been \"ok\" (not good) but were sitting on too of a plate full of baked beans, as were the corn on the cob and steak. All the flavors congealed into each other. Yuck!\n\nThe filet mignon was also cooked until they were sure it was dead, really dead! They insisted there was pink in it but we couldn't see it. They offered to being us each another steak but since it took 30 minutes to get the first one, we were done. \n\nThey did bring free apple pie with ice cream to make it up to us. It was huge and decent but wouldn't crave it. \n\nIf friends from out of state visit, I would bring them here but only order appetizers (snake and cactus for the adventurous) or dessert.

I made reservation on Thursday for Saturday night and 630pm and 8pm were available times, I took the 8pm, but then called back 5 minutes later to change to the 630pm time slot, gal on phone said no problem. My husband, son and I arrived just before 630pm and our name was not on the list. Hostess said it must not have came up from downstairs yet. We were given a buzzer to wait until a table was ready. Once the buzzer went off and they walked us to our table, which was a booth I said my reservation specified a table, not booth, which when we were not on the list 20 minutes ago stupid me should have men-tioned that AGAIN. So we were given another buzzer and 30 minutes to wait. At this point, offering a drink or dessert would have been thoughtful. Plus the fact that we had flowers and pre-sents should have been a clue that this was a special occasion. \nBuzzer went off again and we were walked towards some tables which were all filled and then returned back to the waiting area for another 2-5 minutes then finally taken to a table on the other side. \nWe order appetizers, which were pleasing.

She chose RR because she saw that they had the slide.  I called to see if they would accept a reservation and the only opening they had was at 8:30PM or show up with a 45 minute wait.  I decided to go ahead and show up and wait and hoping it wouldn't be that long.  When we drove up, I thought it was going to be a very long wait as the main parking lot was full and we had to drive to the additional parking.  When we walked up to the hostess desk a little after 7PM, they said it would be a 30 minute wait.  We decided to check out the place and my daughter wanted to do the slide.  She pretty much just went up and down on the slide until our buzzer rang, which was less than 30 minutes.  We got a table right by the windows, so it was a nice view.  It seemed like a bit before someone came with water and even longer before we saw our waitress.   \n\nI ordered the bbq chicken and my daughter ordered the spaghetti.  As we waited, they provided a nice hot basket of fried bread and biscuits.  The fried bread was good with honey, but not the usual fry bread I'm accustomed to since it was doughier.  My daughter liked the fry bread (because of the honey), the biscuit not so much.  One of the two balloon artists came by and she got a flower as we waited.\n\nOur dinner didn't seem to take too long to make despite it being very busy.  They first brought out the salad, which had a ranch dressing.  Soon afterwards, our dinners came.  The kid's spaghetti came with two garlic bread pieces and a lot of spaghetti.  My bbq chicken came with steamed veggies, corn, and beans.  As far as the food, my daughter said that we make better spaghetti at home.  My chicken was dry and the bbq sauce was ok.  On the bright said, my daughter really liked the corn.  The veggies had way too much pepper.  The beans had some spice to them, but were just okay.  We had plenty of leftovers to take home.  The best part of dinner was yet to come though.  When they brought out the cotton candy, my daughter gobbled it up.  I had a few bites and I must say, the cotton candy tasted very fresh and probably was the best cotton candy I've had.  It had a very nice bubble gum favor.  My daughter probably could have gobbled up another one.\n\nWhen we got the bill, I was pleasantly surprised.  RR must have a special where you buy an adult entr\u00e9e and you get a kids meal free.  Not sure if that is an offer they have all the time or just certain days.\n\nDid I mention this is a very family friendly place?  There were a lot of families and kids at RR on Saturday.  The line at times for the slide was long.  My daughter enjoyed going on the slide so much before dinner that I let her go on the slide again after dinner.  She did this for about 20 minutes and before I told her it was time to go.  She probably could have slid on it for another 30 minutes if I let her.\n\nOverall, I would give the RR two stars for the food and one additional star for the ambience.  The most memorable part of the evening for my daughter was the slide and the cotton candy, which I would agree.", "business_id": "wZwZcte4lcbu51NOzCjWbQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-07-02", "type": "review"}

It was an occasion that conjured up the entire waitstaff, as they clapped their hands (and probably rolled their eyes), sang happy birthday, and delivered me a massive dessert adorned by a tiny glowing birthday candle. \n\nMy twins just turned 5 and I wanted them to also have that delightful moment of abundant attention and sugar.  So, I started to look for places that would sing happy birthday.  Apparently, this is yet another thing to file in the \"good old days\" category.  Supposedly My Big Fat Greek Restaurant sings happy birthday in Greek...which sounds interesting, unless you are a 5 year old.\n\nRustler's Rooste was suggested and it is true - they do sing happy birthday!  However, for a $15 price  tag.  \n\nBut!  You also get a cowboy hat.\n\nI have to give them props for keeping the birthday spirit alive and well, even if it is no longer free.  The candle-lit dessert that arrives is enough to feed 3-4 people.  It is a football-sized eclair, oozing with whipped cream (my favorite food), and drizzled with chocolate (my second favorite food).\n\nAs for the rest of the food....it is okay.  The meal starts with complimentary bread and butter and salad (ice berg lettuce, cucumber, a few cherry tomatoes and croutons).  I do appreciate getting food immediately, even if it is mostly iceberg lettuce and chewy bread.\n\nFor the meal, I had the \"catch of the day\" which was ahi tuna.  It was well seasoned, but it could have been more pink.  I will say the exact same thing about my husband's steak.  The kids-meal portion of macaroni & cheese was terrifyingly huge; I think it was the largest portion size among the entire table.  I was relieved I opted to get steamed broccoli instead of french fries that came on the side.  \n\nBut this may just not be the place you go for a fine-dining experience.  It is a place you go for a fun-dining experience.  There is a slide that all the kids love...and maybe some adults (*cough*) enjoy it as well.  There is also a big cow  that greets you at the entrance.  Does it emit a smell that I want to smell right before eating? \n\nProbably not.  But I will give it a few points for having such large, curly horns.", "business_id": "wZwZcte4lcbu51NOzCjWbQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-08-03", "type": "review"}

Sadly, it's a shadow of its former self. Sure, the place still has terrific views but that's it.  The tables and chairs are rickety and aren't cleaned often, as using my hand to pull my own chair in found at least two used pieces of gum affixed to the underside.  \n\nMy wife and I quickly ordered macaroni and cheese for our two year old son while we looked over our menu options.  The mac and cheese arrived within two minutes - clearly it's made en masse - but was overcooked and lacked any discernible flavor.  This should have been all the warning we needed, but instead we forged ahead and ordered the \"Cowboy Stuff\" platter for two.  At $21.95 per person it seemed like a good value for all it promised; BBQ chicken and ribs, skewers of beef, chicken, and seafood, baked potatoes, corn, the works.  What was delivered was a baking sheet with all the aforementioned food loaded onto it, but with whole carrots with the green stems still on, celery stalks with leaves on it, and so on.  It looked like someone had been foraging in the woods for our dinner.   It was accompanied by a very forgettable salad that had tons of dressing, yet lacked flavor of any kind.  \n\nThen came the taste test of our main course.  The name of this restaurant really should be \"Overcooked and Flavorless\" because the trend started with our son's unfortunate kid's meal was consistent across the entire meal.  \n\nMy son needed to use the restroom, so we headed off in that direction.  The baby changing station isn't even in the bathroom, but affixed to a wall out in the hall for all to see.  Walking into the bathroom, we took one look at the dirty, dank surroundings and immediately headed the other direction.  We'll wait, thanks.  \n\nGetting back to the table and trying my food, I decided to ask for the manager to voice my concerns.  Unbeknownst to me, my wife had already spoken with him.  When he arrived, he seemed exasperated and told me, \"I already told her I'd replace the meal with something else and she said no.  What else do you want?\"   Um, well NOTHING now, pal.

To ensure a table, I called Thursday and made a reservation with a resounding \"Sure thing!\" from the girl on the other end. After arriving and giving them my name, however, they said it would be about 45 minutes until we'd be seated, and that they \"don't do reservations.\" Apparently, it's more of a waiting list, so whoever took my \"reservation\" probably should've said something.\n\nA bit miffed, we sat in the bar area being bombarded with a deafening roar of country music. I had to yell to the server that I wanted a Blue Moon, and she said they don't serve it. (Really? It's a full bar; at least get bottles.) About 7 minutes after getting my sad replacement, our buzzer luckily jumped to life and we were off. Evidently, my unintentionally blurted-out comment of \"WITH a reservation?\" to the hostess after she told me the 45-minute wait-time suddenly made the line much shorter.\n\nOn our way down to the table, we kept bumping into kids who were literally running up and down the staircases and crashing into the hostess leading us. (The look on her face was priceless!) Apparently, people just let their kids run rampant through the restaurant and nobody tells them not to, and that's just normal -- you've been warned.\n\nWe were relieved to find that our table was along the edge of the restaurant, right next to the windows overlooking the valley. It was a bit quieter over here and the view was great, but then we realized our server hadn't seen us and it had already been 8 minutes or so. Isn't the target goal to make contact within 2 minutes or less as wait-staff?\n\nShe seemed overworked and was taking quite awhile to come back and take our order/check on us throughout the night. She was still polite, though.\n\nWe had a coupon from their email club for a free-ish appetizer, so we chose hot wings. Some random dude brought them out to us and couldn't tell us which were hot and which were mild. As it turned out, 10 of them were hot and 2 were mild; go figure. They were okay; nothing to die for and I definitely wouldn't pay $10 for them.\n\nThe salad was dismal. It was pre-bagged iceberg mix with some sliced cucumber, cherry tomatoes, and fresh-from-the-box croutons. I tasted zero dressing whatsoever and wound up using the leftover ranch from the wings. The biscuits were a bit dry and needed butter desperately. The frybread was actually tasty, but the cinnamon-butter it came with was really unexpected, and the flavor combination with my meal once it came was awful.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9e and I both ordered the prime rib. The prime rib itself was decent (again, like the wings) but I've had much better for less money. It was tender but definitely past medium, which I ordered. It was pretty dry, too. There was no juice even puddled under the cut. Any true fan of prime rib sees this as a warning flag. Sides of seasonal veggies were blah; overcooked and needed salt and pepper. Their tacky, little pot of ranch beans just tasted like hot ketchup and brown sugar. We barely even touched them. Corn on the cob was waaayyy over-boiled. Pro-tip: Fresh corn on the cob only needs to be boiled about 3 minutes. Any more and you're killing it.\n\nPortion sizes were huge, but I would've much rather had less food and actually enjoyed it thoroughly. Large portions at average quality make me kinda feel like I'm being bought off as a customer. The worst part about that is they're still charging you a lot of money for the average quality you get.\n\nWith children running by us every 2 minutes and jumping all around the booths without anyone telling them not to, we got fed up by the end of our meal and had enough. Check took awhile to get to us, but again, our server was polite and apologized. I get the feeling either their management needs to be more proactive or someone didn't show up for work that night.\n\nPROS:\n- awesome, valley-wide views\n- live country music with dance floor\n- seems like a great happy hour place\n- polite server\n\nCONS:\n- no reservations and is absolutely PACKED on weekends; be warned\n- average food at steakhouse prices\n- big portions of food you won't fully enjoy\n- kids (like, not one family's, but a ton) running around everywhere like they own the place\n\nBOTTOM LINE:\n\nFeels really touristy and tacky and forced. Another restaurant pretending to be a casual steakhouse but sacrificing quality food for a family-restaurant atmosphere. Might try it again on a weeknight, but I'm not exactly dying to go back.", "business_id": "wZwZcte4lcbu51NOzCjWbQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-08-06", "type": "review"}

The bartenders were very friendly and told us that there was full service at the bar, but we opted to wait for a table. \nThe atmosphere is just like a Texas roadhouse, or kind of like Lone Star. They serve peanuts, and encourage you to toss the shells onto the floor. \n\nSo after about a 35min wait, we were seated.

All the food was really good, my brother wished he had only gotten steak. The chicken was good he said, but liked his steak a lot better. The night we went, seemed like it was everyones birthday.

Unfortunately that is where the similarities ended. \nI came here on a Wednesday night with a friend. so it was relatively quiet. We were sat right away so we were off to a good start. It took our waiter about 15 minutes to get bread and water to us and take our drink orders.\n\n We were a bit confused but we gave the benefit of the doubt and thought maybe there was something going on in the back of the house. After bringing us bread and our drinks we ordered appetizers. The appetizers took 20 minutes to get to us. If it was super busy I would have understand. After the appetizers being brought by a separate staff member we asked for our server so we could order. \nAfter about 5 minutes we started looking around trying to locate him. He was standing at the bar watching a baseball game. \nA little annoyed we waited for the middle of the inning and he came over. I ordered some ribs and chicken. When they arrived, the Rib's were good, chicken was cooked nicely. Green beans were my side and they were stone cold. I asked them to be reheated or sent back and get new ones, whichever is easiest. They arrived as the check arrived, still cold.\nI was beyond annoyed and just all around fed up.\n\nI will not be coming back to Texas Roadhouse.", "business_id": "Mm8x_jzeLrWlvDEnqhuCBQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-07-06", "type": "review"}

I reviewed their menu before going there, and ordered based on some of the feedback I read. \n\nI had called ahead in order to minimize my wait time for a table, and when I arrived, there were lots of people waiting to be seated. I was glad I had called. When I checked in, they said it would be about 10 minutes to be seated, so I decided to eat at the bar, which had plenty of room. I requested a class of club soda, and she brought it right away. I didn't realize she would ring it up as a sprite and charge me for it. I couldn't tell you the last time I was charged for club soda other than when in San Francisco. If I'd know, I would have just had water.\n\nThe bartender got back to me relatively quickly to take my order, especially given that she was serving the bar and several tables too. I ordered the 14 oz. Ft. Worth Rib Eye medium rare with saut\u00e9ed mushrooms on the side, a side of corn, and a side of green beans. The bartender immediately brought me a basket of their rolls with cinnamon butter. The rolls were piping hot, and great with the cinnamon butter, but I was saving myself for my entr\u00e9e so I stopped after sampling them.\n\nMy dinner came out fairly quickly, and luckily the bartender came over almost immediately to ask me how my food was. It was a good thing. They had served the steak smothered with the saut\u00e9ed mushrooms rather than providing them on the side, and my steak was cooked medium well - way to done for me. I had thought I would be ok, because I had ordered according to their menu description of \"doneness levels\". I showed her where I had cut into the middle of my steak, and she agreed that it was way too done. She said she would take care of it and took it back to the kitchen. A short time later the service manager brought me a fresh dinner, with a medium rare steak (I checked it while the bartender watched), and the mushrooms in a dish on the side. The service manager indicated that she had made sure because they want their customers to be satisfied.\n\nFor the price, I can't complain about the steak, only that it didn't come out correct the first time, but it was on the salty side. Luckily, the mushrooms weren't salty at all, so they balanced each bite of my steak. It was a little on the tough side, but tasty, and I was hungry.\n\nAfter a few bites of steak, I tried my sides of corn and green beans. The green beans I simply didn't like. There was some sort of tough meat in them that I don't think was bacon, but didn't recognize. They were also too salty to eat. I tried the corn, but it also was too salty to eat, and drowned in something that didn't taste like real butter to me. It was just salty corn in salty oily liquid. Of my entire meal, only my steak and saut\u00e9ed mushrooms were edible. The steak wasn't good enough to earn a good rating for this overall experience.\n\nAfter I ordered, my tab had been placed in a glass in front of me. When I was finished eating, I put my credit card in the glass and turned it so the bartender would see it. I probably sat there for 10 minutes before she noticed, and I could not get her attention because she was very busy at tables. It wasn't a problem because I wasn't in a hurry, and was reading a good book. She didn't even question that my side dishes were uneaten, and I didn't feel like complaining any more. I was just ready to go.\n\nAs I drove home after eating, one review I had read lodged in my thoughts. It was a poor rating from a diner who had been there several times and had hit and miss experiences. They said that when it was good, it was great, and when it was not it was terrible.\n\nAs I continued to think about the ratings I had read, there had been several about the how salty the food sometimes was. I guess I went on one of the days that the cook was heavy handed with the salt.\n\nMy experience wasn't terrible, but I think I went when the kitchen was having a bad day. It's too long a drive from my home to go back again. I would not recommend The Texas Roadhouse to friends.", "business_id": "Mm8x_jzeLrWlvDEnqhuCBQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-07-15", "type": "review"}

The service that was once so amazing, sucked. Our waitress had us wait over 10 minutes from getting our drinks to when she came back for our food order. I ordered a side salad with my meal and that, which in the past would come out within less than 5 minutes, took close to 15 minutes. When I asked the waitress if it was coming soon, she said yes it should be right up. Thing is, the servers make the salads themselves so she clearly just forgot. When our food finally came out, my sons chicken tenders were drowning in grease. I had to pat them down and wipe down his plate with a napkin and that wasn't even enough. My chicken sandwich, which is normally delicious, had very little flavor. The so-called smoked chicken on it tasted boiled. It had no flavor, when in the past, it's been delicious. My husband said the meat on his reuben was dry and hard and it looked like it. It resembled jerky. When the check FINALLY came, I noticed the waitress had charged us for my son's drink which should have been included in the cost of the meal. We were in a hurry by this time so I didn't want to ask her to remove it from the bill and be gone another 10-15 minutes so I just paid for it so we could leave. So a kids meal that my son didn't touch ended up costing $10.75. Ridiculous. I really didn't want to tip at all but I can't stand being an a-hole so I tipped low.

Unfortunately, this one is closest to my home and I had a one star meal yesterday 07/25/14.  Let me say, that I usually go here with a crowd. Yesterday, I had lunch, just me, after a business meeting...I took myself out. Was starving, in a great mood, and wanted Steak and Lobster. \n\nI sat in a bar booth. My waiter was an older woman with short white hair who tried to rush me, was prickly and EXTREMELY unfriendly and in a big rush. I was her only table and she was walking away while she asked what do I want to drink. She never brought my water  She threw my salad in the bowl to serve it to me. Everyone else (in other sections with different wait staff)  received normal looking salads, but whatever. I asked for dressing on the side..and it came on top.  The AWFUL waitress surely was responsible. \n\nIt took 1/2 hour to get my meal after I noticed waiting after I just pecked at that boring salad. Then a table of three men came in and she was sweet to them, friendly and said \"thank you\" Worst wait staff experience. I only left a tip because I know bus people need it. too. \n\nSo the FOOD was only acceptable and NOT normal yummy-like Outback.  The steak was cooked properly, but tough and nowhere NEAR the flavorful steaks this chain really puts out.  The very small  lobster tail (I ordered steamed) was about  30 seconds under-cooked, but I ate it and it was tasty.  I had asked my waiter for my potato dressings on the side, but alas it was on top already, again what would she care?\n\nSo all this for my \"atta-girl-treat yourself  special lunch for $35. Previously,about 3 months ago I was there and  they had to re-fire my steak TWICE to get it to medium-rare.  However, the staff has always been -except for this little lunch of mine--usually very nice.  I mean why else would I stop in if I wasn't usually comfy there.  After the last few meals, just in the \"meh-had better\" range, considering the price, and now the hiring of a nasty white haired witch server?    I'm done with this location.

When I talked to the manager about the lack of quality he suggested that the prime rib isn't cooked to order as it is sliced \"fresh\" in the morning then reheated on the grill when ordered which makes it tough and overcooked.

The kiddos each order the mac and cheese (Kraft, out of the box, $6, reallY!?!)\n\nThe zucchini appetizer was decent enough - even the kids ate a piece each - and plenty to share.\n\nThe steaks sucked - I've had better steak from room service that cost the same.  Rather dry, not very well seasoned - the only thing going for them was that I was hungry!\n\nAs a token of good faith - the waiter offered up a second desert for free in lieu of my birthday email offer - let's see - a $5 desert in place of a $25 meal - nice try - FAIL!\n\nSo it became obvious after the fact that there was a reason this place was a ghostown - regardless of the Sunday night or not - We will not be returning to Stuart Anderson's - probably ever.", "business_id": "OjNTZTZ6HYQghJN-3jmwnA", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-06-16", "type": "review"}

My friend and I really liked it . We shared the dinner for two. Our appetizer of choice was the zucchini. It's battered in a light Panco breadcrumb. The crispness and crunch was great and I LOVE the fact that it was not a greasy soggy mess. It is served with a fresh, light cucumber sauce which complements the veggie very well.\n\nI had the filet with blue cheese and chose garlic mashed potatoes along with green beans. The filet was cooked just as I ordered. The steak was melt in your mouth tender. The potatoes were fresh with small chunks and lots of garlic. The green beans are crisp. My guess is the chef blanches them, ice water bathes them. They are kissed on the grill for flavor just before serving. Just perfect!\n\nMy guest had the New York with green beans and onion rings and was equally pleased!  The dessert was a shared piece of chocolate cake. The cake was moist and very rich. \n\nThe decor was a little dated and could use a modern twist! The bar was beautiful and had many customers. I liked the booth height. It kept the noise down and made it private.\n\nOur server was Shannon. Our drinks were NEVER empty. She was pleasant and knew the menu well. She made our first experience a great one!

But when compared to others (Outback comes to mind) it amazes me that there aren't more of them (BAS)  or more to the point that the chain has not done well over the years.\n\nFirst, I've figured out where a lot of these culinary school grads go when they can't get a job elsewhere.\n\nAs a result of actual culinary school trained chefs/cooks showing up at places like BSA the quality of food is quite good.\n\nHad the fried zucchini with their cucumber ranch (or whatever they call it).  Very good.  The zucchini is lightly breaded and fried.  Is not greasy at all and the cucumber ranch is reallllyyyy good.\n\nNext up, wedge salad.  As always, one salad is enough for two to share, so don't waste one of your two sides getting another salad if you go the wedge route.\n\nOrdered the grilled corn and asparagus.  Both fresh and very good.  Some complaint/observation as before on the asparagus.  The cooks don't always do the best job of trimming off the ends.  I'm not going to get into how to do it properly, but if you want to know how it should be done, you can google it.\n\nFinally, on to the dead animal.  I had the new york strip  I thought it was pretty good.  The wife had the prime rib .  Good again.\n\nValue wise their dead on...especially if you have a coupon.

The waitress was friendly and had just the right balance of not hovering but never leaving us alone more than 10 minutes at a time. The food was delivered promptly.

My husband devoured the excellent bread that they provide at every table.  The drink refills appeared just as we needed them. The manager came by to check on every table and took away our dishes for us when we were done.

Right off the bat I noticed the atmosphere was pretty nice, nothing over the top, but enjoyable.  I also noticed that the wait staff knew their shit.  Our waitress explained all the specials and recommended her favorites without hesitation.  The real highlight was before our food came when the manager came over and asked us if it was our first time.  He then brought us a shrimp cocktail on the house to kick off our meal.  \n\nThe second visit was for a friend's birthday.  We ordered a round of chocolate cake shots and the manager showed up to mix them himself and bought us our first round.  He also gave us each recipes to take home with us. \n\nThe food on both occasions was great, I haven't had a good cut of meat like it since I left the midwest.

By the time our steaks arrived after sending them back twice, we were no longer hungry after finishing the baked potato and salad and we were running out of patience. They went good for it and reduced our bill which was nice.\nThis last time my wife's steak came out very rare and as timing would have it,  it was the manager who checked on us just as she was first cutting into it. He took it back and again my wife worked on the baked potato and had no room left for the steak. The waitress also failed to bring out a wedge salad for one of the other guests in our party. She returned with our meals so getting a salad at that point seemed a waste. It also took some time before our drinks arrived as well.\n\nThe management again took my wifes steak off the bill and offered our two other guests a dessert for the salad mistake.

They are less expensive than Durant's/Fleming's but more expensive than Outback/Texas Roadhouse. Likewise their steaks are less tasty than Durant's/Fleming's but more expensive than Outback/Texas Roadhouse.\n\nWith that said, each of the aforementioned places has their positives and negatives. Durants is really pricey but they very well may have the best steak in town to go along with their interesting atmosphere. You can cowboy it up at Texas Roadhouse where throwing peanut shells on the floor is allowed/encouraged. Fleming's is that classy place where you have a whole slew of wines to chose from to have with your supper.\n\nSo to take it all in and get the happy medium I think that is The Keg. The steaks are really good there. I would put them on par with Fleming's but obviously not as expensive. Neither myself or the girlfriend has had a complaint about the steak there. The price isn't too hateful there either. And the atmosphere can be as good or better than Fleming's depending where you are. The only thing Fleming's is going to have over the Keg in service is that at the Keg you will have one server that handles everything. Versus Fleming's where you very well may have three servers - one for drinks, one for orders, and one for food (you may not, but I've had special people come and only pour wine, etc). Fleming's isn't quite at the Delmonico's level (Vegas) as far as service.\n\nReally, for the money I think the Keg is the best. Food is great as is service.

There were probably only a few other people near us so it was mostly quiet, which I definitely appreciated. Only real pet peeve with this place is that is is so dark! I understand wanting to keep the atmosphere a certain way but if I can barely see the person sitting across from me it isn't working for me.\nAnyways, the food. My boyfriend and I each ordered a wedge salad, I had the Prime Rib and King Crab legs combo, and he got a NY Classic. The salad was crisp and nicely chilled, but the only issue was that when they had rinsed the lettuce they hadn't drained it very well and there was a lot of water in the inner layers for both of them. My boyfriend's steak was cooked to perfection and he definitely enjoyed it along with the super creamy mashed potatoes that came with it. My Prime rib was so tender it basically melted in my mouth.

It's that with stuff that seems to have some type of canola oil added to it. The texture of the bread was nice but it's not sourdough and really didn't have much flavor. \n\nI asked for with a salad with dressing on the side it came on the top. They fixed it but again attention to detail when I'm spending $28 for meal is important. \n\nThey made my fianc\u00e9 old-fashioned incorrectly.   They were able to fix it but it still didn't taste right. I think they added simple syrup. It  had a strange sweet flavor to it. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 did enjoy his meal they cooked a steak the way he wanted it and they left off the butter on his vegetables because he has a dairy allergy so that was good. \n\nMy steak however was well done and I did not ask for it well done. The flavoring and seasoning was good though. \n\nAgain for the amount of money we paid for that meal it definitely was not worth it. In my opinion the keg is just another one of those chain restaurants that charges a lot of money pretending to be a fancy restaurant and it's just average.

I had the steak sandwich (another bar special), which was terrific. If you are a wine drinker, don't go to Fleming's if you are thirsty. The amount of wine they serve (a friend ordered a glass of Merlot) for $6 is ridiculous. They bring a huge glass for the wine, and a little carafe of wine, barely enough to wet the inside of the glass. Stick with the mixed drinks or beer.

The atmosphere was nice but my husband and I were not happy with the food at all. The bread they gave pre-meal was just ok but didn't seem very fresh. There were two types of butter that came along with the bread and both were actually pretty good. I ordered the lobster bisque to start and honestly, the flavor was a bit odd. I personally think the lobster bisque at Red Lobster is better not to mention cheaper. For dinner, I ordered the seared scallops that came on top of puff pastry and a measly portion of vegetables. The scallops were gritty and seemed like they had not been cleaned properly as I could taste granules of sand. My husband ordered the ribeye since Flemings is supposed to be known for their steak. He said that the steak was not seasoned at all. For sides, we ordered the Flemings potatoes which were really good and the baked potato which was fine, but honestly, how hard is it to mess up baked potato? When the check was presented they also gave me a box of chocolate truffles since it was my birthday. I wont lie, these were amazing!!! Unfortunately, the truffles, Flemings potatoes, and butter will not make me come back. I am all about giving places several tries before deciding to go back but not a place with a huge price tag such as Flemings.

I left extremely disappointed with both. The restaurant itself was nice. I love low lit, intimate settings and design-wise the decor was well conceived. The ambiance was cheapened however by the level of noise, which was comparable to a mess hall and overrode any pleasure instilled by the eye. Our server Mickey was great, no complaints there. I ordered the Prime Rib-eye, bone-in. The two gentlemen who brought our food out rushed through their delivery so quickly that any presumed warning that was issued about the plates being hot was not heard. Probably also in part due to the high decibel volume. Consequently I burned my fingers, which didn't lend to the evening. I advised Mickey it might have been better for them to get everyone's attention first, before slipping in the hot plate advisory and misplacing orders on the table. She apparently mentioned this to the manager who came to our table with all the grace of Al Capone, strong-arming us into confessing that all was right with our meal. At this point I was ready to put all these previous distractions behind me and dig into a really great steak. Instead I discovered one of the toughest and poorest cuts of meat I have ever had. I ordered it medium-rare. It came nearer to medium-well. There was also no marbling and the pale greenish color was also an indication that in spite of the wet aging process, this was not a corn fed cow - which will produce a deep red burgundy color even when well cooked. My suggestion; if you want a great dining experience and a truly excellent Rib-eye spend your next Benjamin at the Ruth's Chris in Park City, UT.", "business_id": "0ONypOKIhttBz9IJzBE8jg", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-06-16", "type": "review"}

Since you can only take advantage of the happy hour specials in the bar it becomes a regular mob scene by 5:00. Management needs to seriously rethink the logistics on this. They're sending a lot of potential customers next door to Roy's and the Sandbar due to poor planning. \n\nAll in all a very good experience.

And even though the beer options are limited, their wine list is fantastic. They have a huge selection, at many different price points. Pretty cool that they also give you an ipad to look it all over.\n\nEven though this place is a chain, it's worth a visit if you are in the mood for a great steak. It definitely beats out the other options like The Keg and Ruth Chris. Get on their email list and you'll get the advertisements for when they do special stuff like give you a free gift cards when you spend a certain amount on dinner. They also sometimes do seasonal pre-fixe meals. Right now they also have a small plate special that will help keep the bill reasonable.

It also cost Eleven Dollars, so one would hope to get one's money's worth with a half dozen asparagus stalks.

Fleming's is a great date night or special occasion place with friends.\n\nI typically get the petite filet with the 3oz add-on shelled lobster tail.  The filet is always cooked to perfection and extremely tasty.  The lobster looks small when it is served but is always the right amount for me.  We almost always get a few sides and last night was no different.  We had our standard creamed spinach (my fav), Fleming's potatoes and creamed corn (I wasn't a huge fan of the creamed corn as it was a little spicy and that's not my thing).

Lucky me, my bf is in town for work so I can FINALLY take him to this place that I have been raving out (see Nashville review for more details on the menu).\r\n\r\nThey give you two cheese dips here with sliced cracker/bread and celery sticks. One of them being a gorgonzola cranberry spread. DELICIOUS.\r\n\r\nWe ordered:\r\n\r\nTENDERLOIN CARPACCIO - Although I remember it being tastier in the Nashville chain, this is still very good and better than any I have had in California thus far.\r\n\r\nSEARED AHI TUNA - love it! This restaurant (not Japanese sushi joints) is why I am so hooked on tuna. Ironic isn't it? My bf loves this too.\r\n\r\nBEEF FLEMINGTON filet wrapped in puff pastry with a mushroom duxelle, madeira sauce - This is by far my FAVORITE MEAT dish EVER! They cook it to perfection (remember I am a medium-rare girl), and it simply MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH. The combination of the tender filet and the buttery pastry is HEAVEN in your mouth. My bf LOVED this too and felt it was an exceptional dish. Ratings for this are up there with Nobu.\r\n \r\nSEARED SCALLOPS lobster cream sauce with a puff pastry of sauted fresh vegetables - My bf thought this was very good but not as good as the Beef Flemington. We had the ultimate BEST SEARED SCALLOPS in Paris (at an average restaurant too), so it would be hard to have something that is up to par with that. Still a nice tasty dish. I love those puff pastries.\r\n\r\nCHOCOLATE LAVA CAKE - This is the second best lava cake next to the Culinary Institute of America in Napa. HEAVENLY, FRESH, RIGHT OUT OF THE OVEN. Delicious! And they don't cheat at this one. No hole on the bottom of the cake to put the filling in! I love bittersweet chocolate. Ummmm.\r\n\r\nThe wine selection is great. They recommended a smooth Italian red wine for us (I think it was a sirah). The service is great. Despite how large the restaurant is, the high quality of their dishes remain the same.

I cannot come here without a group because after eating my steak, potatoes, (oh and great apps too, try the seafood tower, it is really tall), and drinks I don't have enough room to eat a whole dessert, let alone two because that is what I am going to order.  Yes I cannot make up my mind between Chocolate Lava Cake and Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e so I do what I do best and get both (to share of course).  They are so good and together they compliment each other perfectly.  The Lava Cake is so chocolaty that I could go into a coma and the top of the Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e cracks perfectly under my spoon.  I think I am diabetic now.\n\nIn all, this place is amazing, pricey but well worth it.  True you can come not dressed up but I like to make an occasion out of it.  You can find me in a cocktail dress with the chipmunk cheeks stuffed with food.\n\nPS do yourself a favor and think about making a reservation, comes in handy.", "business_id": "9AbyBqGWHYZC73GlyAuTrQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-07-24", "type": "review"}

No sides come with the meat at all. My steak was close to $30 alone. For a place that bills itself as a wine bar, I was disappointed with the by-the-glass choices.

I ordered a side of mashed potatoes (9.00) for a quarter of a cup of potatoes. I have to admit they were DELICIOUS! but not $9.00 for a quarter of a cup delicious.

Word to the wise, you want the waiters to recognize you, wear expensive suits and bring some ladies, you will be treated like a King.\n\nNeedless to say, this establishment will never get my business again.", "business_id": "9AbyBqGWHYZC73GlyAuTrQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-08-09", "type": "review"}

Flemings didn't let me down. I walked in and sat at the bar. They brought me some fresh kettle chips which were awesome. The sourdough bread with the sun dried tomato spread and some sort of Gorgonzola spread were amazing. I went with the wedge for a salad. It was huge! Presentation was great, it had a full piece of bacon and a block of blue cheese. For the main course I decided to go with the Filet and flight special. I had the filet with the peppercorns and then Oscar styled. The steak was cooked to perfection, so perfect I almost didn't even need a knife. I left very full and happy. I absolutely recommend!", "business_id": "9AbyBqGWHYZC73GlyAuTrQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-06-01", "type": "review"}

Simply stated, the experience was outstanding.  Our waiter, Jose, was friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable, but not an overbearing presence.  The rest of the wait service was also very good.  The food was cooked to perfection.  The Strip steak that I had was one of the best, if not the best, I have ever had (and yes, I have eaten at Durant's).  I had mine done medium rare and seared while my son had his Strip steak medium rare and broiled.  My wife had the small Filet done medium rare.  Both stated that their food was equally as good as mine.  \n\nDo not expect a fast paced meal.  One of the pleasures is that it was served at a leisurely pace allowing for the total enjoyment of what was being served.  We had drinks, the entr\u00e9es, and we shared a wonderful fruit and cream dessert and we where there for over 90 minutes.  The environment was subdued and reasonably quiet.  The other guests' conversations did not intrude upon ours.  \n\nAll the employees, from the manager (who came to our table after we had told Jose how much we enjoyed our meal and service) to the greeter who open the door for us were friendly and seemed genuinely pleased that we had decided to visit their establishment.  One of the assistant manager even took my wife's arm and helped her to the restrooms when asked where they were.  Could not have asked for more.", "business_id": "9AbyBqGWHYZC73GlyAuTrQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-06-20", "type": "review"}

Service however needs some work. We came the day before Valentine's Day and were very disappointed with service. When ordering $150 wine, you would hope the server would come by every once in awhile to pour it for you. Or at least check up on you! We never saw her after we ordered. And poured our own wine. I don't even want to imagine her service when it was crowded on Valentine's Day!!!\n\nWe came 2 or 3 weeks later to give it another try. We had a reservation, however it \"wasn't ready\" so we waited 25min...what was the point of a reservation?? Service was a little better, but still not the service you would except and that we usually receive at a prime steakhouse restaurant.\n\nI hate to take away 2 stars for the same reason, but we give it two tries....\n\nAll other Flemings I have been to have had 5 star service, they need to retrain at this location!!!", "business_id": "9AbyBqGWHYZC73GlyAuTrQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-07-16", "type": "review"}
