After trying to match the names with some of the ice creams in the freezers I ultimately went with a single scoop of birthday cake ice cream in a dish.

The walls are lined with glass drug store display cases - now filled with an assortment of glass ware and interesting ice cream parlor related paraphernalia. \n\nI heard about Klavon's first while watching a WQED special on the strip district.  When the special was filmed, the second generation of owners (the son and wife of the founders) had recently passed away. The parlor stayed closed for a few years according to my fiance. \n\nSo when I decided after the hot summer day that scorched Pittsburgh yesterday meant an ice cream run, the fiance immediately had me check the hours for Klavon's. I was greatly surprised to find out that their summer hours go till 9:00pm on Sundays! YAY - we had enough time to get there and enjoy the ice cream.\n\nThe place was packed with I would guess around 20 to 30 people awaiting or enjoying their ice cream.

I'd been meaning to visit Klavon's again since it'd been a year since I'd last visited, so I suggested it, and my friend, who'd never been before, was game.\n\nI usually order a soda or float when I'm here, since this is the only place in PGH I know that makes them.  However, most of the flavors were fruity, and I was in the mood for some chocolate, so I decided to go with a sundae instead.  I ordered a regular sized peanut butter M & M sundae, which the woman serving me (who I assume is the proprietor) described as consisting of two regular sized scoops of ice cream.  It was huge!  The ice cream was vanilla with streaks of peanut butter, and the sundae had warm peanut butter and M & M pieces spooned into it.  The ice cream was very creamy and delicious, and there were no problems with freezer burns this time.  Overall, the sundae was great, if not quite what I was expecting.  Other than the M & M's, it lacked chocolate (I had assumed that the ice cream would be chocolate ice cream with peanut butter swirls), which was disappointing since I was looking for more of a chocolate peanut butter combo.  However, to be fair, this was more of an expectation issue on my part since the description of the sundae didn't say anything about chocolate ice cream or fudge, so I can't blame the proprietor for this.  Word to the wise: If you're seeking more chocolate, you may want to have them add some hot fudge!\n\nMy friend ordered the orange creamsicle ice cream soda, which consisted of vanilla ice cream and orange soda, and she enjoyed it very much. The only thing slightly amiss with it was that when she first started sipping it, the ice cream shifted, causing the soda to fizz up and overflow the mug. Since I'd been wanting to try this flavor, I asked her if I could have a sip and she obliged.  The flavor was very good, and I'd definitely order it when I return.\n\nService was friendly, if a bit slow.  The current owner has done a great job of maintaining the decor, down to the penny candy (I saw it this time!) and phone booths.  The only thing conspicuously missing is the scale, which I assume the original owner's family kept as a personal keepsake--but this is probably a good thing for dieters who'd rather not be reminded of their indulgence (ahem, cough, cough).

With a rich history as a marble topped pharmacy reopened as an ice cream parlor in 1999, it has been supporting good old fashioned trips to the Strip through generations.\n\nIt was swiftly purchased from Mr Klavon in Jun 2013 after the old man had passed away in January and the family sought to sell. I swear that is when I took notice of the location in the post gazette but I had believe it to be last year not 2 years ago. I guess i'm not the only one living in a time capsule. A time capsule find of an old 50's Milkshaker was the spark to create a creamery out of the old pharmacy location in 1999.\n\nIt difficult to sift through the wonderful options of Sundaes, Floats and Sodas so you must find a seat at the Counter. I opted for a Nutty Englishman Soda creation. How have I never has an ice cream soda before? Considering my love for soda water it is the perfect way to simultaneously indulge in cream scoops of ice cream [this one butterscotch] and still lighten it up as a drink. Amazing -- I will never go back. It's set up large so you will be plenty filled by yourself, or to share if you wish. KB had hers as a Sundae that comes in two sizes. Being very full still from lunch, the smaller size was good enough.\n\nThe newest venture is paired with the Penn State Creamery [America's largest college creamery celebrating 150 years] and will not disappoint. Klavon's new owner is a Penn State Alum and is proud to bring in-house creations to our beloved city.\n\nKlavon's is a perfect way to finish a Saturday hot summer stroll or a quick fix if you have a sweet tooth emergency.

The employees inside had no idea that there was an order matching our number. Maybe someone gave our order to another customer. They asked my husband if he wanted to wait for them to make another meal. He requested his money back. But they didn't simply refund his money, he had to WAIT for his money as well, while the manager was going through the register looking for some record of his order. But in the mean time, she was waiting on other customers in the drive up window! There was still no record of our order, so she had to calculate the order over again from what he ordered. It took forever, and finally I decided to leave the car and see if my husband might have been abducted by aliens, but I did see him coming back to the car, no meal in hand. Usually in situations like this, some compensation is made to the customer, either a free meal or at least some coupons. Nothing here.

The chocolate shell on the PBC was nicely chocolaty, especially for that kind of a product, and I appreciated that they didn't skimp on the pecans for the Turtle. We both had smalls, which were QUITE ample. We also got a K9 custard for our dog, which she appeared to enjoy. \n\nI guess I just have a couple of objections that keep this from being a 4-star place. First, I wish they had more flavors, since I don't always want a sundae (but maybe this is characteristic of frozen custard joints and is not a fair criticism). Second, I think it should be served slightly colder so that it doesn't melt as fast when the hot fudge hits it. Third, I felt that it was a bit overpriced for a fast food-style place. This is especially true of the K9 custard, since we're used to getting something more along the lines of a 79-cent kiddie cone for the dog. We'll probably be back, since its in the neighborhood, but this will not be the last frozen dessert purveyor I visit in Madison.", "business_id": "Jb5SB2OXbRW0e7ErGlMK-Q", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-08-19", "type": "review"}

Who knew you could mess up a Blizzard so bad?\n\nFirst of all, the line was out the door.  We assumed that it was just a busy night.  Turns out they were out of multiple items (and did not put a sign up). People were upset and walking out.  Then the family in front of us ordered, but did not pay.  No card, no money left their hand.  What?  So like you are giving out free ice cream and making us wait in line?  \n\nI get up to the counter and ask a question about the ingredients of a Brownie Batter blizzard.  They are like, it is just brownies.  My response: Anything else?  They had to go ask someone.  What?  Seriously?!  So I finally get my answer and order it.  My husband also ordered a blizzard.  He ordered a Turtle Pecan blizzard and received some random peanuts in his blizzard.  We never got a receipt.  When I asked for one, they said they did not have any.  What?!\n\nWe pay and wait.  And wait.  Oh, but while we wait, we get to watch the kitchen person.  He was making a chicken sandwich.  With his LONG ponytail hanging over the grill.  Yum?  More like gross.  Then both my husband and I notice that he grabbed a raw chicken breast (while not wearing a glove) and placed it on the bare counter.  He then wiped his hand on his pants.  What?  Salmonella much?  Any food standards?\n\nWe get our medium blizzards.  The ice cream normally extends to the top or slightly over the top of the cup.  This time the ice cream barely made it to the top of my cup. My husband had ice cream under the cup.  When we asked if this was a medium, they said yes.

Really enjoy their service whether it's drive thru or dine in. The staff, while typically high schoolers, are very nice. \n\nSome things to note:\n\n1. Pop (aka soda) is typically flat regardless of what kind you get\n2. Drive thru on Fridays is ridiculously long. You cannot even get into the parking lot and resort to parking across the street a the Associate Bank.\n3. They Walleye Dinner is seasonal but is also their 2nd best item on the menu. 3rd would be their chicken tenders which are 100% white meat and VERY fulfilling\n4. Pricey. You can easily spend $20 for two people.\n5. Flavor of the day typically sucks. Sorry. It's rare that I pass by and see a flavor I want to stop and order\n6. Wish they would send out more coupons.

A taste of heaven in a cup, they need to rename this place \"Heavenly Custard Cup.\" I used to think DQ had the best blizzards (i.e., tropical and Hawaiian) but the custard component did it for me in the form of \"snowstorms\", thus The Custard Cup has moved up on my list. I don't remember the name of the flavor I ordered but it had fruit and nuts and was absolutely positively amazing.\nI would recommend sharing only if it's not your first time because this stuff can be extremely heavy on smaller digestive systems. I was full after about 5-6 tablespoonfuls of the size small snowstorm, then felt nauseous after but that didn't stop me, I kept on eating bc it was sooo good but then still couldn't finish. \n\nI do wish they had written descriptions somewhere of each flavor bc I felt bad having to ask the worker to describe every other flavor on their never ending list. Like \"moonlight\", \"star dusk\", wtf, I don't remember exactly but just weird names that don't give a clue.

I'd actually driven past here on a previous occasion while in the Champaign area, but did not stop by. I did some research for dessert options in the area, and Jarling's seemed to be very popular.\n\nGoing to Jarling's, I knew I wanted to get a snowstorm (similar to Culver's concrete mixer, DQ's blizzard). I also wanted to try their famous 'cold fudge,' which is hot fudge, but it's cold, and does not melt the custard (explanation given to me by a girl working there).\n\nAnyways, I decided to go with the Tortoise snowstorm. At first, the girl gave me the tortoise sundae, which i should have started eating, but I gave it back instead. I guess she was confused because I asked what cold fudge was, and cold fudge usually comes on the sundaes, but whatever. It was quickly corrected to a Tortoise snow storm. I also ordered  a teddy cup of the cake batter ice cream. A teddy cup at Jarling's is a dip (equvalent to a scoop) with 6 teddy grahams and a cherry. A dip would have been 1.75, but the T cup was 2.25. Not really worth it in my opinion.\n\nI was a bit confused by my snowstorm, to be honest. It said it was vanilla custard, although it came out looking like chocolate. The tortoise is supposed to feature cold fudge, almonds, and butterscotch. When the incorrect tortoise sundae was brought out, it was vanilla custard with a fudge topping. For my snowstorm, it was a different color, so I was confused. I also did not taste any butterscotch, which I was really looking forward to.\n\nI went here with my bro, and he ordered the same teddy cup, as well as a Macaroon snowstorm. I had a bit of his, and it was much better than mine. I think they may have mixed up my order, but either way, the custard was still very good.\n\nThe cake batter custard was nothing special, to be honest. No pieces of cake batter, or any sprinkles.They have a weekly special of flavors, along with their regular (see their new updated website). \n\nJust a side note, we came here at 845 on a Saturday night, and it was pretty crowded inside. There are multiple benches inside, as well as a drivethru. We decided to order and head to my car, which was parked in one of the angle spots. While eating, 2 wonderlake fire dept trucks pulled on both sides of us. A girl who got out of one of the trucks decided to open her car door on my exterior, and didn't even bother to check anything. Not sure I'd want her responding to a fire of mine (nothing against jarling's, but it did happen there).\n\n15 dollars for our 4 dishes. I'm not sure if I will be getting a snowstorm or a sundae on my next trip, but I will be back! I think I should have gone with something coconut, PB, or chocolate chip based next time. I'll be honest, I was disappointed in my Tortoise, but I will go back because I love dessert, and I'd prefer this place over DQ, any frozen yogurt place, or McD. I'd actually put it on par with Culver's, but I love local business, and I'd like to see if my experience coudl be improved.", "business_id": "ciRNik0_EdguibEypTspFA", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-06-30", "type": "review"}

If I would have known about Jarling's my freshman year I would have put on the freshman 50. But seriously. Both times I've been I've gotten snowstorms (think blizzard + custard) and the junior size is more than enough.

There are windows and a line for each window, so that's something to keep in mind if you show up and it's super busy! Service is a little slow but snowstorms are definitely made with love. You can't rush a good thing! Everyone I've talked to has been personable and friendly.

This place is a real gem with the low cost ice cream that puts to shame other ice cream stores. Do you know what makes custard a custard and not ice cream, it contains egg yolk in it.

My coworker and I were waiting for a movie across the street and decided to try and beat the heat by getting some ice cream. I have allergies to soy so I have to be very careful about what I eat as it is in *everything* these days. There were two gentlemen in the store one dark haired and kinda sullen looking,  the other heavy set. I failed to get their names as I was quickly put out by our experience and just wanted to leave. \nThe heavy set guy was busy with a customer so we asked the dark haired one if there was nutritional information available and politely explained I had allergies and had to be aware of everything I eat. He looked at us blankly and kind of put out sounding responded \"I have it in a book.\" There was a pause as he just stood there staring like we were some sort of circus oddity. Finally, my coworker politely asked if we could see the book. Without saying anything and with a slight roll of his eyes he turned, grabbed the book and shoved it in my face kinda rudely. I took it from him and turned away from him because it was clear he had some sort of problem. I remarked to my coworker \"Friendly... Love that\" because he clearly was not.\nPerhaps he despised his low paying job. Perhaps he thought we looked too low class to be in his presence. Perhaps he was having a bad day. Perhaps he was just a jerk. Whatever the case, his unfriendliness and and our unwelcome  were palpable. I flipped absentely through the book but quickly decided I really had a problem giving money to a store who had employees that seemed to think openly treating customers with disrespect was okay . Handing the book back to the employee in question, I smiled and said thank you as we left. As if this wasn't enough, as we were leaving I noted that he never took his eyes off of us and even kind of elbowed his co worker and started making some sort of comment while staring us down through the window of the store as we left. They chuckled amongst themselves if full view of us as I watched. They seemed not to care that I could see their every move. \nWhen I called back after we left and asked to speak to a manager, at first I was put on hold while whoever answered said they would go get the manager. A couple seconds later, the same person came back and said, \"Oh I'm sorry. She's not here.\" He then informed me he had no idea when she would be back in. \nCall me crazy, but I find it hard to believe in a store of that size one could be unaware their manager was no longer in the store and further could not give me any sort of estimation of when she was expected except to say she was \"usually\" around in the morning. \nAt any rate, I have scarcely been treated so rudely in a customer service environment ever. So, to the manager, whoever you may be, I would suggest you inform your employee he should endeavor to adjust his attitude towards paying customers if he intends to continue working with the public. Honestly, I really don't care what his problem was. Not my issue. I couldn't care any less what he thought of me or my coworker. However, I steadfastly refuse to give my hard earned money to a store which allows this kind of blatantly unacceptable behavior from one of its employees. Next time, I'll just find a Ben and Jerry's or simply endure the heat without aid.", "business_id": "PIu2Rocm6_Vyp2M3v6TKdA", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-06-28", "type": "review"}

She had great customer service, friendly, personable, and kind. I had been running around trying to find a decent sized icecream cake for a going away party for a friend last minute. Not only was she very helpful she even drew on the cake and wrote some stuff in icing for me. How cool is that?! I thought for sure I wouldn't be able to find someone to do it last minute and so quickly too. I was in and out in no more than 10-15 minutes. Asked my questions, got straight answers, and was out of the door ten minutes later. Maybe not even that Long. Everybody loved the cake when I brought it to the party and complimented it and asked where in the world I got it. Nobody could believe it was a cold stone cake they for sure thought I got it from some place expensive. \n\nAnyway, hands down the best service I've ever gotten. Will recommend all my friends to get their birthday cakes from cold stone and specifically from that location. In fact I'll be back in September to get my friends birthday cake and October for mine(: \n\nThanks for the great service(:", "business_id": "8WPCqC0Y-yszJi7eqfSllA", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-07-29", "type": "review"}

I remember coming here with my parents as a wee little one, standing on my tippy toes with my hands and face pressed against the glass trying to pick one of the glorious 32 flavors (yes, they have 32 not 31 flavors at this location) I was going to indulge in on my sugar cone. I also remember riding my bike here as a tweenager with friends and discussing which Hanson brother we were going to marry (yup, I admitted that) while eating a banana royale because a sugar cone was so juvenile.\n\nAnyway, I came to this location with my mom, after a five year hiatus, and was pleasantly surprised with the remodel. The same family owns this location and still works the updated, clean counter. You can choose from 32 flavors of ice cream and sherbert, along with seven toppings (oreo, m&m, gummy bears, rainbow and chocolate sprinkles, hot chocolate, caramel), premade ice cream cakes and THEY STILL HAVE THE CLOWN CONES!!!!!! Those were also my favorite to choose from when I wasn't pressed up against the ice cream glass. BR's mint chocolate chip ice cream is the best! I haven't found anything nearly as delicious. I'm not sure if its the shaved chocolate in the ice cream or the crack (kidding), but its seriously addicting and I ended up buying a quart to enjoy at later times.

Its creamy, never gritty, and the flavors are fun and forever changing. I have been going here for nearly 15 years and I'm never disappointed in the yogurt. Its wonderful!\n\nThe Bad: This is the reason I'm not giving it 5 stars. First, they only take cash. I'm someone who never carries cash so it makes it inconvenient to have to remember to bring some. Second, no longer do you see the family members working there with their friendly faces but instead are these high school teens that don't care about their job and talk about their high school drama instead of showing some courtesy to the customers. Lastly they don't have a lot of toppings to choose from and I feel they're a bit pricey so I never get them.\n\nFor years I refused to get yogurt anywhere else because MFY was sooo good I didn't like any other shops but alas I have ventured and found other great places that are doing a better job at creating creamy yogurt. I'll still go there every so often when I'm in the area but nowadays I seem to like other places a bit better but its still very much worth a try. \n\nFYI, they're not open on Sundays!

The food was...meh. I would enjoy a burger from just about anywhere else more. The fries were not good...soggy, not crispy, and bland. The milk shake did not satisfy my craving. \n\nThe \"$5 Buck\" lunch was a good price but the name was driving me crazy. If you say \"buck\" then do you need the dollar sign? Seems like it reads \"Five dollar Buck\" which...is redundant and doesn't make sense. But...that's not why the bad review. \n\nThere was a table of people behind us. They had a little girl with them, and I'm not good with kid ages but I would guess her to be 2 or 3 maybe? They kept walking back into the back of the kitchen with her...sometimes with a woman, sometimes a man. I assume they were the owners or something, right? None of them are dressed like they work there. They are wearing clothes that clearly don't meet health department specs...tank tops, hair hanging all over the place, open toed shoes, etc... They walked past customers in line, helped themselves to ice cream and stuff while customers had to wait to get their orders because these people were in the way. They didn't greet the customers. They didn't acknowledge the customers. That was bad enough, but then I go to the bathroom, and the little girl throws french fries over the booth into my purse. My boyfriend saw her doing it! After watching them walk around the place so rudely ignoring customers and cutting in front of them for service, I guess I shouldn't be surprised that their child would do something like that. \n\nThe only thing that gives this place the 2 stars I so generously gave was the other staff. They were suuuuuuper friendly and very helpful despite the owners getting in their way. Until the issues with the owners began, I kept thinking that even though the food was just...ok, I might start going here more often because the staff was so pleasant.

But at the time she didn't remember the name of the place.  She's telling me she only had it once, that a former UNLV professor took her there for the best \"ice cream\" she's ever had and that you can only order it outside.  She described it as a little shack with some ghetto ass window bars.  \n\nSince we're hella bored in the office and we hate our manager.  We decided to annoy her by being unproductive doing google and yelp searches trying to find this place.  According to my intense online research, the only place I see close by the Stratosphere in the ice cream/desserts category is Luv-It Frozen Custard and showed her the picture of the outside.  She says, \"THAT'S IT, it has to be the place and we have to go today!\" \n\nNow I've never had frozen custard before so I didn't really know the difference between frozen custard or ice cream.  She asked, \"You fly, I'll buy?\"  \"Well if your going to twist my arm, Let's roll than!\"  But it was 11:30 am at the time and Luv-It doesn't open until 1pm.  I don't usually take lunch at 1pm but today was an exception to satisfy her sweet tooth.  \n\nWe bail for \"lunch\" at 12:45 exiting off Sahara,  As I turn left onto LV Blvd I was laughing driving up realizing OMG it's one block from the muthaphukkin OG, hoping it wasn't a bad omen (rewind 2 nights before: http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-olympic-garden-las-vegas#hrid:NKIO3Tyry85byIIVYrWjwQ).  We arrived and there's like already 7 people in line waiting and it was still 12:55.  So I knew this must be legit! There was only two flavors available which were Vanilla and Pineapple just made in the lab.  Since it's only a one man shop, they don't crank out many flavors at 1:00.  Unless you order like 1/2 a gallon I believe than there's a variety of other flavors already \"hard packed\" so its frozen solid.  \n\nSome of the regulars in line recommended the Luv-It sundae with Vanilla flavor so I went with that and the owner was nice enough to hook me up with extra pecans which complemented the vanilla flavor very well.  You can really taste the vanilla and the egg whipped in.  But if I did a blindfold taste and put out a cup of vanilla frozen yogurt or frozen custard I don't think I can still tell the difference.  I look forward to trying other flavors without the all the sundae toppings next time.  I'll probably only be back on the weekends because of their weird hours.  It's CASH only and if you don't mention what flavor you want it's always going to be vanilla by default.", "business_id": "uYVdp5LfCbX8S8ytnhdk-g", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-08-16", "type": "review"}

I love how they just hand you it out the window and you stand there eating it on the curb. It was an interesting mix of customers: local weirdos, guys in suits, slick dudes in fancy cars, cops, placated thugs, you name it. Best business model ever. 4 bucks, here's your delicious freshly-made frozen custard, now stand there and eat it in our ghetto parking lot. Well done, Luv-It.", "business_id": "uYVdp5LfCbX8S8ytnhdk-g", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-08-24", "type": "review"}
