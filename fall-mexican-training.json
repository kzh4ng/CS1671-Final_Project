After hearing rave reviews from Mexican, Puerto Rican, and Dominican friends, I finally got the opportunity to eat here last night. \n\nI arrived around 9:30pm and was sat instantly. we were the only party in the upstairs part. My friend, who is Mexican, chose to get the rice water (forgot the original name) and it was delicious! Chips and Salsa was plentiful, I didn't care for the salsa at all. Tasted bland and watered down to me. The chips were obviously out the bag, which I don't mind but some salt or some seasoning was needed. \n\nI ordered the Street Tacos and my friend got the Shrimp Fajitas. He loved his fajitas! Now, my Street Tacos on the other hand is a completely different story. The tortillas/soft taco shells were greasy and cold. I couldn't even eat them. The items inside the taco weren't that great either. Huge strips of chicken that tasted bland, barely there pico de gallo, and a sprinkle of cheese. There was lettuce and guac on the side. I also asked for sour cream on the side to try to make it taste good. It also came with rice and beans. The beans were beans, nothing special. The rice was the best part of the meal... but it was room temperature which I didn't like much.\n\nService is the reason why I will never give the food another chance. Our server was Ingrid. She was pretty great at first. When a Spanish speaking couple came to sit upstairs, she began talking to them so me and my friend had to wait about 10 minutes for the check once we were done eating. Then, she assumed the checks were together and seemed to have a shocked look on her face when I asked to get them split. We had to wait about another 10 minutes for her to finish talking to her manager/co-worker. The thing that that really put the icing on the cake was seeing a charge for sour cream. I wouldn't have minded if I knew when ordering sour cream with my tacos that there would be an extra charge, but to me that is just Serving 101 to tell a customer that all add ons were extra. Paying $1.25 to attempt to make the tacos taste a little bit better was ridiculous. When asked about it she told me, \"All add ons have a charge to the ticket\". No attempt to atleast say, \"I'm sorry, but sour cream has a charge.\" I just don't like being surprised when the ticket comes. There was a man, maybe the expo manager or kitchen manager that refilled our chips, salsa, and drinks. I'm not the greatest tipper, but I always tip 25-50% on inexpensive meals so I felt obligated to leave a note telling her that I would've tipped if I knew about the charge and if I could've got the ticket faster instead of watching her chit chat literally right in front of me while waiting for my ticket One of the first times in a while that I didn't tip. I'm in the service industry and I know that if I ever treated a customer like that, I would've gotten wrote up and had to have comped their meal out of my pocket. \n\nSuper long story short: Sub-par food, worse service.", "business_id": "rg1-6A-8SKXGh_p-Abbyxg", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-10-26", "type": "review"}

The salsa was good, not great, but good. The red being the more flavorful, though hot, and the green being comparatively mild and bland. Margaritas were tasty, but verrrrrry weak. We went through the pitcher and wondered if they had much booze at all. I like the taste of tequila a lot, especially over margarita mix, but I could not taste any tequila in these. Then came the entrees, Chicken Enchiladas for her and Red Burro Enchilada style for me. I ate my food, as I will never leave something on my plate, but I was telling my girlfriend the whole time that it smelled like canned dog food. I didn't say this because I thought it was bad, or gross, but actually smelled identical to dog food. She agreed. I thought long and hard and today it came to me, it smelled like Pedigree brand. \n\nOverall it is a clean restaurant with great service, but unfortunately somewhat questionable food.

After a few recommendations, we decided to try it for take out. We wanted a good variety of foods, so we ordered cheese enmoladas, a gordita, a chile relleno combo, a pastor burrito combo, chilaquiles verdes and a pambazo. All of this food for us to share and the best part of it was the salsa, which they happened to charge us for. \n\nThe cheese enmoladas were stuffed with a dry, flavorless shredded chicken. The gordita wasn't too horrible, but was definitely understuffed. The chile relleno seemed as if it was stuffed a few days prior. The cheese had a brownish color and was slimy with a gritty texture when rubbed between the fingers. The pastor burrito was very small, understuffed and was served on a cold tortilla. The tortilla was actually still ice cold on the bottom of the burrito by the time we got home, so the filling must have not been very hot either. \nChilaquiles verdes were a complete joke. It was seriously a handful of chips, a small spoonful of green salsa and a tiny sprinkling of cheese. It did come with some sort of a pollo asado on top, which is unique and it was flavorful, but it was very old and dry. It is served with just beans and some iceberg lettuce, but for $8, this is no bueno. Something also caused the bottom of the container to melt, so I had to transfer it to another plate, but I still found pieces of styrofoam in my food. The pambazo was flavorful and pretty decent. The filling (chorizo and potatoes) had some sort of a bitterness to it. I think maybe the potatoes or chorizo were burnt, but it was one of the better dishes. The combos were also served with rice and beans. The rice was old and hard. I'm certain that it had been out the entire day. The beans served on all of our dishes were entirely inedible. They had a really funky sour taste, so they were either spoiled or just plain bad. Either way, discarded all of them. The salsa that we were given and charged for was really great! It was a red salsa and tasted like it was homemade. \n\nWe did order 30 minutes prior to closing, so we figured that a lot of the issues were due to the late order, but the food was really unacceptable. If they didn't have quality food to serve or it was ready to be thrown out, just tell us that you're not longer taking orders. It really sucks to pay for something and then have to discard at least a 1/3 of it. After all of this, we would still try El Nopalito again because of people's recommendations, but only if someone else was paying.

(we are the only ones in there besides a person at the bar and the business types in the other room). He does this about 20 minutes after i asked as he obviously forgot until he saw me staring at him. Not too big of a deal.\n\n25 minutes after ordering our appetizers we still have not seen our waiter or any sign of our food. He finally comes over to our table and says \"you're food will be out shortly, our cooks are slacking\" It's completely obvious to us that this guy forgot to put in our order. \n\nFinally our food arrives! It was brought out by another gentlemen who exclaimed \"Sorry about the wait folks, that big party over there (the business types) caught our cooks by suprise! \n\n1. We ordered long before they even came in. \n2. Your cooks got caught by surprise??!!!  So, they're not used to cooking when they go to work as a cook!\n\nThey got one order completely wrong. our friend who is a vegetarian, ordered the harvest sampler (the veggie sampler). They brought her the regular sampler consisting of beef chimi's burro's and other things. Now we have to wait another 20 minutes for her food. \n\nAfter comping her meal we received our check. We asked the waiter again if he can split it up 3 ways (we had told him we would be doing this prior to ordering) \"Sure, No problem he says\". He returns 10 mins later only to tell us he can't split the check and we'll have to \"figure it out\" \n\n My wife and the rest of our party except one, proceed to leave and wait for us outside while we \"figure out\" the check.  After deciding we would leave a poor and undeserved tip just to be nice, our waiter brings back our change.. no $1's. before we can open our mouth to remedy this he is gone. \n\nAt this point i'm tempted to walk out without leaving a tip but im a nice guy. So i stroll up to the bar to make change. The new bartender makes eye contact with me,  but doesn't say a word, turns around and proceeds to shuffle around the bar as he tries desperately to open a bottle of seagrams with no luck.

It was very slow and yet it took forever for our server to come to our table. The decor was a throwback to the 80's, and probably that was when it was done and never updated. The menus came with dried up food on mine. They eventually came and brought us typical chips and awful salsa. It was served in q maple syrup dispenser and had the consistency of tomato paste. You couldn't pour it so you had to remove the top and scoop it out with a spoon. It tasted a little like flavored tomato paste as well. When our server came by we asked for a drink menu and he pointed to his head, as if to say all we needed to do is ask and he would recite it to us from memory. We asked what is good here and he grinned and said \"margaritas\", to which we asked what kind. He began to recite flavored, and we said we wanted a top-shelf, he really didn't know what we were talking about so we ordered the non-flavored with salt on the rocks. It came out and was perhaps one of the most typical standard margarita mixed drinks with very little tequila. We mistakingly at that pint decided to stay and ordered a combination plate, split. They split it, but instead of splitting both items they gave my wife one and me one and only one set of utensils. He asked what kind of sauce, we said green but on the side.

Don Jose is the first restaurant I ever remember coming to. That was over 20 years ago. My dad used to go to the old original location at who knows where... So, to say that I know it well and it knows me is an understatement. The nice family who ran it knew our orders by heart and we came about once/week for many years. Imagine my upset to find out it was closing back in 2009. I wanted to have a cry. Even though my dedication had faltered in the past few years since I started college, I was still heartbroken that the old reliable Don Jose would not be there. \n\nIn the two years that it was not open, I mourned and craved my cheese enchilada staple, along with my beans and a cheese crisp covered in hatch chiles... Of course, we covered everything in their simple yet amazing garlic-induced red salsa that has a certain jenesequa about it. When I heard they were opening up under a new owner but with the same menus, I teetered. What if it wasn't the same? What would I do then?!?! My heart would fall to the floor and my childhood restaurant ruined... I went for it. \n\nI ordered the same thing I have ordered for over 20 years: Two cheese enchiladas and a side of beans. They tasted... THE SAME! Delicious and simple! Awesome! The salsa? ALMOST the same. There was something different that I couldn't put my finger on. I would almost say they may just use a different brand of tomato sauce, that's how slight it is... And that shows how many gallons of the stuff I've consumed in my lifetime. Well, adieu old Don Jose owners and hola to the new! Thanks for bringing it back and letting me continue the enjoyment in the same old booths I've sat in for years.

Lunch was good with both the food and the service being done right.  Went back last night because it was a beautiful night and we wanted to sit on the patio.  Initially the hostess was not very accommodating but reversed track and sat us on the patio.  Chips and a bottle of water showed up pretty quickly but unfortunately no glasses.  We sat there for about 10 minutes without seeing anyone else.  I have been in the food service business for years so I am pretty forgiving so this was not a big deal.  What was a big deal was that they were apparently having a function for a girls softball team and while the parents were inside their girls were on the patio \"playing\".  12 - 14 of them yelling and screaming and running around.  While they do have a bocce court on the patio, its not a playground although this was not the first time we have seen children using it as such.  It was the first time there were so many and so loud.  Had we been served a little faster it might not have been so annoying but with nothing to do but sit there and listen to all the noise we decided to leave.  As we got up the waiter hurried over and asked if everything was OK.  We explained we had come for dinner and the noise was too much.  To his credit he asked if he could give us a gift certificate which was nice but didn't mean much as we had made a special trip to enjoy a nice dinner at a nice restaurant.  If we wanted to be around of obnoxious kids on a playground we would have chosen Chucky Cheese or Peter Piper.  Probably won't be returning any time soon as it is a drive for us and not knowing what to expect (nice restaurant or kids day out) its probably not worth the effort.\n\nIn regards to the girls softball team, the parents of the Hotshots should be ashamed of themselves.  I coached travel ball for 15 years from 10U through 18 Gold.  My daughter is a coach for one of the premier high school programs here in AZ.  Never would one of my teams been this obnoxious and rude.  The Hotshots have been around a long time and have been a premier program in AZ for a long time.  If any of the people who are running this program happen to read this, you may want to tell your coaches that as long as your team is wearing its name on their shirts they should act with some class.  When my daughters played in college, the first thing they were told was you represent the school in all you do.  We told our players the same thing and that is why all of my seniors received scholarships to play at the collegiate level.  They could play and they were respectful and had class.  There is more to being an athlete than just what happens on the field.  This team was an embarrassment to your program.", "business_id": "G9LwkTSdKOyOGqd5BbuIkA", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-09-18", "type": "review"}

OK, so Yelp is a great resource and so are friends' recommendations.  But when it comes right down to it, it's all a matter of opinion.  When it comes to Carolina's Mexican Food, mine differs from most.\n\nI've mentioned in other reviews that I love the idea of a mom-n-pop place where local owners are doing their own thing, contributing to the local economy with jobs and paying their taxes.  Plus, this place makes their own tortilla shells. so that's a nice touch.\n\nThe food isn't especially memorable.  The machaca or chicken tacos are appropriately sized overall, but contain mostly just iceburg.  See for yourself with the posted pics.  The chicken was flavorless, but the machaca was a bit easier to discern.  Also, the size of the cheese quesadilla was fine, though proportionately had little cheese.\n\nIn the interest of safety, I would NOT recommend coming here at night alone.

I was at another location for the first time the night before and liked it so much I decided to come to this location of lunch the next day.\nI must have just missed the lunch rush because the place was pretty much empty. Which made me wonder for a second if there was something wrong with this location. Where were all the people? I thought it would be packed with people. Not that I am complaining because I was able to get right up to the counter and order and get back to work pretty quickly. There is nothing wrong with this location because the food was fantastic. So was the service.\nThis time I got the Langostino Lobster Burrito. I have never had lobster in burrito before and wondered how it would taste. But I was told it was very good and sure enough it was fantastic. I think I like the Original Fish Tacos a little more but this was good. I could eat 4 of there tacos even though 2 do a good job of filling you up. It is one of those things that is so good you don't want to stop eating even though you are full.\nI will definitely be back again and again and again and again. So good and cheap too.", "business_id": "N7oUi6aM01UlvrsIcTSqmg", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-11-08", "type": "review"}
