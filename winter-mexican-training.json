On our way out of town for the holidays, we needed a quick snackie and made a stop at Reyna's for taco deliciousness.  We got four - two chicken, chorizo, carrnitas.  YUM.  They were so fun to eat - messy, sitting in our car, hot sauce dripping down our fingers - who doesn't love street food?  Seriously, this is the only place I've laid eyes on in Pittsburgh that appears to sell tacos of this kind.  I kind of want to go back....like, now.\n\nOH BUT WAIT.  Stop.  the churros.  On a whim, I ordered some churros real quick, and watched the guy pour the batter into hot oil right before my very eyes.  They floated around, browning and sizzling, then he took them out and put them directly into cinnamon sugar, into a paper plate thing, and then into my hands.  They were the best churros ever.  Love at first bite.  Love just watching them sizzle! \n\nI think I want to try empanadas next time if I can tear myself away from the tacos.", "business_id": "buVALudg30kgkDusqB3yJw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-01-05", "type": "review"}

With the bland chips, it wasn't much of a pairing, but with the salted chips, I was pleased. \n\nFor lunch I ordered an al pastor burrito and a barbacoa sope. The burrito was awesome! I actually really liked that it wasn't huge. What it lacked in size, it made up for in flavor. The barbacoa on the other hand, wasn't as good. On the menu it says that barbacoa is only served on Saturday and Sunday. This is apparently because El Napolito's barbacoa is made with lamb. I've had plenty of barbacoa before and I was expecting to be blown away...especially after having some great al pastor, but I wasn't. The meat was really gamy, like really gamy. Salsa and a little salt were needed to make my sope enjoyable, and that was a shame.\n\nI would return to El Napolito, but there are loads of great little Mexican places in the area that I'll be stopping by first.", "business_id": "s87D-mtAuJ8BluKgYYsXGw", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-01-08", "type": "review"}

They also gave us a big bag of chips with sides of salsa, pretty good as I stated in my previous review. For our entrees, my hubby ordered the steak fajitas & I ordered the carne asada burrito (with rice & beans added). Hubby said his fajitas were pretty good but my burro was gross. The bottom was so soggy I couldn't eat it as a whole, just picked at it & threw a lot away. For dessert I ordered the flan & since our order was over $30 we got a free dessert as well so I chose the mini chocolate chimis.

At most restaurants a machaca taco is very finely shredded spiced beef, and shredded beef tacos are coarsely shredded beef. Here if you order a machaca taco you get a course shredded beef in a preformed taco shell, and if you order shredded beef you get machaca in a properly deep fried taco shell.

It took us a while to actually make it there because they wouldn't take reservations for less than a party of 4 - so we ended up going for an early dinner. It was delicious and the service was great. \n\nBF enjoyed it enough that when I inquired as to what how he would like to celebrate his thirtieth birthday he selected Rokerij. \n\nThis is where disappointment sets in. I hate to be tough on the place but . . . the food was good, the ambiance good - but. . . \n\nI made reservations for 4 two weeks ahead of time for seven pm on a Saturday. We arrived right on time - the hostess alerted me that they were a little behind but would seat us soon. So we took our group to the bar downstairs for a round of drinks. It took them thirty to forty minutes to seat us. But we tried to be understanding (despite the fact that the second couple was paying a babysitter 10 dollars an hour . . . ) \n\nWe were sat - generally enjoyed our meal. But the service was lacking - for this level of restaurant you expect exceptional service - and frankly this caliber of food can be found elsewhere with good service and more reasonable prices. \n\nWe finished our meal (which was decent) we paid our check while we finished our dessert and drinks - but decided we would like to continue our conversation. We flagged down the waiter - who upon us requesting a round of drinks said \"my dad is getting pissed - so if you could sit at the bar . . . \" Our thoughts - so you took an extra forty minutes to seat us - when we had a reservation and now you want us to leave your table and you couldn't come up with a more tactful method of asking us to leave (note - it was 9:30/9:45 at this time, we had been at the table for about two hours, had a full meal (drinks, appetizers, entrees, dessert, second drinks - which equates to a full check and a hefty tip). Now I don't know who our waiters dad is . . . possibly the owner. But the professionalism at Rokerij was seriously lacking. \n\nI don't know whether we will return. But we have concluded: (1) Rokerij does offer good food - but they are slightly over priced for the quality (2) the professionalism was seriously lacking in service (presentation of the wine list focused on the price and not the taste pallets), and (3) they should get their ego in check - I get that you have a long list of people waiting for tables at your restaurant - but the next time I have a special event I will be going to one of the dozens of restaurants in the valley and receive the level of service that should come with the ambiance and food.", "business_id": "5kRug3bEienrpovtPRVVwg", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-01-09", "type": "review"}

Was 100% empty at 3:30. I sampled (yeah that's right.. i cheated! hardly ever happens) one of their tortillas and was hooked. Small kitchen in the back staffed by some nice Mexican ladies.. Smelled great.. total dive type place. It had success written all over it.\n\nThree of us pull up at 7pm ready to stuff our faces. The parking lot is packed which has to be a good sign. Walk in and are confused. Do we ordered at the window? Sit down and wait? wait to be seated? After about 5 minutes I flag a lady down and ask. She asked if it was take away, I let her know if was to stay she told us to take a seat and she would be with us shortly.\n\nAfter viewing the reviews/pictures the first thing I ordered were the chips and a cheese crisp with guacamole. The chips and salsa and water hit our table right away and the CC zoomed out less than 5 minutes later. Sadly this is where the speediness stopped :(\n\nAnytime we needed something after that point we had to flag someone down and ask.. sometimes twice. Its not that they were lazy its that their were only two of them serving a really busy restaurant. This is no fault of theirs but a fault of management. Staff your establishments accordingly! A Saturday night rush cannot possibly be \"news\" to this place. It was obvious this was the norm.\n\nWith empty drinks/chips we watched and waited as food slowly trickled from the kitchen. 45 minutes and our food finally showed up. It was fresh so we had not been forgotten about. They were THAT busy for the size of the kitchen. Another ding for the restaurant management.\n\nannnyywayys.. I believe I can separate my feelings on management/service/food so onto the food :)\n\nchips hot/mild salsa:\nSuper tasty! The chips had a very pleasant corn flavor, fresh, and far from greasy. On first glance I was sure I was going to hate the regular salsa. I'm one of those weirdo's that likes tomatoes everyway but fresh and it was loaded. I tasted it and prepared for the cringe.. NONE! it was really good. Not sure what they did to remove whatever it is about the fresh tomatoes i hate but they did it. The \"hot\" sauce in the bottle was also very good, standard chili, garlic, Mexican oregano that you find at most places. All three of them were addictive and I was almost happy we never requested a refill.\n\ncheese crisp:\nDelicious Tortilla (check), Super Sexy Cheese Blend (Check), Crispy (Check), Foldability (MASSIVE FAIL). DOH! If you read my review on la pi\u00f1ata you will see me talk about this. This happens when you try and slightly fold and overly crispy cheese crisp to maximize guac/salsa capacity. Snap! you try and recover SNAP! Now your hands are covered with grease and salsa and you have this crazy folded discombobulated mess on your plate(see attached picture.) I have to believe you all know what I'm talking about. Still tasty.\n\nguacamole:\nThey at least have the \"avocado is the star\" aspect of this down but it was lackluster. There are some supporting ingredients that really help bring out the creaminess/fat flavor of the avocado. It lacked citrus, salt, flavor in general. At least it wasn't 3/4 tomato :)\n\nshredded beef taco:\nIt was decent but nothing amazing. They weren't stuffed and then fried which I believe makes a superior taco. Something was overly wet as after two bites it fell victim to taco shell failure. Bottom falls out and you ended up finishing it with a fork. The meat could have definitely used more seasoning.\n\nground beef taco:\nOnly difference here was ground beef and had much more seasoning. Standard large amount of chili powder/cumin.\n\ngreen corn chicken tamale:\nWOW!! The comments about these are dead on. Really good even nekkid. Moist with just the right sweetness and corn flavor. I could have had a plate full of these and probably wanted more.\n\nchile relleno:\nThe pepper was bland, the cheese was a little scarce but at least melted and warm. You can tell the batter was at one point fluffy and light but in a short time ended up a soggy mess. Covered in green sauce.\n\ncheese enchilada:\nAmazing cheese with a small spin of adding onion which I liked the combo. This was covered on red sauce.\n\nSauce:\nRed: Above average, nice fat content and good roasted pepper flavor.\nGreen: No real heat, spice, or even chile flavor. I was disappointed because a few people mentioning how amazing it was.\n\nPros:\nCheese\nTamales\nChips/Salsa\nReasonably Priced\n\nCons:\nHorrible Service: Due to understaffing\nBland: This isn't uncommon for Senoran style but this was excessive.\n\nSummary:\nWhen I have a craving for tamales and delicious tortillas I will be back. Anything else I will likely head elsewhere. If there is something amazing there that I absolutely have to try please let me know! So out of 10 items the group really only liked 2 with a possible 3rd. Maybe it was an off night but I can't give this more then a 2.5 based on our experience. I really wanted to love this place :(", "business_id": "flUKBy7WHqYdfOrwU1A2SA", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-01-25", "type": "review"}

With the other 4/5 star reviews, you have great taste. You get it.  They have made many changes by adding a nice outdoors patio to eat at and two drive-thru windows. That's how busy they are.
