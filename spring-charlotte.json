I have lived in the Ballantyne area for years; however, this was my first visit to the Spa at Ballantyne. Overall, we were very satisfied with every service we received. We were welcomed and had a full tour of the facilities upon arrival. \n\nI personally had Leigh for my facial, and she was amazing. She talked with me at length about my skin type, the products that would work well, and the experience was incredibly relaxing. I have had facials before, but this is the best one I've ever had. My mom was equally satisfied with her service, and said she could have stayed on the table forever. \n\nI had Choyoung for my bottoms up pedicure and luxury manicure. She was an expert, and sought to ensure comfort at every step! My mom and I had these together, and it was a great experience - relaxing, refreshing, and lots of good chatter. We had a beautiful view of the golf course, and were sipping complimentary Pomegranate Martinis during these services. I have not been doing a mani/pedi on a regular basis, but am considering adding this on a monthly basis. Choyoung was very welcoming, friendly, and efficient. \n\nThe only part of our day that really irritated me was our checkout. After gathering our things from the locker room, we came back up to check out. My mother went into the shop to browse while I waited to pay. There was one customer at the desk actively engaged in a conversation with the man behind the desk. There was a woman behind the desk also, not participating in the discussion, but seemed like she was politely listening. \n\nShe clearly saw us walk up, and my mother go into the shop. I stood there for a bit, expecting that since the other customer was actively engaged in conversation with the other staff member, she would respond but did not. I almost said 'excuse me', but given I do customer service for a living as well, I wanted to see how long she would ignore me. I continued to stand there, and finally she (Lindsey) greeted me. I must say she was the most cold and rude person I encountered at the Spa. She presented me with the itemized bill before charging my card with $700 in services and a forced 20% gratuity (I normally tip 20% and would have anyway, but it's nice for the customer to have that choice), and then focused back on the previous conversation while she was printing receipts. It was almost as if I was a bother to her. After I received my receipt, I started to walk into the shop, and I heard her greet the person behind me with a totally different attitude. \n\nAfter the fantastic service received from all of their services staff throughout the day, it was not something I expected at the end. It goes to show you that a borderline rude customer experience at the end can ruin the entire impression of a business. Additionally, I sent this feedback in e-mail to the Spa, and heard absolutely nothing from them...not even a 'sorry'.", "business_id": "SVI6dJhJCdmp6c-smgQ2dQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-04-15", "type": "review"}

I understand this spa is considered a member of the luxury collection with Starwood.  Services between spas are typically the same.  You pay extra for Ballantyne for the experience.  My experience was not up to par.  I arrived for my appointment at the scheduled time as I do for all of my spa appointments.  I was ushered back to the treatment room to change there and my service ended ten minutes early.  At Ballantyne your experience is supposed to start with a brief tour of the spa which ends in the locker room where you can put away your items and change into a robe for your service.  I am also surprised that I was charged for the full 50 minute service and only provided 40 minutes.  I could tell a couple of processes were left out and that the time was cut short.  That is what prompted me to check my phone for the time after the service provider left the room.  I discussed the issue with the desk and they suggested I speak with management.  I called the spa director who made no apologies.  She said it was a policy of there's to cut the service short if a client was late.  However I was not late and I believe at a luxury spa a client should be accommodated in the event they are a bit late. I have never been shorted on a service at any other spa.  I was offered a free full service to return but declined.  This practice is unprofessional and should not be standard for Starwood.

Be on the lookout and check their site to be privy on opening nights. \n\nFor the growing artist out there: The staff here is fantastic and the facility is incredible, clean, inspiring, unique, and overtly beautiful.

Floor after floor of impeccably adequate space (all studios are complete with giant double doors for moving large pieces in and out) on the rather large service elevator.

The crab cake was so warm and fell apart beautifully, perfect spicing, a little n'orleans remoulade underneath, and the lump crab was so sweet and tender. The salad was rich and creamy, a few bites of decadence.\n\nWe then had an artichoke bisque, which was unfortunately the low point of the meal for both of us as neither of us loves artichoke much. The base of the soup was fantastic, but the tough bits of artichoke were just okay, and the cracked pepper garnishing the dish was very coarse ground (which provided contrast to the consistency of the soup, but seemed out of place).\n\nThen on to a baby wedge salad, mine with blue cheese and buttermilk, Barb's with a housemade vinaigrette. The salad was composed with perfect bacon, dried bing cherries, spiced pecans, the blue was fragrant without being overwhelming. Barb's vinaigrette had so much body and cling, with such great balance that she couldn't stop making pleasant-eating-noises - you know the ones.\n\nWe had a little sorbet (blackberry, such concentration of fruit flavor), and then the three main courses.\n\nThe salmon was served with wilted spinach and a potato hash, but the salmon itself was cooked to a perfect and consistent temperature throughout without overcooking the edges, or a slightly-underdone-center. It had a gently spiced rock-hard crust on one side, with perfectly cooked salmon immediately below. The plate was served with a smooth and tangy lemon beurre blanc. Best salmon I've ever had.\n\nNext was the duck course, our server Johnathan mentioned reminded him of Christmas. Beautiful rare duck breast, served on a bed of whipped sweet potatoes (perfectly smooth, none of that stringyness you sometimes get with sweet potatoes) that had been flavored with vanilla and brown sugar. Not overly sweet but absolutely decadent, and a small serving of sauteed brussel sprouts. The richness of the duck offset the cabbagyness of the sprouts, and the sweetness of the potatoes was a great offset to that pair. On top was a single sage leaf - the most fragrant I've ever smelled - which tied it all together and made it feel like christmas.\n\nThe third entree was the filet mignon, what Barb would have chosen, had we only had one choice of entree. Served rare to mid-rare, it had the same amazing cookery as the salmon, where the temperature and doneness was consistent throughout to almost within a millimeter of the soft crust. Served with a green peppercorn sauce, by far my favorite sauce of the night, which had spiciness and richness. The mashed potatoes served with the filet were nothing much on their own, but served as a perfect vehicle for the sauce, and the braised collards were noteworthy for both their balanced flavor as well as the fact that they were perfectly cooked. The greens had little snap in the backbone, they weren't wilted as so many collards become. They were barb's first bite off the plate, and made her eyes light up and she was almost rushing me to try a bite. The steak itself was pure silk on a plate. Warm, lucious, flavorful (uncommon for a filet!). Unfortunately, I do think that Barb's half of the filet was slightly more cooked, and came out mid-rare/medium, but mine was perfect.\n\nNext, a small goat-cheese log stuffed with dried fruit, rolled in crushed nuts, and served with two pieces of baguette. The baguette had a wonderful quality of being crisp and light (like melba toast, but not as dry), without having a crust that was so hard as to be painful to the gums (as so many toasted baguettes do). Also on the plate were a few tiny slices of celery, and a small drop of wildflower honey. This is not your store-bought-in-a-bear-squeezy honey, but rather it was fragrant and flavourful, very sweet, and brought out a dessertlike quality to the cheese/nut/fruit/bread combination. Barb, I'm sure, would go to great lengths to find that honey again, she enjoyed it so much.\n\nLastly, the cheesecake course. When it arrived, it was small, and we both looked at eachother and said \"this is how cheesecake should be served\", not a huge slab that's a chore to work through, but a small indulgence at the end of the meal. It was rich, but fluffy, and so moist. None of that powdery or clumpy feel that you get at a factory. Served with a bourbon-vanilla-cream sauce on the plate. The sauce was sweet, complex, but not cloying. The cheesecake was sweet and rich, and I mopped that plate clean. But the whole course was never too much of anything, it was just a perfectly walked tight-rope, never too sweet or too rich, never too moist or too dry, but everything was executed wonderfully.", "business_id": "USdRzNk14UdjZWFgBJb0wA", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-04-04", "type": "review"}

Unfortunately, about 45 minutes into our experience, a large party of 10 was seated in the same room.  The volume and overall boisterous demeanor of the large party killed the mood we were had been enjoying previous to their arrival and therefor dampened the evening.  At times we could barely hear ourselves think, let alone hear each other.  While the staff did acknowledge the disturbance, nothing was done to either remedy the situation by moving and/or quieting the large party.  Our coffees were taken off of our bill but that is very insignificant thanks for the $4 dollar coffees off of a very expensive bill.  \n\n Going forward, perhaps it would be better for the comfort of all involved to have a separate room designated for large parties only.  It seems like your restaurant makes every effort with the level of service and food so it is a shame to have that effort go to waste due to unfortunate seating placement.  \n\nAlso i noticed when i parked in my garage that the hood of my car was open, which means the valet much have hit the wrong button when pulling my car up and thankfully it didnt come open during the trip home.", "business_id": "USdRzNk14UdjZWFgBJb0wA", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-05-21", "type": "review"}

I never would have known about Al Mike's (as it is known casually) without reading the reviews on Yelp.  Most people said very positive things, so we decided to go here for my birthday dinner.  There were 5 of us, and then 7 on a Saturday night.  Granted the weather was terrible, but we were easily seated at a comfortable table in the middle of the restaurant.  The waitress put up with our indecisiveness with grace and humor, and answered all of our questions very nicely.\n\nOur group started with the Fried Pickles, and even with that many people one order was enough.  Of course, if you know Fried Pickles you know that too much is not a good thing.  These were light and not greasy, even though they came out to us super-hot and fresh out of the fryer.  Their ranch dressing was wonderful, and really complimented the sharp dill taste of the pickles.\n\nOur entrees arrived very quickly, and our table ordered everything from one of the specials, to pasta, to a burrito.  All reports back on entrees were positive.  We had a vegetarian in the group and he was easily acommodated by their menu.\n\nMy Feta Chicken dish was chicken (duh) served over penne pasta with lots of veggies and covered in feta cheese.  The taste of the dish was great, and my only complaints had to do with texture.  The sauce was more of a broth, which is how it was described in the menu, but I guess I was expecting a bit more structure to it.  And, the chicken was tough.  Flavorful, but tough.  The rest of the dish was great.  The feta was lively, and there were some wonderful mushrooms in the sauce that were a treat to discover every few forkfuls.\n\nBecause it was my birthday, I got a free chocolate brownie!  It came out with a little candle in it, which was very sweet.  Our group also ordered the bread pudding.  Between the two desserts, I think the bread pudding might be the superb choice even though I'm a chocolate girl through and through.  It had a complex flavor that was just delightful.  The brownie was good, as really all brownies are.\n\nI prefer wine, and while the wine list is not extensive here I was perfectly happy with the pinot noir on the menu.  If you are a beer drinker, than this place has a ton of options for you!  The rest of my group drank beer, and heartily enjoyed it.\n\nI am so glad to have found Al Mike's, and I strongly recommend that you make the effort to find it in the 4th Ward.  It's easiest to get to off Graham Street - just turn south onto 9th and it's a block or so up the road.

In 1983, Michael Alexanders neighborhood tavern opened for business. \n\nA popular neighborhood institution, Al Mike's retains some interesting building characteristics, such as the supporting pole almost directly in front of the women's restroom door, which lends itself to many a bumped head as well as built in coolers that are original turn of the century ice box coolers. \n\nWe dined on the Spicy Crab Soup, which one of my dining partners characterized as melted Velveeta with crab and while that description might sound rather unappealing, it was quite yummy. In addition to the three cheese on Texas Toast sandwich, which was ok, but a bit on the dry side, my other dining companions had other basics, such as sandwiches and burgers. This is tavern food, so don't go expecting high end meals. The appeal of this restaurant, as a visitor to Charlotte, is that it is located in the Fourth Ward, a small district of brick and Victorian buildings and the unique history of the building that houses Al Mike's.", "business_id": "ePP0Eqz8JKSbtdt2phiB4A", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-05-27", "type": "review"}

Being that it is in an old, renovated house, the seating can get cramped at times, especially during peak traffic hours. Service gets bogged down too, both by the level of traffic and unwieldy setup.

Once you open the door and walk in to this exhibit and hear Arabic music. Not to be missed folks if you enjoy ethnic culture and cuisine. Bam! Right in front is the kitchen and get to try your sense and figure out the spices to recipes of Kibbeh, Tabbouleh and many more.

But sometimes you just want somewhere that's laid back, not crowded and has the feel of local pub.  The interior is all hardwoods, there is an upstairs that I think is held for private parties maybe, or just overflow during the weekends.  They have pool tables and of course plenty of TV's for sporting events, etc.  Plenty of dining area as well surprisingly due to the fact it doesn't seem that large when you first walk in but most of the dining area is tucked away near the back of the place. \n\nOk, I've been here a few times, mostly for social gathering and drinks mainly but last night I actually ordered food.  I had The Black Forest sandwich.  It's a simple sandwich really, but they make it perfection!  I'll have to say, a great sandwich is only as good as the bun or bread it's made of.  This one is angelic...hahaha...ok....yeah it's good though.  They use a Bavarian pretzel roll (nicely warm and soft) as the bun.  The combination of the flavor of the bun combined with the great ham, monterey jack cheese, smoked bacon and honey mustard condiment is sandwich bliss.  My side item were there nacho chips and unfortunately all I have to say about those in comparison to the sandwich is.....meh.  They were fine, but nothing to get excited about.\n\nNow, in terms of specials, Tuesday nights is $2.00 draft nights (mostly domestic labels only).  Also they have a rewards program here and it's called the All Star Brew Club I believe.  You earn points for the beer you buy and at certain thresholds you get things like, money credited to your bill, free t-shirt, etc.  It's free to join and they give you $5 off your next order.....that's a WIN in my book :)", "business_id": "-6JY1T0w4XETux5kGOj84g", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-04-20", "type": "review"}

I always give places the benefit of the doubt. I know people tend to weigh negative experiences more heavily and therefore tend if they take their time to write a review, chances are that they will be negative. \n\n A friend who lives in the Garden District (the nicer part of First Ward) convinced me that this place is just fine.  I was initially attracted to this place because you can get a 2B/2B for under $1000 and the location is so close to the nightlife in uptown. \n\nThe apartments are pretty standard - no luxury. And that works just fine for me. I am all about location. After 9 months of living here though, I have decided that there are better places to live. Here are some things I wish I had considered before. I promise that this review is not meant to be a rant, I am writing it so that you make an informed choice.\n\n-It's dirty. Constantly I find trash all over the parking lot, and the stairwells. (see photos). Also, the neighbors are lazy and put their trash bags outside their doors and forget about it...as if there were valet trash. In several occasions, I witnessed neighbors taking their dogs to potty and not picking up after them.\n\n-It's loud. Neighbors are loud. Also, I didn't think consider the downside of being close to the uptown action was that starting on Wednesdays you can expect people yelling on their way back from the bars.\n\n-You can count on the marijuana stench on the weekends, and frequently during the week. This should have been apparent to me as there is a drug use and distribution clause on the lease agreement.\n\n- Parking is an issue during big events. Many unauthorized cars parked at the complex. My car ended up getting towed because I couldn't find a spot. And all that management could say was: \"I'm sorry you had to put up with that.\"\n\n- No storage space. My small closet is my storage.\n\nTo be fair, I should include the upside of living here and all I can think is location. It is close to I-277 and I can get to places quickly. Oh, I have a wonderful (unblocked) view of the city's skyline from my balcony. But I just got lucky with the location of my apt. Most apartments in this complex don't have that view. Also, they let me paint a couple of accent walls as long as a paint it back to the original color when I move out. Also, is it worthy to mention that the maintenance staff are super friendly and helpful -Expect to always be greeted with a good morning and a smile.\n\nIn sum, if you are willing to put up with all of the disadvantages Then, you have found yourself a bargain. You may be inclined to think that \"you get your money's worth\".but I don't think it's worth it.  There are more charming areas around the city. Time to move on.

It makes an evening of arts and culture just that much nicer to enjoy.\n\nThe facility, adjacent and accessible from Founders Hall, is (relatively) new and sparkling throughout.  The lobby spaces are very open and offer a number of modern chairs and benches to provide seating to patrons.  A wide spiral staircase connects you to your level of seats and each level has a concession bar offering beer, wine, spirits, water, and a few snacks.  Prices are a little steep, but not so bad as at your typical movieplex.  Bonus tip: you can pre-order and pay for a drink during intermission.  When you walk out, there is a side table with your drink and order slip waiting for you.  So convenient and easy, as your time waiting in line is all but eliminated.\n\nI also think the seating inside the theater is very good, from most all levels.  If anything, the Orchestra seats may be close to the stage but require angling your neck up to see the action.  The seats in both the grand tier and mezzanine levels allow you to look down on the action but do offer unobstructed views.\n\nThe staff, located in the mint green jackets, are literally everywhere and available to help you find the most convenient door and path to your seats.  If you ever have a problem with patrons around you, a discreet word to an usher will quickly remedy the issue.  Bonus tip 2: they also sell parking passes for $5 before, during, and after the show.  There are 4 decks near the BPAC that accept the coupons.  The staff will check your parking ticket to make sure you parked in a qualifying deck and will then sell you a $5 ticket to get out after the show is over.  I can't say how helpful this is- you just feed the coupon into the gate and off you go- no digging for cash or waiting for a credit card receipt to slow you down.  \n\nBravo to this facility and their staff- they make a nice evening out just that much more enjoyable.", "business_id": "IFwRwGoz4B7glSzA84NWcg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-03-21", "type": "review"}

When we walked into this restaurant, it felt like we were walking into a pub in Ireland. Our server told us that the interior was transported from Ireland and restored into its existing condition.\n\nWe started with the Potato Cake appetizer, pan seared potato and cheddar cakes served with savory sour cream and a balsamic reduction. The Potato Cake was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. On the downside, it was loaded with onions and only served lukewarm. Dora here, Good thing we didn't stop there. :)\n\nI ordered the Shepherd's Pie, made with minced lamb, gravy, peas, carrots, and leeks served with a mashed potato crust and a slice of brown bread. The term \"shepherd's pie\" is used when the meat is lamb; the theory being that shepherd is connected to sheep and not cattle. This was an outstanding dish. The lamb and vegetables were perfectly cooked and full of favor with just the right amount of liquid, and the mashed potatoes were creamy with a nice crust. Dora here, I'm always game for Shepherd's Pie, and this was the first I've tasted with lamb. Thankfully, hubby shared with me or I might've resorted to stealing his fork. Soooo good! \n\nMy wife chose the Ri Ra Burger, topped with Ashe County cheddar, country ham, brown sugar onions and a Brioche bun. This burger was tall, juicy, and almost too big for the mouth. The caramelized brown sugar onions were sweet, and the garlic mayo added a unique taste. The \"Chipper \" chips are actually thick cut fries. I snagged a few and enjoyed dipping them in the garlic mayo. Dora here, This was a messy burger, but oh so yummalicious! And I probably drank a gallon of their iced tea.\n\nI would rate this establishment 5 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving outstanding food. If I included the less-than-thrilling appetizer, I'd lower my rating to 4 forks.\n\n~Ernie Hiers, Food blogger at Fiction Faith & Foodies", "business_id": "WuCcv_Dyd_1B_1-4jwK7sQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-03-16", "type": "review"}

We arrived shortly after 5:00pm and were able to grab two tables in the back, which was nice.  With more than 10 people we required a server, to sit at the table. That seemed good, rather than having to order each drink at the bar.  However, our server was taking care of every other table in the back room and drinks at the bar so he was hard to find. Most of use decided to order our next drink half way through our first since we knew it would take a while to see that next drink.\n\nAs for food, they no longer offer happy hour specials so we ordered a few appetizers off of the menu, potato cakes, poutine, cajun crab cakes, fried pickles among a few. And, all were nothing to write home about. The poutine actually came with raw french fries of which we had to send back. And the gravy, that typically is poured over the fries, sat the bottom of the bowl and tasted like gravy out of the packet, thank you McCormick's for letting Ri Ra use your gravy mix...Nasty!\n\nAs for the drinks, steer clear of the martini's, $12 for something the size of shot glass. Not worth it.

Complimentary cornbread at the beginning of the meal was plain and delicious, and the collards weren't that overly cooked mushy that I can't stand.

The hummus is made fresh and is the best I've had in Charlotte.  I ordered crab cakes for my entree, but they were a bit mushy and sloppy.  There were three medium sized ones served above a lot of plain white rice (too much) and some broccolini on the side.   Just an \"ok\" meal - nothing great.

Anytime there is a major event uptown (i.e. CIAA), they usually run out of cars - so plan ahead.  \n\nTransactions are always smooth and I'm never pressured to take insurance like I've been at other places.  They almost always have weekend specials for $9.99 a day.  Their weekly rates are the cheapest I've found (compared to Avis, Budget, Hertz, etc.).  \n\nGood prices and good customer service = repeat patronage!", "business_id": "VYsGg7O1kT_IRWwBn_Hg6w", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-04-17", "type": "review"}

I have become a \"treadmill snob,\" and one morning, all (6) were being used, so I hopped on the ecliptic (sp.?)  machine. I loved the interior of the fitness center as well. There are also free weights and other equipment available as well. I kept hearing that you had to pay $5 each time, but no one on the fitness staff ever approached me regarding this. \n\nThere is also a spa within the fitness center. I did not utilize this, but other coworker's utilized this opportunity.\n\nWe had our meeting within one of the conference rooms at the hotel. It was nice (modern), although as is usually the case, the room grew too cold on occasion, which was addressed by our staff, but with no noticeable difference.\n\nI noticed each morning, that our facilitator was met by the hotel staff to review the day's agenda, which I was very impressive. \n\nThe rooms were nice.

While 9 out of 10 are good experiences this one takes the cake.  Based on yelp reviews we knew ahead of time about the parking fee (it is unavoidable in the center of the city)At least it is only a 1 time fee and they validate it for your stay.  After parking we go to hotel lobby to check in and were greeted by a very nice and helpful receptionist (I wish I remembered her name).  She told us that we had the best room in the entire hotel, and I truly believe it. Our room was 15th floor room 1534.  It was on the corner so we got 2 walls of windows, one side had a great view of uptown (not the arena which is behind the hotel), and the ceilings were over 12 feet high. Our king bed was comfy as always, and I always fall asleep quickly on them.\nThe hotel itself is furnished in a contemporary style, and will appeal to 9 out of 10 people.  It is located one block from the Epicenter, and only a block or two from the lightrail system for easy commuting.    The one time we had to leave parking was to travel about 3.5 miles to go to an auditorium (we saw Wicked, and it was fantastic).  Other than that there was no reason to drive anywhere since you are close to everything in uptown.  \n\nIn the beginning of my post I said that my boyfriend and myself always stay in a variety of the Holiday Inn brand hotels.  For anybody looking into hotels, I suggest you sign up for their rewards system, whether or be this one (priority club) or another chains version of it.  Hotels reward loyalty, and will do a lot to keep you loyal.  We did our research and liked the IHG brand (everything from Holiday inn express to Intercontinental)for a few reasons; they are literally everywhere so we knew that when we travel we can stay with them and continue earning points, and price-wise they stay competitive.  Our room preferences are already saved to our account (free to create).  So as a tip to everybody do a little research into hotels rewards programs, then stick to it.  If you stay with a hotel chain ten times a year, they will do a little more to keep you happy, and make up for any bad experiences you might have along the way. When I first started out with my Priority Club membership I highly doubt they would have upgraded me to the 15th floor with some of best views in the whole hotel, but because of my loyalty to them they rewarded me (at no additional cost).  The room was only $97, and that really can't be beat  for this location.", "business_id": "Fi5sQxROyTLp5qDuYKz6bQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-04-09", "type": "review"}

The rooms were spacious and clean and everything was well kept.  The staff was friendly every time we walked past the front desk.\n\nOur flight didn't arrive to Charlotte until 11:40pm on Friday night. That meant that we didn't get to the hotel until 1am Saturday morning.  As we pulled up to the hotel we quickly realized that we were smack dab in the middle of party central.  The restaurant across the street was apparently a night club as well.  There was a line out the door and around the corner and down the block to get in.  The hotel was crawling with both police officers and security (kudos to hotel management for making sure the place was safe at least).  Once we made it to our room on the 15th floor we spent the next hour listening to screams and yells from drunk club goers 15 floors below us.  Cars would drive by with stereo systems so loud that the glasses on our night stands would vibrate.  Every 10 minutes it seemed like someone felt the need to either over rev their motorcycle and bounce off of the rev limiter (I guess showing people that you can twist your wrist on a throttle like EVERYONE ELSE in the world makes you some sort of hot shot?) or do the same to their car.  This would usually be followed by that same vehicle attempting to peel out from the stop light at the corner.  All of this while drunk club goers are undoubtedly stumbling only inches away on the sidewalks.\n\nFast forward to the day on Saturday.  We awoke to grab some breakfast then hit up a bicycle store to get a part for my bike since I was going to be racing a major national race that evening at 6pm.  Our plan was to eat a big breakfast then go back to sleep in order for me to be well rested for my race.  Little did I know that when we got back to the hotel and climbed back into bed around noon we would be kept up by what was apparently repairs being done to the plumbing or other piping on the 14th floor, right beneath us.  Workers were banging on pipes constantly for hours.  We tried to nap but simply couldn't.  We left a couple of hours later to grab an early pre-race meal and made it back around 3pm.  The banging didn't stop until 4-4:30.  So much for any form of a nap.  I thought I would get some rest being in a hotel?\n\nFast forward again to Saturday night/Sunday morning and the same events from the previous night were far, far, FAR worse.  Apparently some DJ decided to set up on a corner or something and proceeded to play dance music until 2am, on the dot.  More screaming and yelling than the night before.  More vehicles with motors bouncing off of rev limiters and, no doubt, blowing speakers in a vain attempt to show others how cool they are by playing overly distorted music through craptastic sub-par car audio equipment.  All to be up at 4am on Sunday morning in order to catch my 6am flight back home.\n\nI will never, let me emphasize this: I WILL NEVER stay at this hotel or at any hotel in the vicinity again.  Annoyed doesn't even begin to describe my level of irritation.  Hotel management should be ashamed that they A) let this happen right outside of their doors B) put paying customers on an exterior part of the building where they are subjected to this kind of noise.", "business_id": "Fi5sQxROyTLp5qDuYKz6bQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-04-12", "type": "review"}

The food and service is very good here, but beware that previous reviews are based on the old Ratcliffe.

I will say the food was prepared very well, and the wait staff was very helpful and patient with us...we were really disappointed that the menu had changed and even considered leaving.  Our server spoke with the Chef and they were able to work out special requests from several at our table.

The convention center is so large that the only time I interacted with persons from these other events was in passing or riding one of the numerous escalators. \n\nInside the conference rooms, meeting halls and exhibit spaces the Convention center staff did a phenomenal job creating an environment that logically flowed from one space to the next, and stationed themselves along the hallways and across all levels of the convention center to ensure that no was were to get lost.

According to the Convention Center website there is  280,000 sq. ft. of exhibit space, 850,000 sq. ft. of state-of-the-art features and award winning amenities, More than 90,000 sq. ft.of flexible meeting space, 35,000 sq. ft.

The one in the living area works with the lineup card, while the one in the bedroom has the digital assignments, such as 76-0010 and whatnot, meaning you can't find anything (including HBO), so if you want to actually watch a show, you'll probably end up watching on the hard-as-a-rock sleeper sofa in the living area.\n\nIf you have to flush the toilet (and many people prefer this option), you lose all water in the bathroom.

There's a parking garage that you use your hotel key to get in and out of (grab 1 extra key if you're like me and keep forgetting the hotel key in the car after I used it to get in the garage!). The garage is well lit and actually has power saver sensors so when you walk through at night the lights get even brighter so you feel safe walking through.

It isn't difficult to find several packs of half-drunk girls to grind on, and if you lack confidence to approach at least the bartenders are gorgeous. This is the perfect place to find someone to take home, and it's so loud you don't have to worry about all the dumb things you say. Truthfully though it's just not my scene. I don't won't to sound pretentious, but this place feels dirty and you will most likely step in vomit or at least spilled beer. As others have said, it's mostly hip-hop, when I was there I rarely heard any house or trance. The crowd definitely trends younger, mostly in their teens or low 20s. I'm 25 and I almost felt too old there. But maybe that says more about me than it does Bar Charlotte. For that reason, I can't give this place less than two stars.

I just came from there.  I allowed my 15-year-old daughter to go to a \"foam party\" tonight with a high-school friend and her friend.  I did not feel fully comfortable with the idea, so I figured I would go check on them (yes...I am that kind of parent).  So, I walked into the club at around 9:16pm.  Everybody is covered in soap suds.  The club was playing a hip-hop song about licking p*ssy.  And there is my 15-year-old daughter with a complete stranger (who was obviously much older), who was dancing and grinding behind her.  While they were dancing, he was cupping her breasts and running his hands down between her legs.  Her two friends were doing the exact same thing.  So, I walked up and told the guy to take a walk.  I grabbed my daughter by the arm and led her out of there.  Her friends were freaking, afraid that I was going to tell their parents (which I did).  I grabbed my daughter by the arm and led her out of there, and took her home.  (Before we went home, we had to stop at the girl's house to pick up my daughter's belongings.  There, the girl's mother and I had a long conversation.  She was just has upset as I was because she thought that Club300 was safe for kids.  IT IS NOT SAFE FOR KIDS!!)\n\nWhat my daughter and her friends did was wrong, and they should have known better.  However, all of the claims on Club300's Facebook page are totally false.  \n1) The music that they play is TOTALLY inappropriate for 15-year-olds.\n2) I saw no security inside the club what-so-ever.\n3) There were teenagers grinding and feeling each other up all over the place.\n4) If you read the FAQ, it states that NO PARENTS ARE ALLOWED IN THE CLUB AFTER 9:00PM...Gee, I wonder why that is?\nThis is no place for underage teenagers.  Besides, the Facebook page states that the club is for teenagers between the ages of 14-18 years of age.  A person who is 18-YEARS-OLD is an adult and has no business being in a club with underage kids.  On Tuesday of this week, I am going to contact an attorney and see if there is anything we can do about this.  This club is aiding and abetting in the delinquency of minors and should be shut down.", "business_id": "jbUu0Mtu9QUjyyeOn6RIHw", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-05-24", "type": "review"}

Didn't have that stretch-cheese consistensy, more crumblike, no complaints here either. Greens can be made a few different ways, this way wasn't my fave but they weren't nasty, a lil on the tart side but the red onions helped to cut through the taste.\n\nAfter an absence from seafood for years, I wanted to get back in the ring and decided to try catfish for the first time.

The decor is really cool and service is warm and friend from the time you walkj through the door.\n\nThe food is very good!

They do have salads if you can stand to eat that healthy while your friends and family eat fried catfish and cornbread  :)\n\nWe loved the Soul RolIs as an Appetizer.  I had the blackened Salmon which was just okay for me. I was looking for more blackened seasoning for a little kick of spice, but it was ok.  My sweetie is a Lousiana man so he had okra and tomatoe, Shrimp creole and fried catfish. He is a better cook than me believe it or not and he said Mert's did a good job.  He loved it. My sons had fried fish french fries collards.   I loved the flavor of the greens  and I am a good cook so I can throw down on some collards. Mert's did the greens some justice for sure!   My family thoroughly enjoyed their meals and the cornbread and everyone left quite  full!

You heard me, landed in Charlotte and after checking into my hotel, I decided to B-Line it to Mert's; because there was a need in me to have some good food, and I got delicious food.  \n\nFirst let me comment on the service... it was genuinely amazing.  I was promptly seated, and the hospitality was refreshing.  The server helped me patiently figure out what was good, and we settled on Southern Fried Chicken, Collard Greens and Mac & Cheese.  The Cornbread came out first, and it was mildly sweet, and tasty. \n\nLet's break down the meal.\n\nFried Chicken:  From the moment I took my first bite of the chicken breast, it was perfect cooked, juicy and hot, the meat was lightly battered, and the batter that was on it, was seasoned well.  It was a one of the better pieces of friend chicken I have had, not dry at all.   I would eat this every day, if I lived here, and I didn't have to worry about eating fried foods.  Recommendation, eat it, yum. \n\nCollard Greens:  I've had collard greens before, and this was good as most.  Admittedly, never had it with tomato before, but it was still delicious.  I liked the flavor, and the greens were tender, soft but with a nice bite.  The portion of the side was right, and complemented the chicken right.\n\nMac and Cheese: Yes Sir, this stuff was creamy, delicious, sauce done with tons of cheese flavor.  It was cooked right, because you don't see any sauce/oil separation.  In fact, all you do is taste the various textures, from the small clumps of cheese, to the noodles which are just cooked past al dente, but not much after.  It's like creamy goodness, yummy heaven, sometimes, I think you can make Mac and Cheese just the entire meal. \n\nHere we go, I love good food... but like a good infomercial... THERE'S MORE!\n\nWhat in the world is a Sweet Potato Cake?  That's lovely stuff, I had some, and it's like a tasty and the cream cheese frosting was amazing.  I think they spiked it, crazy amazing, not overly sweet, the texture was nice, and it melts in the mouth.\n\nHere's the kicker; I ate all the food and this doesn't really happen much, but it was perfect portion.  I'm 6'1, about 225lbs, and I thought all this southern comfort food would leave me heavy; but nope, it was just the right amount, and all for 15 dollars, with a coke.  \n\nLike many other Yelpers, KICK ASS food. Location isn't easy to find at first, but you want food, and you are in downtown, make this a perfect spot, for you and all your friends.", "business_id": "mpDxBBGywUE6GRRKja3sBA", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-04-13", "type": "review"}

First time since joining Yelp.  I was disappointed by the exceptionally long time it took for dinner to be brought to our table and by the terrible version of BBQ they offer.  \n\nDETAILS:\nWe were promptly seated and had our drink order taken.  The drinks came right, and the appetizer (soul sampler) came out in a very reasonable time.  But it took at least another 20 minutes (maybe even 30) to get our entrees: BBQ with sides, and blackened pork chops with sides. And while the sides and chops all got good comments, we did NOT like the very molasses-heavy BBQ.  This is nothing like I've ever eaten in North or South Carolina (and I'm a native).  That needs to be revamped or better disclaimed on the menu.\n\nAnyway, so unlike my previous visits, I left very disappointed and unfortunately, left my out-of-town friends with a bad impression of what has usually been a good place.", "business_id": "mpDxBBGywUE6GRRKja3sBA", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-04-19", "type": "review"}

This most recent visit was my return visit to use my unused Groupon of which I had purchased two a year ago. I went with the lamb at the suggestion of the server and the parts of it that were not burnt to a crisp were truly delicious. The potato salad was really good, as was the mac and cheese. The yams weren't even close to those that my Mom makes, but hey..maybe I'm biased. Part of the downfall of Mert's for me is due to the fact that I have had Lawan's and they are on a completely different level. Mert's seems almost a bit commercial to me and it seems that maybe the food isn't prepared fresh (although I did have to wait a long time). \n\nI'm willing to give them another try, but I don't really want to pay for it so it's likely not going to happen.

If it was purely based on service alone, it would have gotten a 1 star or 0 stars!!!  If review was based on food alone, it would have gotten 4 stars.  I decided to compromise and give them 3 stars.  \n\nOur sour dining experience starts and ends with Sharon, our waitress.  Bottom line, she was very rude and she needs to be FIRED!!!\n\nAfter we were seated, took about 5 minutes before she approached our table.  She then gave us 2 straws and did not even bother to greet us or introduce herself to us.  Then she turned her back to us before we could say anything and continued to flirt with the 2 guys in the table to the right of us.  We didn't even get a chance to ask for water.  About another 5 minutes goes by and finally we can order.  She takes our orders but throughout the entire time, we did not have her full attention, her mind was at that table!  After our orders were placed, we got our cornbread BUT she did not give us ANY utensils to eat it with.  I asked another waitress for utensils and she said she would get it for us, but she never did.  Basically, we weren't her table so she didn't want to help Sharon out.  I guess no camaraderie at this workplace.  In the meantime while we were waiting for our utensils, a party of 2 sat to the table to the left of us and they encountered the same issues with her.  They too were served their salad and cornbread without utensils.  We all had to wait at least 5 minutes if not more.  The only good thing about waiting was the table with the 2 guys to the right of us paid and left.  Now I thought she could focus more on us.  I was wrong!!  \n\nShe brings us our main dishes, fried chicken quarter and fried catfish with our sides being, mac & cheese, yams, okra with tomatoes, and collard greens.  We also ordered an appetizer and I couldn't believe our main dishes came BEFORE the appetizer.  In the end, we just took the appetizer off the bill because we finished out main courses and the appetizer never came in the interim.  Anyways, we STILL did not have our utensils.  I was pissed!!  We waited anywhere between 5-10 minutes before our utensils finally arrived.  By that time, out food was somewhat cold.  We ate our food ASAP and got the hell out of there!!  If you ever come here, don't get waited by her.  Another thing that irked me, a part of 3 ladies sat in the table to the right of us and she was definitely more friendly to them.  I won't speculate about anything but bottom line, she is a terrible waitress (definitely the bottom tier).\n\nAs for the food.  LOVED the fried chicken.  Batter wasn't thick at all.  Light and crispy and chicken was moist and tender.  The fried catfish was good as well.  Lightly battered and fried.  As for the sides, I personally do not like tomatoes and onions with my collard greens.  I prefer the smoke flavored ham collard greens.  If you like the sour/tart collar greens, then this is a place where you can get them.  The candid yams were good, but definitely not the best.  I couldn't put my taste buds on it, but the sugar they use is a little different and it doesn't seem that they used a lot of butter.  The mac & cheese was just okay, I prefer more than once type of cheese in my mac & cheese =P  (i'm just spoiled)  As for the food, I would recommend this place and I would come here again.\n\nWhen we paid for our bill at the cashier's desk, that lady even knew that we received sub-par service.  She made some jokes to make us feel better about our dining experience.

Don't tell me.\"  Then I list what I don't eat.  I also asked for sweet tea.\n    Understanding that this is soul food, real soul food.  So I was excited.  The tea came, glass was clean.  The tea.  Well, the first glass went down fast and was refilled quickly by my server with a smile.\n   Within a few minutes my food was delivered by another server.  Fried Chicken, green beans, and mac & cheese, with cornbread.  I'm happy.\n    The green beans had great flavor, very nicely cooked.  The mac & cheese is incredible, was tempted to order a side bowl of this but, hey, already ate like 4 times prior.  I picked the chicken up, white meat; and tried to bite into it.  WRONG!!!!!!!!!!\n     I warn you, wait for 20 to 30 minutes till you can get into this.  HOW THE HECK IS IT SO HOT FOR SO LONG?  Darn..  I had to cut into it with a knife to let the heat out.  Once it was safe to eat it, I was first taken to the memory of my mothers and grandma's chicken that was made at home.  Perfectly seasoned, not greasy, but just pure flavor and moist.  I finished off several more glasses of that great sweet tea and cleaned my plate.\n    Total bill was about $11, I forgot to keep the receipt, but was well worth it and the server was taken very good care of.\n    She offered cake for desert but it was HUGE, no way I could have eaten that and still be functional to see the town that night.  \n     Only downside to this place is that it is right off the street, so you get noise from the traffic and flies find their way in.

The rest of the meal, food and service, was mediocre at best. To tell the truth, the service ran along the lines of pretty poor. We sat outside and the tables around us were annoyed with the bad service too. Actually the woman at the table of three directly across from us kept telling customers to \"go away\" when they came dine. She also was served the wrong meal but no one ever came back to check on her.\n\nWe started the meal with the fried green tomatoes - Fresh green tomatoes battered in a herb and flour blend, lightly fried to perfection and served with our own remoulade sauce - it was served with our cornbread and the server said she would return with side plates but never did. She never refilled our drinks either. The fried green tomatoes had a very heavy batter on them. It was hard to find \"tomatoes\" in the dish. I would resist trying this appetizer.\n\nWe waited a long time for our main course which is why it was probably cold when it arrived at our table. Scott had the special beef tip omelet with potatoes. He had asked for wheat toast but we were told they had none and they would bring white. They never bought the toast or asked if his meal was good. I tried the Mert's famous salmon cakes. These were dry and cold and my sides the macaroni & cheese - tasty - and okra & tomatoes - greasy? - were also suffering from being left sitting waiting for someone to bring them to our table. \n\nAfter finally chasing someone down inside we got our check.

There were six adults and two kids.  We went early, about 6:30 - 7 to avoid the rush.  We parked in the garage in the same block.  The fee is validated by the restaurant.  I was very excited to try this place because my family has eaten here before and said they love it. The first thing I noticed was the floor, is was so slippy from grease that I almost fell even wearing flat shoes.  The second thing I noticed was that our waitress was just not having it that night.  She apparently didn't feel like smiling, talking, or having any patience that night.  She was so unfriendly that my uncle actually thanked her for taking the time to take our order to try to lighten her mood.  At least that made her smile. As we waited for our food I noticed two more things...the decors is pretty cool; a lot of signed and framed broadway show posters and antique bicycles, and the corn bread is amazing.  I ordered their famous salmon cakes since 1. they are famous 2. I love crab cakes 3. I love salmon. Unfortunately I did not care for them.  The flavor was really fishy and the texture was pasty.  Having cats as pets, this entree really reminded me of their canned food.  My sides were the collard green and macaroni and cheese.  This was the cheesiest and most comforting comfort macaroni I have ever had.  My husband ordered the special of the night which was pork chops stuffed with apple corn bread.  He loved it.  I sampled some of the kids' chicken tenders which were hands down the best chicken tenders I've ever had.  I even enjoyed them cold the next day.  I was not surprised that the floor was like an oil slick being that many menu items were fried.  During our dining experience the servers sang a birthday song to a customer at another table.  It was the best birthday song I've ever heard at a restaurant.  The servers were enjoying themselves singing too.  Overall my family was satisfied with their meals.  The quantity is large and the prices are low.  I took a piece of sweet potato cake home and shared it the next day with my kids.  It was still very moist and delicious.

The salmon was at least 4 - 5 oz but the cajun flavors were much more bland than I remembered them to be. The collard greens were good! Sweet and flavorful with its texture being soft but not mushy.

My first day in Charlotte and I had checked Yelp reviews to plan my meals.  The only good thing I can say is service was friendly and the cornbread was good.  \nHowever, that wasn't enough to even warrant a second star because the rest of my food was so unpleasant.  I started with the soul rolls, but thought the mixture of flavors and textures did not harmonize well.  It seemed to be a fried app just for the sake of being fried.  But without the pleasing crunch I expected.\nBut the real let down was my shrimp and grits.  What they served me was a bowl of lumpy grits (one particular lump was too big for my spoon to handle) swimming in a truly awful brown mess.  The color made me think the sauce might be rich, but it was the opposite.  I could probably recreate the flavor with water, thickener and food color - that is just how tasteless it was.  The shrimp had a strange texture that made me think it came from a can.  Then someone had chopped raw green onion and stirred it in.  That was it.  No seasoning.

The greens were cooked perfectly (taste and texture) and the mac n'cheese was good (not great). My husband enjoyed his shrimp and grits and gobbled one of my whiting fillets to go with. He got a side order of grits later because there was so much gravy on his dish. He said the addition made it perfect.  I kept taking spoonfuls of his grits because they were so deliciously prepared. I'm a snob when it comes to grits and Mert's does it right! The hubs never got his yams and the waitress did not protest when he brought it to her attention and asked to take it off the bill.

Today, we had the fried chicken which was perfectly crispy, Mac n cheese just like your grandmothers, greens like you have never had before and the amazing cornbread. We even ordered a piece of strawberry and coconut cake to go for our 3 hour drive home. Today, I was beyond disappointed. The service was a 0. The hostess was kind and seated us-I should have left her the tip. Our server came and never made eye contact with either of us. After I told her my order she repeated something completely different. So, I repeated it again as she turned around to check out the guys who walked by to sit at the table behind us. We ordered coffee in which took 10 minutes to get and we were never offered a refill. Actually, the server did not even bring our food and only came back tothe table when it was time to take our plates. Finally, we track her down to ask for the cake and a box to go. She brings the cake but no box and seemed frustrated when I ask for the box again. My boyfriend spoke up and ask for the check. She laid it down and walked off. I decided to pay at the door only to be told to go back to my table and my server would have to take my payment. I told her I didn't want to wait. She said I will have her come up. Then, 5 minutes later she came upset and rang me up and laid the my receipt down and said you can just leave the signed copy here and walked off. Never have I ever actually left a restaurant and not left a tip. Today was the first time  I have actually had my dining experience ruined by poor service. I did not leave a tip. It's really a shame because as I said the food here is exceptional but I refuse to go back to such poor customer service.", "business_id": "mpDxBBGywUE6GRRKja3sBA", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-04-19", "type": "review"}

Maybe it was because this joint was so hyped by my coworker, but Merts kind of disappointed me.  I took a stroll from my hotel and arrived at Merts and the first thing I see is a line out the door.  I think to myself \"This place has got to be good if people are willing to wait outside on a cold and cloudy day like this.\"  I step into Merts and the first thing I notice is the dim lighting.  While it the environment looked comfy, it was just so jam packed that immediately I thought about leaving and coming back at a later time.  In the end I just decided to get takeout.  Since the place was so busy, it took me a long time, maybe 10 minutes? to place an order.  Then I waited another 20 minutes for them to get me my food.  Maybe it's just the Sunday Lunch rush, but the place is way understaffed and way too small to cater to so many patrons. \n\nNow onto the food.  After receiving my food I walked back to my hotel to enjoy some BBQ.  I want to start off by saying that the cornbread that came with my food was probably the highlight of the meal.  It was just that good.  I also got mac and cheese, BBQ ribs, and green beans.  The mac cheese were definitely disappointing, not very gooey with cheese and was just overall something I could have made better at home.  The ribs while tasty, were over sauced and a bit tough.  The green beans were just green beans and I didnt have too high of an expectation for them, but they were so mushy and watery that I couldn't believe that Merts would serve it and charge money for them.\n\nOverall, the experience was kind of negative, but I haven't given up on Merts.  A lot of people seem to have had a good experience here and I will definitely give it another shot the next time I'm here.", "business_id": "mpDxBBGywUE6GRRKja3sBA", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-04-26", "type": "review"}

I had been wanting to eat here for years, especially after seeing them on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives. I'm such a foodie so I love trying new places.\n\nHate that we had to pay to park, but that's the downside to eating somewhere in the city. It was a beautiful night and we got to eat out front. Food was GREAT. Service, not so much. We were seated before another table, and they were greeted and brought drinks out to. I had to get up after about 10 minutes of sitting there and ask if we had a server. The hostess said our server was busy so she'd take our drink order. Right after that, he came over to our table and got our order.\n\nFirst, they bring out the cornbread. Omg! Best freakin cornbread I've ever had in my life!! It was so moist and just absolutely delicious. I ordered fried chicken, bbq beef ribs, mac n cheese, and green beans. The fried chicken was a little disappointing as I anticipated it to have more flavor than it did. It was kind of bland. The ribs were decent, a little too fatty but that is to be expected. Mac n cheese was off the chain. Green beans were just that, nothing special. My son had green beans, mac n cheese, and homefries. He didn't care for the homefries cause they were more like saut\u00e9ed potatoes and he prefers fries. My husband had the shrimp po'boy and homefries. He said his was good.\n\nOur drinks stayed empty for the most part so service needs to be better. We left an 18% tip (he's lucky he got that), and the server picked the receipt up before we left and had an ugly look on his face like we didn't leave enough. Sorry, next time you should pay more attention to your tables. They weren't that busy. There were plenty of empty tables. \n\nAll in all, it was a nice family dinner in the city.

She wanted to go to Mimosa Grill as I had taken her there in the past and she loved it! \nWhen we arrived, the restaurant was empty. The Hostess explained that they had just finished a buyout for 160 people and that we were the first seated after that. Our Server, Tom, was prompt in greeting us and setting menus. The nightly \"Sustainable Seafood\" feature sounded amazing, and was a brilliant idea. We were in the mood for Steak however, and so we both ordered the Filet, with Smoked corn and Anson mills grit cake, and asparagus. The order of Hush puppies (an institution) was ordered for the first course. We also wanted something from the chef and were sent a scallop duo. \nThe Scallop dish was a TRIUMPH! The first scallop, seared beautifully, was atop a Tempura fried Meyer Lemon Wheel, ditalini pasta, and blistered local tomatoes. The second scallop, seared perfectly as well, was collared with pork belly lardon, and set atop an English pea and mint puree and accompanied by a fresh Morel Mushroom. AMAZING. The Pea Puree was perfect. a great blend of texture, essence of the mint, and taste. I could have eaten it as a soup! \nThe Hush puppies came out and were delicious as always, although, a little salty, we still found them just as remembered, outstanding. \nFilets arrived at the table and smelled of the wood burning grill. One of the main reasons I order a steak at Mimosa is because of the Grill. To my knowledge, no other restaurant in the city is currently using wood int he grills. I love this! The flavor is so multidimensional and savory. \nThe filets came with asparagus, which was soft and sweet. The grit cake, again, had a generous amount of salt, but still added the contrast between sweet, and salty. My Steak, Rare, was so good that it didn't last long, and Granny's (which she couldn't finish) ended up on my plate. Service the whole time was pleasant, courteous and unobtrusive, all qualities I think Tripp Cagle (GM) and staff do a really great job in training the staff. \nAlexis Mejia, in my opinion is one of Charlotte's up-and-coming pastry chefs and has really taken the Mimosa dessert menu to new heights with items such as Peanut Butter Mousse Bombe with Concord grape granita (which we ordered) and the Key lime Cheesecake with Candied Orange Rind. All southern favorites, with some really fun accents! \nI will say, I have always loved this place and get a feeling of nostalgia when I walk down the long hallway that is the dining room and feel the warmth from the sandstone columns.

Liked the decor - classy and understated; nice lighting and it wasn't noisy (that's an important thing for me - I hate having to hear the chatter and cacophony from neighboring tables in crowded restaurants!)\nThe special for the evening was Seabass and I decided to go for it. They said I could replace anything I didn't like and so I went with asparagus instead of artichokes which is what they were offering. It was an INCREDIBLE dish! Amazing flavors and perfectly cooked fish. Even the portion was perfect (this is usually a grouse for me at these fancy restaurants - I feel like I haven't gotten my money's worth quite often). Just filling enough to leave some space for dessert. They have a nice selection of desserts too. I went for the Chocolate and Mint Torte. It was excellent! Great way to finish off the meal.\nMy friend had the Salmon and a gingerbread-based dessert. He said his food was really tasty too.\nThe service was good too. As is the case quite often, the waitress didn't make it easy to select an entree (which I guess is a good thing because she had wonderful things to say about all the options I was considering!).

Why don't we walk back to Tryon and take a stroll down the street? If nothing sounds better, we'll go back to Mimosa,\" I suggested. \n\nAnd we did just that.

They melted in your mouth.\n\nThen we had the meat and cheese platter. We had the spicy coppa with goat cheese and feta (I forget which of each). Probably my favorite part of the mean. They serve the platter with crackers, fresh fig jam and honey. Pairing that with the cheese and meat was to die for. I'd go back JUST for that.\n\nWe then split the stuffed chicken with their brussel sprouts. I'm a fan of brussel sprouts but these were like unlike any I've had, they were cooked to perfection with honey, walnuts, bacon, and other deliciousness. Get them, hands down. \n\nThe chicken was perfectly stuffed, not heavy handed just the right amount of everything. Super tender and juicy!

So, I slid all the toppings off the pizza, ate the dough and ate the garlic knots, after having tried to pick through the lettuce and onions for something fresh, NO.\nI should have known this would have been a bad experience when the guy at the counter was rude and things moved very slowly with only three people in the restaurant.

It is a relatively small space in the Hearst Tower, but it is dimly lit and the wait staff is professional, attentive and courteous.\n\nNow the food. Yes, it appears to be \"authentic\" Italian. It helps when you have several Waiters FROM Italy and they say it is 99% the same as \"home.\" This is a good thing (and glad it's not of the Olive Garden kind of \"Italian.\") \n\nI had the Veal Osso Bucco. Now I rarely eat this out as it IS a very hard dish to cook WELL. Thankfully, the chef here knew what he was doing as the meat was \"fall off the bone\" tender and very flavorful with a rich red sauce and of course, lots of garlic! Yummy!\n\nMy wife ordered the Pasta Carbonara which is one of MY very favorites. Kind of hard to go wrong with anything that has bacon/pancetta in it! And this one was RICH with their creamy and flavorful parmesan cheese white sauce. Delish!\n\nWe had some sort of an Italian ice cream (NOT gelato!) for dessert, but this was very unique, with almonds in it and an unctuous caramel sauce drizzled over it. I cannot for the life of me remember the name but is was outrageously delicious!\n\nOnly \"complaint\" was that the Caprese salad for the appetizer was very, very tiny for the price. Also my Osso Bucco did NOT come with pasta....had to order that for $6 separately.\n\nWine selection is small but nicely picked. By the glass prices are typically around $9 for a good glass.

Check. \n\nI loved Luce! I stopped by for dinner last night and was thoroughly impressed with everything. I was greeted immediately upon entering the restaurant and was seated right away. I dined alone but certainly did not feel that I was alone. The staff came by to check on me every once in a while to make sure that I was happy and enjoying my meal. They did not ignore me or give less than ideal service because I was by myself either. My server, was knowledgeable about the menu and gave great suggestions and told me about the specials.  \n\nIt was really hard to make a decision because everything on the menu sounded so delicious that I wanted a little of everything. I opted for only the spinach pappadelle pasta with oxtail ragu. I was not disappointed one bit. This was the first time I had pappadelle pasta and enjoyed it immensely. The restaurant makes their pasta in house and you can definitely tell. It was cooked perfectly and the oxtail ragu was nice and tender and they do not skimp on the dish. I ordered the smaller plate because I wanted to save room for dessert. I'm glad I did because I was getting quite full by the time I got to my third to last bite of the main entree. \n\nFor dessert I chose the creme brulee infused with rosemary. The combination sounded really odd but I decided to go for it. I love trying new things. The manager stated that if I did not enjoy it that they would switch it out for me. I had no regrets whatsoever.  I loved how the creme was soft and smooth and there was a touch of rosemary lightly caressing your tongue. My server said that they only put the rosemary in for a few seconds to infuse the creme and take it out. (I'm going to steal this idea the next time I make creme brulee.) The creme was not to sweet because it was balanced with the crunchy torched sugar on top. The strawberries, raspberry and blueberry topped off a perfect dessert. I ordered coffee to go with my dessert to cleanse my palate. \n\nThis is a home run for Luce in my book.

The hotel is on the edge of the \"happening\" area of the city but there is a trolley that runs every 10 minutes up to 10(ish) nightly or a 5 minute cab ride to some of the best restaurants in the area.  \n\nThe hotel has nice rooms that are clean and spacious.

You have a choice of getting the extra points or breakfast vouchers.  Here is my suggestion that works every time for those that stay in the same hotel for weeks at a time.  If you are there for a week, book for 3.  Take the breakfast vouchers.  Then check out at the end of the week.  The next week you can elect the points, use one of those quality white out tapes and presto.....

I have lived through their growing pains, their remodeling, and their re-birth. Right now, the HGI is at the top of their game.\n\nThe lobby was recently redecorated and has a crisp, modern feel. I liked the old wood-heavy look, but this open-space, airy look is also quite nice. The front desk staff is very friendly although I would love to see the check-in process streamlined. (The Hyatt Andaz has you check in with a personal concierge, and other hotels are completely done on iPads.) \n\nThe rooms are spacious enough; I usually get a 2-room suite with a jacuzzi. While I rarely use the jacuzzi, I like the second room for the extra space. The hotel maid staff is fantastic. Day after day they do an amazing job of making my place look fresh. On occasion, a maid does forget to replenish coffee or leave conditioner in the bath, but a call to the front desk fixes that.\n\nUnlike some who complain, I like the location of the hotel. It's off the main strip, but only takes a 5 minute stroll in this very walkable and safe city. Within minutes I'm at the Mint Museum, at the Epicenter for a movie, relaxing on the Green, or in a number of great restaurants.\n\nSpeaking of restaurants, the HGI on-site restaurant is quite good. The selections change several times a year and everything is delicious. A giant helping of hummus for $5? Yes, please. Fresh fish? Excellent.\n\nThere's free on-site laundry which is worth staying here alone. The fitness center is small, but this is a hotel (and a budget one at that), not a Gold's Gym (which is a few blocks over.) \n\nRegulating temperatures in the room can be tricky depending on what kind of thermostat your room(s) have. The WiFi issues seem to have been resolved, thanks to lots of complaining and that the Democratic National Convention came through last year. Yes, the street can be a little noisy with a siren from time to time, but I'm from Cleveland. I sleep better with noise.\n\nTip: Ask for a room that looks over the NASCAR museum.

The service was excellent, as was the rest of the meal, but when the main course is a dud, you can't help but leave disappointed.  It was my 1st visit to the highly-regarded restaurant, and I expected a 5-star experience.", "business_id": "CChwRoYVXA3QZulS8a6xOQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-03-09", "type": "review"}

Armin and the crew were on top of their game. Rebecca did an admirable job of making the night special - even putting together an anniversary desert and picture for us before we left.\n\nEach of the main courses was amazing. The only downside was that the sides didn't really live up to the main dishes. Since there was so much food, we probably would have been fine without them, but wanted to have something other than steak.

I really enjoy The Capital Grill most times and this experience left a poor taste for the Charlotte location. Our service and the food was, at best, two-star. I know I did not have the steak but typically I can count on this chain to deliver a good meal - if not great (my last visit in Downers Grove, IL in December was fabulous).\n\nWhen we were told we could not get a table for an hour we decided to sit at the bar.  After about 15 minutes the host said he could seat us - we should have been suspicious at this point. We went outside to our table that had trash and leaves around the edges of the patio (hey, wait they didn't just blow there last night).  Our tablecloth had stains and spots on the silverware. \n\nIt took a good 15-20 minutes for our server to come take an order after bread and water were dropped. We asked to start with the fresh mozzarella, tomato, and basil with 12-year aged balsamic. When it arrived it was two neat stacks on one plate and one empty plate. When we asked the server why it was not split his response was \"we can't split this salad.\" Ok - not as if we asked to split an escargot- the salad was almost perfectly portioned for two. Not to bother we just shared. The sliced tomatoes were mealy and flavorless and only one leaf of basil per stack. There was a nice marinated grape tomato as a garnish but I didn't pay for a tasty garnish. \n\nThe main course we tried the grouper special. I've had better. The grouper was ok (notice the theme) but the shrimp that came with the special was overlooked and tough. Our sides - saut\u00e9ed spinach and the wild mushrooms were good. We ordered a 1/2 order of both which is just perfect for two people. My only comment is we pulled eight whole cloves of garlic out of the spinach before eating it. Vampires beware ,,,\n\nOur drinks were never tended too and the front server never bothered to follow up on the salad. I hope everyone inside had a better experience.", "business_id": "CChwRoYVXA3QZulS8a6xOQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-03-20", "type": "review"}

But when you're on corporate account and/or just need to impress your lunch or dinner companions, it is very hard to go wrong here both in the wine and food departments.  And the jacketed dinner service?  Well, I always feel extremely well taken care of here.  \n\nAside from one of the best looking bars in all of uptown, the space is amazing, with a partially open kitchen with adjacent wine room and plenty of dark wood and rich, dense carpet.  It very much has that \"country club\" look and feel to it.  \n\nThat ambiance easily carries over to the menu, which is small but that just belies how big the typical portions are.  The same should be said for the calorie count of most offerings.  Friends, leave the diet at the door and prepare to splurge, it's just about impossible not to.  From the decadent lobster bisque soup to the crunchy, earthy goodness of truffled french fries, you simply can't stay within a reasonable calorie count for a proper meal here.  So just forget it, and enjoy.\n\nStandouts for me include the calamari, served with peppers which are not too hot but add a perfect tang to the rich savoriness of the batter than surrounds the actual rings and other bits of delicious seafood.  This could be a meal unto itself, yet it's just their most popular starter.  \n\nSteaks do reign on the entree menu, and I recommend going with the options which include the large chunks of fresh crab meat on top.  Why not take good to great?  But I am currently obsessing over the seared tuna with tri-dipping sauces and gingered rice.  Maybe it's the wasabi oil alone, with the palette cleansing bite that comes with every taste?  Whatever it is, I call it insane and it's a struggle not to order it again and again.\n\nBut you mustn't stop there, as dessert is just as over the top as everything else in the meal.  Mile-high cheesecake, a decadent chocolate layer cake, creme burulee, and more seasonal offerings.  One is typically plenty to share, or try a few and let the staff box it up for take-home enjoyment afterward.\n\nThe staff really cater to your special birthday and anniversary events, so long as you let them know ahead of time, so do share that at the time of reservation.  During late summer, they also have a wine event called The Generous Pour.  It's a fantastic deal that I highly recommend- wine all night long for a very reasonable beverage surcharge.  \n\nSo, chain or not, this place is great for putting on the swag and showing your guests or yourself a fancy meal out.

It is certainly a good thing that Bob Johnson is out of the picture - though his name is still on the team itself - and hopefully Michael Jordan will do a better job in the future, but for now the direction is still up in the air (see how I did that?).\n\nYou will also find nights where some of Charlotte's other 'elites', such as DeAngelo Williams, Jimmie Johnson, Steve Smith, Thomas Davis and even the Yelp crew show up to lend their support, and that is cool.  The arena/team staff is friendly, the facilities are excellent, and it is certainly good for a night out.  If the team can come together to post some wins, it will truly be a \"can't miss\" destination.", "business_id": "nRdpk6Azj6CYkqPrH0Nr7A", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-03-08", "type": "review"}

The venue they play in (Time Warner Area) is located right in the middle of uptown with plenty of parking options nearby. This last time we got really lucky and found a spot on the street two blocks down = free parking. The most expensive parking option is the lot right next to the entrance at $15, but close by options can be found for $5. \n\nI've been to a couple of their games this season and though they aren't quite up there yet, they are improving and provide great entertainment. The view from the nose bleed sections are pretty good, unless you get stuck behind a handrail. And the view from a box suite is great. The between play entertainment is fun to watch and very interactive. They definitely know how to engage the fans. \n\nThere are plenty of vendors walking through the stands selling popcorn and cotton candy.

The Bobcats seem to be one of those teams that manages to lose the games they should win easily, and win the games that nobody expects! \n\nI've been to see the Bobcats play the Lakers (3 times), the Celtics (once), the Mavericks (once), and the Knicks (my recent check-in). Most of those games we were not favored to win, but managed to pull it out anyway. Maybe I'm a lucky charm? Probably not. ;) \n\nParking isn't really a problem unless you're expecting to park for free. The BB&T garage is super convenient to both the arena and a lot of Charlotte nightlife. \n\nThey sell some liquor drinks at the arena (stands), but they are overpriced and kind of weak so I'd recommend getting a (still overpriced) beer if you are looking for a little buzz.\n\nOne thing my husband and I always comment on is how terrible the Bobcats can be about getting the crowd involved. The cheerleaders do not lead the audience in cheering; they used to have a man-and-woman announcer-types team that did some commentary but they seem to have disappeared this year. (Probably not very popular because the woman in particular was kind of annoying.) The screens over the court are rarely used for anything fun other than occasional \"dance parties\" and \"celebrity look-a-likes\" (which, btw, the people NEVER look like the celebrities. Whomever is in charge of this needs to renew his/her subscription to US Weekly or something.. or better yet, Bobcats, are y'all hiring? I could blow this guy/girl out of the water!) \n\nOverall that is important because it means that unless the game is close in the 4th quarter, the audience plays almost no role in the game. I would say the Bobcats have virtually no home-court advantage, particularly when playing a team like the Knicks (when there are so many NY transplants down here)! Half the fans there are cheering for the other team! It is very quiet during the first half of the games. Much less vocal fans than even the Panthers and LEAPS AND BOUNDS below the decibal level of the RBC Center when the Hurricanes play!  \n\nThe Bobcat cheerleaders, however, are the biggest disappointment to me. Consistently. They seem to be there purely for overly-tanned, hair-extensioned, fake-breasted decorations. There is one girl on the squad who can execute any tumbling maneuvers at all, judging by their routines, and their \"dancing\" looks like they pulled girls out of a local nightclub, or worse yet, topless bar. One year I went to a game and they were wearing one-piece orange-and-white outfits and thigh-high white platform boots, that LITERALLY looked like a cross between Julia Robert's outfit on the cover of Pretty Woman, and the Hooters uniform! \n\nCompared to NFL cheerleaders who are usually classically trained (whether their routines showcase it or not), they are a huge disappointment if you actually expect them to get the crowd hyped up. I suspect their real purpose is just to tittilate rich men at season ticketholder events, and make Jordan some money off merchandising through sales of their calendars, swimsuit videos, etc.\n\nOverall though I will be back to cheer for the team.

That's before I even went into the pornographic details about how it was swimming in Makers Mark Caramel Bourbon Sauce that was set ablaze. So naughty.\n\nI mean, I don't even like donuts all that much but it just felt wrong not to order an item that was just so blatantly taunting. \n\nI kept my expectations at bay before dining here. It's located inside of the City Center Marriott so I was very aware that the food may be uninspiring and generic. But what I found is that Savannah Red is actually a fabulous restaurant that stands on it's own two feet, with delicious food at tasty price points\n \nThings started off nicely with an amuse bouche of cauliflower soup, which was rich and delicious.\n\nI like to just nibble and taste so I ordered a few small dishes. The Jumbo Crab Cakes ($8) were pretty good, but keep in mind that the Cilantro Avocado Emulsion is little a small dollop on the plate. The Diver Scallop Ravioli w/ cream sauce, wilted greens, and Sriracha gastrique ($8) was my far my favorite dish ordered. You've got to try it. the greens are cooked perfectly and the two ravioli are large, fresh and meaty. \n\nI was given a bit of sorbet to cleanse the palate before being presented with my Pear and Endive salad, blue cheese brulee and pink apple vinaigrette. So good!\n\nInitially, I had no plans on ordering dessert. But the bread pudding was only $6 and sounded so novel that I had to give it a try. If you like donuts, you will love it. For my own personal taste (I'm not huge on donuts) it was a bit too sweet, but the preparation and plating were fabulous!\n\nOverall, an excellent restaurant with stellar service and an exciting menu.", "business_id": "C9CF7p53Y0L5ErKRhhFhng", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-03-01", "type": "review"}

The Cutter's Cigar Bar is located in the Marriott Hotel (Downtown Charlotte). \n\nFirst of all let me just say this, don't go to a cigar bar unless you like the smell of cigars, smoke them, or are at least willing to try one. Stay back, otherwise your just going to be a pain in the a$$, sitting around huffin and puffin with a dry sullen look on your face, wondering why everyone is so damn relaxed? I don't hang with these people, but I've seen them and felt sorry for whoever invited them. \n\nAs one chick with bodycon Kim K dress and well coifed weave was with a group of men and protested aloud that cigar smoking was not lady like, and I'm thinking like neither are your hair a$$ legs?! But anyways.... \n\nThe staff is very knowledgeable about the products that they sell. If you are a whiskey Bourbon drinker, these sweet southern \"ladytenders\" know how to knock a grown man off his feet as my boy (a man in his 40's) couldn't even finish his whiskey with bitters, because it was so damn strong.\n\nI had a French Martini that was a little on the hard side, they ran out of Chambord, no biggie, the bartender just added extra pineapple juice. I had more of a lady's cigar per say. The bartender recommended this fabulous Vanilla and Cognac medium sized cigar by C.A.O called Moontrance. C.A.O has an array of vanilla and honey flavored selections that make a unique gift for say a light to medium weight cigar smoker.  The drinks n' smokes complimented each other well, after sitting in a car for 8 hours, that was the perfect way to unwind. \n\nI went back a day later and bought a medium grade cigar for my brother and a chocolate flavored cigar by Acid for myself.", "business_id": "7BVCmaxhvXgEpx7J-SQ4QA", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-03-07", "type": "review"}

I will admit that I am a Panthers loyalist but that's not what this is about. There are plenty of stadiums known for the poor treatment of visiting team fans, the Philadelphia Eagles have a courtroom built in to theirs, but you won't have to worry about that in Charlotte. Panthers fans are still new to this whole NFL thing and it shows. Unlike a Tarheels game, visiting fans are treated like guests, it's disgusting. And don't worry if you're team is losing, Panthers fans are also known for trying to do the wave while their team is on offense (when you're supposed to be silent). I once saw a Panthers fan congratulate the opposing teams fan on a touchdown, terrible.\nThe stadium food is pretty great with the addition of Carolina BBQ to the menu but surprisingly, you can't smoke in your seat. Also, don't worry about missing church, there is a prayer said before the game.\n\nWARNING: Do not try to tailgate with the majority of the people before the game. Too much wine and cheese can make you sick.   Also, once Panthers fans get drunk the mood can shift quickly (they are still southerners after all) and you can quickly become an enemy, not because your team is winning but because you are \"too prideful\" about it and some may feel the need to \"defend their honor\" (especially if you're from the North, you know how it is). I once saw a woman (an Eagles fan) get punched by a female Panthers fan wearing a team color Doctor Seuss hat, an all around weird experience.\nOverall, this stadium gets a high score for you and depresses me.", "business_id": "g-Q7G5Q2zHb1BqoF8pq-OA", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-04-11", "type": "review"}

Deny me and all hell will open up.\n\nWith that said, I was invited to LeVecchia' s for my co-worker's going away party.  I am not from Charlotte, so I popped the address in my GPS and up I-77 South I went.  I drove past this place 3 times, because you cannot see if from the street. It is inside the Hearst building (which I did not know), which you have to walk up to and there are no signs on the street, that I saw, that tell you that the restaurant is there.  \n\nFinally, I get there and immediately ask about the WhiteWater Mussels.  YES! They are Prince Edward Island! Bingo! One order please. Fifteen minutes later, our server brings out this beautiful plate of mussels. They ahd the most delicious sauce and tomato concoction ever. Yes, I shared about 5 out of the 20 I was given, but I am stingy, so the rest were mine. They were so good and meaty. They were fresh and not gritty. If only they had been a little bigger, they would have been perfect.  I love mussels.  Beware of the price through- $11.95. Not bad, but it can cut you deeply when you read the rest of the menu.\n\nThe menu selection is not that great. It's only 2 pages and it's categories are Greens (Salads), Steak and Seafood. That's it. Why isn't the selection larger? Why are the prices so high? Why does a 6 oz Filet Mignon cost $26.95?  What's going on? I know inflation is bad, but give me a break somewhere please!\n\nSince the selection was slim, I ordered the 6 oz Filet, Medium with asparagus and red wine reduction.  It was very delicious, smooth and buttery, but I am still on the fence as to if it was $26.95 delicious.  I would have loved it I could have gotten 2 more oz, but that was not an option.  I don't know yet.\n\nAll in all, our service was good for serving 15 people and the food came out in a timely manner for a party that large.

First time I've ever seen a hostess at any decent restaurant sitting down smack at the entrance... something sloppy about that.  Our party of 4 decided to sit out on the patio.  We had to wait a good while before our waitress appeared (frankly we had to ask if she's our waitress as she walked right by us without acknowledging anyone), who wasn't at all enthusiastic or apologetic. She asked us for our drink order, yet we had no wine list.  She didn't even bother to light the candle that's sitting on the table.  We ended up getting the one from next table on our own.  The delivery of food was chaotic, 3 people for 4 patrons and it was all over the place.  I waited table before, 4 tops aren't difficult to manage.  Needless to say, verdict on service is: NOT GOOD, plenty of room for improvement.\n\nNow, food...  I ordered the crab cake appetizer and the crab & corn chowder.  Other items ordered were crusted halibut, stuffed shrimp and seared tuna.  I can't speak for others, but my crabcake was awful.  The crab meat was more shred-y than lumpy (to me an indication of lesser quality crab meat).  It was overly seasoned with some kind of vinaigrette based product that I barely could taste the crab.  It was simply overpowering and it was not complementary to the dish.  I never not finish my food, let alone crab cake, and I couldn't finish it.  The soup was good.  Creamy and a good balance between sweet & salty with the corn, and the crab meat was lumpier.  I tasted a bite of the halibut, it was good, but not sure if mashed potato is the best side option.  The stuffed shrimp was ok... at least the crab meat they used with the shrimp doesn't have that awful seasoning.  Verdict on food: HAD BETTER, for a restaurant that specializes in seafood, that was one disappointing crab cake.\n\nLastly, the surrounding.  We were very impressed with the patio.  For a space that overlooks the back of Connelly's... I was skeptical of sitting out there.  But it's well put together.  The big pillar actually blocks the non-scenic view.  With the nice early summer/late spring breeze, I think this was the most enjoyable part of the dinner.... that and the bread & herb garlic butter.", "business_id": "TLrX4FECQDFz-E45TI_9ow", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-05-01", "type": "review"}

You can have mundane dishes but when your service is lack luster....you'll lose me as a fan.  I've felt better served at Chic-fil-A than this place.  Sad.  We walk in, decide on the patio to eat.  Now, as most will agree when you chose to sit in a outdoor patio area, you always gamble on service.  Easy to be forgotten outside!  We were seated right away and I will interject at this point that the patio was actually impressive given the fact there is absolutely no city view, it's was still nice and probably a good spot to have a glass of wine and lounge.  There is a fairly large sofa on the patio that appeared comfy (although untested!)  Ok, back to the service issues, we sit down and that's where the service basically ended.  Hahaha...I mean it was a solid 10-15 minutes before we were even approached by our waitress.  And her first order of business was to ask if we wanted water? Why not just bring the water out, I mean my guess is 80% of people are going to want to have a glass regardless.  After our water order she said, \"What else would you like to drink\".  I promptly responded with \"I'm really unsure considering I have no wine/specialty drink menu to look at\".  Maybe a little forward but I have no patience for untimely service, especially if it's a place that's in a niche of restaurants that's striving to be in the upper echelon.  After drinks are delivered, we ordered our food.  During the wait for the food, the couple we were dining with noted that we had a candle on the table all be it, unlit.  ??? So my friend took care of that situation by taking a nearby table's candle in exchange for ours...hahaha....love it!  \n\nSo finally our food arrives, and it's like a shuffle game, three servers, four dishes all criss crossing each of us trying to figure out who ordered what.  I think I actually laughed out loud at this moment.  \n\nIn terms of the food, personally I had the grilled yellow fin tun (medium rare) served with baby spinach and jasmine rice.  No here, I can't complain, the tuna was fantastic, the rice was very light and the spinach was cooked to perfection.

Becuase I wanted an entree with chicken as the protein and there was not a single chicken entree on the limited menu (I am not counting the chicken and shrimp jambalaya).  I also didn't appreciate that they served olives with the pits in a salad...a recipe for cracked or chipped dental work.  \n\nLastly, our waiter forgot our drinks and bread after several requests  and then messed up our bills (yes, we split checks...shame on us).

Hot or cold, healthy or cupcakes, you can find something to please even the pickiest of eaters.  There are two entrances (one on 6th Street, one on Tryon), and if the line is too crowded at one, I suggest checking out the other (when we were there, 40 people must have been waiting in line at 6th Street, but upstairs on Tryon was empty).

The owner is the sweet little lady running the register from open to close...I've never been in here when she wasn't working.  She's helpful, friendly, and fast with the service!  A previous reviewer mentioned that the \"interior is nothing really to write home about\".  He's correct; and that is EXACTLY how I want my diners to look!\n\nThe coffee selection is great...always have several different blends to choose from at any time of the day...from light to dark roasts.  I try a different varietal everytime I'm in this place, which is easily 3 times a week.  A far cry from Starbucks commercialized dirty dishwater.\n\nDon't be afraid to stray off the menu and try specials!  the board by the register is full of them, different every day.  Get there early though...they have been known to run out of their specials on occassion (God Bless the days they run the chicken burrito special).  Although I'm disappointed when I get there after the last special has been sold, this does not bug me...it simply lets me know that they don't keep anything around longer than a day!  Everything is very fresh in here.\n\nIf you feel like taking the path more traveled (God knows, its a well-worn path by yours truely), try the Loaded/Stuffed Hashbrown breakfast....you know how, when you get a loaded baked potato, all the sour cream, cheese, and bacon are gone in the first few bites and you still have 70% of a dry baked potato left on your plate, screaming for more accoutrement?  This dish has solved that riddle.  I would be perfectly happy paying the asking price for just the stuffed hashbrowns, but the icing on the hashbrown cake is two eggs \"your way\" and your choice of toast.  \n\nCan't beat it.", "business_id": "qqVmZ3H7j06pcJFaSA4pcg", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-05-17", "type": "review"}

The first time they were out of parmesean cheese, the second time they were out of the usual sliced white meat chicken and replaced it with what appeared to be shredded leg meat and finally today they only had half a small to go cup of dressing.  All three of these items seem to be very important to making a salad that only has 4 ingredients.  If I would have known this upfront I would not order the cesear salad.  I guess I should always ask before I order to ensure that they have all of the ingredients.  In addition, it seems a little pricey for what they offer.

Which is fine, as some of their lots have reasonable rates.  My reason for the low review comes from the user experience side of thing, and their overall customer service.\n\nMy main problem with them (aside from rude people), is that there is no way to update your payment information online.  My credit card was cancelled, and upon receiving my new card (mid-March), I called immediately to update my information so, come April, they would have updated information.  Obviously I would have much rather done this all online, but alas, there was no other option but to call.  They assured me that the new card was placed on file, and we were good to go.  Fast forward to April 5th, and I receive an email saying that my card did not go through and I would be fined an additional $25.  THEY HAD CHARGED THE WRONG CARD.  They sent me this email on Saturday afternoon, and I immediately called, only to be told that the people who handle payments don't work on weekends and I would need to call back during business hours (the girl could have been a lot nicer).\n\nI call first thing Monday morning, and explain what happen--not in an accusing tone by any means, because I'm well aware that the likelihood of the girl I was speaking to having made this mistake was slim, so why yell at the messenger?  She immediately responded in a defensive tone, saying there is no way that error could have occurred, and it was my fault for not giving them the new information.  I tried to explain again the course of events, and she would not have it.  She updated my credit card information, now for the second time, so let's see if it goes through for May.\n\nOverall, here is how I feel:\n\n+Tremendous amount of parking options offered in Uptown\n-Poor customer service\n-Poor user experience\n-Overpriced\n\nIf you're going to take hundreds of dollars for me every year, at least give me decent people.

I'm giving it 3 stars for the great customer service. They definitely had that down. But that's about it. This hotel is highly overpriced and the valet sucked! One night cost us $183 altogether with tax. Almost $200 to stay in a hotel in CHARLOTTE, NC? You've got to be kidding me. I pay less than that per night in Miami and Vegas and the hotels are better.\n\nThis hotel is old but you can tell they've tried to do some renovations. However, we had to literally SLAM our bathroom door to get it to close. The beds in our room reminded me of something from middle school...very juvenile looking. Double beds don't have to look that juvenile...geesh. The rooms are also pretty small. \n\nAND valet sucked! One evening there was a lot of traffic and my car was parked in their overflow lot. Okay...I can understand this. But I wonder how far the overflow lot was because they returned my car to me on E. It was getting close to E but was definitely not close enough to where it should have been returned on E.\n\nUpon checking out, valet service was the worse! They literally lost my car. They could not remember where it was parked. I would say the evening before it took them 20 minutes to bring my car...this time had to take around 30. The valet attendants even kept saying, \"You're still here?\" I'm not sure how many times I heard that.\n\nOn another note...housekeeping did come by with a complimentary bottle of water the evening we were there. It was a nice gesture...but maybe they should check and see how many guests are booked for each room because there were 2 of us and we were not about to share that one bottle of water. \n\nOn an end note...some creeps were staying on our floor. They must have watched us walk into our room late that night even though we tried our best to make sure they did not see which room we went into. And it didn't help that our room was back in the cut on the 14th floor. You would have definitely thought our room was a housekeeping room due to where it was located. Anyway, the creeps started doing the creepiest knock on our door at around 2am. It sounded like a knock off a horror movie. They left and came back a few times so we had to call the front desk and ask them to patrol our floor. My best-friend told me while I was in the shower the next morning, the creeps came back doing the same scary knock...glad I made it out of the Omni okay! \n\nAll in all, I truly appreciate their great customer service but I would never stay here again unless it was for free.", "business_id": "QThlnQ7AvzZwXHKD5DjdCw", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-03-22", "type": "review"}

Even we have updated our toilets in our 90's home.  Not only slow, but also looked like it was going to overflow every time.

We didn't have reservations, and still got in. Anytime there's a nice restaurant in Uptown Charlotte that you can get in to immediately without reservations on a busy evening, either it's not actually a nice restaurant, or you're the luckiest person in the world.  I would recommend reservations, but clearly they're not necessary in a pinch.  \n\n2.  The atmosphere is great. I felt cooler just being there.  The tables were covered with these cool mats that made them look like iridescent tile. My only complaint here is that we were pretty close to our neighbors at the next table, it almost felt like dinner for 4. \n\n3. Wine specials! We were there for 1/2-price wine by the glass, and both got to try some good reds. I don't remember the specifics--my husband got a Tempranillo to start, and I got a Malbec, I think.  We enjoyed both wines. After that, I don't remember our selections.\n\n4.  The menu featured some great-sounding dishes, even though both of us got the bison special.  I loved everything on the plate. It was served over grits (one of my favorites) with wilted spinach, I think. The bison itself was very delicious. I like my meat rare, and this was cooked (or rather, not cooked) to perfection.   They messed up my husband's order, but recovered quickly, and he still left pleased.\n\n5. And finally, the bowl of foil-wrapped fruit candies by the door sent me home very happy!\n\nThe only thing that was a little sub-par was the service. They were very busy, and I think they were short-staffed. I don't think it was our waiter's fault that Jim's order was wrong, but he was not as apologetic as I would have liked. It also took him a few more minutes than it should have to check on us, and discover the mistake.

I give it an extra star because it is an independent, non-chain store, but -- measured against other local and regional independents -- this is nothing special.  Indeed, for an independent, it is light on charm and has little unique to recommend it: almost as if they simply took a Borders and jettisoned 90% of the books.  This is a simple, decent, independent bookstore that would be much better if the staff was a little friendlier (I find them to be mildly aloof and they do not go out of their way to assist) and if they bolstered their fiction, biography, and history sections just slightly.  I'm guessing the target shopper for this store is someone who works Uptown and wants to grab a book.  Fine if you're already Uptown and have a moment at lunch to grab a quick book, but this is never a store you'd make a special trip for (and I'm sure the owners are not aiming to be a store that people would head Uptown for).

My counter part ordered the filet medium rare.  After some time It came out medium to medium well and was only an inch thick.  At $36, I was not impressed.  Her mushroom risotto lacked creaminess and only had a few little button mushrooms in it(could have been cremini).\n\nI ordered the RIbeye, it was large, but at almost $40 I was expecting an at least above average steak for that kind of money.  Shortly after I ordered my ribeye the waitress came back to tell me that they didn't have potatoes gratin and I needed to order something else.  After the blue crab cheese dip I was overloaded on cheese anyhow, so I didn't mind getting asparagus.  A few minutes later she came back to tell me they were out of asparagus as well.  At this point I had decided against carbs in general but I had no choice, so I ordered the baked potato.  One more time she came out and honestly I was getting pissed off.  They had no baked potatoes.  So, I just asked her, what do you have.  Mashed potatoes was my only choice.  For $40, they can't find I potato?\n\nWhen I finally got my meal, I noticed my mixed veggies almost looked like something out of those microwave steamer bags.  Little bit of peas, a couple spears of broccoli, and such.  The couple of mushroom bits I had did have some flavor.  My ribeye lacked any of this chimicurri that it was supposed to have, which was the main reason I ordered the malbec.  The waitress told me it was on there, I just couldn't see it.  I used to live with an Argentinian, you can see chimichurii, it almost looks like an oil heavy pesto.  I did get a side of it, and it did accentuate the flavor of the steak.  The steak was served on top of the overly buttered mash potatoes.  I ate them, but nothing special.\n\nAfter $150 for 2 people, I was not impressed.  Honestly, I don't see how they stay in business, I guess the bankers don't mind dropping that kind of loot on average food.  I may come back for lunch for the sandwiches or to try some of the seafood, but only if I'm already downtown and there aren't other options.", "business_id": "G5dIek0rXPTHlqlJpCNmpw", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-03-26", "type": "review"}

For around $14, you can get their brisket, pork, chicken and ribs.  The brisket was really just so-so (about 2.5/5), the pulled pork was pretty good (3.5/5), but the ribs (very meaty and tender) and chicken (moist and smoky) were really good (4/5).  I also tried some of the sliced pork, which was really good too - I recommend that over the pulled pork.  If you're in the mood to pig out, they had some decently cheap all-you-can-eat (AYCE) specials.  You can even get AYCE ribs for less than $20. They offer discounts on the AYCE depending on what night you go there (I think Tuesdays they discount the ribs).\n\nTheir side items aren't bad either.  I love that offer corn on the cob as a side, and the corn wasn't too bad (although it was a little more mushy, like frozen corn on the cob).  Their macaroni and cheese is ok - very cheesy!  Truly, though, their cornbread is where it's at!  It is tender, moist, and mildly sweet - so delish!  If you're in the mood for a salad, they offer a decent salad bar here as well.\n\nOur waiter was really friendly and helpful, and all the staff working there was really nice to us.  Our food came out super fast, which is always fabulous.  The decor was pretty typical for a chain restaurant.  They also offer a drive thru when you come to pick up carry-out, which is probably very helpful if you're wanting food on-the-go.\n\nCheap prices and several good food options are good reasons to visit a restaurant again.", "business_id": "wpFOZbONc7qUYz6YmBfKuQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-05-19", "type": "review"}

To correct those who have mentioned otherwise, Cedar Fair has now owned the Paramount Parks for three years, and they actually continue to get more affordable each year.  When Paramount owned the parks, season passes didn't include Scarowinds, while they now do.  Cedar Fair just put in a new coaster - the first in a few years.  So the parking lot has weeds?  Deal with it.  If you buy a season pass, you aren't paying for parking anyway, and ideally you aren't paying for overpriced food anyway.  Eat before you go, or after you leave.  Go for the rides, not the food.\n\nOne of the best items in the park is actually the water park, where you can even pack a bag that you can use to carry in your towels.  Inside that you can include some small food items such as a lunch or some snacks, and then you don't have to buy anything.  Talk about a deal.\n\nWhile the lines on the rides can be long, and the price is high if you go every day, if you buy a season pass, you make up the entrance cost after two visits, and you also get free parking and the aforementioned admission to Scarowinds.  All without having to go to Orlando.  It's not the same thing by a long shot - but it's a whole lot closer, too.\n\nWant something else?  Try the Great Wolf lodge for an alternative.

Thank god for that 2 for 1 burger king cup compliments of my older bro.\n\nRide review in the order I rode:\n\n1) Nighthawk:  I remember riding this thing at G.A. (Stealth), I guess I had a better tolerance for g-forces when I was younger. This ride was intense. You start laying down and have no idea how steep the first drop is. I'm not going to lie, I was pretty scared. My favorite part was when you feel like you are flying like Superman. Note: Do not go on this ride on a full stomach...my coffee and bagel did not settle in my tummy very well afterwards. Thrill factor: 5 \n\n2) Carolone Cyclone: Very similar to the Demon, I didn't like this ride, my head was jerking everywhere. Thrill factor: 3\n\n3) Thunderoad: Fastest coaster? Hardly, don't waste your time on this one. Thrill Factor: 1\n\n4) The Hurler: One of my favorites out of the day. I guess I am just a fan of wooden rollercoasters. This ride did not make me nauseous like the others. Thrill factor: 4\n\n5) Ricochet : More of a family ride, the sharp turns were different, felt like the cart was going to fly off the tracks. Would of been more exciting if the entire track shook like the one from Great America. Thrill Factor: 2\n\n6) Carolina Cobra: Unfortunately I had to sit out on this ride because I was feeling a little sick after 5 rides and it starting raining. I didn't feel like getting soaked in 80+degree weather. Thrill Factor: 5 (I take my brothers words for it)\n\n7) Scooby-Doo's\u2122 Haunted Mansion: This was a cute fun ride. The wait was particularly long although it was still pouring. It was worth the wait though, felt like a kid in the shag wagon zapping ghosts and villians with my gun. I scored the highest score and whoop all my brothers asses, 1020 to their measly 300+ points.\n\n8) Thunder Road: This ride would of been cooler if the other train was working. You are supposed to race the other train. Love the drops and didn't expect that many turns for a wooden coaster. Thrill Factor: 4\n\n9) Afterburn: Basically Top Gun or whatever they call it now with a smaller drop but more corkscrews. I should of pass on this last ride we decided to ride on a whim because I felt nauseous again right after.\n\nAll in all I had a good time, the rain killed it though. Nothing too spectacular here that I couldn't experience back home.

The park is reasonably clean, yet it still stinks (see the negative below). The park also caters well to children with the Nickelodeon theme park (I am 15 and still enjoy the Nick Coasters) and good music.\n\nThe negative is that it's employees aren't very accommodating, and it's almost always over-crowded, smelly, and expensive. The employees at rides are usually not interested in taking care of your bags or saying hello and seem to not enjoy their jobs at all. Pretty much every ride will require a average of a 20 minute wait-on a good day...I guess not bad if you compare to Disney World.

I went about six times last season without a season pass. I smartened up this year and not only bought a gold season pass, but a PLATNIUM season pass....that's right folks. I plan on taking my love for amusement parks on the road this year and will be going to a few Cedar Fair parks for FREE. Have friends/family in Richmond, so will have to go to Kings Dominion, NYC native, so will have to check out  Dorney Park, and friends in the Cleveland area, so will certainly have to check out Cedar Point. The review is about Carowinds, right? Sorry, got a little sidetracked.\n\nThey do a really good job with being able to fit so many rides for a park that's not really that big (about 122 acres....most parks are about 300+ acres). With the addition of the Intimidator last season, Carowinds can be considered a legit player in the amusement park world, especially in the Southeast. They have a wide array of different roller coasters.....inverted (Afterburn), Flying (Nighthawk), Hyper (Intimidator), Standing (Vortex), Boomerang (Carolina Cobra), Wooden (Thunder Road & Hurler). The Carolina Cyclone is also another cool coaster....still runs pretty darn well to be 30+ years old. When I go to Carowinds, I usually go on Sundays, because that's when it seems to be the least crowded (people are usually in church/mass/etc. I go right around the time it opens and go through the main entrance. I like to get on Nighthawk first because the line is probably at it's lowest earlier in the day. The line gets pretty long as it gets later in the day and the wait time can be pretty crazy b/c it takes a pretty good amount of time to load and unload the trains since it has to sit up and lay down, etc. Although this is not the newest roller coaster in the park, it is still by far the most popular because of the type of coaster it is. There are only 2 others that are like it in the country (the other two being Firehawk and Batwing). After Nighthawk, that's when I get on the Intimidator. I used to be scared of my mind to ride it b/c it is pretty tall, but once you ride it, you WILL become an addict. No matter how long the lines are for this ride, the line will go fast because they have 3 trains that seat 32 passengers. I love the lapbar restraints because you can move your upper body and the feeling of raising out of my seat during airtime is AWESOME. After the first drop, the rest of the ride is a breeze (for you people that are nervous about getting on it). After Intimidator, I like to go on Afterburn, which is another awesome coaster. The lines go pretty fast on this one too....they have two trains, but it seats 32 per train as well (The Intimidator & Afterburn are made by the same designers, B&M....their coasters are known for their safety, reliability, and load capacity....they build coasters to be able to load several passengers in a short time frame). The front seat on Afterburn ride is a must. After this, I usually head towards Thunder Road, Southern Star, and make my rounds around the park. Boomerang Bay (Water Park, which is included in the admission price) in the summertime is pretty cool. I love the lazy river and the wavepool. The park is kept up pretty well and very clean.\n\nYour best bet is to get a season pass....you would be crazy not to get one. Regular admission at the gate is $51.99 and that's not including the $10.00 you had to pay to park. A gold season pass (which includes free parking and admission to SCarowinds) is only $79.99 ($69.99 if you buy 4 or more). I should be a sales rep for Carowinds the way I speak so highly of them. I guess I took away a star because during the summer months, it can be very hot waiting in lines and all of the lines don't have fans or a/c to keep you cool.

Many months before I had seen it on Travel Channels \"Bert The Conqueror.\"  More specifically I saw the Intimidator roller coaster.  I used to be a coaster buff and I am still a Dale Earnhardt fan.  When I saw that ride and rode it online through a POV video, I knew I had to go.  So my trip to Charlotte was planned and ten months later I was there.  \n\nCarowinds is owned, at this time, by Cedar Fair company that owns Cedar Point and Knotts Berry Farm (a park I grew up at).  So I kind of knew what to expect.  The price was good for a park with so many rides.  $39.99 is about as cheap as you will find.  There will be pleanty of Snoopy and other Peanuts characters to go around.  This is all standard for a Cedar Fair park.  And like other Cedar Fair parks, this has a bit of everything for everybody.   There are classic wooden coasters.  There are steel multi-element coasters.  Water rides.  Kiddie coasters.  An observation tower.  I think I even saw a classic dark ride.  For the price, this park is hard to beat.  For me though, it is hard to survive.\n\nMy first ride on a cloudy and slightly drizzly morning was on Intimidator.  I had to ride it before I was intimidated by it.  The line was short and I was on my way up the very steep lift hill in under ten minutes.  The seats were unique first in their layout second in their design.  My feet were not touching the floor of the train.  There were no handles to hold on to.  I basically was free falling the entire ride.  It was intense but oh so fun.  It was remarkably smooth.  Insanely fast.  The air time is unmatched in my book.  I loved all three minutes of it.  Afterwards I was not so happy.  I don't deal with rides as well as I used to.  I was dizzy for a good hour.  During that hour I basically walked around the park trying to regain my composure.  All this running around made me thirsty.  I struggled though to find a drink.  Most of the food/drink stands were closed still.  I ended up with a bottle of Sprite from a machine for a handful of dollars.  A lot for 20 oz. of sugar water but expected from a park.  \n\nOnce I was feeling ready again I started riding more.  I went for a trip on Thunder Road, a classic out and back racing wooden coaster.  It was a lot of fun despite being a tight squeeze for my frame.  Next up was a good classic water flume.  I was drenched.  I loved it.  I wanted to ride another wooden coaster but it was closed.  I wanted to ride a raft ride but it was closed.  I ended up at Thunder Road again where I got shaken to the core on my second ride.  This effectively ended my day.  I was only in the park for just more than two hours.  Money well spent?  Sure.  For Intimidator it was.  I have decided though that I am done with parks.  Thank you, Carowinds for saving me money and time.  \n\nCarowinds is fun.  It is a little small compared to some parks I have been to.  There is a lot for everybody.  Just not for me.  Check it out if you are in the area.  It is a unique place in that it is the only park in the nation that is in two states (NC and SC).  Some of the rides even cross that border.  Quite interesting if you are into that kind of trivia.", "business_id": "n9iK0s1dKxv5JLi3u1eTkQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-04-04", "type": "review"}

Mind you that this was well before the time of the water park and when the \"White Lightning\" graced the white hot pavement.  This being said, let's get to the review.\n\nNot too long ago my wife and I elected to take ALL of my nieces and nephews to Carowinds as a very late Christmas/Birthday gift from their lame ass uncle that lives in Hawaii and never sends anything.  This was a total of 14 kids under the age of 18, and the parents of said kids ( didn't pay for them ).  This was a major CF, but we did manage to get a discount for the entire group, and I believe it came up less than $400 for all the kids, and myself.  My wife isn't a huge fan of heat or crowds, and Carowinds offers and abundance of both, she elected to sit this one out in the A/C.  Unfortunately for her, so did my dad, but it was a great time to get some serious quality time for him and her ( hahahahahahah ).\n\nCarowinds offers everything that you might expect out of an amusement park.  This place has been around forever and it's seems to have progressed with the times.  The roller coasters are absolutely fantastic, and remarkably they still have some of the old school ones still around, Goldrush and Thunder road.  Love roller coaster, but I must admit that the \"Afterburner\" made me a little nauseous after about the 6th ride. Oh, we went on a Tuesday and the crowds were minimal, but the heat was on full torque, so thank God for the water park, it was a chance to cool off.  NOTE:  Sunblock is a must.\n\nThere is a family, young persons/toddler section, that's fantastic, and now that I again have toddlers I can assure you that I'll end up spending a fair amount of time in it.\n\nAll in all and great time for all. And I'm sure at some point in the future I'll be spending another balmy summer day at Carowinds.", "business_id": "n9iK0s1dKxv5JLi3u1eTkQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-05-28", "type": "review"}

One of the employees at the water park, without explanation, told my 13-year-old daughter to \"take off your shirt\" at one of the water slides.  It was supposed to be a precaution, which is not located on any signage on the ride, but my daughter had been on that ride numerous times in the same outfit and never had an issue; it didn't help that the boy followed her to the pool right afterward.  She was scared to death!  So I went to Carowinds infuriated.  The first two people to take our complaint basically patted us both on the head and sent us on our way.  WRONG!  \n\nThankfully, a gentleman named Jerry met with us the next day, because I was seriously plotting an \"accidental\" mishap of one water slide employee down a nice, high flight of steps.  He took our complaint seriously, made sure it was handled the way it should have been handled and asked us to come back to the park so he could talk to my daughter and make her feel more comfortable about returning.  Ninety minutes later my daughter is feeling a lot less stressed, a LOT more comfortable and she has two new friends at the park who have her back.  Having this situation happen in the first place was a seriously bad scene, but I now have proof that the higher ups at Carowinds take this behavior just as seriously as we do, and it's not going to happen again.\n\nUPDATE:  That nice guy Jerry?  Just another CS liar.  Promised to make my daughter happy with future Carowinds experiences and reneged on every single promise.  Not happy with this place.  They won't be getting our money next year, no matter what the \"big plans\" are, and they got six season passes out of us!  We're officially done with Carowinds.

Some of it is still very rough but not to the point where you'll get hurt. 3.5/5\n\nHurler--Another wooden coaster, slightly better than Thunder Road. This one has been partially retracted as well but some parts still hurt your outer leg as it hits the side of the lap restraint. 4/5\n\nCarolina Goldrusher--A kids' double chain lift rollercoaster. It's actually pretty fun, even for adults but the line moves unbearably slow. 3.5/5\n\nFury325--Takes the cake as the best rollercoaster I have ever been on. Lightning fast and extremely intense, just a fantastic ride. 5/5\n\nCarolina Cobra--A boomerang coaster that will give you a headache. 2/5\n\nNighthawk--One of the few flying coasters left. The line moves slow and it breaks down often, but it's a really cool experience to feel like you're flying. Don't ride it if you're claustrophobic. 3.5/5", "business_id": "n9iK0s1dKxv5JLi3u1eTkQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-04-05", "type": "review"}

Now, the company was amazing as well.  Let me tell you, the selection of roller coasters and rides in incredible.  Fury 325 opened last week, so we had to experience this.  It is the worlds highest and fastest (95 MPH) giga coasters in the world.  It was so worth the 1 1/2 hour wait.  If you have been to Carowinds, take Afterburn and the Intimidator (Dale Earnhardt Ride) and fuse them together and you get Fury.  It was fast, smooth, heart-pounding and insane.  \n\nThe swing that goes high above the park at sunset is so relaxing.\n\nAdd a few Peanuts rides and a Merry-Go-Round with cotton candy, pretzels and people watching to your heart's content and you have a great time.\n\nDon't let Ricochet fool you.  It may look like a kids ride, but it is fun, fun, fun.\n\nBatman shirts beat Superman shirts.  If you decide you want a game to play at the park.\n\nGo early at park open.  You will spend an entire day there.\n\nP.S.  Daily tickets are 59.99 (49.99 if you buy them online at the Carowinds website).  If you have a AAA membership, go to a local office in Charlotte.

We got there when the park opened and went straight to the ride. It took 40 min for them to open the ride because of frost on the tracks. (**This isn't a complaint -- just a fact**) The line was very well managed and everyone was patient and excited. We all cheered for the first car of people and it was awesome.\n\nOnce the ride opened, it only took about 40 min for us to get to ride. The operators are EXPERTS at getting the train loaded quickly, and they ran all three trains. We went back twice later, and each time was only a 30 min wait time. Awesome.\n\nThe ride experience was unparalleled. I was initially nervous about the lack of shoulder harness for the 81 degree plummeted, but I felt really safe with just the lap bar and seat belt. The ride was smooth, even careening through curves and under the Carowinds entrance way.\n\nGot front row once - definitely felt smoother and faster than the other parts of the train.\n\nWorld Class Coaster. Go now.\n\nEVERYTHING ELSE\n\nWater -- several defunct water fountains, $4 for a bottle... this part sucked. I went to Busch Gardens last week, and there were water fountains everywhere. Carowinds, take care of your guests and install some fountains.\n\nFood -- expensive and disgusting. We went to a place that advertised having veggie burgers (I'm a vegetarian), but they were out. I got a $10 cheese pizza and a breadstick that was really just flavorless bread. I wanted coffee, but they \"hadn't made any that morning.\" Yep... they said that. Duuuude.\n\nService -- it's early in the season, so the operators are still having a blast and acting hilarious. I loved everyone on the Rapids ride, the girls on Thunder Road who were going back and forth, and of course the efficient team on Fury. The Cinnabon, however, was understaffed with only one young girl to serve and act as cashier... I guess her manager had stepped out? \n\n------------\n\nWorth the trip, but pack a picnic lunch and tailgate.", "business_id": "n9iK0s1dKxv5JLi3u1eTkQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-04-06", "type": "review"}

But what makes Carowinds special are its two thrill rollercoasters, Fury 325 and the Intimidator.  So of course I had to make the drive down to Charlotte and check em out.\n\nCarowinds is thankfully reasonably priced at $42/ticket for the early season.  $15 for parking and then in we go.  There was a fast pass option which we declined and we immediately jumped on the two main coasters.  Wait time was approximately 90 - 120 mins which was tough but both these rides were GOOD!  We also tried two other coasters which were decent but it was all downhill after the first two.\n\nCarowinds has decent food options with most meals (burger-fries, chicken-fries) going for $14.29 and then beers at $8.  Pricey but about par for the course.  Due to the early season the water park was closed so we couldn't have any fun there.  Overall I think Carowinds is decent but a bit small and limited for rides.

It took 5-7 minutes to load and unload each 30 second ride. Hours of waiting in lines, especially for kiddie rides, is unacceptable. There s not much to do aside from the rides for young kids- unless you pay extra for entertainment- and the layout of the park is terribly confusing and poorly planned. The water rides were not in operation either- which should have been reflected on their website. Due to the complete lack of water fountains, you are left to buy the $4 bottle of water.

Since we're only about a 2 hours' drive we decided to get season passes, which included our admission on both Friday and Saturday, parking on both days, and 10% off on food in the park.  Even if we don't return, it was slighly cheaper than paying a la carte for tickets, parking, etc.\n\nWe also bought the fast passes for Friday, because we just really don't like to stand in line.  I figure it's already expensive, so you might as well pay a little more and get the most out of your time.  Looking back I'm so glad we bought them because Friday was a beautiful day so the park was packed!  But with our wristbands, we never waited more than 5 minutes to get on any ride.  They even asked us where we would prefer to be seated on the roller coasters, which was awesome.  We ended up riding every single roller coaster at least once.  We rode Fury 3 times in 15-20 minutes.  For lunch we split a $10 pizza and a bread stick and had a drink at the bar.  If you eat before you go and as soon as you leave you can get by with sharing something small instead of paying $16pp for a hamburger and fries.\n\nWhen we returned on Saturday we didn't buy the fast passes because we planned on walking around and sampling the food from the food festival.  However, it was an ugly day and when we got there around noon there were absolutely no lines for any of the rides.  We rode the intimidator 3 times in a row as soon as we walked in, just like we would have done if we had purchased the fast passes.  After that, we just walked around and shared the tasting plates from some of the various regional food booths. I  was so surprised to see that we were literally the only ones participating in the food festival.  I couldn't believe that there was a line at Panda express and that the booths where you could get $4 tasting plates, beers, and wines were empty.  To each his own, I guess.  \n\nAnyway, we had a great time and will definitely go back since we have the season passes.  My only piece of advice is if you don't want to shell out the money for the fast passes then make sure you go on a rainy day, unless you enjoy standing in 2 hour long lines.", "business_id": "n9iK0s1dKxv5JLi3u1eTkQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-05-07", "type": "review"}

My friends and I weren't sure what to expect with the crowds but it ended up being a perfect day. Our average wait time for any ride was about 45-60 minutes. \n\nThey really have a great variety of roller coasters - lap bar (Intimidator, Fury 325), shoulder bar (Carolina Cyclone, Carolina Cobra), stand up (Vortex), laying (Nighthawk), dangly feet (After Burn), and wooden (Hurler, Thunder Road). It was nice that we never really felt like we were going on the same ride over and over again. \n\nThe new giga coaster Fury 325 is an awesome ride! It was the only coaster that we went on twice during the day. This ride is brand new this year and unlike the other coasters where you bring your belongings with you and place them in a bin, this ride does not have the bins. Instead they have lockers that you rent - SCAM TO EARN MORE MONEY! The locker costs $1/hour with a 2 hour minimum. The only plus side to this method opposed to the bin system is that they unload and load that ride SUPER fast so even a long line moves pretty quickly. \n\nThe food offerings are pretty standard for an amusement park - lots of hot dogs, hamburgers, pizza, chicken fingers, french fries, pretzels, funnel cakes, etc.\n\nThe park itself could probably use a few improvements like new paint on some of the rides - which I thought maybe would have been done in the off season every year. \n\nMy biggest complaint from my trip to Carowinds would be the fact there are ZERO signs around the park to point you in the direction of a certain ride you may be looking for.

However, I now live in NC and on a 3 day holiday weekend I was more than willing to try Carowinds as a replacement to that void. Sadly, I was not that impressed. \nFirst off, the park admission is pretty cheap currently and I found a deal online that offered free parking, so I was happy with that. We also knew that going on a holiday weekend we'd be in for long lines, so after attempting a 2 hour wait at Afterburn, we cut our losses and bought the Fastpass tickets- highly recommended during these kind of days!! The longest wait we had at any ride from that point on was maybe 15 minutes.  \nUnfortunately the park itself was rather lacking. There is no theme or reasoning to how the park is laid out, kind of reminded me of a beginner playing Roller Coaster Tycoon. Sure let's put a Chik Fil A next to a kiddie 3D haunted house, which is next to a reverse level 5 coaster! Also, I noticed that everywhere we walked there were chain link fences which really just seemed unprofessional, almost like I was in a carnival for a church fundraiser. One of the fast pass lanes went under the roller coaster and with the chain link fences everywhere, no lighting, and no person to guide you,  we felt like we were about to be mugged. \nFood cost was insane; We're talking 4 dollars for a bottle of water! Also, absolutely no exceptions for food or drink being brought into the park. They checked all bags too so good luck smuggling anything-  Disney isn't even as expensive and strict, at least they'll let you bring in little baggies of food, buying snacks for a bunch of kids can add up, especially considering the fact that there aren't that many healthy options. There's a marketplace in the front with fresh fruit but that's it; no worries though, you'll find a churro or funnel cake stand every 5 feet! At one point, we stamped ourselves out and went to the car for snacks which is just so stupid. We did eat at the marketplace mentioned earlier, but oh boy, there are people yelling at you to know what you want, where to go and don't walk in until you're 100% sure. I wanted a panini and surprise the machines weren't turned on (it was 1pm). Myself and one other person stood there for 20 minutes before we suggested just tossing our sandwiches into an oven. The kid had to ask for permission from a manager to do so! We both ended up with cold sandwiches and not even so much as a \"sorry for the inconvenience\" from the manager. \nThe only theme we seemed to notice at this place was a lack of communication from the crew. All of the employees looked under 18 and probably here as a part-time job. Zero smiles, cashiers just standing at registers with a line out the door, difficulties with locking up cubbies before boarding a ride, no one guiding anyone through turn styles (the big rides had people, but often, it was just a free for all boarding which caused chaos in lines) and even on one roller coaster, they were so rushed to get people locked and loaded, nobody walked by to ensure my belt and restraint was on properly! Obviously I survived but I have never been so terrified on a ride before! \nLastly was the rides themselves. This is an extreme coaster park, so be prepared for just that. Aside from the 3D boo blasters ( mind you, they want you to pay for the glasses and if you don't, you just don't get to play the ride in 3D!) and indoor music theater, every other ride is high or fast, so this is certainly not a park for young kids. The wind seeker (yo-yo?) ended up being my favorite ride because it was high, awesome view, and didn't hurt my head. All the other roller coasters caused my neck and head to scream with pain; For the record I'm 29 so I'm not exactly old. The Fury, their newest roller coaster, had a G force so extreme that after the initial fall, during the pull back up, I actually lost partial vision from the blood rush. That may seem awesome to some people but it was pretty damn scary to me. I noticed on several rides about half a dozen people not able to fit. Most of these people weren't even that obese- my husband at 220lbs found himself rather cramped on the wooden rides which makes me wonder, when we live in one of the world's most overweight countries, what weight do they expect people to be?? Just a heads up for anyone who is carrying a little extra baggage to be warned, these seats seem to be very small. \nWe wanted to rest our heads so we decided to go to the outdoor theater, only to be informed that this was an extra fee. I'm not a fan of a park that requires additional pay for something like live music that occurs throughout the day. \nA strange layout, rickety rides that make your head feel like a washing machine on the spin cycle, total lack of care and communication with workers and extremely overpriced meals, I really can't say I had a fun day at Carowinds. Next time we venture outside, we'll go north and try Busch Gardens in Williamsburg, VA.", "business_id": "n9iK0s1dKxv5JLi3u1eTkQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-05-26", "type": "review"}

I love my doctor, Dr Colbert, she is absolutely amazing.  I have built a great relationship with her and she is the only reason I am not leaving this establishment. Someone on the reception staff took it upon themselves, WITHOUT my authorization, to change my phone number to a number that has never been associated with me. Because my phone number was changed without my authorization or knowledge it had happened, I wasn't informed that an appointment I had scheduled for 2 months and took off work for needed to be rescheduled because my doctor was sick. Today, when I went into the office and was glad finally able to see my doctor, I noticed on my check-in paperwork they had a different doctor listed, not my usual doctor that I have always seen and who is my primary care provider. I made sure after my first appointment with my doctor that I would always be scheduled with her and put that in my paperwork  so I'd always see her. Again, someone on the reception staff took it upon themselves to schedule me with another doctor against my wishes, without my authorization, and without my knowledge. I'm not sure if the same person who changed my phone number also changed my doctor, or if the receptionist who rescheduled my appointment put me with the wrong doctor. I realize that mistakes happen, it just seems odd to me that I have never had these types of issues at any other medical establishment, ever, especially when there is so much at risk with the medical industry and patient privacy etc.  Either way, I had to reschedule again and will have to miss work again because of the reception staff at this establishment. Again, if I didn't really like my doctor and if I hadn't built a relationship with her I'd seek medical care somewhere else.", "business_id": "iYlGqyRNH5UYQABKsDuuDg", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-03-11", "type": "review"}

Prior to March 1, 2014, my shopping experiences had been pleasant.  The floor associates are very nice and really go the extra step to help customers choose the best fitting jeans.  While I have always found the floor associates helpful, the cashiers are far less pleasant.\n\nMy trip on March 1st was the most disturbing.  The store was pretty busy because of the $15 sale on jeans.  Finding a floor associate that wasn't helping another customer was impossible.  I took my purchases to the counter and asked the cashier to check the stores inventory for a size 6 pants for my little girl.  She said there were plenty on the shelf.  I told her I looked repeatedly but was not able to find a pair.  I suggested that the pants must have been on a shelf too high for me to reach.  She then asked me if I wanted to pay for my items, then go back and try to reach the pants on my own then stand in line again to complete a second transaction.  I told her I did not want to do that...that I wanted her to have an associate get the pants for me (seeing as I did not have a ladder) and ring up all my items on a single transaction.  With a very disapproving look, she said \"fine\" and stormed off.  Very unpleasant experience.\n\nWould give five stars if not for the terrible check out service.  My latest experience was extreme but the cashiers have always been less than friendly.  I guess cashiers and floor associates receive different training.\n\nAs a side note, the tiny clearance section allows only a few shoppers at a time.

Good, but a smallish portion, and nothing really special about it.  The shoulder was excellent, and rivaled a tender pot roast.  The risotto was good, as was the berry that highlighted the plate.

Rarely did I drink more than a bit from my water glass before it was refilled to the top.  Same with my ginger ale.  Bar service appeared to be pretty speedy as well.  But food service was horrid.  Slow, slow, slow.\n\nSeveral of the people in our party ordered a chocolate cake dessert at the time they ordered dinner - apparently it takes a while to prepare.

We dressed for a night out on the town, and despite her dress and my shirt and snazzy dress jeans we still felt slightly under-dressed. Blue has the looks of a fancy smancy place and dishes out food that exceeds expectations.\n\nWe arrived on a Saturday evening at 6 and were blown away the second we walked in the door. The place simply screams \"swanky\" with a sharp, classy interior and interesting dining room layout. The host and servers were extremely formal and proper, which only made us feel like we were somewhere we didn't belong. But enough about the ambiance...on to the food!\n\nAfter taking our drink orders (the wine list is like gigantic!) the waitress brought over some complimentary bread and butter. The bread consisted of a cheese focaccia which was warm and cheesy, and there was also a dark cranberry walnut that was equally tasty. The bread is served with a dish of kalamata olive butter which I'm always a fan of. I can't explain it...I hate olives but I love it when they are infused in butter!\n\nFor an appetizer I ordered the caesar salad with pork belly croutons. The salad is served a la wedge and lightly drizzled with a caesar dressing. Alongside the lettuce was some roasted tomatoes (not a fan of tomaters, but the missus loved them) and carmelized red onion, which went good with the lettuce. But the real kicker was the pork belly croutons. Don't let the name fool you...these are not dried, hard chunks of pork. There was at least six decent sized balls of pork belly on top of the plate. Each one was deep fried to perfection, giving it a hot, crunchy outside yet retaining the juicy, succulent pork belly inside. It was like eating a deep fried ball of the white fatty part of bacon...it was just that damn good. This pork belly is not for everyone, but if you're proud to be a bacon fat kind of person, this little tasting of heaven is something you can't miss.\n\nThe missus ordered the calamari as her appetizer. The calamari was kind of \"meh\", and the batter was way too heavy and just wasn't good. The plate also comes with some fried olives and hot peppers which she devoured in a heart beat. I wouldn't recommend the calamari since I've had better quality stuff at lesser restaurants.\n\nFor dinner I ordered the bison osso buco, and it was nothing short of tastetacular. Six huge hunks of slow-cooked bison meat sat upon a bed of roasted root veggies. The bison was awesome, and I love getting it when it's on a menu. It was also refreshing to see bison as an actual dish and not just a burger. The meat was lean yet still moist from whatever magic the cook worked on it. The bison juices all mingled with the root veggies which consisted of carrots, potatoes and some others. Oh, and I almost forgot the spetzel! There's spetzel mixed in with the veggies and it was crispy yet chewy, and simply perfect. This was one heck of a dish and a great alternative for the steak lover who wants to try something new.\n\nThe missus got the pan seared scallops, and these things were massive! The sea scallops were cooked to perfection and served with a great seasoning and sauce. The dish came with broccolini and other veggies that were SMOKED (awesome!) and a potatoe puree that was pretty darn good. \n\nNow the portions here are huge...you're getting a full meal, not a small fancy tasting. We both ate half our entrees and took the leftovers home for dinner the following night (still tasted awesome reheated!) We weren't fully stuffed yet, but we had to save room for dessert. I ordered the sticky toffee pudding, and if you have a sweet tooth this is the dessert for you. The toffee \"pudding\" is actually baked so it's more cake-like, and its served upon a sea of melty caramel sauce. There are some hard toffee chips sprinkled about to give some texture, and on top of the pudding is a heaping scoop of dulche de leche gelato that was awesome. The toffee, caramel and dulche flavors were all great on their own, but when combined into one mighty spoonful I achieved dessert nirvana. This is one of the best desserts I've had in the area, and there is no way I would go back here and not order it.\n\nThe missus had the baklava for dessert and gobbled it all up. There was pistachio and pear stuffed inside this huge Greek pastry, and it was served with a side of marscapone cheese. Bakalava isn't normally my thing but I won't deny the tastiness of this dessert, though it was definitely second to the sheer power of the toffee pudding.\n\nBlue is a swanky place, and you will pay for the ambiance through your food, which isn't exactly on the cheap side. We would not want to pay full price for a meal here (simply because it's a bit out of our price range) but it would make for a tempting Restaurant Week visit.", "business_id": "eaqJQP6bp7rQJQt5KqfvxQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-04-22", "type": "review"}

My first visit to Blue a few years ago was fabulous.  The service was very good!  But, this time not only was the food not impressive, but it was totally boring!

My tenderloin was nothing to write home about and the risotto was a mushy, tasteless ,  glob with Carmelized onions on it that looked reheated...also not  flavorful.  The baked in house bread were blah, and butter was not offered.  It could have used it to help the taste.  Dessert was the same...an amaretto cheesecake that tasted like it was left in the oven way too long....dry.   I love good food.  But, this evening was an utter disappointment.  It was a birthday celebration, and I did not want to spoil it with complaints about the food.  I also think my guest did not want me to feel bad for bringing them to this place I raved about prior to going.

There was a high school jazz band raising money for a cancer patient, which included a silent auction. We spoke with the student who had organized the event (a cancer survivor) and were immediately touched by his words and the effort he put into a wonderful event. It makes me extremely happy knowing Blue welcomed the group to put this on. \n\nThe ambience is upscale, sophisticated and cosmopolitan. Dress is formal. It was a very busy night given the jazz fundraiser but luckily we were seated further away from the band.\n\nWe ordered a bottle of wine from the menu, the waiter admitted he didn't know anything about it and sounded confused when we ordered it. A few minutes later we were told that they didn't have it in stock (so why was it on the menu?). He came back out with a different wine that he was offering for a discount and we obliged.\n\nTo be honest with you nothing really jumped off the menu to me. Usually I find myself toying between a few options but there was nothing that really excited me. I settled for the beef tenderloin and fried calamari appetizer.\n\nThe bread (and butter!) was delicious! There were two kinds and I can't remember was in either but they were tremendous. The calamari was so so. The sauce tasted like a ranch aioli out of the jar and was not the lemon-harissa sauce as advertised on the website. Portion was also very small for the price.\n\nThe entrees came out and both myself and another that ordered the beef tenderloin had to send it back. I ordered medium-rare and it was purple, barely cooked in the middle. The best part of the meal was the creamy gorgonzola dolce on top of the cut. The pea risotto that it was served on was unexciting.\n\nOn top of this all one of the raffle items was a bundle of wine valued for about the same as the one bottle that we were presented in place of our original request. A very unprofessional oversight for such a \"sophisticated\" place.\n\nI left wishing that I had ordered the grouper special which received rave reviews from others at the table and I would not come back here without a gift certificate...what a coincidence we left that night with a winning auction for gift certificate to Blue. I guess I'll be returning after all.\n\n Simply put, it is overpriced and not worth your money.", "business_id": "eaqJQP6bp7rQJQt5KqfvxQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-05-15", "type": "review"}

There very very few ingredients to choose from for the omelet so I ordered a sausage, mushroom, cheddar cheese one and my husband ordered an bacon, mushroom, omelette.

I can say that they have consistently provided me with the best sushi experience in Uptown CLT.\n\nFirst impressions; I've always been skeptical when a restaurant attempts to cross dress their cusine amongst several different cultures, and this place features Chinese, Japanese, Thai, etc.  Places that do this will typically fall short of expectations in all categories when they don't specialize in just one.  This is not the case with Fujos!  \n\nTheir sushi is fantastic...their lunch specials are reasonably priced for what you get.  I sat at the bar the other day and ordered the lunch special \"C\" (Cali roll, 3 salmon sashimi, 4 nigiri, chefs choice).  I fully expected the chef to pull a pre-made california roll out of the fridge; this seems to be common practice for other sushi joints who feature specials during lunch...they will pre-make rolls in anticipation of the lunch rush.  Not here.  The chef, who was flying solo during a busy lunch hour I might add, made every roll as it was ordered....a plus in my book, and something I will be glad to wait an extra couple of minutes for.  \n\nFrom the kitchen, might I suggest the Crab Fu Rong?  Delicious...of course, it is hard to screw up a crab!  Service is militarily efficient as well...if I ever had to wait in this place (which is seldom), it was on the kitchen, not on the waitstaff.\n\nThis place does fill up quickly during peak times...good news about the quality of the food, bad news for those of us with precious little free time during the workday.

Meaning my body does not love me for eating it as much as my mind/tastebuds do and I swell up for a week. That said, when I just have to cheat and have some great bread, this is the place for it. I always tend to go for the sweet breads like the Blueberry Cheesecake bread, the Cinnamon Chip or Cinnamon Swirl bread (GREAT FRENCH TOAST!!!), Cherry, or Apple Pecan bread. Each could be eaten plain but are taken over the top when you toast them with some honey or some other spread. I wish I could learn how to make the breads. Wait, scratch that.  No I don't. \n\nTheir cinnamon \"scuffins\" (if scones and muffins mated) are excellent and hubby likes the cinnamon rolls (not my fave). Even their snickerdoodle cookies or plain honey wheat loaves are good. They have a Florentine kind of loaf that is perfect for holiday/italian meals. Well it's a crowd pleaser but sometimes gets you in trouble w/ the Italian Mother In Law because it's more popular than what was previously served. Consider yourself warned.\n\nGreat Harvest gets brownie points for supporting the race community and providing post-race samples :) Yay! \n\nThe only reason I don't give this place a 5 star rating is that seemingly every time we have a craving to go, it's Sunday morning, when they're closed.

But it is a bit pricier than we usually budget for dinner out: our bill usually runs about $90-$120 for two with drinks. We have been to this location as well as the Montgomery, Ohio (Cincinnati suburbs) location several times. The service is always exceptional and it seems staff truly enjoys working at The Melting Pot. The ambience is low-key, but slightly upscale. Most of the booths are laid out for privacy.\n\nOur standard choice is the Fondue For Two, a three-course fondue plus salad dinner that is more than enough, and a bottle of wine or two. The waitstaff will be happy to recommend a bottle from their extensive collection of wine. All fondue courses are prepared at the table on the built-in hotplate.\n\nWith fondue there comes several choices. First, the cheese course gives the option of Cheddar, traditional Swiss, Wisconsin butterkase/buttermilk blue cheese or a spicy Mexican-style cheese fondue served with bite-size bread cubes, raw vegetables and apples. We have always enjoyed the traditional Swiss cheese fondue, but I think I'd also like to try the Wisconsin.\n\nThen, comes the salad, which you shouldn't fill up too much on even though their California greens with gorgonzola and rasperry walnut vinaigrette is delicious. Tip: you can buy the salad dressing in bottles to duplicate the salad at home.\n\nFor the main course, you will choose from several fondue styles and meats. Standard fondue choices will be oil or bouillon (vegetable broth), but for an additional fee, you can choose Coq au Vin fondue (herbs, mushroom, garlic and burgundy wine) or Caribbean bouillon with garlic and citrus flavor. The standard bouillon is low-sodium, cholesterol-free, light and healthy that does not add bulk to the meal (that pays off at the end). The meat selections include their standard chicken breast, pork tenderloin, shrimp, teriyaki sirloin and fresh fish fillet (based on availability); the market-price \"surf and turf\" with lobster tail, Filet Mignon  and portobello mushrooms; or the pricier pacific rim with teriyaki sirloin, breast of duck, pork tenderloin, chicken breast, and potstickers. All of the above come with bite-sized portions of red potatoes, mushrooms, broccoli, squash, and a variety of dipping sauces. The meats and vegetables come to the table raw and you will cook them yourself in the broth/oil, then dip and eat. See? Fun!\n\nHope you saved room for dessert because this is where fondue becomes sensuous. Again, you have choices to make. Chocolate comes in dark, milk, and white which you can choose unadulterated or with additives, like Bailey's Irish Cream, or Amaretto, or marshmallows and crushed Oreo cookies, or caramel and pecans. They have pre-selected combinations or create your own. I love dark chocolate + Bailey's Irish creme instead of their milk chocolate + Bailey's. \"Yin-Yang\" is pretty: dark chocolate swirled with white chocolate. Dessert fondue is served with fresh strawberries, cheesecake, pound cake, marshmallows, bananas, brownies and pineapple for dipping. This is also a good time to switch to coffee to start coming down from the wine-buzz and endorphins before attempting to drive home.\n\nI have never walked out of this place unhappy, although I have walked out completely stuffed and pleasantly buzzed.

( It has been years, since my last visit)\nFood was cooked to perfection ( I cooked my own food - of course)\nService was impeccable. (Will was great)\nPrice was reasonable for individual entr\u00e9es.\nDesert is the only reason we went.....(strawberries smothered in chocolate)\n\nNow for the main attraction.\n\nWe placed our reservations online. It was very easy and we received an email confirmation shortly thereafter.  The day of the reservation, I was contacted via phone to confirm the reservation.\n\nUpon entering the restaurant we were promptly greeted by two young ladies, I am under the impression that one was the manager.  We were promptly seated in a very secluded booth but was closest to the \"kitchen area\". ( Not sure that you can really call it a kitchen if you do not cook there- imo)\n\nOur server was Will.  He was very prompt, and informative regarding the menu, the entr\u00e9es and the sauces. Will was right on top of our drinks, he kindly informed us that if we needed any additional items he would take care of them. I took advantage of the mushrooms,as they went so well with the green goddess sauce.\n\nOur entr\u00e9es were as followed: \nThe Filet Mignon, and the Signature Special (3 pieces of chicken, 3 white shrimp, 2 Teriyaki Sirloin, and 2 salmon) Vegetables consisted of potato wedges,broccoli, and mushroom caps. Both individual meals came with a house salad.  ( I have added pictures)\n\nOur dessert was the small milk chocolate ($16.00 ) it featured pineapple, marshmellos, bananas, rice crispy treats, cheesecake, brownies, pound cake, and my favorite strawberries.\n\nWhat I gained in weight  from food was balanced by the weight I lost in my wallet, but hey, we only live once.\n\nOverall this was a great dining experience, we were asked twice by different people if this was a special occasion, and we stated that it was not.  This would make for a nice,  quiet /aka romantic location due to the high tables,and secluded rooms,but we were just here to show off my mean \"fondue skills\".\n\nNCFoodGuy", "business_id": "uDoTFFud2mXE3VT1Jt9L5A", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-05-26", "type": "review"}

We has both the Fiesta and Swiss cheese fondue, and both were great. I especially liked the Swiss. My Cesar salad was excellent! I've never had pine nuts on a Cesar, but  the crunch gave it great texture! For the entree I had the Land and Sea, which came with filet, herb crusted chicken, and shrimp. It was way too much food for just me- I ended up sharing and still felt full. I couldn't do without dessert though, and our group went with the white chocolate creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and flaming turtle. Both were delicious with the dippers!

This time we came with a different couple for Double Date Nights, which happen each Wednesday in March. You get the cheese, salad, and entree courses for $50/couple, which is a great deal. They were also having a special for $7 select martinis. \n\nWe were celebrating a birthday, and after last time made sure to request 2 burners. I think for us, the table was a little crammed. Not seating wise, but once you have 2 burners and then 4 plates, 2 plates of food to cook, and 8 sauces floating around the table, you are unsure where to put your 4 waters,and 4 drinks. \n\nThe waitress was great. I think she might have been busy, or we were in an awkward part of the restaurant because it could be a little difficult to find her. She explained all of the courses, and cooking times and sauces. \n\nI got the pineapple upside down martini, and the birthday girl got the pomegranate martini, both were on the $7 menu. Both were also pretty bad... the flavor was there, but I'm not sure the alcohol was. Mine was literally half grenadine. I would just go with a beer or glass of wine. \n\nMy husband and I ordered our regular, cheddar cheese and it was delicious. They've added grapes which was something new. For the salads, I got my normal fruit salad, which had apples, strawberries, pineapple, and blackberries. My husband got the California salad, which we said was very good. For the entree we picked the (free) beef broth cooking style, and we had shrimp, mushroom sachetti, sirloin, filet, and chicken. We also had the usual mix of mushrooms, potatoes, and broccoli. It was delicious! I love the sauces, they make my night. \n\nSince we stuffed ourselves with green goddess and mushrooms, among the other entree foods, we decided to skip dessert. It was $30 for the 4 of us, but we just weren't into it. The birthday girl did want to partake, so her and her husband got the turtle. I think it ended up being a couple of dollars more for them to just get it, but I didn't have any room. \n\nSo overall, minus the drinks, and the occasional wait time to see the waitress this was fantastic.

(for all ages) It has a relaxing atmosphere but also a classy one. I love the idea of taking the Switzerland famous style (fondue) and turning it into a restraint. The best choice in my opinion is to get there four course meal. You get a choice of many cheeses to start off with and you dip the bread, apples, and grapes into the cheese. (The cheese is my favorite part of the whole fondue course) Next you can get a nice decent size salad. After that you can get a choice of meats to dip into boiling water to cook. After that they bring out bananas and deserts to dip into hot chocolate and you can choice your type of chocolate to. I prefer the Flaming Turtle chocolate.

I've heard nothing but praise from locals. Tonight was my second visit, and I can firmly say, \"I am not in love.\"\n\nMy first meal at MR was lunch with coworkers. I ordered a calzone. The crust was bland and the filling seemed sparse. I was underwhelmed but my coworkers raved about their dishes. I figured I should just order something else next time. C'est la vie.  \n\nTonight, a friend and I headed over to MR for dinner. I started off with bruschetta that tasted freshly made but had an overpowering acidic/vinegar flavor. The bread was already soggy like it had been sitting for a bit. My friend had calamari that she didn't care for at all.\n\nWe both ordered slow cooked brisket (I think the waitress said about 7 hours.) with grilled veggies and mashed potatoes. The entree was good, and the portion was huge...more than enough for two people. Leftovers are in my future. Of everything I've had at MR, this was the best. Still, I wasn't blown away by it. It was just good, not great.\n\nOn each visit the wait staff has been very friendly and attentive. Our waitress from tonight (wish I could remember her name) was super friendly and helpful. She did a great job.\n\nMy friend and I weren't complaining about the food but our waitress asked so we told her what we though of it. And the manager came out to tell my friend the calamari would be removed from her bill, and offered her a free dessert, which was a very responsible and nice gesture. I was mildly annoyed because I don't think she even acknowledged my presence. At this point it didn't even matter.

So, when I found myself in the area around lunch-time today I decided to stop in and see what's on the menu these days.\n\nFor lunch, they have several sandwich options as well as yummy looking pizza selections. However, I haven't had pasta in a while, so I decided to go for that instead.  I was sort of in the mood for a red sauce, but as I perused the menu, nothing in that category jumped out at me. Instead, the chicken & broccoli penne pasta was calling my name.   So, I went with it and sure am glad that I did.  The sauce was somewhat creamy - but not too heavy.  It had a lot of garlic (yum) and a nice lemony flavor.  I enjoyed it very much.   At lunch, this entr\u00e9e was $8 and I had enough to take some home for later. \n\nSince I was by myself, I just sat at the bar.  The guy behind the bar was a bit busy since he was taking care of all the take-out orders.  The service was a bit \"meh\" but that's what I get for sitting at the bar.

A little on the fancy side but nobody was wearing tuxedos so it was chill in my eyes.\n\nThe night started slow and the size of the place kind of made it look too big but as people arrived the extra space was definitely needed and appreciated.  The club is big enough that you can dance and have a good time without constantly bumping into everyone around you but also not so huge that you won't still be around other people.\n\nThe bartenders were good and made the drinks strong but at the same time very reasonable priced. I'm used to DC prices when drinks are going for 10+ dollars, so a 5 or 6 dollar mixed drink was right up my alley.\n\nSecurity and the front door were cool, they knew people were there to have a good time and didn't go through all the pretending that their club was extra hot by making people wait outside for no real reason.  \n\nOne odd thing I did notice was that the group I was with all brought tickets in advance and some of the group, their tickets were brought by one guy, well at The Big Chill, the person who actually bought the tickets must be present for you to gain entry. I could see this being a problem if you get your tickets from a friend in advance but don't arrive to the party with them, you may have to wait. No huge issue though.\n\nThere is no real parking lot and if there is, it is either small or hidden, so we valeted the car but even that was affordable and honestly you just feel extra fancy when you pull up to a venue and somebody opens the door for you.\n\nThe Big Chill was a cool place to have a night out, definitely more fun if you're with a bigger crowd because like I said the place is a bit on the massive side but I judge places about how much fun I had and I had a cool time.\n\nI recommend The Big Chill for your partying needs.", "business_id": "x6dFuGT0ZedXuYgaJ-Gubw", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-03-08", "type": "review"}

It was our Spring event and we were here to listen to Jon Gordon speak about books he had written, and words of inspiration. The place was filled to the brim with people. I was at table 26 and there were about 8 people per table, if that gives you any indication. \n\nSince the parking lot is so small, the Big Chill had valet available. The valet worked so hard, they could not keep up with just the sheer amount of volume coming through. I sat in the valet line for about 15 minutes. Once I got out of my car, weaved my way through the tables and sat down, the presentation was great. They have a good stage area, and I think for the most part everyone could see very well. \n\nThe bathrooms were a bit tricky to access because of the amount of people, and could use some updating. We had lunch available, which was a buffet. They had amazing chicken. I don't know what was on it, but it was definitely a couple notches above the kind of food I expect from these venues. They did a good job at directing people when to go to the buffet. I think it took about 20 minutes to get to the line. \n\nOnce everything was over I think it also took about 20 minutes to get my car back from the valet. I think most people took advantage, so at the end there was a mad dash. \n\noverall, great location, off Morehead, and great venue.

It's like stepping across a few continents and tasting authentic Indian cuisine.  The \"naan\" flat bread is piping hot when it comes to your table.  The garlic naan is my favorite.  And the curries are always wonderful.  \n\nIf you haven't tried Indian food, take your time getting used to the menu.   Generally the main dishes are chicken, lamb or vegetables, in a different kind of curry sauce.  If you go on a date you can order two or three plates and share.  The items toward the top of each list are simpler and less spicy.  The further down the menu you go, the more interesting and spicy the dishes get.  I recommend starting with \"medium\" and seeing if that's too hot or if you'd actually like spicier.   If you ask for \"between mild and medium\" they can do that too.  I like to pick one meat dish and one vegetable dish, usually something with potatoes.  Dinner comes with basmati rice (long grain rice with a little saffron).\n\nSuper friendly service although not American style waitering.  There is generally a head waiter who is also the host.  They will seat you and take your order.  After that, other waiters will serve you in turn, one getting drinks and another serving food.

If I lived in Charlotte, there is no doubt I would be a regular here! \n\nFor anyone who's traveled abroad and hit those beachy bar restaurants where time stops and no one is in a rush, everyone is up to talk, and you just feel like you're on vacation. Well that's Cuisine Malaya in a nutshell. The entire staff, from bartender to manager to server, is sooo nice and sooo laid back. The service was comparable to that of what I've received in some of the best travel spots. Two of us in our party got there early so we waited at the bar, had wine, and hung out with the staff. Killing close to an hour never went by so fast. Seriously we had so much fun with the Cuisine Malaya folks that it was almost a bit of a disappointment when the rest of our group showed up and we had to move to our table! \n\nThe food is just as amazing as the service (thank you Carrie!). For our party of six, we had several appetizers, wine, many entrees, and dessert. I won't list every single thing we ordered but I will say EVERYTHING was delicious. The highlights for me were the roti telur appetizer. If you like Indian food, this will make you smile. It's basically an Indian pancake (savory, not sweet!) that comes with a cup of curry sauce to dip it in. The flavor was not too strong and the amount of oil they used was just right, not overly greasy/fattening. The other MAJOR hit for me was the tofu lemongrass entr\u00e9e. It has such a punch to it, the second you put a spoon of it in your mouth, you will feel a spark. Absolutely DE-licious! For spice lovers out there, Cuisine Malaya is a haven. Our table included one Indian (me), four Liberians, and one white woman (who says she has a black woman inside of her and has the spice tolerance of an Indian!). We all LOVE spicy food and they had no problem catering to our pallets. We got so many chili paste refills, I lost track! The other thing I want to point out is that they have some of THE best wine I've ever had. We had two bottles of their Takar Plum Wine, which is sweet, rich and made in Japan. I think only one person in our group was reserved on this, everyone else had a minimum of two glasses. I also had their Chateau St. Michelle Reisling and it was dangerously good. I mean, you will taste no trace of alcohol, just sugary sweetness. At times I felt like I was drinking a great non-alcoholic drink and took big gulps. You WILL get a buzz so drink with caution! And lastly, dessert! Aaaaah, the cherry on the top to this magical dining out experience! We got their pancakes with peanut ice cream and it was to die for. I may be butchering what it's called but it's the only dessert choice that has peanut butter flavor in it and it will create a dance party in your mouth. Soooooooo good! \n\nMy suggestion if you plan to go here is to order food family style, sample as much as you can (you will be satisfied!) and start with less and build up. We didn't realize how HUGE their portion sizes are and got way more than what we could eat, we all ended up taking carry out boxes with us. One entr\u00e9e can easily feed two. If you're not that hungry, then it could even stretch and fill up three. And if you do drink, plan ahead and figure out a DD. This place has a SUPERB wine selection, you can really lose yourself and before you know it, drown down 3-4 drinks very quickly. \n\nFinally, my parting words on what's turning out to be a super long review, is: Eat, drink, and be Merry! Cuisine Malaya will afford you all three!", "business_id": "MMNBgMQCdwyVoNaHg0h_QA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-05-14", "type": "review"}

Unlike some other Tom Yums you certainly had no trouble finding the chicken and veggies. I ordered the Beef Randang extra spicy (beyond what the little pepper beside it on the menu was already supposed to indicate). What I got was certainly beef. I can't really speak to its randang-ness since I am no expert. I felt like it could have used a vegetable or 10 to break up the beef chunks covered in thick sauce. None were mentioned but they weren't mentioned in the BF's Chicken Basil either and it was teeming with them. What my dish most assuredly was not was spicy. At all.\n\nOur waiter, who was very pleasant, brought me additional ground chili but even they had no zip in them. No veggies and no spice made the meal sort of a downer for me.

The roti canai is really top notch, and the chow fun is delicious. Lo Mein is also delicious. Their noodles are cooked with a very hot wok, you can tell from the slightly singed flavoring, and that with the sesame flavoring gives the noodles a nutty smoky flavor, which is so hard to find anywhere. i had a curry dish as well (I cant remember the name) which was excellent as well. We have not have a single mediocre dish here yet. Always looking forward to going back here.\nUpdate April '13: Had the Dry Chili with Chicken, it was very good. A friend had Beef Rendang which I tried and it was delicious. We also had the Malaysian Lo Mein and it was delicious. I do need to correct my previous post above where I mentioned never having a mediocre dish - I now recall we had ordered Pad Thai once and it was not good, so I would not recommend that one. Everything else we had was good. We have not yet tried many non-Malaysian dishes except for the Pad Thai and Roti - we have stayed mainly with the Malaysian food which has all been good so far.", "business_id": "MMNBgMQCdwyVoNaHg0h_QA", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-03-26", "type": "review"}

The only thing I would say is that I would like it if they paid a little more attention to the timing and waited until we finished the appetizers before bringing the entree.\n\nWe had fried dumplings and BBQ spareribs to start.  The dumplings were delicious, plump, tender and flavorful with a dipping sauce that was better than the usual offerings.  Ribs were big and meaty with the normal amount of chewing and tearing required to eat a Chinese restaurant style rib.  Nice char but not enough sauce.\n\nFor our entree we shared the Szechuan shrimp and scallops.  It was hot, fresh and flavorful without being overpowering in any way.  The seafood was perfectly cooked, although I suspect that the scallops may not have been real as they seemed too perfectly round and all the exact same size with a strange texture, more like a plug of fish and not very scallop like.  Veggies were all very fresh, texture was perfect and the balance was just right. \n\nI do have a pet peeve regarding shrimp in a sauced dish such as this - Take the freaking tail off of the shrimp.  It is a hot, sauced, stir-fry and we had to take our fingers and pull the tail off of the shrimp before eating it.  I'm OK if it is a shrimp cocktail or jumbo fried shrimp that you can grab the tail as a \"handle\" and pick it up but, not in a piping hot slippery sauced stir-fry...please...it just makes things messy.\n\nThe decor is exactly like any other of this genre and it seemed pretty clean from what we could see.

Also one last tip, I learned that you can request lunch portion on pretty much ANYTHING on their menu, even the chef's special, so make sure you ask for it if you don't want as big of a portion, it'll save you a good $2 or so on each item. Lastly, try their beef chow fun, OMGGG, awesome. Not the best I've ever had but out of all the entrees I tried from this restaurant, they nailed the beef chow fun.

Baby romaine, baby arugula, microgreens all tossed with that magical balsamic reduction, tiny pieces of a salty, stinky blue cheese. Every bite was sublime. I sure can't make a salad like this (and believe me, I try regularly).\n\nCheese plate is reasonably priced, bordering on a steal, depending on what the daily cheese is.

Awesome.\n \nEntrees were good (mine) and amazing (the special, his). Eggplant roulade, mine, suffered from mush factor (maybe inclusion of walnuts or pine nuts inside the roll would give us something to bite into?). Flavor was stellar - smoky, bite and acid from the tomato concasse complimented the fresh mozz well, but I kept looking for more cheese. Of course, I always am. \n\nHis - mushroom bolognese, was flawless, surprisingly rich and meaty and deeply flavorful.
