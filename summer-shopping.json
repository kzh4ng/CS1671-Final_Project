A. Bank for mine and my groomsman's suits.  Allow me to give you a numbered breakdown of the issues we encountered when renting from Men's Wearhouse to be the groomsmen in our friends wedding.\n\n1- They never contacted us after the fitting after saying there would be a followup call.  The other groomsmen and I had to follow up repeatedly to get an answer as to when our tuxedos would arrive and the staff were very short with our honest questions over the phone.\n2- They sent two of our tuxedos to Homestead when we asked for them to be sent to Ross Park Mall during the fitting.\n3- When one of us called two days prior to the wedding to ask if our tux's had arrived the guy answering the phone said \"Oh... I don't know\" (insert an awkward, pregnant pause here while waiting for him to say \"Let me check that for you\") he instead said \"Well, I'm going to hang up now.\"  And he made good on that promise, and hung up.\n4- Despite saying we'd get a call a few weeks ahead of the wedding to be resized in case one of us gained a few lbs over the winter, this call never came so we basically had to hope that everything fit as it needed to.\n5- We were at one point informed that MW had our emails on file and that when our tuxes arrived at the store we would receive an email letting us know.  Not a single groomsman received any such email to that effect.\n6- One of the groomsmen randomly received a black tie while everybody else had white.  Another received no studs.  We discovered this approximately two hours to show-time while relatively far from civilization.\n7- On picking up my tux I informed the associate \"I'll be unable to get to a Men's Wearhouse for a few days after the wedding, is this alright?\" to which she responded \"Yeah that should be fine\" so when my girlfriend graciously dropped off my tux for me a few days later and learned of the $100 late fee, I was totally caught off guard.\n8- My girlfriend was also caught totally off guard by the associate at Ross Park Mall who was incredibly rude to her when  he informed her of said late fee.\n9- As the Best Man I was given a coupon card for $50 off my next rental at Men's Wearhouse.  Since I am in another wedding next month with rentals from MW I figured this would be an opportune time to use it.  Imagine my shock while paying for the next weddings rental, when I presented the coupon and was told \"Oh, that isn't for this.  That is intended for YOUR wedding.  Oh and it expires on December 31st of this year.\" \n10- The groom himself decided to use a coupon to purchase a suit for the wedding and to own, rather than rent a tux for the occasion.  He was ensured by the Homestead staff that the coupon would be fine for this purpose and got fitted for it.  When he went to pick up his suit and pay with the aid of said approved coupon he was instead forced into an argument with an associate who insisted he could not use the coupon towards the suit that an associate a few weeks earlier had insisted he could use.  Granted, now I am speaking for another person so take that with as much salt as you may, but he reiterated this fact to me several times prior to his wedding last week.\n\nOver my friends wedding weekend, any time anything even went slightly wrong at and around his wedding, the joke between the Groom and his Groomsmen was \"Effing Men's Wearhouse.\"  For example, at a restaurant, \"Wait I asked for no onions on this sandwich. - Effing Men's Wearhouse!\"  \"Noise complaint at the hotel room? Men's Wearhouse.\"\n\nAnother groomsman looked at me when we discovered the wrong color tie one of us received and said to me \"I hope you're taking notes for your own impending wedding\" to which I replied \"Perhaps I could find better service from GoodWill of Western PA\"\n\nCongrats Men's Wearhouse.  You became the butt of every joke for every mishap for an entire weekend around a wedding to which you provided the suits.\n\nTL;DR - 10 mistakes, several rude associates and 1 future groom going to Jos. A. Bank.", "business_id": "DMy5IG-dNrH4ARk96KngEA", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-06-20", "type": "review"}

Last year, he also rented a tux there for an out-of-town wedding he was in. After the wedding was over (the next day, before we returned home), we returned the tux to a MW at the local mall, also sans any issues.\n\nRecently, said husband got a promotion and bought some dress pants and shirts from MW at the mall, and was sent a $50 gift card. Last weekend, we decided to head down to The Waterfront....lo and behold, there's a MW in Homestead. Who knew? So, we head to MW to see if he can get something for free. Before we go in, I ask him, how much are pants normally at MW? He said, oh about $50 or $60. Okay, well the cheapest pair of pants we find are around $130, but most around $200?! I'm shocked, never thought men's dress clothes were so pricey. Again, who knew? Surprisingly, we were able to sift through the sale racks and were able to find one pair of pants on sale for $19.99 and dress shirts for $14.99! Very exciting! \n\nThe problem was the staff and the store itself. First of all, the store was messy. Sales racks had clothes out of place and shirts rolled up, not a good impression for a 'high end' men's clothing store, not to mention it was hard to look for sizes etc. with everything out of place.\n\nThe biggest issue was with the staff. There were five employees in the store. Okay, I get it, they work on commission, but seriously. The one and only employee who approached us, and I can't remember her name but she was a middle-aged Russian woman- was a shark! She asked if we need help, we both say no, we're fine. Just looking. I am much more assertive than my husband, however, which she realized right away. Needless to say, she wouldn't leave us alone. I tried several times - nicely - to tell her we were just looking around. My husband said, I'm looking for some dress shirts and pants. maybe a tie. She just doesn't get it...keeps asking \"Do you want to look at more ties?\" \"We have nice blazers and jackets\" I'm finally like, lady we're only here because we have a gift card, we don't plan on spending a ton of money. Getting her to leave us alone was near impossible. If it would have been me alone, I would have walked out. However, I knew my husband wanted to use the gift card.\n\nThe worst part is there were other customers in the store that no one was waiting on. Some of which were looking around for assistance. I didn't get it.\n\nContinuing on, check out was a nightmare! Each and every item rang up more than the price tag. She had to end up cancelling the sale and re-doing the whole thing. We had to carefully scrutinize every thing she rang up, to make sure we weren't overcharged. We ended up going over the $50 - obviously. So, she says, \"You can swipe your card there.\" I said, \"We have cash\" and omg you would have thought it was the end of the world. They had no money in the drawer and she actually had to send another employee in the back to get us change. \n\nLet's just say, I'm sure my hub won't returning here anytime soon. You can buy nice men's clothing almost anywhere else for less money and less hassle. \n\nPros: None", "business_id": "DMy5IG-dNrH4ARk96KngEA", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-06-23", "type": "review"}

I think the days of simply bringing your bike in for a quick and relatively inexpensive tune-up and a few fixes are long gone.    \n\nThis review is more for the repair end of BBB. In their defense BBB does appear to carry some amazing brands of bike (ie Colnago) that you just don't find anywhere else in Pittsburgh. \n\nAt BBB I was charged $250 for a tune up and a few other things. Granted this included installing a sew up tire (which I can understand would cost approx $50), Swapping out a left side (big ring) shifter on my down tube (this should have cost approx. $20 at most) and installing new bar tape (cost of tape $20 and $20 to install?).. SO WHAT\"S WITH $140 FOR A TUNE UP? Well the story goes like this:\n\nI bring the bike into BBB prior to the nice weather hitting Pittsburgh in hopes of trying what people have said is a great bike shop and getting my OCLV TREK 5900 ready for the season. Turns out I don't hear from these guys. A week goes by ...two weeks...I think that's ok I have two or three other bike I can turn to for a ride. Then I wind up going out of town for a week thinking for sure I'll get a call from them re: my bike is ready to roll...but no dice. So I call. Turns out a screw snapped when the mechanic was re-installing the down tube shifter and it had to be tapped out (is that my fault?). He says \"Should be ready in a few days\". So I come in a few days later to this mammoth bill. I ask if I am paying for the labor of taping out the screw? I don't think I ever got a straight answer? I look at the bill and can't see a good breakdown of the charges. Normally I would \"duke it over\" a bill like this but I figured...I had somewhere I to be 10 minutes ago and at least I finally have my bike. I would expect that for that money my bike could have been stripped down to the frame and totally gone over (overhauled). But it wasn't.  Well BBB I'll give you a star because the mechanic did do a good job in that my cycle shifts well and the tape job on the bars looks great (nice wrap). Plus I'll toss in a star for your outstanding selection of high end cycles.

It has a lot of points going for it that other thrift shops consistently mess up.\n\n1. It's well lit.  You can SEE the clothing, see whatever might be wrong with it, and make an honest assessment.  You're never surprised when you leave at the state of the items you've just bought.\n\n2. It is surprisingly clean.  Nothing seems to smell, so I can only imagine they've laundered everything thoroughly. \n\n3. There are good quality brands--Ann Taylor, Kenneth Cole, etc.  It's mainly items along these lines.  You're more likely to find twinsets than clubbing tops here, which if you're over the age of 21 is a good thing.\n\n4. Markdowns and fresh merchandise.  These people *know* how to turn over their stock.  Because the place is never empty, and there are specials every day, the stock flips rapidly.  The merchandise is never the same week to week, so as I mentioned before, it's addictive.  You never know what you'll find.\n\nA summary of a few things I've bought here: a 6 dollar designer knit dress, a few silk twinsets ($2-$5), countless heels, two pairs of Birkenstocks and two pairs of Doc Martens ($4-$8), a dressmaker's bust ($5), a pressure cooker ($7)....\n\nYou get the picture.

Granted, it has the basics you need, and is 1 of the biggest in the city itself.  Finding things takes work.  My big gripe is that it has one of the weirdest and most illogical layouts that I've seen.  It actually takes time to find what you need as compared to most stores where once you are in there a few times, you easily find everything.  Parts of this store are diagonal and that causes you to go in every direction possible.  Here is a quick summary of the setup as it can be classified as a maze:\n\n1.) When you enter the store through the slow wide door, you go to the left and walk past the front registers to produce.  Normal enough.\n\n2.) From produce in front of you (a quasi L-shaped department), you take a quick left and go diagonally to the right to walk past the pharmacy.  Take a hard right down aisle 1 and then you hit the bakery.   \n\n3.)  From the bakery, you walk along a long meat wall.  Diagonally to the left, you'll find the service meat/seafood counters. And because how the wall goes diagonal to the left, the sign for Aisle 9 is facing diagonally to the right so you don't miss it because the 1 side is longer towards the back than the other. (Aisles 9-14 are almost twice as long as 1-8).\n\n4.) From meat, you have frozen straight back on a long back wall in its own cove.  A hard right (if you bypass frozen) brings you last to hot foods, the deli, and then facing in front of you, the Customer Service desk which is tucked away in a corner (not really visible when you walk in the store).\n\n5.) Once you pass the deli and customer service, take a hard right, then to the left (almost a U-turn) to the checkouts, and then you take a hard left to leave.\n\nMost of the other Giant Eagle stores are much more logical in how their aisles and deparment locations are set up.   You're not going every which way to try and find things.\n\nAlso, the service isn't that great as one of the other reviews said.  Given that, I would take Market District on Centre Ave or GE on Murray Ave over this store.\n\nHowever, for those who remember the Giant Eagle on Centre Ave at N. Craig St, nothing beats how BAD that store was.  There is a reason that store was nicknamed \"the dirty bird.\"  Compared to that North Oakland store that closed several years ago, Shakespeare St GE is light years ahead.", "business_id": "BG4N0V93wml9kaU6YYRxRA", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-06-09", "type": "review"}

From the moment you walk into here it's like someone has hit you on the head very hard and you walk around in a confused state the rest of the time you're in there.\n\nThe set up is ridiculous.  I mean, who wants to walk around in the freezer section and then go through a smaller than usual end of the aisle to see, SURPRISE, the meat section hidden off in an area where they could have knocked down the wall so you didn't have to do a little dance to get to it.  Aisles seem extra long in this store, you can tell that they worked with the space they had.  It's like when you are half way through the aisle and realize it's too late to turn around because it's the same distance to the end as it was to the beginning of the aisle, but you kind of just want to give up and sit on the floor because you feel like you've been walking forever.  \n\nHonestly, I only went here because I was at Target and didn't want to venture any further to complete my shopping.", "business_id": "BG4N0V93wml9kaU6YYRxRA", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-06-09", "type": "review"}

Let me repeat, never again. \n\nThe primary reason I used to visit this store was to fill medical prescriptions. Due to their repeated inability and ineptness in fulfilling simple requests, I cannot continue to patronize this store.\n\nWalking into the store, you are given the stink-eye by a minimum wage security guard, which automatically gives you as a customer the warm and fuzzy \"guilty-until-proven guilty\" feeling a shoplifter would get, which is what this store assumes everyone is based upon their decision to lock up the mouthwash and shampoo.\n\nThe pharmacy seems to be staffed by high school interns.  They have no concept of customer service, nor do they display any attention to detail, which is quite frankly frightening in a pharmacy.  I really think my chihuahua would make a better pharmacist than the people who work here - my chihuahua lick you to death before you got your prescriptions, but at least you'd get greeted when you approach the counter, and you'd get what you ask for.\n\nThe first mishap was when my wife and I changed prescription insurance providers.  i handed wanna-be pharmacist #1 my new insurance card.  After spending about 5 minutes staring into a computer screen behind the counter, he assured me that they had my insurance information in the computer.  I then returned in the following days to fill a prescription, trusting in what wanna-be pharmacist #1 had told me in the days prior.  When I went to check out the bill came to over $300, which I chalked up \"maybe I have to meet a deductible before the coverage kicks in.\"  Upon further research, we discovered that wanna-be pharmacist #1 had NOT updated my insurance information and had run the numerous prescriptions I filled under my old insurance.\n\nThe latest of many \"adventures\" involved my wife calling in a prescription refill.  We stopped to pick it up on the way home from work, only to be told when we arrived that the insurance won't cover the refill until tomorrow.  Again, she CALLED and SPOKE to one of them to refill the prescription before showing up.  I guess it's too much to ask to TELL someone you're speaking to on the phone that they need to wait a day for the insurance to work before coming into a ghetto pharmacy to not pick up a prescription.  But hey, at least wanna-be pharmacist #2 behind the counter was dressed like a stripper, which gave me and my wife some comic relief for the moment.  \n\nWe then returned the following day to (again) pick up the prescription we called to have refilled 2 days prior.  We were first told by wanna-be pharmacist #3 that there weren't any prescriptions waiting for us.  After searching around for a few minutes, they \"found\" my wife's prescription refill, but it would take 10 minutes to be ready.  Yes, the prescription that we tried to pick up yesterday would need another 10 minutes to be prepared.

A dark-haired guy greeted me as I walked in and treated me like a total noob, and his demeanor made me feel like the dirt under his shoes. However, he did give me good information and service about my camera when prompted by another man in the shop (who I might assume is Bernie). \n\nThey told me they could send it to the manufacturer where they'd clean it for a couple hundred bucks, but instead they cleaned out the sensors and the lens right there at the counter and checked the contacts between the lens and the camera. The dark-haired guy showed me through a magnifying glass what I was looking at, and explained that some spots I saw in the viewfinder were inside the top of the camera and wouldn't appear on the pictures. The other guy (Bernie?) explained to me some of the functions of the camera -- I knew these already, but it was nice to hear them explained and he showed me a few examples. They advised me to get a UV filter to protect my lens, which I knew was overpriced but I happily bought anyway to pay for their service. \n\nSo I think the kind of experience you get depends entirely on the person you run into. I can see how someone would be put off by the dark haired guy I ran into first, and how someone would absolutely love the service from the other guy.

We found this place through our Home Warranty Company.  Our dishwasher was broken when we moved into our new house. The sellers were supposed to have it fixed by this company before we moved in however it was still not working on move-in day-would not drain.  I called Perla and they had no record of being out to our place to fix the dishwasher (sellers did pay for it) and said they think they had the wrong zip code written down and could not find the house. I mean are you kidding me??!!  So we scheduled an appointment for a service man to come out. This took several calls as they rarely answer their phone and one lady is extremely rude whenever she answers.  The service man was scheduled to come in a week between 1-4pm.  He shows up at 4:30 because he typed the wrong house address into his GPS instead of going to the appointment scheduled before us. Well lucky us.  He recommends we get a new dishwasher as it would be cheaper than fixing and he leaves after 10 minutes. The home warranty company says otherwise and tell Perla they will pay for the parts.  Perla never calls to make another appointment so again I have to call about 5 times until I can get someone on the phone to schedule a second appointment.  We were told the parts they ordered had come in.  The day they were supposed to arrive we did not get a call so I called and they said they cannot find the parts they ordered for us. Another are you kidding me!!  Two weeks ago they said the parts had arrived. They said they would call back if they find the parts and never do.  Meanwhile we are waiting at home for them to arrive.  I call them back and the parts have been found and I demand they tell me when they will be coming. In an hour they finally show up and fix our dishwasher.  So far so good but honestly I would have rather bought a new dishwasher at Lowes and been saved the headache of dealing with this company.

There is something interesting around every corner, tucked onto every shelf - from pens you can't get anywhere else to fine writing paper to porcelains and art supplies to leather handbags and wedding invitations and greeting cards - it's all jam-packed into every crowded aisle and every nook and cranny. \n\nLook up and you'll see a balcony beckoning...wind your way around and climb the stairs to the second floor balcony ....there you'll find gorgeous yarns in wools and linens and silks, nubby or smooth, delicate or chunky, brightly hued and sequined or softly demure. Comfy chairs dot the space where you can sit a while and think about what yarn would work up best for your imagined project or settle into an old wooden rocker while you ponder the possibilities. Not feeling up to the daunting task of creating your own knitware? There are gorgeous sweaters and bags, baby items and slippers...little treasures for sale all over.\n\nThe salespeople at Weldin's are friendly and helpful - again, a throwback to the past. Don't expect instant service as they take their time to serve the needs of each customer. Wait your turn and your patience will be rewarded with advice to get you the right tool for the job. This isn't an instant gratification kind of place....it hearkens back to the ease of a gentler time with a leisurely pace and gracious manners. So breathe, relax and enjoy your surroundings while you wait. \n\nOh, while you're waiting you may be graced with the presence of one of the cats that roam the store or walk to the back to say hello to the beautiful Shar Pei or Bernese Mountain Dog in the back. I guarantee that after spending some chill time in Weldins, your blood pressure will be lower, you'll have a smile on your face and a feeling that all is right with the world.", "business_id": "cWe1Xoczmj2vD5h6BOrZYg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-07-14", "type": "review"}

You walk into the storefront into a cavern of bike things and bike parts. Literally things stacked everywhere... with a narrow aisle that you can just barely walk with your bike through. The back of the store is a mechanic room that has several stations/stands where you can work on your bike - it's a bit more open, but also lined with shelfs and stacks of parts, and tools and scrap. There always seems to be people there who are willing to help or offer their opinion on how to do things. Gerry is also willing to help you with any other things you don't know or can't figure out by yourself. This is an awesome shop if you need anything special, if you lost a bolt or a nut or any other little piece that you can think of and need a replacement, this is the place to go. I love that you can spend an afternoon fixing up your bike your self, and having any of the tools or parts that you would need available and also at the cheapest possible price (for the parts). First time I was ever there, Gerry greeted me nicely, and invited me back into the shop to do the the work myself. I consulted him a couple of times - it was a busy afternoon at the shop, but he told me what i needed to do... and left me to play with it myself. I'm sure if you know nothing about bikes, or are working on a more complicated issue, he would have just as much insight, though I still get the feeling that he expects you to learn and pull your own weight in the repair/maintenance of your bike. I like that do-it-yourself attitude, but if you are looking for a place to drop off your bike and have the shop do all the work, this is probably not the place. \n\nAs far as Gerry being gruff... i didn't have that experience, really, but I see what people mean. I think he is not that outgoing and personable in a superficial way, but is willing to help or talk to anyone who wants to learn about their bike or needs help.

My first visit to Kraynick's was during a panic situation, otherwise known as a tire blow-out.  Having commuted to work daily by bike for 3+ years, I've been strangely immune to things like flats, blowouts, or really anything of the sort.  So when it happened, I had no clue what to do.  I thought about visiting Performance Bike in East Liberty, where I purchased my current ride, but the lure of Kraynick's was too much.  Plus, I was able to leave work 10 minutes early and actually get there before their 6pm closing time.  \n\nWith busted tire in one hand, I pushed the door open and was greeted with - well, I'm not really sure how to describe it.  An avalanche perhaps, of bicycle parts EVERYWHERE.  Seriously, hanging in every nook and cranny; taking up every inch of counter space; even occupying each step of the stairs near the front door (at least I think they were stairs...).  I'm pretty sure I just stood there in awe for a minute before taking a few more hesitant steps inside.  \n\nI'd read enough reviews to know that the white-haired man was Jerry.  I waited for a few minutes while Jerry finished up with his customer and then just sort of presented my tire to him with a smile and a look that said \"please don't judge me for not knowing what to do about this.\"  No judgement.  Jerry told me that it was a dangerous blowout and he hoped that I hadn't been going too fast.  Then he plucked an identical tire from the ceiling rack above his head and asked me if I needed anything else.  I rocked back and forth on my heels a few times before sheepishly asking if he could tell me how to change the tire once I returned home.  In, I swear, no less than 10 words, he explained the process and wished me luck.  For $20 I bought a tire, tube and the, um, the things you use to take the tire off...tire irons?  I'll take a class someday. Seriously.  \n\nAaaanyway.  I returned to the shop earlier this week with the other tire, which had been experiencing an annoying slow leak.  Jerry told me it was just the tube and offered his tools in \"the back\" so I could do a quick change.  Well, if the front room was filled to the brim with every part under the cycle sun, the back room was equally bursting with every tool imaginable; none of which I knew how to use.  With the kind help of a few of the guys who were working on their own bikes, I managed to change out the tube in no time, leaving the shop with a kind of silly sense of accomplishment and some incredibly black hands.", "business_id": "HzZmhlRNLtPkMI0egh9Oig", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-08-31", "type": "review"}

Two and a half weeks ago I googled bridal dress alterations and BB popped up as a search.  It was near by to my house and my fiance said it was a very popular place, so I figured I would give them a call.  The woman on the phone asked me several questions about the dress and she said she could fit me in.  I was a little weary about the appointment being in two and a half weeks since I didnt have much time before I was getting on a plane for Bora Bora (and she knew the date I needed it by).  I figured they knew what they were doing, so I became excited about the day to go in and get to have it fitted for me.  I went in, dress and shoes in hand prepared to try it on and have them fit it to my body.  It just needed to be let out a bit around the rib cage and shortened... nothing too difficult.  The woman at the desk asked me how she could help me and I said I had an appointment for a dress alteration.   She looked down at her book and was searching for my name... then two other woman came up and the one asked if I had gotten my dress there because they did not know who I was and could not see that I had purchased a dress there and they didnt have a phone number for me (Funny, because I remember leaving my phone number when I made the appointment... who doesn't when they make such an im.  She stated that \"We only do alterations on dresses bought here\".  I told the woman I was never told that, ad she said well the person who made the appointment should have told you that.... WELL GUESS WHAT!!!!  She did not!!!! And you wasted two and a half weeks of my already very short time frame.  SHe stated that she would go ask to see if something could be done.  Of course she came back and stated that she is sorry, but they cannot help me.  I of course stood there telling them that it was not my fault that I was not told what so ever.  WHy would I waste two and a half weeks of an already small time frame.  Bottom line is that the three woman stood there staring at me and refused to even make an exception.  You messed up, not me... so have good customer service and make an exception.  They of course could care less about me.  They did not even offer to give me a local seamstress that they thought I could possibly use. I HAD TO ASK IF THEY RECOMMENDED SOMEONE!!!!  What horrible service this place gives!  Thankfully the woman that they ended up giving me was FANTASTIC... Ss glad I found her.  She is getting the dress done in a week, probably ALOT quicker than BB would.  I was just rather bothered by the customer service I was given, they could have handled the situation ALOT different.  I was actually planning on buying a second wedding dress from there, but after my experience I would rather give my business elsewhere.  I am not downing the dresses at BB nor the customer service that you may be given if you have actually already bought a dress from there.... I am merely telling the customer service I was given.  Just because I didnt buy a dress from there does not mean you dismiss me....

The first time I went in to try on bridesmaid dresses the woman gushed over every dress I tried on, even though I looked like an 8 year old child in the extremely oversized dresses.  I hated every dress we tried on because they were down to my mid calf and about 8 sizes to big.  The bride chose a dress hoping it would look better in a smaller size.  When we were being fitted for the dress, I measured a size 6.  When I tried on a size 6, it was way too big and fell right to the floor.  I tried on a size 4 in a different dress and it fix perfectly.  They recommended I get a size 6 though because it was a different dress.  I'm not sure as to why they would waste my time (20 minutes to get the size 4 from downstairs) to try on a dress that wasn't relevant to the decision making.  They then went back and forth as to whether I should in fact get the size 4 or 6.  They told me it was up to me, that the size 4 may fit perfectly, but may be too tight.  I lost my temper immediately after because this is their job and they do this everyday!  They measured me!  They know my measurements, they should know what size I should get!!  They told me I should get the 6 and will just have to have it taken in (they love the fee for alterations!!).  I decided on the size 4 because at this point I did not trust them.  Of course, when I get the size 4, it is too tight in the chest (partially my fault!).  So I take it to be let out, which is a half inch on each side.  She had me stay in the dressing room while she was out front discussing my alterations with the rest of the staff.  I was tired of waiting so I went out front and it got very quiet and awkward.  Almost as if they were trying to hide something from me.  She then said the bride wanted all dresses to be 2 inches above the knee so she had to take it up a quarter inch...really?!  The cost of the alterations were $90!!!!  And I would have to leave work early to come back for TWO fittings.  I called the bride, she said she never said the dresses has to be a certain length.  I then began looking up other alteration places to go to and Lu Lu's (Reweaving and Reknitting Shop) had wonderful reviews.  I took my dress and said I was going somewhere else very politely.  They said okay, you will pay the same amount.....which I did not!", "business_id": "x2y1d9-v6ReSXJasCagyNg", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-06-10", "type": "review"}

The service is just OK, and from other experiences in boutique shops I'm afraid to say this was the worst. Usually you are pampered and treated with interest and care (isn't this one of the reasons of not using a huge bridal store?) but here I would say we were treated more like a number than a customer.\n\nOur alteration service was subpar at best and management didn't quite seem to care. We came in for multiple appointments feeling nothing had been done since the last one, (and they admitted that was the case) so why did we even come in? Then a week before the wedding when we were promised certain things would be done, we show up and nothing was ready or done! They make us come in AGAIN and the things that should have been done are now done, but it needs to be pressed. We come in for the final fitting and the bustle is still up and there are creases in the front, but are assured it was pressed. Really? On top of EVERYTHING the seamstress loudly pointed out during a fitting that weight had been gained and we would need to take the dress out and went on to ask \"Just how much weight had she gained\" ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Obviously we are aware but it is not to you to point this out or make her feel bad for it. We left half of the fittings crying and the bride is a VERY reasonable bride, and hasn't been emotional at any other point of the wedding planning. \n\nTwo stars for the dress and dress selection.", "business_id": "x2y1d9-v6ReSXJasCagyNg", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-08-29", "type": "review"}

So for anyone who hears that... they have NOT-they used to be in one place in Mt Leb... but they moved down the road!  The new location is so beautiful inside- trying on your dress and coming out to your friends and family in this beautiful shop makes you feel like a princess- it is just like you see on tv shows (much unlike some other local bridal shops I visited, which are basically just a notch up from your normal everyday dressing rooms).  I brought my mom, sister, grandmother and best friend, and there was room for everyone and room for me to walk, twirl, and show off.  :) Now for the dress...  I went in with my own ideas of what I thought I wanted.  Greg brought me a couple of dresses to try on that fit that description.  They were beautiful, but not \"the one\".  But then he said he had one he wanted me to try that was different than what I said I was looking for. I wasn't keen on that idea, and even after seeing it on the hanger, I didn't think I'd like it at all, nor did my family.  I was completely wrong.  This dress, THE dress, was amazing, and Greg's ideas and vision were SPOT ON.  He added a headpiece that was simply amazing, another thing I would have never tried.  Since Anne Gregory was my first stop on my \"day of dresses\", I wasn't comfortable buying the dress before I visited some other stores.  So I left and went to the remainder of my appointments.  But my family and I quickly found it was a total waste of time.  None of the shops compared, none of the gowns compared, and I knew I had already found my dress.  I made another appointment for the following week, tried it on again, and then bought my dress.  Greg and Maryann are extremely good at what they do, and were both so wonderful to work with.  It seems to me that Greg and Maryann take a lot of pride in their business (it is their shop), take things to heart, and believe they have the best around.

Instead of pulling dresses similar to what I wanted (dropped waist, full skirt) he continually brought out trumpet and mermaid dresses that are just not my style at all. Its nice that he found them flattering on me, but i was clearly not interested.\n\nWhen I left, I expressed how I had had my eye on the particular dress from the designer and how it was basically my dream dress and I still very much wanted to try it on.

The whole feel of the place is comforting and classy. I never felt rushed to make a decision-- and believe me when it came down to deciding between two dresses it took me awhile! In fact, after I decided on the dress Greg sat and talked to my mom and I for a half hour or so. He made us feel welcome. There is no doubt we are in good hands at Anne Gregory.

Let's just say that I saved more than I spent.\n\nWhat stuck out to me was that the girl--I believe her name was Georgette--who rang me up went out of her way to make sure that I got the best deal possible with all of my promotions that I could use.  It took three times as long to ring up me, but she was very patient and friendly during the process.

We walked into Shooters Express Gun Shop looking to pop off a few rounds. The range is in the back of the shop, ensuring that you walk through the retail portion. There are two separate ranges, one for rifles/shotguns and one for handguns. \n\nWe checked in with the range master and he asked if it we had safety cards. We didn't, as this was our first visit. He handed us a business card sized safety card and told us to fill in the info (name & birthday). That was it. I'm not sure what video the others are referring to, as we didn't watch it. \n\nThe range itself had terrible ventilation. No air conditioning/cooling just a fan that didn't oscillate. Sweating at the lanes while trying to hold a loaded gun. No bueno. The lighting was poor. \n\nMy biggest complaint is pricing. $18 per hour per PERSON... with an one hour minimum. Most indoor ranges charge by lane, not person. Plus... they charge for targets... Customer service was poor and unfriendly. $40 for two people to shoot for less than 30 minutes (we brought our own guns & ammo, otherwise that figure would be way higher). \n\nThe bathroom was gross. With how much money they are making at the range, you would figure they could at least spruce up the bathroom a bit.

He brought it home and I was ecstatic to have it back only to be let down again because it wasn't sized.  \n\nWe went back to the store together the following day.  The associate slid the ring down the sizer and low and behold, the size has not been changed.  The company must keep it another week.  I go again to pick it up and it fits!

We explain what happened earlier and she tells us she cannot help us without the paperwork.  SERIOUSLY?!  So now we are fuming.

She gave me a rundown of the basics about the store and their offerings of engagement rings. Then we got right into it. My fiancee had been pinning designs that she liked so I pulled up that list to help narrow things down. Once we had gone through all of the display cases I narrowed it down to four rings. \n\nWe skipped past the pitch about diamonds as I had already heard it many times at other jewelry stores. Finally I grabbed all of the information on the four rings to be pleasantly surprised that the one I liked the best and the one I thought my fiancee would like was significantly discounted because it had been discontinued. \n\nI went back to my hotel to upload the options to the fiancee's Pinterest board and to do some research. After poking around on different websites and asking some sneaky questions to my fiancee I decided to go back and purchase the Neil Lane ring that had been discontinued. It turns out that there was almost the exact same ring still in production which was full price so I knew I'd be kicking myself later if I didn't snag this deal.\n\nUpon returning to the store a few hours later, the staff member I was dealing with earlier was busy so I had a look around to see if I could find something to bring back for my lady as a gift that would throw her off the trail of me looking at rings.\n\nDuring the purchase process I was informed that I would be getting a bunch of their reward points. This was perfect as I wanted to get something else for her, but the catch was that the points could only be used on certain designer brands. After looking at these, there was nothing that was in the price range that I wanted to spend on after the amount I spent on the ring. Later on in my trip I went to a different mall and bought her a Coach purse.\n\nOverall I had a great experience here. The sales staff were very helpful and informative and went above and beyond to help me out in finding the right ring.", "business_id": "UlY2l61fqYgOa1dvogNCRw", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-06-24", "type": "review"}

Sunday, so while I expected a fair amount of family's and the noise that comes with them, I was pleasantly surprised that even the children passing through were well behaved and virtually unnoticeable from behind my book. The disruption was instead caused by employees. I realize this isn't a library, but customers camping out and reading quietly is the norm at any B&N. 2 lady employees were complaining loudly; one was a teacher, maybe the other was as well? The one complaining loudly was young and clearly unhappy with her students. From there I heard all about how they didn't listen to her instruction on an assignment and her subsequent \"punishment quiz\" she gave them afterwards. \n\nThis conversation made me sad. I couldn't help but listen as they were standing literally right in front of me and they were by no means hiding their remarks. Clearly this woman isn't connecting with her students and instead of taking a different approach she went with punishment. No wonder her students didn't listen to her, she seems to hate her job...\n\nMy boyfriend had left his book in the chair next to me... I saw it when he did it and knew he was doing it wrong; he'd left the book face down and open (the way you shouldn't leave a book). I didn't think much of it knowing that he would be purchasing it, however the other employee did. She clearly didn't realize we were together and when she noticed the book she grabbed it and exclaimed how much she hates it when people do that. I explained that he was coming back and the he would be purchasing this book to which she shoved a magazine subscription card in his place and explained they can't sell the books after they've been bent like that. Totally understand her point. 100%. She just seemed so unapologetic after I told her the situation and caught her exploding unnecessarily.\n\nI guess the point of my review is more about professionalism on the job...

They also have a lot of foreign, indie, and classic films, as well as TV shows, anime, and even a lot of VHS.\n\nThe staff has been friendly and helpful each time we've been in.

Also, you have the option of searching for a movie you want online, and it will tell if they have it and which section.  Hurray for that!\n\nIs it a little more expensive than Redbox?  Well, sort of.  If you're renting for one day, then I suppose so.  However, most of their rentals are for multiple days, and you will find so many movies here that aren't found in a Redbox.\n\nThe only caveat is that you have to have a credit card to rent.

I couldn't believe how vast it is, and upon walking in my head was practically spinning. I didn't even know where to start. So like any anxious and excited shopper would do, I grabbed a cart and began at the first aisle, determined to make my way down them all. Prepare your eyes and your nose upon entering: they will be treated with the beautiful vignettes around every corner and the wonderful scents that fill the air. \n\nEverything here is displayed so beautifully that you could picture the items in your own home easily  (perfect for all of you decoratively challenged people out there). I found that they have a great range of style; from traditional, to country, to cute items and more classy ones. I do agree with what Lindsey said in a previous review, that if you are into the contemporary look you may not find a big selection in here. But they do have very unique items that you won't find anywhere else. \n\nGoing back to the set-up of this store: it's a huge warehouse that is broken down into aisles, and each aisle has smaller sections you can stop and browse through. Think of a flea market, but far more upscale. Others can lease spaces in here as well, which is great for local artists and entrepreneurs to sell their items out of, and also awesome for consumers who now have the privelege of coming to one store and visiting several all at the same time. You can be assured that most of what you see here cannot be found in department stores. \n\nThe list of what they offer is endless, but to give you an idea: they have gorgeous furniture (both large and small pieces), tabletop items like decorative dishes and candleholders, wall items such as clocks, signs with clever sayings, and beautiful canvas scrolls, seasonal decor (you HAVE to see the christmas displays they have up already, they are magnificent!), funky little gifty items, such as mugs and martini glasses that are all handpainted with different themes (see pic), children's items, and more, plus a whole design center in the back loaded with furniture. You can literally get lost in this store. \n\nThe prices vary depending on the type of item and the vendor (as I mentioned, some outside vendors rent space here). But the range is so wide you are sure to find something here that suits your taste. So set aside a few hours, wear comfortable shoes and head over there.

Returned with smiles and no hassle. I hope store does not start going down hill. I heard Publics treats customers well. Shame on them.

(Fall fabrics are either American-made Woolrich wools, Japanese artisanal wools and/or organically produced.) http://www.capitolcharlotte.com/symmetry-scarves-and-poole-shop-capsule-collection \n\n3) LemLem - Ethiopian hand-woven cotton clothing. It doesn't get any better than LemLem in the spring and summer. \n\nI also love the cult favorite, Isabel Marant & Etoile.

There just weren't enough hours in the day or days in the week to read everything I wanted.  But with online buying so convenient I hadn't bought a book from a brick and mortar book store in I don't know how long.\n\nI was in the area, and I had a few hours to kill and nothing to do.  i saw this place.  It's big.  It's very big, and they have a wide variety of genres from romance novels to DIY to travel to music Dvds and everything in between.  It's big enough that each section has a lot to choose from.\n\nThat was important to me because I had been looking for a good book that teaches Brazilian Portuguese.  I didn't want to just buy something online that I didn't get a chance to flip through first.  This place has a decent sized foreign language section, and I'll be doggoned if they didn't have exactly what I was looking for.  I got a beginning level language book with CD and a workbook with its own CD.  My high level of integrity forces me to say that the book was very expensive compared to what I could get from Amazon, and I'm not talking about the used marked up books with mystery stains on them.  I'm talking about a new book from Amazon would cost about 40% less.

From the get go, the gum-chewing-lip-smacking Morgan was completely lacking in anything remotely close to customer service. We arrived with a coupon from David's Bridal for $40 off a tux rental and was met with the realization that it was for Prom only (despite the small print not saying Prom only rentals). When I told her where we'd gotten the code, she agreed that yes, a $40 coupon was in David's Bridals free catalogs at the store, but she was unable to use any coupon codes to get the discount.\n\nSo let me go over this: I have a coupon. Give coupon. Not valid on this transaction, but there are other coupons in the same place you got this. I don't have that coupon. Sorry cannot help you even though I know that coupon exists and the code is simply DBAW and 6 numbers.\n\nWow, wow and wow.

Customer service means service with a smile (no smile on Morgan but sloppy dress and bra showing, check!). Customer Service means going above and beyond (perhaps giving us a working coupon to use). Customer service means using your brain and not being a complete idiot when it comes to common sense.\n\nSo, what did I do when she rang up the charge full price? I called David's Bridal in NorthLake and got AMAZING customer service by the first person who picked up who was glad to tell me the current wedding coupon code, which I told to an apathetic Morgan. Me - 1, Her - 0. Chick, you don't even know the lengths I will go to so that we can save money with or without your horrible help.\n\nAnd what's a cake without icing?

The butcher lady initially said that there was a recall. Then she said that the meat had been discontinued and she wasn't sure why they would advertise it.

Mall parties were where it was at for small-town pre-teens circa 1997. \n\nAnywho, the East Towne Mall of today is unrecognizable from the mall I remember as a kid. They've done a lot to renovate it and seem to be going for a more upscale vibe. There are a few holdouts from back in the day in addition to the anchor stores (Spencer's, Vanity, Bath & Body Works - who, adding to the nostalgia factor, are currently offering discontinued scents like Country Apple and Plumeria), but most of the stores are new to me. \n\nUpsides are that the mall is clean and offers ample space to navigate through; downsides are that the lighting is weirdly dim and the atmosphere almost somber. I don't find the mall all that fun to go to generally, but East Towne has a particularly downer vibe for a place that is in good condition and has nearly every storefront filled.

I find it ridiculous and horrible business to dismiss someone just because the closing hour is coming up.  The correct response to make a sale would obviously be \"we're closing in 5 minutes, anything can help you find quickly?\", but alas, even that was beyond the capacity of this staff. \n\nHere's the cherry on this cake of crap. As we were pulling away from the greenhouse with our windows down, we heard someone yelling \"help me! Help me!\" We looked inside the gated area which had obviously been locked due to the magical 5:00PM closing hour the staff were so keen to make, and there was a lady LOCKED INSIDE THE GATE... I kid you not, the staff was in such a hurry to lock the store and get out, and they literally LOCKED SOMEONE IN THEIR GREENHOUSE. I immediately jumped out of the car, told her I would let the staff know and strolled up the door.  A lady came and unlocked it, and I told her \"You locked someone in your greenhouse.\" She laughed it off and then slammed the door in my face. \n\nSo just to recap, horrible customer service, horrible attention to detail, and horribly unfeeling staff.

I needed to simply pump up a tire on my nephew's bike. I had trouble getting to the air value due to a spoke that was a little to snug to the value. Very simple issue....\n\nI walked in and there was a white lady getting her bike fixed. Another white lady and a white gentleman came in after me. \n\nThe first lady bike was serviced. I was clearly next. The guy working there looked past me and serviced the white lady before me! It was clear that I was next, but he didn't serve me. \n\nI patiently waiting thinking something was strange. He then asked me what I needed. I explained and we walked to the pump. He started to pump the air into the value, stopped 1/2 way through, and went to help the white gentleman. He just left me standing there. ??????\n\nHe got a set of tires for the man and left me wondering what I had done. I walked back in the shop wondering what was going on. I stood next to the gentleman. As the worker charged the man's credit card in the front of the store, the customer looked at me and apologized for the man working. He thanked me for my patience and went along. \n\nAgain, we went to the pump and the worker finished pumping up the front tire. I proceeded to ask him if he would squeeze the back tire to see if it needed air too. He refused to do it, telling me that I 'should know how to do it.' He told me that 'this is a simply life skill that I should already know how to do'. Huh? \n\nI said, 'In your professional opinion, would you suggest that I add more air to the tire?'. He replied with a short, crisp, snotty attitude, \"you feel the front tire and it (the back tire) needs air, do it\". Wow!!!!!\n\n...and he walked back in the store, leaving me by myself. \n\nI'm serious, I stood there shocked and wondering what was happening.\n\nI am an African American professional who wanted to take my nephew on his first Monona-lake bike ride.

I came prepared, bringing an extra cabinet door I had lying around as well as several photos of the crown molding to aid in identification of model numbers. Julie was the consultant who helped me. We examined the pictures and cabinet door at length, cross-referencing them against the Merillat parts catalog, until we both agreed that we had a positive match. I should mention that Julie took notes furiously throughout the process, carefully noting the product number for each item (or so I thought). Since a phone call to Merillat HQ was required to price out the order and the don't do business on weekends, she promised a follow-up call on Monday with final price information.\n\nI got said call on Monday with final pricing. All that was left was for me to sign a contract (Julie's language, not mine) and put 50% down. I looked over the contract and verified that it contained line items for crown molding, a tall kitchen cabinet, and a spare cabinet door. I then signed and returned with a 50% down payment.\n\nTwo weeks later, as promised, I got a call that my order was ready for pickup. Upon unboxing the crown molding, I was shocked to see something that looked nothing like the molding Julie and I identified together. I immediately called Marling. Julie was apologetic but quite firm in that Marling doesn't take responsibility for ordering errors, no matter who makes them. After all, she said matter of factly, I did \"sign the contract.\" Legally speaking, she's right of course.Ethically speaking, her logic is ridiculous.

Let's get the bad stuff out of the way first.  \n\n- It's pricey.  I recently bought 2 sea scallops, a pound of Halibut, and a 6-oz Tuna fillet.  Price: $50.86.  Ouch.\n\n- Limited selection of \"staple-goods.\"  Sure, I can get fresh Alaskan King Crab or a locally-made vegan cookie from the bakery at a moment's notice, but I dare you to find a box of Blueberry Special K on a Sunday night... I think they stock 4 or 5 of those, and when they're gone, they're gone (they're also about $1 higher than Woodman's).\n\n- It's inconvenient to get in and out of.  University Avenue S-U-C-K-S sucks.  And, if you wish to head west from Metcalfe's, you have to turn onto Midvale, make a U-turn, and then sit at the Midvale/University light and wait... The parking lot is also a cluster-F.\n\n- The checkers can be a bit snooty.  That, or I get the same girl every time... it really does seem as though I'm bothering the heck out of her by giving her a handful of items to scan, waiting on a total, and then giving her money.  I usually encounter a \"why-are-you-bothering-me-with-this\" sigh or a roll of the eyes at some point during checkout.  \n\n- The clientele can be a bit snobby (especially the ones that hop out of their leased BMWs).  Yeah, so you think you're cool in your BMW, but we both know that you're living in a rundown apartment, using one credit card to pay the other, and you're maybe 2-weeks from having the Bimmer repo'd.  Get over yourself... and flip your collar down and straighten that hat - you look ridiculous, fratty.  Ok?\n\n\nAnd now for the good stuff.\n\n+ The service workers (Deli, bakery, etc) are fantastic.  Very knowledgeable and helpful.  Makes it seem a little less painful when you're paying $28.99/lb for fish or buying a $4 cupcake.\n\n+ Fruits and Veggies are usually top notch quality.\n\n+ They place an emphasis on locally sourced products.\n\nSo there you have it.  As others have mentioned, there are many better alternatives for regular day-to-day items: Woodman's, for one.

They have a decent-size showroom, plus several large catalogs that show hundreds of additional items. You can (I assume) buy the items in the showroom, but I would guess that most customers are using the showroom and catalogs to get ideas, and then ordering the item they want. Everything is made to order, so you can choose from a large variety of woods and finishes, including both stain and paint. They are also able to modify pieces (e.g., adjust dimensions, add or remove features) or help you with a completely custom-designed piece. The main downside to the built-to-order approach is the time -- it takes around 8-10 weeks to get your furniture, so plan with that in mind. (Don's does not make the furniture themselves; they are a middleman for several Amish shops elsewhere in the Midwest.) \n\nThe salespeople are friendly and low-pressure (I believe they're not on commission, which likely helps). \n\nPrice-wise, I was pleasantly surprised. Obviously, it's not cheap, and if you order all-custom mahogany furniture, you'll pay and arm and a leg. But for standard pieces, the prices are similar to the wood furniture items from Pottery Barn. Perhaps a bit higher. The difference, of course, is that Pottery Barn is often not solid wood (lots of wood products and veneers), is manufactured and shipped from overseas. You'll get far better quality for your money here than at Pottery Barn, West Elm, etc. This stuff is going to last decades. Plus, if you want to add a piece later, they'll always be able to make something in the same wood and finish to match what you already have.\n\nOne reason I didn't give this store 5 stars is that the pricing is not transparent. Largely this is because the cost depends on what wood/finish you choose. However, there's a lot they could do in terms of posting information -- for example, lists of the lowest, middle, and highest-priced woods, that could help customers make a decision. As it is now, for each an every item that you're interested in, you need to ask the salesperson to draw up a specific quote, even if it's a standard catalog item without modifications. And since the catalogs don't list prices either... well, it just makes the shopping process somewhat difficult, especially in the early stages when you're trying to narrow down what you are interested in.\n\nThe other aspect I wasn't crazy about is that the styling of furniture skews pretty traditional/country, and in some cases, dated. They definitely have some gorgeous contemporary pieces, as well as some great mid-centry modern-esque items, but for the most part, they seem to be catering to Baby Boomer generation style. Us younger customers would find a lot to love if they could offer a larger selection of updated pieces (e.g., Room and Board).", "business_id": "W0kwwRhto5fw8tURZ0cYBg", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-06-02", "type": "review"}

Their information on many vehicles has to be based on product fitment catalogs, the same catalogs that you as a consumer have access to online.  Inform yourself and don't expect a kayak/canoe store salesperson to know all the in's and out's of your particular vehicle and how it works with a bike rack.  How's the Thule fit my 79 ?

I purchased a boat, paddle, PFD, and a rack system.  I was personally helped by various individuals to help me decide on all of these items.  I was helped to install my rack for the first time and shown how to safely tie off my kayak.\n\nThese folks WANT you to come back and thier service shows that.  If it floats?

Packed to the gills with so many pipes and pipe-blends that you'll need their expertise to know where to start. Oh, and humidors line the walls and cabinets; so, there's no want for cigars either.\n\nThese guys supplied my first excellent cigars (Avo Maduros), and when asked, they politely explained and helped with my first pipe and pipe-blend(s).  I haven't been steered wrong by the staff yet.  There's a reason people come over here and hang out- the staff are hilarious.  Excellent discussions ensue over many a bowl of excellent tobacco.  Friends frequently bring items to share with others as well.\n\nI didn't realize what a gem this place was until I traveled more and dropped in on other pipe-shops around the country.  These fellows go above and beyond.  They even have popular Dunhill and Esoterica blends in bulk and sell in ounces as desired.  If they have something open, they'll give you a bowl-full to try out in the shop.  [Penzance, Margate, And So To Bed (tried all these in ounces first).]\n\nThere's a reason Former (Hans) Neilsen drops by the shop first when he enters the country.  He always brings his best pipes and they sell them at excellent prices.\n\nWhile I love Iwanries in Chicago, this place has more of a small-town feel to it, characters included, and is a place not to be missed if you're dropping in for a while.  Grab a stogie or a great pipe blend from them on your way to Papa Dell's and enjoy it after a great pizza at a local outdoor beer-garden.  [sorry folks, we are plagued with anti-smoking laws here as well]\n\nTip for the beginning pipe-smoker- \"estate pipes\" at Jon's are cleaned carefully before sale and are at least half the original selling price.  Older pipes have greater value often due to better briar wood available at the time.  Antiques can be found in the estate drawers.  Not all of them are low-priced!  Some Radice Double-Bores are available etc.- so don't go thinking the estates are worse.  Jon's has a fantastic selection of estate pipes and also allow lay-away on pipes you love but can't afford all at once.\n\nBe sure to say Hi to Pat.  He's fantastic.  Stopped me at a local bar a while back and introduced himself to my girlfriend as \"Allen's Tobacconist.\"  [I have a tobacconist! LOL]  Pat's a gem.  Every once in a while another staff member expresses an opinion that I don't agree with, but I still love these guys- I figure I'm dealing with real fellows here and take the every so slight bad opinion with the excellent.\n\n[One of the staff is Deputy Mayor of Champaign, and another is a retired State Police Investigator- so you know they have some stories to tell.]  Sorry, I could go on and on here- better stop now!  :D", "business_id": "Y6jWHVbcWULr00HHYLCRyQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-07-16", "type": "review"}

I had also asked for the price for the lenses (They have hi-index lenses from 1.60, 1.67, and 1.74). I am a bit surprised because I had already called other Eye Care in Urbana but it seems that none of them has the 1.74 hi-index, the thinnest lenses out there.\n\nI went to Illini Eye Care on Tuesday, July 22 2014, met with Christina Peet, the Optician. She is very knowledgeable and willing to help me out. She put down a note on different hi-index lenses and pointed out how much each costs to me, and how they would be able to handle my frame (I am making lenses with Google Glass prescription frame, few Eye Care knows about this in the Champaign-Urbana area).

BROWNE'S FINE JEWELRY WILL MAKE YOUR DIAMOND BUYING EXPERIENCE A POSITIVE ONE!  HERE IS WHY I THINK THAT:\n\nAlthough I now live in Chicago (I used to live in Champaign), a friend of mine recommended I check out Browne's Fine Jewelry.  I am so grateful for that tip as Browne's was the best customer service experience I had out of the 12+ jewelers I went to looking for an engagement ring.  \n\nRight away upon entering Browne's I was greeted by one Browne's sales staff, Andrea Laird.  Her sales style was HELPFUL AND FRIENDLY VS the cocky and aggressive style of most other jeweler's sales staff. \n\nAndrea addressed all of my questions (I had ALOT of them) on the 4 Cs of diamonds, post purchase benefits, ring settings, trade in value of diamonds I had from other places, financing options, etc in a very INFORMATIVE and BELIEVABLE way.  At OTHER JEWELERS I had visited, their sales staff would talk down to me when I asked these type of questions or give me answers that did not seem believeable.\n\nBrowne's great customer service extended to email inquiries which were ALWAYS answered in less than 24 hours.  While shopping at Browne's, I noticed how many customers  knew the entire sales staff by name and appeared VERY HAPPY with their diamond purchases! \n\nI was very IMPRESSED with Browne's diamond selection as it rivaled the Chicago jewelry stores I had visited.  The sparkle factor on their diamonds I looked at was high quality!   As a guy, if you are looking to impress your significant other with a diamond that she can proudly show off to her friends, BROWNE'S IS THE PLACE TO GO!  Their competitive prices and financing options make Browne's diamonds VERY AFFORDABLE for the HIGH QUALITY you are receiving.  \n\nAs mentioned before, each and every one of Browne's sales staff was very helpful with customers coming in the door.  This type of service was UNIQUE to Browne's vs other jewelers I had visited.  Since I worked with Andrea the most, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND ANDREA for anyone looking for a knowledgeable, friendly, and thorough salesperson!  \n\nBIG CITY DIAMOND QUALITY AND SELECTION WITH GREAT LOCAL FAMILY OWNED SERVICE!", "business_id": "XfqqfNrnZgEE-78OMuCqsg", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-07-16", "type": "review"}

In that short, frantic time, we kept thinking, \"Hmm. We should get rings.\" We shopped a bit here and there, looking at places like amazon.com, Kohl's, Macy's, etc, trying to find something simple. I love not spending money on jewelry, but both of us like shopping locally. So we ended up going to Browne's the Tuesday before the Sunday wedding. \nLisa at Browne's helped us choose rings, find the right sizes, etc. She told us she'd have them in by Friday.\n\nFriday comes. My ring is in, but his isn't. So instead of leaving us out to dry, as rightfully they should've done, since we were SO last minute on the whole thing, Lisa stepped up to the plate. She called the company for us, and they overnighted a similar ring in my boyfriend's (husband's!) size for us to use at the ceremony on Sunday. Which we did, and it was beautiful. Monday, she called us as promised as soon as his actual ring was in. We swapped the overnighted ring for his actual ring, and it's perfect.\n\nWe're exceptionally pleased with both rings. The prices were good, considering the current market for gold. I am so, so grateful to Browne's, Lisa especially, for their outstanding customer service and problem solving skillz.

Let's be honest - most days it looks like an overgrown apple growing from my body. Apparently, there are frame shapes meant for fat faces (i.e., rectangular). I spent a good 15 minutes looking at all of the glasses and, of course, did not get a rectangular frame -- primarily because in that entire 15 minutes, not one of the ten employees in the room offered assistance or guidance or anything. I was then told to \"have a seat\" on an ungodly uncomfortable backless bench to be fitted by a worker. This wait was 30 minutes - and there was only 1 person in front of me. Not a happy girl here. The chick worker (very nice) was not clear about their offers, prices, lens benefits, or frame choices/differences. In fact, I felt like I was forcing her to give secret information when I asked about scratch resistance, UV ray blockage, and price, etc.\n\nIf you know what you're looking for and you memorize their website, this would be a fine store to shop, but you will not find a decent frame for under $170, and the 4 lenses on the website are apparently not available with all frames, because I only had 2 choices ($120 featherwates or $180 featherwates plus). Employees are not helpful, but there is a receipt book that they give you at the end of the purchase that tells you about  frame choices (i.e., after you buy your non-rectangular frames for your fat face, they tell you not to do that).

Asking me to pay $40 more and getting angry when I ask if he'll meet me in the middle on price is not a good way to do that.\n\nNot only did I not buy that hookah there (bought it online, saved money, and am very happy), but I will not patronize that store any more.

I have never ever ever ever ever ever gone in and seen more than 2 cashiers working. Why do they even have 10 checkout lines if they're only going to use ONE most of the time? This is one of the only groceries downtown so I don't understand why they would close early(...10pm I think), and have one lonely cashier working during BUSY times. I once came here in the evening around 9 and stood in line for 40 minutes to pay for the one or two things I had bought. I couldn't believe it.

I will drive 15-20 miles to my nearest Sprouts or the Fancy Fry's in Scottsdale before I ever drive 1 mile to get to Safeway.\nIt's that bad.\nNot only is the parking lot notoriously sketchy with inconsiderate drivers abounding, but there are numerous problems inside the store, as well:\n1) You walk in to a rather dimly-lighted store, usually with a sour-faced security guard blocking your access to the carts.\n2) What carts you ask? That's a good question. Several times I have had to grab a handbasket because there were no carts in stock, even though I had a long grocery list to fulfill. I actually saw the cartboys leaning against the cartrails, laughing and having a heck of a time. Look, I get it, it's hot outside and you don't want to get get the carts, but C'MON!\n3) The first thing you see upon walking in may or may not be a ghetto display of moldy-looking fruit, or on  the 4th of July, a teenage employee roasting hot dogs on a bunsen burner with open containers of ketchup and mustard on a rickety table.\n4) Venture into the produce section, and you will meander through very difficult twists and turns that your cart may not even fit through. Please, managers, make sure that the spaces between fruit stands are at least cart-width!!!\n5) The line for the pharmacy extends into the produce area. Enough said.\n6) Expect for the aisles to have large space-blocking cardboard displays and/or fallen down merchandise and/or an employee restocking items right in the middle of the day. I would say half of the aisles are blocked at any given time.\n7) Once you have completed your hazardous journey of finding everything on your list, you must enter one of the two checkout lines, which are so long that they become another force blocking the aisleways. Two checkout lines, you say? Yes, only two, despite there being 5 or 6 total checkout lanes. If you are a young lady with any shred of fashion or hygiene, expect to be \"checked out\" by creepy older men whilst standing innocently in line.\n8) Your cashier will either be a surly teenage boy or a pregnant teenage girl who does a poor job managing the line and barely gives you the time of day and/or forgets to give you the receipt when you are done. But you are so eager to get out of there, you simply don't care to go back and ask for it.\n\nOh, and there may or may not be trash on the floor.\nIf Safeway as a nationwide brand prides themselves on safety or service, they need to get their corporate people in here to take a look at this store, and either condemn it or fire everyone who works here.\nIt's even more pitiful because they are the closest store to everyone who lives downtown, so they could easily be the most popular.\nPlease, downtown, replace this disgraceful store with a Whole Foods or a Sprouts or a place with a shred of human decency.", "business_id": "7Z7IkR_-94AjUuDw0fbI7g", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-07-09", "type": "review"}

And Eternal 42.\n\nMaybe Joy Electric. But I can't be so sure. Once I learned about the \"red cup rule\" (booze can be brought in as long as it's in a plastic red cup), all of my experiences at Modified became one long haze of noise and staring intently at paintings and going \"I see...yes...very interesting.\"\n\nThe Modified was like the \"seedy bar/club\" cliche in every movie you ever saw. You couldn't get within ten feet of the building without being pwned in the face with the scent of B.O. and pot. There are homeless people on the patio, lushes on the sidewalk, and a very disinterested door guy who doesn't even look up from his book to stamp your hand with some socio-political metaphor.\n\nAmidst all the decay and broken glass there was (and still is, why the fuck do I keep switching tenses?) something really special. \n\nThe bands that came (come) aren't always the biggest and most well known. Because if they were, they'd be playing the Marquee.\n\nBut the shows are always worth watching. Even if the bands suck (and trust me, a lot of them do), the energy exchange between them and the crowd is intense. \n\nI've seen people go entire shows clapping in rhythm with the songs. I've seen people cry. I've even people engage in group hugs and collapse to the ground.\n\n...indie kids.\n\nUnlike other venues, people came to the Modified to be seen (or it is scene? Get it? Fuck you).\n\nYou never learned their names, but you could spot them in a crowd. Girl with Crazy Hair. Boy Who Wore A Little Too Much Makeup For It To Be \"Ironic\". Girl That Always Smelled Really Good. Guy Who Always Wanted To Help The Band Move Their Gear.\n\nI often wonder what my \"scenester\" nickname would be...\n\nYes, it's dirty. Yes it's cramped. And yes, if you try to pee near the dumpster the guy who owns the restaurant next door will yell at you in Chinese.\n\nBut after all of Phoenix is gentrified into submission, and all the art galleries and performance venues are bulldozed over to make way for more strip malls and high-end shopping outlets (with the occasional Starbucks dotted in to \"give it culture\"), we will have wished we had visited it more often.\n\nOh well. Maybe the Phoenix Art Museum will put in a performance venue.\n\n\"Hello Phoenix! I want to hear all of you singing along on this one! Even you, guy pretending to make sense of that Monet. Alright, let's go!\"", "business_id": "YRJKTPc7Tkz1cbjGHmOHuw", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-06-30", "type": "review"}

A lot of the bands that play here would sell somewhat larger venues in other cities, but that gives you the chance to get a little more intimate with some fav artists here in Phx.\n\nModified could use to knock out the center wall and put the bathroom in one of those \"Private\" rooms, but the funkiness of the space doesn't deter from the shows.

I had been warned by a friend that it was not worth going for lunch, as the food wasn't very good, but I was craving a hamburger and in the area, so to MacAlpine's I went.\nOnce I figured out which door granted entrance to the diner (seriously, it took three tries),  I was greeted by some awfully pretty and very in-character waitresses. They were all dolled up, '50s style and had that sweetie-pie personality down pat. I admitted I wasn't too familiar with places that offer so many soda options and asked for a recommendation. The server gladly offered her favorites, and I went with her suggestion, a cherry cheesecake soda. It was fantastic.\nI looked over the menu and was immediately disappointed, why is a turkey burger featured above the all-American diner staple, the cheeseburger?! And no fries? I briefly considered the chili dog but that too was made with turkey ... what kind of throw back retro diner was this?? Damn. I got the cheeseburger and potato chips, which came out pretty quick and the burger was hot as all get out, fresh off the skillet ... definitely not a grill and that was just about the worst patty I've paid for in my life. Dry, flavorless, terrible. Well, I had been warned and can't exactly complain.\nSeeing as I'm not a soda drinker and wasn't a fan of the food, I won't be back.

Two of the front windows were broken, and at first glance all that was visible were the two thrift stores that bookend the \"restaurant\".  \n\nThe eating section looked quaint at first: clearly the original counter with lots of interesting items wreathed around it.  But upon closer look, the counter was in disrepair, trim had fallen off in places, and shelves were missing, requiring supplies and table settings to not only be displayed, but piled in a jumble on the surviving shelves in full view of customers.  Worse, the jukebox was broken which we only found out after we already wasted 2 bits.\n\nService:  terrible.  The wait staff was young and in need of training.   Our waiter didn't write down our order and had to ask 3 questions because he forgot.  Then two mistakes still were made with the order including an incorrect entree served.  There was a large table behind us our waiter also was serving and I overheard that a child's order was completely forgotten.  Dude, just write it down!  You're not ready for a big boy server gig, it's okay.\n\nFood:  deplorable.   Other reviews correctly assess the embarrassing \"hamburgers\", but the fountain drinks (we had the root beer float and Breakfast at Tiffany's ) were weak sauce (literally).  I had the Ruben with potato salad which was decent, but I was pretty hungry and would have eaten anything.  I would have preferred fries but they weren't in the menu, no deep fryer either ?\n\nOverall the ambience was that of a David lynch movie spliced with \"The Road\".  Clearly the brainchild of a spinster with dementia, this place may have seemed quaint in some rim town 20 years ago ,  but on Central Ave in PHX in 2014?  Bizarre.

My husband and I are both into oldies music, so naturally we had to check it out! Initially the place caused confusion, as there were several entrances in a row, but we figured out we had to enter through an antique store. We loved all of the old stuff on display in the diner. The waitress was friendly and dressed for the era, albeit not in a poodle skirt. We asked for time to peruse the menu, as there were a mind-boggling amount of shake flavors to choose from. I opted to mix two flavors for my shake: passionfruit and black cherry, which turned out to be a scrumptious blend. My husband got coffee, but it tasted so weak that he swapped it out for blackberry. We were told it was weak because it had just been made with coffee ice cream rather than using their coffee syrup. Why? We don't know. The music wasn't 100% consistent with the theme. Part of the time it was oldies, and the other part was 80s. For our lunch, we both ordered the same thing-pastrami on rye with potato salad. The reviewers are spot-on about the potato salad, it's quite good. The sandwich was pretty good as well. After eating, we browsed the antique shop on the other side. I found it strange that the restaurant is sandwiched between two of them. Another odd thing is they were selling some clothes and old family photos along with the antiques. I didn't really get why people would want to buy photos of somebody else's family, but oh well.

Do not hesitate, just go to them!!\n\nMy Apple iPhone4's battery has been on its last legs the past few months (the fact that Apple cannot put a battery in their $400 phones that can last more than a year is another debate for another review). Fortunately, a friend gave me an unused spare, so I was prepared to just do the work myself.  I had the proper tools but when it came to removing the battery to replace it with a new one, I was stymied trying to remove the one stupid 2.5 mm screw that kept the battery connection in place.\n\nConcerned that I might \"strip\" the screw completely if I tried to keep muscle-ing it, I sought expert help to see how much it would cost just to take the stupid screw out for me. That's it. Nothing more. I'll take it from there.  As a self-employed professional myself, I don't expect anyone to work or put in their time for free and I was prepared to pay a reasonable amount for whoever did the work's time and trouble.  I did a Google search and came up with three establishments in my immediate area.  The first one did not answer the phone(in fairness, it was lunch time), and the third one, rather dismissively, came up with some lamea*s excuse about the screw being stripped and maybe needing a new connector and said, I quote:  \"I can't help you, man\".  I won't mention this establishment by name, but suffice to say they are located at the NE corner of 7th St. and Union Hills and their number is 480-559-9694.  My 2nd call was to Sun Cellular and the phone was answered by a young fellow named Issac.  I explained my problem to him and what I needed done and, after listening and confirming all I needed was the screw taken out, he invited me to come on down.\n\nAbout an hour later, when I came in to their shop off Bell Rd., a young man behind the counter was the first to greet me.  Turns out it was Issac.  I re-introduced myself and my problem and he kindly took my phone in back to take a look.  I had barely had the chance to sit down in their comfortable waiting area when he popped out of the back smiling, holding the tiny screw in one hand and my iPhone and back cover (I had pre-removed the pentalobe screws so as to take up less of his time) in the other.  Hallelujah!   I then asked if I could pay some sort of \"diagnostic\" or other j*rkoff fee for their labor and trouble, but Issac said that it was no big deal.  I asked him if he was sure, as I had no problem paying something for their assistance, and Issac kindly declined again.  In fact, a slightly older fellow who was also behind the counter (who, I'm guessing, may be the owner/proprietor) chimed in with, \"Anyone who would charge you for that should be shot...\"  Wow.\n\nIn this day and age, it is so rare to find such friendly and service-oriented professionals--particularly when it comes to repair of consumer electronics.  The reviews you read on this Yelp listing are clearly no joke.  These guys are the real deal, and iPhone repair shops throughout the Valley (including the last crew that fixed my phone) could learn a lot from them.  I can't speak to their experience with any other brands, but in terms of plain honesty, customer service, and sheer professionalism, you owe it to yourself and your smartphone to visit Sun Cellular.

And it can be fairly easy to run in and grab just one or two items, which is what I almost always do.\n\nThe member gas station has been our favourite aspect and the main reason we got a membership.

What the heck are you doing to the bananas???  I mean, I know the sign says, \"Control Ripening Technology\" but this so-called \"technology\" is making your bags of bananas turn into bags of banana mush.\n\nBasically, I buy the bananas. I leave them in the bag. The bag assures me that moisture in the bag is good for my bananas.  But, THE BAG IS WRONG.  My bananas get soggy. The peel falls off. The banana turns brown.  \n\nIf I try to eat the bananas immediately, when I break one off, it breaks away the peel from the other bananas because the moisture has made the skin weak and useless. So now I have a bunch of partly unpeeled bananas.  It is madness.  \n\nI will cut you slack because they are insanely cheap and you give me free samples of tuna fish on fancy crackers, but Costco, it is time to reject that stupid technology and put the holes back in the bag. Or, just stop selling bananas because as of right now you are reeking havoc on our local garbage men who are forced to deal with garbage cans full of bananas mush.  I know, in the realm of trash, banana mush is seemingly innocent, but that stuff LEAKS.  Then you step in it and your shoe becomes squeaky. The mush leaks onto other bags  and then you have banana mush laden trash that attracts fruit flies.  Nothing annoys me more than fruit flies. (And, apparently I speak for all trash men.)

Despondent over the fashion things that will be affected by this un-planned cost I inquire on tire pricing.\n\nMari did not laugh at me. \nNo, I don't know the kind of tires on my car.\nNo, I don't really know the year of my car.\nNo, I don't know if my Ford Escape is an xlt.

Mari did laugh, but *with* me.\nYes, I am a fool as to all things car.\n\nApproximately two hours later Mari rang me and I headed back. First Mari, then Rene, explained the steps taken to test my tire. In English. Not a damn thing wrong with it. Highly probable a rapscallion LET THE AIR OUT on purpose. (Thanks to whomever for that.) Just in case, Rene replaced the air valve stem.\n\nTen minutes later my tire is plopped back onto my car. My car has been vacuumed (!) and I was free to go.\n\nHere's the crazy thing:\nCostCo didn't charge me a penny. I sucked up their time and energy. My Dad had sent me there saying \"they're good\".

The next weekend I decided to take the bike out to some flat dirt and ride for a few miles. About a mile in both tires went flat, as a matter of fact, the front tire \"stem\" completely tore off the tube, leaving me stranded to walk a few miles back to my car.. Gave me time to calm my nerves.\nThe third time I decided to go for a real ride was last weekend in Sedona. I picked a nice basic trail, loaded up on breakfast and rolled out to have some fun. About 40 minutes in to my cruise, I noticed the bike wasn't shifting well. I decided to hop off the bike and visually inspect some things (don't know much about bikes) to see if I could find something wrong, nope! So I kept riding, stuck to switching gears as little as possible, sticking on the flat terrain when I go to switch down a gear to make it easier to pedal and POP! SNAP! BANG BANG BANG BANG!\nI look down, and to my dismay, I see pieces of metal completely sheered off the bike frame (derailleur hanger) with the derailleur stuck in the spokes of the bike, marred up significantly. Thinking to myself now... Well shit, now I'm stuck in the desert, 4 miles in on this trail, now I have to carry my bike back. In order to roll my bike back I had to remove the back tire and sort of drape the chain around my pedal. When I finally got back to the car, to my dismay realized the chain had married up the crank so badly it was more silver than it was it's nice original black color.\nNow I'm back in Phx, drive done, called the bike shop (Slippery Pig), they informed me to bring the bike in. The distance from my work to home to the bike shop is significant, and after stewing over the fact I just dropped almost $800.00 on a bike that ultimately failed on me, I was not inclined to return quickly, therefor I contacted Cannondale.\nCannondale referred me to another bike shop (Biker's Edge) in Peoria, much closer to home, that was and still is a licensed Cannondale repair shop. After chatting with them over the phone, very nice people by the way, I brought my bike down for a full inspection. According to the technicians at Biker's Edge, the bike was not shifting correctly because it had not been adjusted properly, an adjustment that should've been made before I was sold the bike at Slippery Pig. They continued on with saying that things like this \"just don't happen\", and that \"they happen so infrequently for basic riders there is no need to carry spare derailleurs\" because \"they just don't break\".\nAt this point, I am disheartened and filled with anger towards Slippery Pig for selling me a bike that was adjusted incorrectly from the beginning leading to an incredible amount of damage (haven't seen my bike in two weeks), and had two faulty tires that blew out the first time I road (front tire was on backwards according to tire tread writing). Needless to say, Biker's Edge got the hanger replaced when they noticed some additional parts that make up the actual derailleur were loose. The parts total was about $45.00 plus $15.00 to put them on plus another $30.00 to work on the chain and cover the exorbitant amount of scratches with magic marker(not kidding), total costs ending up at $90.00. Before I moved forward with the additional repairs aside from the hanger, I decided to contact Slippery Pig to see if they could do anything for me. According to the staff at the Slippery Pig, they will cover the $20 additional part that needs replaced if I pay $10 for labor, that's all, and a sorry (which doesn't really help).\nTakeaway from this:\nI would not recommend purchasing a used bike from the Slippery Pig bike shop, nor rely on their maintenance/shop services on your personal bike. Based on my own personal experience, I have found their services to be VERY poor (except for a very nice gentlemen that went out of his way that tried to get me assistance, his name was Troy).\n\nHowever, Biker's Edge in Peoria, AZ is an incredible, Cannondale certified bike shop run by a staff of 3 people, all whom are extremely knowledge, communicate effectively, establish and resolve issues deadlines efficiently, and most importantly, they devote their attention all on you when you call for help, it's a bike shop that truly cares and isn't just worried about making sales.\n\nOut the door, $130.00 for repairs. Needed a derailleur hanger, new derailleur pulleys, brakes readjusted (overfilled) and a brand new chain because the chain was a link too short causing shift issues.", "business_id": "42Ai9wcFPE2HZ_aADGXI9Q", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-08-20", "type": "review"}

In the case of Fry's, they typically ignore you when you come to the window, take 40-minutes to fill any prescription - even something that's in a box and all they have to do is pull it off the shelf.

As it so happened, that pharmacist was in the midst of filling the prescription and they had the medication to me in less than 5-minutes.\n\nDespite the fact that Fry's is just around the corner, I may be transferring the family prescriptions to Walgreen's.

If you are (were) like me and had no idea how it works or if it's legit, here you go:\n\nAbout once a year I find myself in need of minor medical attention and without a primary care physician. I usually skirt the issue by having plenty of family in the medical profession that can call me in a prescription for whatever ailment I have self-diagnosed (ear infection, sinus infection, worse than usual allergies, etc.) \n\nIt's not that I wouldn't love a primary care physician to call my own - he would be old, gentle and white haired (not hasty, distracted, a bad listener or curt, like most doctors). But I am a generally healthy procrastinator, so when I had a cold that I suspected was turning into a sinus infection, I couldn't wait three weeks to six months for an opening at an office -- that is, of course, if they're accepting new patients at all. \n\nSo this Walgreens business - though strange, I admit - appealed to my urgency. It's an urgent care, basically, with a nurse practitioner on staff at more reasonable hours than a doctor's office, slightly less convenient hours than an ER or UC. It seems like a good bet when you pretty much already know what's wrong and you just need the appropriate signature to get the drugs you need to get better faster.\nI called to make sure they took my insurance and was told the copayment would be the same as a specialist. The deal is you walk in - no appointments, ever - and sign yourself in at the kiosk. Basic info only: name, number, zip, and check from list of typical maladies and then it gives you a wait time. In my case - 1 hour, 20 minutes. So at this point I'm at the same wait and cost as Urgent Care. Bummer.\nLuckily I work just across the street, so go back to the office for an hour and come back. Of course, my name was called while I was gone. So I re-enter at the kiosk (frustrating that there is no actual person to address concerns) and am given no wait time this go round. So I just sit and wait. About 10 minutes later the nurse emerges and bc there was no one ahead of me this time, I'm taken to a back room where we go thru the rigmarole that front desk admin usually takes care of before hand, so that took another 10 minutes.\nWe finally get to the medical assessment, which was taking my temp., checking my lungs and heartbeat and looking in my ears, nose and throat. That took about three minutes and my self diagnosis was confirmed. She entered my prescriptions into the computer which is automatically sent right out to the pharmacy outside and I'm done. Oh, turns out my copay was less than I was told, which was nice. (If you don't have insurance it's like $70 - yowza!)\n\nAll in all, it was convenient in a pinch and got my drugs same day.

They are conveniently open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week with a 2 lane drive-thru pharmacy. I primarily come to this Walgreens to pick up my prescription and my experience is always hit-or-miss. The pharmacy can be EXTREMELY SLOWWWW. Especially if you come here at night since they are located near the hospitals so there is usually a small line of people filling prescriptions. \nI had one experience probably 6 months ago where I decided to go inside the store one night so I could pick up a soda or something with my prescription. There were maybe 3 or 4 people in line in front of me. I waited in line for over half an hour. During this time, any car that went through the drive thru was being served more promptly than the people standing there in line. When I finally got to the counter, the staff member was very apologetic that I had to wait so long, although I know it was not her fault, they were just severely understaffed. \nI do have to say though, that in recent months, they have been more efficient with their operations whenever I have come through here.", "business_id": "HfWkdqxegjiGEXzI8j7Wwg", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-07-29", "type": "review"}

I'll try to be as detailed as possible, as this review may be used in court one day. First, let me say I have a chronic condition and I am a polite and easy-to-get-along-with \"regular\" of this pharmacy. I've never had an issue before tonight. Efran, who I normally deal with in the pharmacy, is a great guy- super friendly and always smiling. Monica, the manager, was very responsive and polite when I called her tonight. Hopefully, she will resolve the pharmacist's problem.\n\nHowever:\n\nI badly injured my finger and it became infected. It is swollen to triple size and a doctor had to slice it open today to drain the puss. The doctor used zero anesthetic, but he had good reason. That's another story.\n\nSo he gave me a prescription for 15 Vicodin and 20 antibiotics. I wasn't picking up 200 Oxycontin tablets or doing anything weird. It was a small amount of pain pills and antibiotics to match. My injury was also very visible on my right hand.\n\nI was asked for ID, which is understandable, because I was picking up a regulated narcotic. I get that.\n\nSo I hand the pharmacist a government issued photo ID. The government ID had a matching address to my prescription. In addition to that, I had an ASU student ID, a credit card (that I was paying for the prescriptions with), and my insurance card ...and I also had a visible injury. A visibly infected injury on my hand, and I was picking up the exact prescription that would match the physical evidence.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that it was crystal clear that I was who I claimed to be.\n\nHowever, the photo ID that I showed was unique. Only certain people get to carry it. I am not saying my ID was a green card (and I'm not saying it wasn't), but a green card would be an example of a government photo ID that is not commonly shown.\n\nBut if you are visiting from a foreign country, for example, and you are here legally, you should be able to get prescriptions that you need. I know that Arizonans aren't fond of illegal aliens, but people that are here legally should be able to get medication if they are sick.\n\nNot at this Walgreens. The pharmacist declared, in front of witnesses, that they won't serve everyone. If you are visiting this country, go elsewhere. The pharmacist at this Walgreens will not help you.\n\nUpon inspecting my government issued, legal photo ID (that the bank accepts by the way), the pharmacist said, \"I'll take it this time, but next time, you'll need an ID from the DMV.\"\n\nFrom the DMV! Can you believe it? She actually said \"from the DMV.\" \n\nI said: \"That's a legal government-issued photo ID. You can't deny me.\"\n\nShe then arrogantly proclaimed: \"I am the pharmacist and that is our policy! We need an ID from the DMV!\"\n\nI protested, because, since I don't drive, just going to the DMV is a tremendous pain in the butt. And what law says that you need DMV ID? Who says that you are required to visit the DMV ever? As far as I know, you just need to be able to prove that you are here legally. My ID proved I was here legally. And again, it was government issued photo ID.\n\nUpon me protesting, she snatched my prescriptions from the cashier (all on videotape) and said, \"Then I won't give them to you if you want to argue!\"\n\nOkay, so this girl has a power-struggle issue. I get it. \n\nI'm in agony, and I know when I am dealing with a nut-job, so I satisfied her narcissism and agreed that yes, she was the pharmacist and no, my ID wasn't good enough. And she handed me my prescriptions. Thank God. You see, it was never about the ID. Otherwise, I wouldn't have my Vicodin right now. It was about exerting control over a customer. A regular customer that has spent over a thousand dollars in that store, in 2012.\n\nShe actually held pain medication over my head, until I agreed to her illegal, discriminatory policy.\n\nSo, in a state of duress, desperate, I relented. I said, \"Okay. I agree.\" (clenching my teeth in agony)\n\nAs I was walking out, I turned to her and said, \"I am now going to write a review online.\"\n\nShe replied: \"Good! Go ahead. And now we will never serve you again.\" She went over to the computer and publicly announced that she will make a note on my account and that I can't get prescriptions from there anymore. Again, humiliating me in public.\n\nAnd what did I do? Absolutely nothing. I did nothing wrong. I never even swore or called her a bad name. All on videotape.\n\nI am contacting an attorney first thing Monday morning. Good luck Walgreens.", "business_id": "HfWkdqxegjiGEXzI8j7Wwg", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-06-29", "type": "review"}

And if I were reviewing just the store I would say it was fantastic.\nBut my experience focused primarily on the take care clinic and it's inefficiency. I was needing a physical for employment and despite having to pay out of pocket, I thought this would be far more convenient than going to a primary care doctor. \nI checked in and waited about a half hour (which wasn't very long). I was than greeted by someone (I have no idea if he was a doctor, a nurse or the receptionist). This person never introduced himself, walked me into a room with someone else's stuff. He was a young guy in his 20s with clearly very little professional experience. When I told him I wanted a physical, he let out a big sigh as if I was causing him an inconvenience. He asked me why I hasn't filled out paperwork (which were nowhere to be seen) and grabbed the papers I had brought (for the physical). He stared at the papers and  looked at them as if they were written in a foreign language. He let out another sigh. It was at this point that he wanted to start the exam, but it was also at this point that I decided I wasn't comfortable with this person ( who was frazzled, unprofessional and still hadn't introduced himself to me).

You can still get bargains in the beauty section, but otherwise you will be paying through the nose for convenience (plus the privilege of being treated rudely).\n\nQuality has also generally declined. The house brand cat litter, which used to be great, is now as useless as beach sand and exists solely so you remember how the box stank all week and pay double the going rate for Tidy Cat. The $15 rayon dresses -- wonderful for summer around the house -- are now so skimpy that I can barely get my arms through the arm holes (they used to err the other direction). \n\nAs the place has declined, the clientele has gotten sketchier, too.

Now that same-store sales are in the low single digits, if not actually negative, and chains are struggling to hold stable against the behemoth of Amazon, the prevailing customer service attitude is \"Don't like it?

I preferred to use cash, so I stopped by to settle the bill that weekend.  Huge shop plus: Shop Cat!  This black and white sweet little thing stole my heart and the florist had her eye on me to make sure I didn't steal him.  He sat on my shoulder as I paid my bill, and I reluctantly returned him to a nearby stool.  My third encounter was when I picked up the flowers, ready right on time as promised.  I had a ton of carnations, some green trix, buplerum, and a few hydrangeas.  Shop Cat again proved to be the highlight of the experience, but the service was great as well.  She sold me a stem-ripper (to remove thorns and leaves) even though I hadn't purchased the roses from her.  \n\nAll of the flowers held up marvelously, with the exception of a few user-error calamities.  We trimmed and arranged everything in my centerpieces with a little water, and stashed them in a cool (but not cold) spare room so they would wake up.

Try as I may, I just can't get excited about it. \n\nAAB&C has everything a good comic store should have; in-depth yet intuitive store lay-out, boxes upon boxes of back issues, nice tidy displays of action figures and busts, a big sign on the front of the store  professing their accolades...\n\nAnd that's it.\n\nThere's no playing or reading space of any kind. No television. The radio usually plays smooth jazz or some other music substitute.\n\nAnd unless you're willing to strike up a conversation with the guy in the Amoeba Music t-shirt who so looks like he's already judged your worth as a person by the time you've made it to the graphic novels section, there's really no one to strike up any conversation with. Unless you need help looking for something (here's a hint...alphabetization).\n\nYes, AAB&C is a good \"comic book store\"...by standards set ten or twenty years ago. These days I expect more from my comic book store. \n\nMaybe it's because of the integration of trading card players into geek culture. Or maybe it's because the internet has replaced basic human interaction and I crave more face to face time with other nerds like myself. \n\nOr maybe it's because it's 114 fucking degrees outside and I need a place to go.\n\nBut me personally, I like a comic book store with some atmosphere and hospitality.\n\nSure, not having any playing space to play or read cuts back on the \"Yeah, I think I can get it one more game in before my mom comes to pick me up\" crowd, but let's call a spade a spade; you used to be that fucking kid. And so did I. \n\nMaybe it wasn't our local comic shop, but it was the mall, the movie theater, perhaps even La Biblioteca. We've all been there, we all had parents who didn't want to spend the weekend with us, and as annoying as the spectacle of sad and fail is to behold, we have no real place to pass judgment. \n\nAfter all, we're the ones buying comic books and action figures we'll never take out of the box. And the shops can afford to carry such ridiculous fare from all the income they get hosting Magi-Yugi-Mon events.\n\nBut wait, if AAB&C doesn't cater to such a crowd...how do they...wait what?\n\nIn my reviews of other comic book outlets, I've referred to AAB&C to \"All About Crooks & Comics\". \n\nThis is not a mere clever nickname given by the fund-deprived; AAB&C has a reputation for ripping off those poor and unfortunate few who come across a rare or vintage back issue/piece of memorabilia and bring it in hoping to get a reasonable price for it. \n\nI can't prove from first-hand experience, as I'm not a \"collector\", I'm a reader. I don't keep my books in bags, and with the exception of a set of JTHM I got for Christmas from Misty S, I don't even have any recent single issues. I just wait for them to come out on trade paperback. \n\nI know. The horror. The horror.\n\nBut I have had a lot of friends who've griped to me about going back to AAB&C and finding the same book they sold them a few weeks ago on sale for 3, 4, or perhaps even 5 times the amount it was bought. \n\nGranted, this is a common occurrence in all \"Used & New\" businesses; remember that commercial for Gamestop where the guy mentions that he's selling his copy of [Random First Person Shooter] for 15 bucks? Yeah, that never fucking happens. That guy would be lucky if he got 10, and that's including the 10% extra that his Gamestop card would give him, if he was smart enough to sign up for one in the first place. \n\nBut if AAB&C doesn't really buy into the whole \"trading card/clicking miniature figures\" craze, it makes you wonder where the profit comes from. Especially when there's a Samurai on Indian School & 7th St, an Atomic Comics at 28th Dr and Peoria, Stalking Moon on Greenway and Hero Comics on T-Bird.\n\nMaybe AAB&C primarily services \"serious buyers\" who do not have the time or patience for all the hub-bub and tomfoolery to be had at the other, trendier locations. Maybe it's those same people who gave this place all 5's (except the one who admits they only come in to buy gift certificates). \n\nMaybe that's where AAB&C's niche lies, and we should accept that certain people want certain things out of the places they give their patronage.\n\nWho knows? You've probably stopped giving a shit about what I say ever since I admitted I only buy trades. \n\nBut don't lie, you've got a friend who spouts nothing but quotes from Plato and Socrates, and every time he walks away everyone in your group is all \"I just want to kick that guy in the fucking balls!\"  \n\nUnless that friend is you.\n\nYou ass.", "business_id": "y9cQ0DBC0qFNgkpTXHzokA", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-07-05", "type": "review"}

Just recently, I had an experience that pleasantly surprised me.  I'd purchased a Promaster CF card from them in January.  I used it for a while, but then it got corrupted somehow.  I switched to another brand that I had on hand, and took the Promaster back to FF.  They exchanged it for another after verifying that it was a bad card with no problems.  I stuck the new one in my camera case and forgot about it until a couple weeks ago. (I may have formatted the new one in my camera, I don't remember at this point)  I pulled it out to use it for a firmware update, and found that neither my camera or computer would recognize it.  So, I took it back to FF.  They tried to format it in one of their cameras, and it wouldn't function for them either.  With no questions asked, they not only exchanged this CF card for a new one, but they also upgraded it to the new \"Extreme\" CF that Promaster makes.  In other words, they exchanged a $60 CF card for a $140 card without any hassle or paperwork.  That's the kind of customer service I really like.  \n\nOne side comment:  The people behind the counter at FF are photo geeks (and I don't think they'd be offended by that) who happen to work in a camera shop.  Meaning they're incredibly knowledgable, and more than happy to help, but maybe not overwhelmingly polished and \"salesman-like\".  I've dealt with all of the gentlemen working there currently, and can't think of a single negative thing to say about any of them.\n\nRegarding pricing:  I research everything I buy before I make a purchase.  I know that I can beat the prices at FF on many items by ordering online.  The difference is generally fairly small though, and I feel that it's worth the extra 1-2% to purchase locally, and have the access to such an incredible knowledge base that the folks at FF have to offer.", "business_id": "VilxIfmahfOhMcIaGK8Www", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-08-19", "type": "review"}

It is true, and depending on the time, I wear it loud and proud or I just pretend to be a Norm. I really look and act like a Norm, I promise. I even bathe and brush my hair daily!\n\nSamurai is an awesome store. I can't say enough good things about the place. \n\nIt's super user friendly, for one. They have a bunch of regulars that work there who run the place and know their stuff. I have a subscription box, and I love it. You can basically ask them to pull certain comics every time they come out on Wednesday, and come by when you've got enough to purchase and get them all out! And everytime something you subscribe gets put in the box, they email you letting you know it's there. No fighting to make sure you're able to get it, no coming in a month later like I usually do to find out that Jason Pearson's return to Body Bags sold out AGES ago and you can't get any... it's just there. It's dangerous for my pocket book, but in the best sort of way. \n\nI have a lot of history with this place. I went by this store every time I was passing by about 2 years ago. I really stopped going because money was tight, and truthfully, every time I walked in there I was spending more than $50!! Good for them, not so good for me. I wanted to start reading Death Note. They didn't have them, so they ordered it for me. They did the same for multiple TPBs that they didn't have on hand. They will check the other stores to see if they have back issues of an arc you missed, if you're a dork like I am and constantly forget to check when something is coming out. Or if you get on the bandwagon late and want to read something 3 issues in. :P \n\nThey were awesome then. They're still awesome now.\n\nRecently I made it a point to wander back in after I had seen things pop up about free comic book day. I wanted to get Becky Cloonan's Conan the Barbarian. I was out of luck, but they put it in my subscription box. And when I stopped by to get it, I see a sweet little note on there saying Welcome Back from Chris! Now that tickles me to the cockles of my wee lil' heart. That is SO awesome.\n\nI love Samurai. I don't live anywhere near you guys, but as long as I'm into comics and live in Phoenix, I'll be coming to you guys.

After you get 10 stamps, you get $5 off your purchase. so the most you're getting is a 5% discount every few weeks, but more likely you're getting a much smaller %.

I ended up with a beautifl 3G that just happens to match my car.  But it gets better.  When I went to pick up my bike, Joe helped my put my ancient bike rack on the back of my PT in the middle of the day - roasting hot sun - and he did it all with a smile!  Josh is a genius at accesories, but not at all pushy.  Adam took time to say hi and say he was glad I had wandered in.  While I was there, I watched various associates giving excellent service to everyone who was there.  Best purchasing experience I have had in AGES.  Oh, and it gets better.  In two or three months I take my totally amazing bike back for a free tune-up!  Yay!  A word to the wise - if you don't speak bike\ndon't to go Landis - go to Sun Cyclery.", "business_id": "jYyfLGMURG2pQ6k80R4eZA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-07-18", "type": "review"}

We use the machine a ton.\n\nThe machine (as well as I'm sure many of their other products) comes with a 10 YEAR WARRANTY!!!! Just bring your item into the store and have it maintained! LOVE IT! During my many visits to the store to pick up the necessary cleaning solution I have seen other customers bringing in their products for upkeep. What a lovely service.\n\nThe machine is totally worth the money. It does an amazing job...way better than any of those wet carpet cleaners and even better than having our carpets cleaned by professionals! All that money wasted on those services when this little gem of a machine was waiting at the store just around the corner. Guess I should give ya'll the name of the machine, it's called the Orbital.\n\nSo happy with our product, the location of the store, and the expertise of the one-man show!\n.", "business_id": "GJIl37k1Kitq5r43eUZ1Kw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-08-16", "type": "review"}

I also think that they could stand to expand their offerings to include some furnishings and decor that are a little more modern/urban (like the loft collection West Elm just introduced). I think they could update their offerings without messing up their overall concept. I get kind of tired of seeing the same dark wood furniture pieces with ethnic embossing over and over again, especially when one dresser has a $600 price tag. \n\nThat being said, Pier 1 is an awesome place to pick up accessories to complete or add to your current furniture and decor. My personal favorites: their reeds/feathers/silk flowers, plates (buy one cool one and display on the stand they sell separately), martini glasses (we have two striped ones displayed on our wet bar), trays, and candles/candle accessories. They also always have a huge variety of colors, which is really helpful if you have something particular in mind; this is not the case at Ikea or Target, which tend to have decor in stock that is only in specific seasonal or featured colors. \n\nThis particular location of Pier 1 has a really friendly and helpful staff.

Having the oversight of several apartments in the central Phoenix area we have had our fair share of appliance failures. I am always pressed on what is better try and fix or just replace again. In the same week I had two separate washing machine failures. Both were acting in similar fashion. I called Frost Appliance Repair. After telling them of my problem and giving them a description of what they were doing they told me that many time it will be less expensive to just replace the machine. One of our machines I felt may be repairable. The second I was confident the transmission was out so they said send them a model number and they would let me know what the costs might be. I scheduled them to a service call on the the one I thought might have a chance to be repaired and the told me the second that I was pretty sure was bad would cost more than a new machine to repair. We scheduled the service call for the first machine. I received a call from the the repairman while he was at the location. He explained the problems he encountered and with that information I determined it would be better to replace that machine also. Another bonus for me is I did ask them if it can't be repaired would they be able to sell me a used machine that they had in stock. They told me that they have elected to not sell any machine but just focus on giving great repair service.\n\nThe reason I am so happy with this company is they were right up front with me about their work policy and ethics. If they make a service call they charge for that. If the machine can be fixed they deduct the service call from the repairs, not add it in. And if they feel the cost is of repair is more than what I could buy a new one they will make that clear.\n\nIn the end I had them make a service call at $80. They took the model number of or other machine and told me the costs to fix the transmission at no charge. With the information they armed me with I was able to go out and find a super deal on two new washing machines at a price that that was less then what a repair was and now I have a full factory warranty on the new machines.\n\nI will have added Frost Appliance repair to my list of preferred vendors and from now on they will be my first call to either talk with me about the problem or schedule a service call. Their service was awesome, and they saved me money. I am not sure why there are these other negative reviews. I found Frost by seeing one of their trucks in my area when I needed the help. Before I called them I did look them up on Yelp and read the reviews before I called. I approached them with caution because of the review but my experience was the polar opposite of what these reviews indicated.

I ordered it for store pick-up, got an email it was ready as soon as the store opened, zipped in and picked it up with no hard sell of warranties, no effort to push add-ons, no patronizing interference with my setting it up.\n\nSix weeks later, its operating system went kablooey. I took it back to Best Buy, and in a matter of minutes, the customer service gal had determined that the laptop was defective and they needed to give me a new one. It seems, from the side-chat with her supervisor, that she had to do some exceptions to not put me into a loop of futile diagnostics and repairs -- AND SHE DID THAT EXCEPTION VOLUNTARILY.

But what DID happen was...\n\nthere have been some small changes that make all the difference at this small store and for the most part, I really like it. \n\nFirst thing, they have added things representative of other tribes to their stock. I have found Fresh Corn (LOVE THEM!!) Shirts that rep my tribe! (WHOO!) and they are also selling shirts that rep other tribes. The prices for the shirts aren't too bad $22 for one is about average. \n\nAlso, they have more shawls. I luuuuuuve shawls!! *purrs* Shawls are sometimes painted but usually applicaed (is that spelled right) shawls that are worn at Powwows by women. Some shawls can go for a couple of hundred dollars - and in the past, Drumbeats went for a little higher than $200 - I was have happy to see that they lowered their prices on shawls! :) I now send EVERYONE for them! :)\n\nI didn't check their stock of pendletons, I believe their prices are still same but they do have more of a variety of them now - which is good. They now are expanding their stock of Pendleton Accessories!! I SO want a pendleton purse! :D Their jewelry is now more... colorful. which is great. I love color. :) and again - representative of different tribes. \n\nAlso - they have a couple of more racks of CDs for sale... so they have more of a variety and have extended their Chicken Scratch collection (SCORE!) lol. \n\nThe clerks still aren't the most outgoing, but atleast they are saying \"thank you\" at the end of every transaction now. And ONCE in a great while... they'll crack a smile. This a nice turn around for the store and I'm glad. \n\nALSO once in a while (I'm not sure how frequently) there is a small group of Navajo women who sell frybread. They have standard stand prices (nothing over $5 - I believe) and of course have mutton stew and grilled mutton with green chili frybread sandwiches. I like their frybread with red chili... it's really good. So maybe if you're lucky - you'll go when they're there... look for a neon green sign that says \"frybread today\" along 16tth street! :)", "business_id": "dUTQIs1SMymII0-frGSZdw", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-08-12", "type": "review"}

However, I will try my best.  I dropped off a prescription Tuesday evening.  I pulled up to the drive-thru and waited at the window for over 5 minutes without being acknowledged.  Not a \"hi, we'll be right with you\" Nothing.  I wasn't in a hurry and understand that these places can get crazy busy so I waited this time without pressing the \"Call for service\" button and when I finally did, waited another several minutes before I was rudely greeted by a younger girl who looked like she would rather be doing anything at that moment besides helping me.  I then gave her the prescription and it took her another several minutes to tell me that they would have to order it and it wouldn't be available for me to pick up until that Friday!  I was a little upset that I needed my medication and would not be able to obtain it until then, but I figured what can I do, and agreed to be there Friday to pick it up.  Upon arriving Friday after work, I was in a hurry to get home and figured they had plenty of time to get it good and ready for me by Friday afternoon and assumed it wouldn't take more than a couple minutes.  First off, they only had one of what I had been expecting three of, THEN they wanted to charge me over 80 dollars for something that has always cost me 10.  I said that there must be some mistake and the \"kid\" behind the counter said he didn't know what to tell me except this is what they are supposed to charge according to my insurance company.  So I left, extremely upset, without my medication.  Then I called my Insurance company and I was told that CVS was wrong and I was only supposed to pay the 10 dollars as usual.  When I went back, I was prepared to sit and wait as long as it took in order to get my medication at the price I was supposed to be charged.  I ended up spending over an hour in the CVS this time until they finally figured out they were wrong.  I ended up leaving that day with my medication which I paid the amount expected from the beginning and left with a smile on my face and at no time was rude to the \"less than educated\" workers behind the counter because while I waited for them to fix their mix up, there were several customers who were presented with similar situations, all of which were not nice to the staff.  This however is no excuse for them to be little punks and not give a crap about people, this is our health we're talking about and it should not be dealt with by a bunch of dumb dumbs...

My employer forces us to use CVS for long term prescriptions. This is unfortunate because I have had nothing but horrible customer service experiences here. I've either dealt with a pharmacy tech who is incompetent, rude, or lazy-and on occasion all three. Just a few recent examples:\n\nI called about their generic prescription plan that you pay an annual membership fee for. I wanted to see if I could buy a membership for my dog's medication. The girl said \"um, nah. that's not something we offer. you can ask your vet for references\".  Okay whatever. I went to Walgreens to fill the prescription and before paying the pharmacist stopped me and told me about their similar program and explained that I could \"of course!\" Use it for animal medication, as long as it was available. \n\nI called CVS to refill my own prescription. They filled it as a 90 day supply a few months back, and then this last time as a 30 day. I wanted them to refill as a 90 (I never asked them to switch to 30) and the girl on the phone gave me attitude when she replied \"we can fill it but it depends on if your insurance will allow it\". She really can't see my prescription history? So I say \"okay\" and wait while she checks. She says \"okay looks like we can do that\". Then she calls back later in the afternoon and leaves a voicemail saying that it cannot be filled at all until July 26th. So I call the automated system and figure I'll just have the 30 day refilled. The system stops me and says my prescription is available for pickup?! So we go to CVS to pick up what I expect to be the 30 day because homegirl said they couldn't fill the 90 in her voicemail. Adam was our cashier/pharm tech and I started to explain the scenario and he interrupted with \"this is for 90 days\" like I was out of place for asking. No apologies for the confusion, nothing. Treated me like an idiot while watching me fumble with the electronic signature release pad as well. Cut your hair and reel in the attitude, sir. \n\nEmployees-stop acting like you're smarter than everyone just because you took organic chemistry. \n\nI can see how the job sucks, but I didn't choose it for these folks.

That is the same price I would have paid at a Footlocker, and only $10 more than Amazon (without prime shipping, so almost equivalent costs once you pay to have them mailed).  I also purchased a Buddy System hands-free leash for $2 more than the online price.  Obviously I can't speak to every item in the store, but for what I got -- I really didn't see much, if any, markup.

Quinton made the engagement ring and wedding band purchasing process extremely easy and very low pressure.  He is very well informed and was great at teaching me all about diamonds.  He spent an hour with me the first time I walked in the store and never pressured me into buying anything or spending more than I wanted.  I ended up with the perfect engagement ring.

We walked out less than an hour later with the perfect band as well.  I appreciate businesses that go the extra mile to make sure that customers are happy with their purchasing decisions and take the time to inform them without pressuring them during the process.

Neither of them spoke English, or knew American sizes.  He was certain, that,  Jenny, the men's manager, who \"is one of my best friends in America\" will know what to do!  I asked her after she got the ladies set up next door how she knew him, maye she had been dating him.   She said no, he was just a customer who drove in from Glendale to shop with them. It didn't surprise me in the least. I felt comfortable asking Jenny that as I have know her since she graduated from high school.  I know the work she puts into making it a great place for a man to shop at.   Excellent merchandise is not enough if men don't feel at ease shopping at a men's store.  When it comes to shopping, a man always needs a place like this!  I'm just afraid one of these days someone is going to steal her away to Sedona one of her favorite places!\n\nJust so you know, when they sell your things, you have the choice of getting cash or taking it in trade.  Wise individuals, they want you to keep you money on account and spend it there, so they give you more when you take it in trade.  Don't be surprised though if your Raybans that you have never worn don't bring as much as you think.  Jenny will probably gets you as much as your going to get unlike another store at 32nd Street and Shea.  I about threw up when I saw what they got two pairs of unworn Merrill boots  I took there just to try some place different for a change  I'm not going to say I'd never consider going to another place and see what they have to offer.  I just know Well Suited is a consistently comfortable place for a man to enjoy going in and doing some shopping and that isn't all that bad!\n\nJust thought to say something about two different things.  Ever gotten a gift card to someplace that is going to take you forever to find something you need to use it? The money you take in trade can be used at any of the stores of this group which includes women's and furniture and accessory stores.    Even better, I think is what happens if something  you consign doesn't sell.  You can take it back or they will donate it to a group that supports no kill animal shelters.   I appreciate the owners of the company for supporting this very worthy cause.", "business_id": "uuLYxKdJW_jfty1jMtXxQw", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-07-05", "type": "review"}

If you are hoping for customer service, try Poor Little Rich Girl as they take the time to help you and treat you well. There are nice people who work here, but they often aren't allowed by management to get you info or help out as you need. Mostly, you have to keep on top of everything you consign. Some examples. After seven weeks of asking where my items were, the manager admitted they couldn't find them. They only gave me $10 in credit for a new pair of Ted Baker evening pumps as compensation. Second, I dropped off a pair of genuine Louis Vuitton shoes. If the issue with missing items hadn't happened, I never would have found out that they labeled them as faux (which they are genuine!) and they would have donated them without ever calling me. I'd be out an expensive pair of shoes with nothing to show for it. Third, they lost a pair of unworn Gucci wedges for over a month. When they found them, they were on the floor less than two days before they were marked down by 40%!

The whole thing.  From the intial phone call I made to the office to the final installation of the new motor.  Just awful.\n\nFirst the phone call to the office was less than desired. The fellow who answered the phone wasn't terribly helpful and told me that he couldn't schedule anything, but he would send my call to one of his \"technicians.\"  Okay.\n\nA couple hours later a technician called. He was abrubt and abrassive in his tone, asking me to describe what was wrong and then interrupting me when he figured out that he knew better than I did what the description was.\n\nHe came and diagnosed the problem while I was at my office in Chandler. He very tersely told me, \"either I come in an hour or on Monday.\"  I had just come back home to 114 degree weather, so I thought it better he come quickly than wait 5 days.  So he came.\n\nThen he called from the car and told me he had taken my motor as it needed to be repaired. I wasn't given a choice.  He just took it.  So now I can't have someone else come out and give me another price quote.  Of course, this fellow still hadn't told me what was wrong or what the price would be - he just took my motor and called me from the car.\n\nWhen he returned on Tuesday (not on Monday as he promised because he said I didn't answer the phone soon enough for him and he couldn't leave the motor without any money from me) he installed a new motor without telling me. He told me on the phone that if he couldn't repair the motor someone would call and quote me the price for a new motor.  I guess not, and what choice did I had - he still had my old motor.  So we were forced to accept the new motor since it was already installed without a price or a pre-installation discussion.\n\nHe then told us that a pipe was cracked and that the suction for the pool pump was compromised, but he didn't fix it.  Why not offer to fix it?  And after he left, he left our pump clock on for just 2 hours.  Really?  In the summer?  And he didn't tell us the fill valve was also broken.  A cheap 20.00 part that I am sure he had on the truck would have fixed that.\n\nThe new motor was 289.00 which I am told is very fair, but then they charged 16.50 for shop labor (for what) and nearly 100.00 for the miscellaneous parts needed to install the motor, and 95.00 for his labor.  The price should have been about 385.00 in my opinion.  If he had repaired the plumbing and the fill valve so we didn't have to have someone else come by, I might have thought 580 was fair?  But now we have to have more work done on the pool by another company.\n\nThis particular technician was so horrible I am afraid to call this company ever again. He was rude to me and to my husband and", "business_id": "xsyIKrKNsmcOMsBipNlO5A", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-08-28", "type": "review"}

The second -- a suit-clad gentleman standing by the door at full attention in the heat of day, like one of the Queen's Guards outside Buckingham Palace.  He let me through the first door as I approached, into a small room where the outside door closed and an inside door opened.  In awe of the security of the place, I finally entered the elegant, yet bustling offices of Molina Fine Jewelers.\n\nThe selection is intricate, unique, and WAY out of my budget -- we're talking multi-MILLION dollar jewelry, such as the 76-carat diamond, The Archduke Joseph.  The front wing of the building, labeled \"Boutique\", is a wedding boutique which has more accessibly priced inventory and, unlike the rest of the store, does not require an appointment to visit.

We were at Sports Chalet the day day before and left empty handed because the girl who worked in the snowboarding dept. had no idea what she was talking about. Ski Pro was the exact opposite. A very helpful and informative guy by the name of Cody answered all of our questions. He gave us his personal advice over what size board would be right for me. We also asked if the newest season of the board we were looking at was any different than the one I wanted. He assured me both boards were almost exactly identical but that I would be paying $85 more just for this years graphics (which sucked by the way.) After speaking with him I felt confident in the purchase I was making, and so happy that I ended by a new pair of pants that I didn't really even need. I am just sooooooo impressed by their large inventory, the shop-ability of the store, the prices of everything, as well as the great customer service that was provided.

These people are trained to tell bald face lies in order to make sales. The reason I say trained is because I've seen a pattern with the employees. I was told in March of 2011 that I should buy a 4G Samsung 1 because 4G would be coming out any day. A year and 1/2 later I dropped the phone and cracked the scree and still on contract I told them I did not want an upgraded Samsung III if they weren't coming out of 4G anytime soon, the the next employee sounded like he was giving me the same sale pitch the first one did, that 4G was coming out, giving me that nudge to spend more money than I wanted to.\n\nAlso I was sold a Sprint MIFI and I was told you could go anywhere at anytime and connect to the internet. After about 6 visits to this location for tech support, we end up resetting the thing each time, but if I'm in the field, and since that's required every single time I use it, I might as well just use my phone for internet and save 10-15 minutes. I paid $100 of this Piece of cr..p thing and $37 per month and they flat out refuse to let me out of the contract.\n\nI was being sarcastic when the manager after several tech support visits between my phones and MIFI asked me my name and I told him he should know it by now, and his response was that I should be thankful that at least someone was helping me.\n\nIt's damn near a monopoly, but not quite. There's still Verizon and T-Mobile, and god forbid running a business with Cricket, which is a small step down from Sprint.", "business_id": "N6ff0yyo9Cv_7XPz-YDoow", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-08-01", "type": "review"}

She said to the cashier, \"You need to wear your hearing aids whether you like it or not!\"  I was so appalled that she would say that in front of the woman's customers and coworkers.  Apparently this manager has never heard of the ADA!\n\nSo the cashier finishes helping the lady with the accent and it is my turn in line.  A coworker of hers gives her a piece of paper with a note from the manager.  I see her open the note, and I can see that it says, \"wear your hearing aids!\" and I see the cashier's face completely drop.  \n\nI checked out and left the store, got all the way back to my car, but didn't feel right not saying anything about this older woman being humiliated at work. So I walked back in and asked a cashier if I could have a phone number or e-mail address to contact the district manager or corporate. She said she would have to go to the back to get that information, and when she came back, she said, \"My manager said we can't give you that information.  She'll have to take your name and phone number and call you.\" I said, \"That's okay, I'll go online and get that information.  What is your store number?\" and of course I later found that they gave me the WRONG store number.\n\nAlso, all corporate businesses like this has a line customers can call about concerns.  This manager was seriously trying to cover her butt.\n\nSo I called another Williams Sonoma store in Phoenix, spoke to the manager there, and got the corporate telephone number.\n\nThere are other ways to discuss the cashier's disability with her, in private, and come to a solution.

However, when it comes to this Gucci, I will most likely only make purchases elsewhere. I've had several disappointing experiences here. \n\nCustomer service is big for me and when walking into a high-end store such as Gucci, I look for quality customer service. Sadly, I get the opposite here. I purchased a purse and a month into having it, the strap broke. The purse was only a month old. I brought in my new purse with a broken strap into this Gucci and asked them if they could replace it since it was a brand new purse. They immediately said no and said that they would need to send it back to the factory to be fixed. I understand this requirement if the purse has been used and owned for awhile, but this was practically a brand new purse. However, I followed the rules and let them send it into the factory. Six weeks later, I finally got it back. I thought it would be as good as new and not give me any other problems. I took my purse on a work trip to San Francisco a couple months later and in the middle of my trip, the same exact strap broke a second time. This time it left me without a purse on my work trip. Since I was in San Francisco, I immediately went over to the Union Square location and explained the situation. They were horrified that Gucci didn't replace it the first time and without any questions, they exchanged my broken bag for a brand new one and sent me on my way. Now that's customer service and I'm sad that it took the Gucci in San Francisco (and not Scottsdale) to give it to me. I was very disappointed with how Gucci in Scottsdale treated me. \n\nDuring a second experience, I had Gucci sunglasses with scratched lenses. I love my sunglasses and wanted to fix or replace the lenses. I figured that Gucci was my best bet so I took my sunglasses into this location because it was my only Gucci store option. I explained the situation and asked them if they could send my sunglasses to be fixed. Without a second glance, they said no and that there was nothing that could be done and sent me on my way. A couple months later, I discovered another sunglass store in Fashion Square and decided to ask them about fixing my lenses. To my surprise, they did it for a reasonable cost and my sunglasses were like new. Sadly, Gucci was not the store who helped me and I had to resort to another business. \n\nI like Gucci products and I typically like Gucci service, but unfortunately this particular Gucci location lacks the customer service and I will therefore shop at other locations and not this one.", "business_id": "-fIGHIUdHX-T_ZGh2IQz4Q", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-06-13", "type": "review"}

When I went back to check the status, I mentioned that my trackpad had been wearing down after years of use, and how I would go about replacing it. Genius said, no prob, that he had it in stock and would swap it out. What I didn't realize was it was one part so I also got a new keyboard in the mix, so that was pretty sweet. \n\nNow, I think Genius felt sorry for me to be honest. I'm not sure, but I really don't think the keyboard part, nor the battery are covered under AppleCare in normal circumstances, but that day apparently they were. \n\nSo I walked out of Apple with a practically new MacBook, finally that damn external hard drive, but no evidence of the last 3 years of my life. It was a super crappy day, but it could have been a lot worse. Thanks to Genius Alan and AppleCare, I was at least able to have a silver lining to the dark cumulonimbus hovering over my head.\n\nWhen life hands you lemons, you make lemonade. If it gives you a rotten Apple- head to the Genius bar.", "business_id": "l5vzFaqSjvxZiRn0MJeKkg", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-07-08", "type": "review"}

I even had a pretty good experience when I purchased it at the Scottsdale (Kierland area) Apple store.  I'm realizing now that i forgot to yelp about that... oh well!\n\nThe reason I had to go to the Biltmore Apple Store was because after two weeks of using my new phone, I realized my speaker phone, my ringer, my alarm, (basically everything audio on my phone) was not working.  And my phone was not holding a charge very long either.  I took it in today only to realize you cannot just \"take it in\" to meet with someone in service - you need an appointment!  Ugh!\n\nLucky for me, I only had to wait about an hour and a half to get that appointment... so Jared and I walked around the Biltmore Fashion Park wasting time until my appointment.  And then guess what happened?  I walked in for my appointment and I was told that I needed to make sure that my iPhone was backed up to my computer or I would lose everything!  And why they couldn't tell me that in the first place, i have no clue...\n\nSo I made another appointment for two hours later and I went home and backed up my phone... and then I went back for my appointment and waited and waited.  And then I met with someone who passed me to someone else and finally they took care of me.  I actually scored myself a new phone that works this time.  \n\nSo, after spending a good chunk of my Saturday with several \"geniuses\" at the Apple store, I'm thankful to have a working phone...

Ever since my PC died the day before a major paper was due freshman year, I have been a Mac user, a PC hater, and I scoff at the Windows OS. \n\nI have been to this location twice for two different reasons. The first was to buy an iPhone 4 cover and the second time was for an Apple Care/iPhone hardware problem.\n\nFirst time: I waltzed in around 10:15 and headed to the accessories area in the back, after being greeted by a friendly employee. Normal. After a few minutes of debating different cases, I asked for help. I noticed that most of the 1 and 2 star reviews wrote about bad customer service/being ignored, especially when those Yelpers only aimed to buy the less pricey items. I received great treatment. My Apple guy pointed out two cases that met my specifications and suggested the one that was cheaper. Excellent. I was out the door in less than 20 minutes.\n\nSecond time: My iPhone 4 was on the fritz and I couldn't make or receive calls. \n\nSince this was not my first Apple product, I knew to call Apple Care first and talk to someone over the phone, who would then set up an in-person appointment for me whenever I wanted and wherever I wanted. (Tip for new Apple users. The phone people are great and super nice!)\n\nWalked into the Biltmore store 5 minutes before my appointed time and ended up waiting for 30 minutes. Ugh. But when Brandon did get to me, he was great. Although he tried to convince me that my problem was software-based and not hardware-based (as the phone Apple Care guy and I determined), he was a total sweetheart when I walked back into the store not 10 minutes after I initially left with a phone still unable to make/receive calls. He got to me right away and switched out my broken phone for a new one. The second time only took 10 minutes and my new phone is great.\n\nTwo small suggestions for the store:\n1) Stop scheduling your Genius appointments so close together. You know that some problems take longer to fix than anticipated and that makes all the subsequent appoints late. I like your store, but I don't want to sit around for an extra 30 minutes when I could have just been scheduled later.\n\n2) Apple stores need to have the same express pass phrase that the Apple Care phone system has. I know that some Apple users might not understand certain tech things, but I do not want to be told that I have a software problem when I know that I have a hardware problem and I have to return to the store ten minutes later! Give me that pass phrase that lets my Genius person know that I know what I am talking about.", "business_id": "l5vzFaqSjvxZiRn0MJeKkg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-08-25", "type": "review"}

The man on the phone message sounded very unprofessional, and spoke like he was a flamboyant, member of the Rocky Horror Picture Show. He thought it was fabulous, that they had repaired something with my computer, completely unrelated to what I was requesting be fixed. Obviously Dant\u00e9 had called the wrong customer, but whatever.  \n\nWhen I get to the store I found a confused hipster telling me that they hadn't and wouldn't fix either of the problems that they said they would be fixing.

I went to this apple store after going to a competitor and can say they really helped me save money.  I went in ready to buy a new unit when one young man said why not buy refurbished on line and have it delivered.His logic waas that they had gone farther through a refurbished machine when they got it back than with the regular brand new machines.  Something to be said for his line of thought I thought about this long and hard and checked what was available online for a month.  Later I went back and worked with an associate named Jessica who showed me logically that I was going to spend more money than I needed to, about $500 dollars!?!.  The refurbished unit came in faster than i expected/  I took my old machine that had half the tech staff came out looking at it and saying \"It still works?\"  They loaded the new one with the info from the old  machine and got it the same day.  Later that evening, I realized nothing was going as it should in updating necessary information.  The  next day, I made and appoint meant and hauled everything over there.  My final contact was with a delight flu woman named Elizabeth.  She proceeded to show me that about half of what I had load off the old machine wasn't necessary and would have caused exactly what was going wrong.   I can't tell you how much time she took to remove things I didn't need.  She also explained something to me that I think should have been told before.  Safari is a product of Mac, I was not  this  before. In my opinion, it only  makes sense to use it when I am on a macintosh computer.  From seeing what Elizabeth work today, I realized I've run into problems previously because no one told me about she benefit of using safari and mac together.\n\nYeah, Jessica, for saving me money!  Elizabeth for her smile when she went through the tedious process of ridding my new machine of things I didn't need!

Definitely recommend if you are in need of an Apple Product, but as far as repairing your products I recommend anywhere else but here, especially if your warranty had already expired. I had a liquid spill and the cost to ship it and look at it as $755. And I will tell you it was very little shampoo that got in it (although sometimes that doesn't matter). Anyhow, I recommend, Mac Media, Mac troopers, or Mac I am to fix any liquid damages. Even if you have the warranty or Apple coverage it still wouldn't cover liquid damages. The sub stores are a great place to go to in the Phoenix area for a cheap fix. Most of them were actually Apple employees before owning their own businesses, etc. \nI was very shock to know that my MacBook Pro was finish after just having it for only a year. \nThe only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because I am very particular about appointments. If I made an appointment for 1, I expect to be seen at 1 or before, not at 1:30. Otherwise it's a good store.", "business_id": "l5vzFaqSjvxZiRn0MJeKkg", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-07-07", "type": "review"}

I sewed quite a bit as a teenager, then quit when I went to college and didn't give it a second thought for nearly 30 years. After moving to Arcadia 3 years ago, I started driving by the store every day. I had no idea what a \"Bernina\" was, but the sign advertising sewing classes caught my eye. Finally this spring I bought a modestly priced machine (not a Bernina--one day!) and signed up for BC's Sew Fundamental class. I literally took my new sewing machine out of the box, put it in my car, and drove to class along with the supplies I had been instructed to purchase. Cecile Morrow and Mary Furniss could not have been more patient with a basically novice sewist, and I learned a variety of basic machine- and hand-sewing techniques. \n\nAfter taking up garment sewing and getting AWFULLY tired of a zig-zag stitch to finish seam allowances, I bought a modestly priced serger and signed up for Serger Academy with Mary Lewkowitz. This is another fantastic class. This time I practiced threading my new serger before class started, which was a good move. If you have no idea how to thread a serger, Mary will patiently help you, but I think I got more out of the class having already learned that part (it's really not that hard--it just takes patience--and tweezers!). \n\nBeyond the worthwhile classes, the store itself is a delight, and I don't even quilt! I can just imagine how quilters must feel. There are bolts and bolts of beautiful cotton fabric. Their batik selection in particular is admirable. They are thin on fabric selections for garments, but what they do have is definitely worth checking out. They have top quality Mettler thread (both silk finish cotton and Seracor) which is extremely helpful as I can't get it at the local big box store. They have tons of patterns and books for various projects. Best of all, their employees are friendly and helpful without being intrusive. Sometimes you just want to walk around and bask in all of the colorful, patterned goodness, and they're happy to let you! \n\nThank you Bernina Connection--maybe one of these days I'll even sew a quilt!", "business_id": "iYj4QlA3Of2WHTtyYGTodw", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-08-19", "type": "review"}

I'm not sure if the owner saw us pull up in a beat up truck and me walk in with my mom and neice and nephew, and assumed we were poor and I was un-wed with two kids!!  Or if she is just this rude to everyone.  I walked into the small cramped space and was ignored, so I started looking around.  She has a few examples of invitations on her back wall, so I started to look at those, I was not impressed.  I finally went over to her desk and she finanlly asked if we needed help.  I told her I just got engaged and wanted to see some examples of invitations and save the dates, and she told me I had to make an appointment.  There wasn't anyone in the store, she was very rude, and I could tell she was passing judgment on us.  She must not have seen the rock on my finger! Sure my parent's don't have a lot of money, hence the beat up truck we pulled into the parking lot in.  But my paren't aren't paying for my wedding.  My fiance and myself are, we are getting married at the Waldorf Astoria in Chicago (I was visiting family in AZ and wanted to involve my Mom in some of the planning).  If she wasn't so judgemental and allowed us to look through some examples we may have used her, all though I wasn't impressed with the few examples she did have on her wall!  She has no idea what my budget was and if she did know I'm sure she would have treated us better, but to be honest I wouldn't want to give someone like that my buisness.  Make sure you make an appointment before stopping in this place, and make sure you are dressed to the nines so she doesn't think your money is worthless in her store.

The employees are very knowledgeable and really seem to care about your specific pool issues. I tend to trust their advice and follow it. I never feel like they pushed \"snake oil\" on me. One cool thing is that they keep a computer record of your pool and water information.\n\nThe only drawback is that sometimes the wait can be long to get service. I think that's a byproduct of them providing good, personalized service to each customer so I'm not going to knock off a star for that. They might consider hiring an additional *well trained* employee during the busy summer months.\n\nThere really aren't many other pool store options in Phoenix so they have a bit of a captive audience. They could just rest on that fact and provide poor service but they don't. I don't feel like I'm getting gouged by their prices either. I don't enjoy spending money on pool chemicals though.

The manager is very helpful and genuinely wants to see your pool clean.  I'll raise it a star for the solid manager.  \n\nI would give it 1 star if not for the good service.  I have owned my house and cleaned my pool for 3 years now.  It has its own share of issues, specially due to its age.  I just got a new pump put in and replaced the sand on my filter.  Everything is now in essentially brand new condition.  I have gone back and forth with them about every single issue I have had.  The last set of advice made my pool virtually unusable for a solid month this summer. \n\n I was told to dump a bunch of crap into my pool to raise its PH.  Two weeks later I put even more chemicals in there to lower the PH, right after it was raised!  I was told every single time I went in that my chlorine levels weren't registering.  I would add more shock, more tabs and whatever product they were selling me.  It seemed to work fairly well for the first year and a half or so, then I would have to drain my pool like clockwork.  I would spend hundreds in chemicals that did nothing.  Then those chemicals I spent hundreds on would require me to drain my pool every couple years!!\n\nMind you, these chemicals are not cheap.  In fact, Leslies prices are consistently 30 - 40% higher than the competition.  I purchased a vacuum head here for $40, only to find the same exact thing at Fry's next door for $25.  \n\nIn short, I was paying hundreds of dollars for chemicals that were causing more harm than good.  My CYA levels were so sky high that they don't even register on the test. \n\nI turned to the internet to find answers to my problems.  I found http://www.troublefreepool.com/ to be a great resource.  I switched to liquid chlorine and stopped using tabs and granular shock.  After a 80% drain of my pool I am back to square one and a recovering pool.  It is quite frustrating to spend hundreds, possibly thousands, on advice that just doesn't work.  I bought my own water testing kit (Taylor Technologies K-2006) and do all my own tests.  My pool chemistry is now in balance.  Something I never had when going to Leslies.  \n\nI'm over you, Leslies.", "business_id": "AGnIn5fNTniUa1x9XdqCvA", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-08-25", "type": "review"}

If you live in Arcadia, chances are you've shopped at Arcadia Crossings and you might have seen signs all over the parking lot: \"$5 watch batteries\". I saw those signs for about 3 months and still neglected to break out a Lincoln and get my battery fixed. \n\nFinally the stars aligned and I had my watch with me and a few minutes of free time. The store owner Jenny was helping a customer who magically kept pulling watches that needed new batteries out of his jacket (in July mind you) asking if she could fix them. No worries, I browsed though the Arcadia News which had a stack of their newspapers there. \n\nOnce Jenny was able to help it only took a minute for her to fix the battery and have my watch ticking again like new. They charge a couple bucks for the install so with tax $10.29.  What I did like about the place is when talking with the owner, I found out they have been around for years, back when there was a big mall where the Wal-Mart sits today a couple blocks down the road.\n\nHer and I'm guessing husband had a small cart at the mall and ran everything. When the mall closed and the big shopping center was opening up, they made the move. I didn't buy any jewelry that day, but any small business open for over 25 years in the same neighborhood should tell you something. \n\nIf anything they are worth a visit on your list of stores to check out and if you can't find anything you like, go over to Costco and get a hot dog and soda.

T\n\nDo they never clean the bathrooms or wipe down the tables? It's honestly barf inducing.\n\nThe employees are rude. I'm 35 weeks pregnant so yes, I move a little slower while walking through the aisles. Getting on my ass and sighing loudly and repeatedly isn't going to make me go faster. \n\nI love Target. So much so that it's usually a family outting of sorts. My husband and I get Starbucks, my son gets pizza, everyone wins. If it was legal to burn this place to the ground, I would do that too. The clientele is...interesting. The parking is terrible and very busy.  Look out or you will get run over. The pizza my son got today was blue on top. Blue! The breadsticks I got had no seasoning. The coke was flat. \n\n\n\nToday was such a bad experience, I had a complete crying meltdown while waiting for my husband to come rescue us. I honestly do not understand the good reviews for this place. Never again.", "business_id": "VxnV1uMZURUQMNUaPdB8QA", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-06-09", "type": "review"}

We're fans. We use the Target Red Card and Cartwheel app shopping there. Target has been a staple in our house for years. When the economy turned south and they stopped selling the higher-end stuff I was disappointed but understood. When the Garden Centers closed to be replaced by grocery departments I was disappointed, but adjusted. There seems to be a very slow effort underway to bring in some higher end stuff again, but there is much catching up to do. Lately however I have been extremely disappointed with their grocery department, not in selection but in the lack of pulling expired items from shelves. A few weeks ago I came home with three grocery items that had expired in 2014 (yep, last year). Didn't learn and didn't look last week. I came home with two expired items. So during today's run we made an effort to look at all expiration dates of items we normally would purchase. Of the 20 items we looked at 5 were at least 30 days expired and three were to expire in 2 days (boxed stuff). That is not OK! Sadly this doesn't seem to be contained to bad management at one store. Shopping trip 1 was at one Target (Tempe Marketplace), the other at a different (Indian Bend and Pima) and today's at yet another (44th and Thomas). Yep, there are 3 Targets within 5 miles of my house.  I've scaled down my grocery shopping at the store and moved back to the neighborhood grocery store.

So, we chose to ignore it (figuring since it was a $500 couch, it was what we should expect). About a month later, while watching a movie and enjoying a nice, cheap glass of wine (we're frugal, get it?) the couch snapped, and my boyfriend and I both crashed into one another whilst spilling red wine all over ourselves as we sank 3 feet into the floor. This sucked. My boyfriend and I are both tall. lanky, one might even say \"gangly\" people. We knew our combined weight of, maybe, 300 pounds could not have broken the couch. Plus is sucked since day one! So, we called Pruitt's and after 2 weeks a nice man came over to look at our couch. \"It looks like the frame broke where there was a knot in the wood!\" he said \"we will fix it, and it will be as good as new...wait... better than new!\"...he said. So, after being couchless for 4 weeks (it was kind of fun, we set up a bunch of pillows and cushions and made somewhat of a fort(that killed our backs from sitting on the floor)) we finally got our couch back! And guess what, it STILL creaks. \nSo, long story short, its been 6 months of creaking, still hasn't broken, yet! But we are too lazy/figure it's what we get/don't want to be couchless again. So, hopefully if it breaks again, it will be before October, when our year warranty will be up.\n*** 3 stars because it was cheap, and we will probably go back, and because our crappy couch is *extremely* comfortable, and looks nice!", "business_id": "XThGLVVN4oVybmv2gFS1Wg", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-07-11", "type": "review"}

I bought it right then and there.  The sales guy ( I wish I could remember his name) was so kind.  He took my new purchase to the back were he examined her and made sure she was good to go.

Something about the cost of the rims made me look on Ebay and I found many choices of cool rims for the $200 range.

When I picked up the bike which looked good with a clean up and new tires, I asked how much to crate a bike with me paying the postage?

I explained I was in and the price was $60 so he says, \"OK if they told you $60 then it is $60.  I took the bike to REI and they said it would be a couple of days but the cost would be $30.

I went in the store with my girlfriend and the first thing we asked the manager was if we could take pictures. We told her if it was an issue we would leave our cameras in the car. She told us it was fine and we were there for an hour snapping away and having a grand time. As we made our way to the front she tells me that I am clogging the aisle and that she needs to see my ID. She told me that security told her to take it. I then asked where the security people are located and she said that they had left. Further into the conversation she said that the manager told her to take it. I asked who the manager was and she said there was no manager and proceeded to say security had asked for it. I called her out on the inconsistency of the story and she said she never said that she told me that a manager asked her to take the information. One of the employees finally took me to the side while she was helping a customer and told me that she was the manager and was concerned I was casing the place to later rob it. She accused me of taking pictures of the security system and being too detailed with my shots. I'm a photographer and all I was looking for was nice pictures. I insisted that she watch as I deleted all photos that I took, but she said all she needed was my information. Needless to say, I will not be coming back to this antique store.

He bought a couple pairs at the optical shop connected to the ophthalmologist and when he sent me pictures I was quick to call and cancel the order.  We then went to Costco but they really didn't have much and in desperation to just get it done we had a disastrous trip to Lenscrafters.  He was intent on the most horrid old man glasses and wouldn't listen to anything I had to say much to the amusement of all the other customers, but I was in no way amused.  That is when I turned to my fellow yelpers  - THANK YOU.  \n\nWhen I typed in glasses Sassy Glasses came up and I was excited after visiting their website (you can get a $25 coupon by signing up for their mailing list).  It really wasn't located on our side of town, but we are no strangers to traveling for the things or food we want - Mesa resident hazard.  Anyway we hustled to get there before they closed on a weekday and made it in about 5:15pm.  They had the best selection of glasses I had ever seen and for someone who is completely committed to her contacts I was actually jealous of my husband as there were several pairs I wanted for myself!  Another day!  Anyway there really wasn't a pair there that I would have said no to and Jordan who helped us couldn't have been nicer.  She helped with suggestions, gave some good insights about frames, and was completely non-pressure.  When we had a question she wasn't a 100% about she called for Dan, the owner, and once again it was a helpful encounter.  My husband ended up getting not just a really cool pair of glasses that he likes because a. they don't have big logos on them, b. no one else has anything like them, and c. they are just really comfortable for him, but he also ordered some Maui Jim's prescription sun glasses which is a great concept.

Here's why I'm giving a 1-star rating:  the $692 tree we paid for 2 weeks ago went missing (was sold to someone else!), they won't offer us a similarly full mesquite tree in exchange for the same price, we waited at home all day for delivery and do not have the tree we paid for 2 weeks ago.  \n\nWe used to live off of Glendale and would pass by the nursery on a regular basis, and we even lived a street over from the owner (we know through a mutual neighbor).  So when it came time for us to start our big landscaping makeover by buying a big shade tree for the west side of our house it was easy to say, \"Hey let's go support our old neighborhood nursery.\"  \n\nOn a Saturday a few weekends ago (6/13) we showed up in the afternoon, and had to wait quite a while for someone to help us.  Eventually Nick helped us and could not have been a nicer, more helpful guy to work with.  He helped us find the type of tree we wanted (lots of shade, very full already, desert adapted tree/lower water use), didn't hesitate to pull out the tree we liked (which we took pictures of, then paid for).  We signed the paperwork, agreed to take delivery on 6/25 and excitedly waited 2 long weeks through the blazing hot Phoenix summer for our new shade tree to arrive.  In the meantime we prepped our yard by moving gravel, had all of the utilities marked and got a landscape design outlining the other plants that we'll be purchasing.\n\nToday (6/25) we get a call in the afternoon saying that our tree is missing.  That's weird, how does a giant tree go missing?  Well, no one knows--it just is.  The best they can do is offer to send some other smaller trees (but same box size) out to see if we want those.  We wait for those, agree that they're definitely not comparable to the tree we picked out and have to pass on them.  I call in and talk with Matthew (also a nice guy) and the best they'll offer is a refund of our delivery fee.  We'd prefer to be offered a full mesquite (which may be a larger box size) since that is what we picked out.  At this point we're $700 into an overall large landscaping plan/budget, we've wasted 2 weeks and a whole day waiting at home without an acceptable resolution.  \n\nI really enjoyed working with Nick, talking with Matt on the phone, and the guys who brought the trees for us to look at were nice as well, but the end of the day we still haven't gotten what we paid for.", "business_id": "pCvl0km6v3Imcpq5UV_-UQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-06-25", "type": "review"}

That was a frustrating experience, but in the end they made it right for us.  They brought over two other full mesquite trees from their Southern Ave location to the Glendale Ave location for us to consider as replacements for the tree we had originally picked out.  They weren't as perfect as the original tree we had picked out, BUT they gave us a discount and got it delivered practically the next day.  We agreed on a tree on Saturday afternoon and it was planted first thing on Monday morning.  We worked with Nick, Matthew and the delivery/planting guy Raymond (I think).  Everyone was very nice.  \n\nFYI, The Southern Ave location is 20 acres vs the Glendale Ave location's 5 acres.  I'll definitely be checking out both stores when we're ready to start buying trees and plants for our back yard soon!\n\nSince we wanted to make sure we got the best tree we could, I comparison shopped at Moon Valley Nursery and I was happy to see that Whitfill definitely has better prices and larger trees for the same box size.  Moon Valley had very pretty looking mesquite trees (nice shape), but they weren't as full and they were significantly ($300-$500) more expensive for the same size (36\" box).

Before I sing their praises in particular, let me just say that in my experience Home Depot has raised the bar on customer service overall as a company over the last few years.  Remember the days of walking in to what felt like a football field of tools, paint, etc., and feeling like there wasn't a customer service rep in sight?  Thank goodness those days at Home Depot are over!  I have experienced this at several locations in the Valley area; everytime I turn a corner or am looking for something, someone is right there ready to assist.  \n\nBack to the service I received at this particular location...if you are looking for information about wood flooring, carpet, etc., and you live anywhere near this area it is worth the drive.  Find Chris or Lisa; they are both incredibly knowledgable, helpful, enjoyable to work with and will do whatever they can to help you make the right decision without being \"pushy\" at all.  I went in simply looking for ideas about what type of flooring I might want in a new home; I left feeling committed to buying whatever I buy when the time is right from Chris and Lisa.\n\nSometimes we forget big huge companies are made up of individual people just like the rest of us who want to do a good job, be recognized for working hard and to enjoy where we work and who we work for.  It was a nice eye-opener to see how a huge American retailer has instilled such loyatly and pride in its team members.", "business_id": "ZjCUvsuV1O_8TgOUfDnTPQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-08-02", "type": "review"}

My husband and i went on this website to purchase our sons high school graduation announcements. Our son has worked very hard to complete his education thus far and being the proud parents that we are we wanted to commemorate this day by sending out announcements. We decided to order from Jostens because it is the schools official company that is used. We went to the website and looked for the classic embossed announcement that i wanted to use. My first impression was that the outside was what I imagined but why didn't it show exactly what was on the inside. I looked at the order form and it had a space where it asked my sons name so i filled it out and figured that this was asked because they were going to print his name it. why would I assume that? BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT ANNOUNCEMENTS ARE FOR! I got my second red flag at the end when i was about to complete my order, it said NO REFUNDS! Now i should have known better because usually company's that have a high request for refunds do this. They have these high request because usually on some level they are scamming the costumer or they are misleading them into buying something they already know they will not be satisfied with. needless to say we received our  announcements and were completely dissatisfied. first of all the cards and envelopes were damaged. all warped and bent out of shape. the envelopes were glued together. then we opened the announcement and did NOT have our sons name anywhere on it. it was basically a cheap, generic invitation to a graduation ceremony. This is not what I ordered. If i wanted invites I would have bought them. I wanted an announcement of his graduation with his name date and the school he is graduating from. I called Jostens to complain and the costumer service rep told me that to print each students name on them it would take a lot of time. I told her that is exactly what we and every other parent thinks they are paying for when we order these things and that I felt like they mislead me and then sold me a generic product that was given to all the the students when i paid good money for an item that should have been customized for my son. She told me that they get this a lot and are currently working on fixing the problem. WHAT?! so you know that what you are selling is not what people want and your still selling it to us. incredible business ethics! of course they did not give me my refund but they did offer to resend new cards with little cards inside that say his name. Thanks a lot. the writing inside is still going to be ridiculous and i no way convey the message I needed. I did learn a valuable lesson though  next time i will go to a local graphic designer and order exactly what I want. that way I will be supporting local business as well as getting my money's worth.", "business_id": "dL0A8XofOhRncXXkKVu0jg", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-06-17", "type": "review"}

At $27,000+ we expected a lot and Jenny led me to believe that she would be there supervising.  That was not the case.  The installers were nice enough but barely spoke English.  They said that Jenny never comes to the jobs.  The planting a were fine except for two $300 plants that were planted in the wrong place and got burned.   They would not replace them.\n\nJenny's brother was supposed to have done work on our barbeque island but instead it was delegated to  the plant installer who doesn't speak english.  The worst offense was that when they modified our Canterra stone counter, they moved a burner over about 12\" farther away from the barbeque.  We thought it had been done properly, but  when we tried to turn on the grill we heard a very loud hissing.  We didn't try to light the grill, but if we  had the would have been a very big explosion because they had neither capped the gas line to the burner, nor connected it to the burner.  They just left the cut line wide open.  If we had tried to light the grill, the volume of gas pouring into the interior of the island (that was supposed to be connected to the burner) would have created a huge explosion.  We had to have a barbeque technician out to do the repair so we have all of this documented.\n\nSince we had our barbeque grill island modified, they had to replace part of the counter top.  It was supposed to have been done by Jenny's brother but instead was done by the plant installers who did a terrible job.  The Canterra stone top was very uneven and they left thinset all over everything including the barbeque grill which should have been removed or at least masked off for the counter installation.  The thin set won't wash off the existing tile and they chipped large pieces off the backsplash and just filled it with large holes with thinset instead of replacing the damaged tiles.\n\nJenny wouldn't return texts, and when her brother came out to see what needed to be done to complete the job, he was argumentative, telling me that the plants got scorched because they were planted too late in the season.  Since they were Yuccas, the plant won't ever replace those burned leaves (they were burned all the way up to five feet high on the plant), so the plant will forever looked wilted and scorched.\n\nOh, and the irrigation was connected to a house water line the was 1/2\" not the to the water supply line from the street with requisite 3/4\" minimum you need to get proper water pressure.  Consequently the heads don't always all pop up, and they were also set so deep that when the ones that do pop up spray, they are below the level of the grass.\n\nTo summarize, after leading me to believe that Jenny would supervise the installation Desert Gardens sent a bunch of unsupervised workers to do the job who didn't speak English.  I believe that over the three week course of installation Jenny showed up maybe two or possibly three times. No one addressed the problems.  No one followed through.  If they had been hands on and had been around to supervise, I believe that the job would have gone better.  They made a lot of mistakes and did some sloppy work.  The plantings turned out well for the most part not withstanding some difficulties where they would not be accountable for their mistakes.  The hard scape work was terrible and I would say, all in all, the fact that they did the job without supervision or follow through created a lot of problems.  I would NOT use them again.", "business_id": "0PMs2OgT2sTIJrQcxienVg", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-08-22", "type": "review"}

You buy one frame & the second is a penny!  I go once a year and buy tons of frames - I love the silver one's and they have some pretty cool contemp styles as well.  I give framed pics out as gifts quite a bit - who needs another tie or a sweater?  Everyone loves a nice pic!\n\nAnd since I go there a lot I know they aren't marking up there prices!  They have a great selection & the people have always been very helpful & nice.  I have also run in there when I need an item to finish up a painting (there paint supplies are a bit pricey) but there frames are great! Don't go during the lunch hour as they share there lot with several popular restaurants!", "business_id": "rDyAYMl4kRnut0mruZctOw", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-07-01", "type": "review"}

They have such an incredible selection, the people are always especially nice, and they have a buy one get one for a penny sale often enough that you can score some serious deals. They have every possible size and shape frame and when there is a sale on or if you have a coupon it's really no more expensive than Michael's or other bigger box stores. Great selection of art/craft supplies and fun stuff for the kids as well. I feel like Aaron Brothers is kind of a sleeper but more people should put it in their rotation.", "business_id": "rDyAYMl4kRnut0mruZctOw", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-07-10", "type": "review"}

There really is no comparison when it comes to cigar shops in the Valley.
