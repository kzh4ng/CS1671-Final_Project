Whether increasing the number of diners at the last minute or providing separate checks, they are flawless. Lots of other restaurants could learn from them. Impressively, even with providing separate checks to such large groups, they chose not to add gratuity (and we obliged with good tips), l managed to deliver food to everyone at the same time, and processed payment of the checks in no time at all.

Their sales are worth planning a shopping trip around.\n\nWhen I followed a plant-based diet, the bulk section was my holy grail. For grains, flours, nuts, and seeds, they have a wide variety of unique products.

I did try a sample of the vanilla porter which was more chocolate and cr\u00e8me than vanilla but I could see it going really well with some cake or brownies after dinner.\n\nHowever, I was here for a late lunch/early dinner so I opted for the turkey sandwich with their mac n' ale cheese side. The sandwich was a lot smaller than I was expecting for the price ($8.50 for a small sandwich and side). The turkey and spinach leaves were really fresh and the roll was lightly toasted and not dry, but the cranberry mayo didn't have a very strong flavour. It would have been better with actual whole cranberry sauce and then mayo separate. The sandwich was good but I was very disappointed with the size. The mac n' cheese was very good and cheesy but it wasn't very noteworthy - it was basically high quality Velveeta cheese a slight beer-esque tang to it, topped with parmigiana. I tried a bit of my friend's parmigiana fries and those were decent but, again, nothing special - just fries with parmigiana on top. \nService was fast (though the place was pretty empty) and friendly. They also had a few different ciders in bottles available which I wasn't expecting (I'm a HUGE cider fan), so that was a nice plus.\n\nMain point: I like going to breweries because they usually incorporate beer into a lot of their dishes. SunUp's beer-battered shrimp (again, what the friend ordered) and ale-infused cheese is an example but where are the beer-battered fries or soft beer bread or other delicacies you can find on Four Peaks' (for example) menu? What do you have on offer to draw in non-beer drinkers to your establishment? I think it's an important question when a brewery decides to also be a restaurant and one I'm not sure SunUp really thought about.\n\nI would come here again to sample more of the beer and for dessert or a Happy Hour-priced appetizer but not for lunch or dinner again.", "business_id": "3UMcsN9IjoeV8JZvC4apag", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-04-09", "type": "review"}

When she returned, she had forgotten to bring a tea for one of our party. Moments later, holding a tray with a cleaning rag on it, she dropped the tray just beside me and splashed both myself, and my friend sitting next to me. I absorbed most of the splatter, in my mouth, left eye, and face. She fortunately was only splashed on her body and hand. Georgina didn't even say anything to us, but picked up the tray and kept going. After a few moments of waiting, I got up and went to the restroom to clean myself off, since I didn't even have a place setting or napkin at the table. On the way back, I stopped and asked to speak with a manager. A young man with curly hair, and square framed glasses was brought to me and didn't give me his name. I told him our situation, and what had happened. I told him I could not only smell, but also taste the cleaning solution that had been on the rag and tray. At first I asked if it was bleach based, and he assured me it wasn't. Then he said he'd talk to our server, and left things at that by turning around to talk to the hostesses. Clearly, I was dismissed. So I returned to the table, disgusted, upset, and smelling of cleaning solution. My appetite was ruined at this point, so I choose not to order anything. Having chemicals splashed into your mouth, even a few droplets, will do that to a person. At this point, our friend STILL hadn't received his iced tea. We flagged down a passing server and asked her if she could bring it for him. She went back, and came out with the wrong tea. Now in this, I say it wasn't really her fault. She wasn't our server, and didn't know what type he had asked for. Correcting that issue was minor. Next up, comes our long wait for our orders to be brought out. Georgina hasn't been back to our table for at least 15 minutes at this point. Another young man stopped and dropped one basket of bread and a small dish with 4 butter pats, to serve a group of 7. Another long wait, and the table next to us, who were seated after us, and ordered after us, gets their meals. At this point, my left eye was feeling irritated, and I went to flush it out in the men's room with water as best I could. When I returned to the table, our orders were just coming out. And my roommates order was wrong. He had ordered the garlic noodles with shrimp, and NO asparagus. And he got asparagus mixed into all his noodles. At this point, he notified the food runner who had brought his dish that it was wrong. The young man said sorry, and then walked away without offering to replace or fix the order. he decided to just pick out the asparagus, and deal with it since he was hungry, and didn't feel like waiting another 30 minutes. At this point, Georgina has appeared at our table 4 times total. While refilling glassing, she is reaching directly in front of my roommates mothers face, my face, and our friend seated on the other side of the booth. No excuse me, no words at all, and STILL no apology from her for the splashing. While my friends ate, I again went to the restroom to flush my eye. I again stopped to speak with the manager from earlier, and asked him for the name of the chemical used for cleaning. He immediately told me that \"I already told you sir that we do not use bleach products here.\" He furthermore told me that he had spoken to our server, and she said she didn't have any cleaning solution or rags with her when she dropped her tray. Outright calling me a liar as I see things. Please take into account, from the beginning I told the manager I didn't want anything, and wasn't asking for free meals, or drinks, or desert etc. I simply wanted the name of the chemicals used, so that I could give that information to a doctor if I felt the need to seek out treatment. He informed me that they didn't use chemicals for cleaning, and then said they used a sanitation solution. I'm sorry, but that would be a chemical. I pointed that out, and told him I was very upset with how this had all been handled. I made it clear again, that I wasn't looking for anything from him, except the name of the chemical. He asked if there was anything he could do to make my evening better, covering my meal or anything. I once more told him that I had chosen NOT to eat, after getting splashed and having that rancid taste of chemicals in my mouth. He then said he would get me the name of the solution used, after my having exhausted every other avenue, and telling him I would be contacting the corporate office. At this point, I told him I was done with the conversation, and wanted nothing more to do with him, as he clearly didn't care about the situation. The rest of our evening was spent with little service from Georgina. She had come and taken a desert order from our group while I was speaking with the manager, without even asking if I had wanted anything. Granted, I didn't. She didn't speak a word to me the entire time after the first complaint, and treated", "business_id": "2r8jGeuYvMkyP2ik_X-Bxw", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-05-03", "type": "review"}

So ordering was like pulling teeth.

He also used the wrong bread for each of our sandwiches, forgot the spread that was supposed to be on it, and forgot the veggies. It really just looked like WAY too much meat on bread. Anyway, we brought the sandwiches back in to the other guy that was working and he said he'd remake them.

There weren't nearly enough crackers or toasts or whatever you want to describe them as for the amount of salmon. The \"dressing\" on the greens was almost nonexistent even though it had a pretty good flavor. The salmon and capers were good, but I've had better.\nThe pancakes were just overpriced. I don't think I should have to add in an extra 2 dollars or whatever it was for blueberries. The TINY amount of syrup they give you is ample enough for one pancake, not three. \nAnd the quesadilla? I just don't get their \"homefries\" or \"potatoes\" or whatever they call them. It's more like an onion casserole. They shove them inside the quesadilla, which is filled with eggs and chicken and salsa. It's HUGE. I would split this if I go again.\nThe coffee is SUPERB, though. Great flavor. Rich, robust and not bitter. \nParking is ample - there are a lot of places to park around the neighborhood, and the revitalization efforts of this \"historic\" neighborhood are noticeable. \nThe little market where they sell things isn't anything great. You can go to the farmer's market on Power Rd. and get better prices. And AJs has most everything else at comparable prices. (Yes, AJs prices are comparable to Liberty Markets). I do like the idea though. If they could procure items that were \"hard to find\" then this concept would play out nicely. \nMy overall observation, however, is definitely the flow of the service lines. ?? I really wish there was some other way to herd the cats...without making it awkward and anxiety ridden. \nThe decor is awesome though. It's a great concept - and I was actually a purveyor of the original Liberty Market, so I enjoy the Owner's commitment to keep the integrity of the building. And I love the bathroom idea.", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-03-28", "type": "review"}

Liberty Market has flabbergasted me. What a place. It is so unassuming from the street, almost leaving you wondering if you're in the right place, but then you walk through those doors and feel like you've been transported to some magical dream world. Here's a word of warning, I will be gushing until the end of this review. \n      I asked my dear Kristen to find us a new restaurant last night for dinner, and she, through a very unorthodox way, found us Liberty Market. I asked her if she was sure it was a restaurant and not a market, she said yes, and we were off. While driving over to Gilbert she let me know that the owner of Liberty Market was also the owner of Joe's BBQ and Joe's Farm Grill, this excited me to no end because those two places are wonders themselves, masterfully put together and designed, if I may say so myself, and Liberty Market is no different. \n      Sitting next to a fun water park of sorts (a great place for photography), it is set in beautiful downtown Gilbert, and right when we walked in the door we were greeted by every employee under the sun, it seemed even the chefs ran out from the kitchen to say hello. Now, this was not because it was slow, there were quite a few people there, not quite busy, but hopping for sure, they simply are awesome employees. The atmosphere here is incredible and the interior has a wonderful modern design, there is even a \"market\" where you can purchase various drinks and old timey trinkets. The salad and bread chefs conversed with us and explained how the market worked, so we sat ourselves down, looked over a menu, and picked our delights for the night. \n      Kristen stuck with tea, while I had an Anchor Brewing \"Liberty Ale\" as we began our meal sharing the starter pizza, a delicious, light, grilled flat bread with olive oil, pecorino romano, rosemary and hummus to dip it in. We were already hooked with just the starter. The bread was so good, warm and airy, the cheese had a perfect bite and the hummus was a perfect topper, nothing too heavy and nothing too lite, simply a delicious starter, leaving us ready for the next tasty morsel. I ordered the flatiron steak with chimichurri sauce, garlic smashed potatoes, and fresh from the ground grilled vegetables. The steak... oh boy, the steak... it was so flavorful, cooked perfectly, not tough at all, I'm having a hard time finding words to describe the deliciousness, it was just so good. The chimichurri sauce added a wonderful dimension, it was light but flavorful, never overpowering. I thought the potatoes were awesome, a great blend of big delicious fresh chunks of potato and small hunks of garlic, and the vegetables (carrots and asparagus) had a wonderful grilled taste that brought out their natural goodness. A truly special and wonderful dish. Kristen ordered the liberty bowl with pasta (essentially spaghetti and meatballs) and loved it. The meatballs were big and filling, wonderfully seasoned and cooked. The marinara sauce was done really well, tangy and rich with an intoxicating aroma and the noodles were tender yet had a good bite to them. I am by no means a pasta man, and I thought it was terrific. With every bite, we each were just overwhelmed with our plates. The food at Liberty Market seems to have been very well planned out with careful seasoning and incredible ingredients. \n      We will be back to Liberty Market, many many times. You simply have to try it, you will see what I mean, see why it's so special. Also, don't leave without visiting the restrooms, all of them, peek inside each one. I love cool restaurant bathrooms, and these are some of the best.", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-05-18", "type": "review"}
