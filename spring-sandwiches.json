Well, faithful followers, I must now admit that The Dor-Stop has now been verified as only one of the best.  Why?  That's because Gab and Eat I have now found to be THE best breakfast I've ever had.  If it was closer to my home I would quickly become a regular.\n\nI easily decided to order the Mixed Grill (Half).  Before I go on, I must ask...has anyone seen a full order?  Because I honestly can't imagine how much food that is.  I created my own with bacon, cheese, eggs and potatoes.  Based on reviews I also opted to get a side of the sausage and was pleased as punch when our waitress asked if I wanted hot or sweet....or one of each.  I like variety, so I jumped on the change to try both.  I also selected the Italian toast - what other kind is there, really?  \n\nWhen my food arrived, it looked delicious.  There was so much bacon that after eating half of my Mixed Grill it looked like I'd barely started.  The sausage was great, just don't ask me which one I liked best.  My toast?  4 thick slices that looked to be about half the loaf and were buttered on both sides. It was a struggle, but I was determined to enjoy every tasty morsel and not leave a crumb.   \n\nIn case anyone is wondering, yes, they use real butter.  I saw pounds of it stacked in the kitchen with my own two eyes.  The wait staff was quick and efficient as well as helpful and friendly with our larger group of 9 people.  The fact that none of the plates match and I noticed a sign at the front register that said, \"We need mugs\" just makes me love this place even more.\n\nA few tips: 1.) Order the Mixed Grill.  2.) Cash only!  3.) Gab and Eat is a popular place but also very small and narrow (or cozy if you will).  I recommend going during the week when they are still busy but can accomodate a group.  That way you won't feel rushed or crowded.  4.) Get to Gab and Eat ASAP!  You'll be glad you did!", "business_id": "b9WZJp5L1RZr4F1nxclOoQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-04-07", "type": "review"}

We have to agree with most other reviewers that this is a place to eat.\nWe arrived around noon on Saturday and were happy there were a couple open tables. The place is tucked at the end of a strip mall and you have to look to find it. There is plenty of parking.\nInside the decor is quaint and funky at the same time. Country style decorations and signs are mixed with nostalgia signs & posters. Most interesting are all the signatures and comments written on the wall by past customers. We regretted not having a marker to add ours. The other highlight was three large white boards with trivia questions - fun way to spend time waiting for food.\nThe waitstaff there is...uh, experienced. They are attentive, pleasant and efficient.\nAfter reading reviews I had to try the Mixed Grill. But S went with pancakes with a side of bacon. The pancakes were outstanding...maybe the best either of us has eaten. They were thick but with light texture and rich flavor. \nHis bacon was cooked just as requested - as crisp as possible - and very flavorful.\nThe Mixed Grill is a mixed together concoction of eggs, potatoes, onions, peppers, cheese, and spicy Italian sausage grilled together. I'm glad I heeded those who stressed going with the half size order. It filled a full sized dinner plate with a heaping order. I couldn't finish it all and that's rare. How do they serve the whole potion -- in a trough?\nEverything was cooked well. The sausage added a nice bite to offset the somewhat plain potatoes. You can build your own mix but the basic was a good mix.\nMy only complaint was the amount of potato and that they are pretty plain. I like home fries with lots of seasoning that have aged on the grill. These potatoes were pretty uniform chunks with little seasoning. Personal preference.\nIt usually comes with Italian toast but they were out so I went with raisin. It was delicious soft inch thick slices.\nCoffee was excellent and the cup stayed full. The total was less than $15. Fabulous value for the quality and portions.\nWhile I can't say it's the best breakfast in Pittsburgh (only here 3 days), its the best so far and one of the best we've had.", "business_id": "b9WZJp5L1RZr4F1nxclOoQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-04-13", "type": "review"}

The menu is very basic- no specialty pancakes, waffles, or french toast and only 1 specialty omelette. There were no meal options, so if you want home fries or something, it's extra. The omelettes do include toast. (Great bread, btw!) We had to wait a while for our food, which was surprising because we've been to a lot of diners. My husband and I both got omelettes and agreed that the contents were not really cooked with the egg. It's almost like the egg was completely cooked and someone threw the cooked contents in there and just folded it over. As for my mushroom and cheese omelette, the cheese was lacking. My biggest peev about this place is that it's CASH ONLY. Perhaps I missed it, but I'm pretty sure this wasn't noted anywhere on the menu or the front door.

My wife and I stopped in this past week, and for me, I was reminded of why I enjoy Atria's...but this having been our first time at Atria's together, and witnessing my wife's experience, I realized why the place could garner such low reviews.\n\nFor someone like myself, who's actually had enough positive and negative food experiences at Atria's to know exactly what to order and what to steer clear of, I can make the experience a positive one, but that's a situation I'm afforded now thanks to my previous patience and convenience. My wife, opting to stray from my suggestions had an awful dinner. Her plate of bland fish and asparagus left her turned off completely. Luckily, we were using a gift card, so it wasn't as frustrating for her as it could've been. Regardless, walking away from an entire plate of food is disheartening.\n\nThat led me to realize this: If you're only at Atria's once, you're odds aren't that great of having a good experience. That's just the reality of the situation. There are a handful of really good things on the menu that I LOVE. The parmesan crusted chicken is really good, although it can sometimes be a little too oily. The pot roast is excellent, but it's way too heavy for most of the year...ESPECIALLY during baseball season when they're busier. Their chili is really on-point...especially paired with their bread, and the salmon salad is excellent. Although, I don't like the salmon, so I swap the salmon for chicken for a great salad option. The carrot cake is insanely good, but truth be told, it's not homemade. I could care less, though, as it's still some of the best carrot cake I've ever eaten. Period. Other notable items are the pot roast nachos, crab cakes, red skin smashed potatoes, and the reuben.\n\nThat's really where the positives end, though. I've learned to steer clear of the burgers because of the inconsistency with which they're prepared. I've received more undercooked burgers at Atria's than any other restaurant, and it's just not worth the gamble anymore. My filets have always been perfectly-prepared, but the one time I got a strip it was practically burned on one side and undercooked on the other. Failing to cook burgers and steaks correctly isn't that surprising, but deciding to serve them to customers despite their incorrect preparation IS surprising...and poor.\n\nI know that the last time I had salmon on my salad, the fish tasted \"off\" and I paid the price for it later. I've never given a single fish meal a chance there since (we're talking years now). Hence, my request for chicken on my salads now. Most of the meals that I've had are average, and I've practically tried the entirety of the menu over the years, so believe me when I say it.\n\nWhy do I continue to go? Well, because the few items that I do love, are crave-worthy, and having become a regular (less so, nowadays), the service that I received at the bar was always excellent. Daniel and Roy have always provided  great service to me, and good service goes the distance, as far I'm concerned, so it's been worth stopping in from time-to-time. Unfortunately, if I can't sit at the bar, I don't always stick around, as the service at the tables is really hit-or-miss. For every good server they have, they have two more that could care less about their jobs...especially during peak times.\n\nRegardless, this is my favorite Atria's location, because it's the least \"stuffy\" and pretentious location of them all, but there's still a lot of room to improve...and I hope it does.", "business_id": "Z101WZaISochG6g7tI2ZVw", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-03-26", "type": "review"}

I visited this restaurant with a large group of about 40 people before going to a show at the New Hazlett Theater. We were seated upstairs and ate a buffet-style dinner (the dishes had already been picked). The two waiters who took care of us were extremely friendly and efficient, and they made sure we would leave in time for our show. While we waited for the food to come out, they served us drinks, but the waiter stopped offering straws after the first couple tables.\n\nWhen the food came out, they let a few tables help themselves at a time. They provided us with three different types of plates (large square ones, rectangular ones, and small circular ones), which I found odd. We had three entrees in the buffet line: Chicken Marsala, Tomato Vodka pasta, and Parmesan Crusted Tilapia.\n\nChicken Marsala: flavorful, tender chicken served with mashed potatoes. I really enjoyed the potatoes because they had a distinct potato flavor, unlike most butter-heavy ones. However, I wish they were more generous with the tomatoes and mushrooms in the dish. There was no vegetable-based dish in our entire meal, and I missed them.\n\nTomato Vodka pasta: penne cooked with just a little bite left in a yummy tomato sauce with a couple leaves of spinach here and there. Again, I wished there was a lot more spinach in the dish. Also, the pasta was a little sauce-heavy.\n\nParmesan Crusted Tilapia: the fish was crispy and delicious, the angelhair pasta was cooked perfectly, and the tomato sauce was good. I grabbed some pasta near the edge that hadn't been touched by sauce, so I liked the amount. No vegetables, though.\n\nAfterwards, they brought out a tray of bite-size desserts for us. I don't see any of them on their menu, so I'm not sure how the organization ordered them. Both the cheesecake flavors I tried (raspberry and almond) were delicious--the cheesecake was really light and airy, and the flavors really came through without being overly sweet or overpowering. They also had strawberry halves and chocolate chip cookies, which were soft and cakey--not the best I've ever had, but pretty good. Also, there were these little squares that, as far as I could tell, were squares of iced cake covered in chocolate. These were way too sweet for my taste. Mine looked like chocolate everything, but there were also white-chocolate covered squares, and other squares with different colors inside (different flavors of icing, perhaps?).\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the food, but I'd like to try a greater variety before giving four full stars (and see if there are any vegetable-heavy ones). However, this restaurant is a little too expensive for me to return any time soon. The service was great.", "business_id": "Z101WZaISochG6g7tI2ZVw", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-03-22", "type": "review"}

It kind of has an old diner feeling to it and I liked that. \n\nAlas, that's all I liked.\n\nSo, why such a low score? Well:\n\nThe service was terrible. After spending twenty minutes sitting without anyone coming to refill my water or ask for my actual order - note, the place was almost completely empty - I went to the register to ask for something to eat, which I'd started to think I had to do after watching a couple people do the same (in hindsight, I probably misinterpreted their actions, but my mistake does not excuse what happened next). My waiter looked at me and went, \"Don't you get the concept of a restaurant? Haven't you been to any restaurants, like, ever? Sit back down and I'll take your order.\" \n\nAnd not even in a joking manner that made me feel like I could smile about my mistake - this guy was being a condescending, rude, arrogant person. It was unbelievable. Utterly, totally unbelievable. If I hadn't met company there that night, I would have walked out right then.\n\nTo make matters worse, this was not a good night to order anything at Primanti's. The coleslaw was way too sweet and there was far too much of it, the fries were bland and had no texture at all, and there was barely any meat on my sandwich at all. The result? A big pile of carbs that really didn't taste great after the first few bites, rather than a delicious sandwich.\n\nBefore you all kill me, please note: I LIKED my meal at Mt. Lebanon's Primanti location. They also have a more diverse menu, which is always a bonus for me - I like having more options. I think in the future, I will stick to that location in this local chain, where even on a busy night I managed to get food in a decent amount of time. I certainly will not be coming to the downtown location if I spot my previous, downright awful waiter working there again.", "business_id": "NeUf9FyCCIN4MEseNyqkXQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-03-04", "type": "review"}

I got the Colossal Fish and Cheese sandwich.  The beer batter fish was a very large piece and by itself was not bad tasting at all (just a little under seasoned.)  The fries were limp and had no seasoning what so ever. The fries were the worse part of the sandwich.  The coleslaw was  very mild, sweet and vinegar base, and by itself it was ok, but put everything together between two slices of white bread and it made for a bland pile of flavorless starch.  The bread was also too soft and did not hold up well at all, and the cheese was nonexistent.  I ended up having to add a ton of salt, pepper and malt vinegar to my sandwich, picked it apart and ate the pieces with my fingers.\n\nPrice:  For the size of the portions you get, the price is great!  I got two sandwiches and a soda for about $16.  Their sandwiches range from around $6 - $8 each, and are a good value since you will definitely leave full (I took home left overs.)\n\nAtmosphere:  After reading a few reviews about the restaurant, I was pleasantly surprised to see that this place was not packed with tourist.  For being such a small dinner, the place was fairly empty so I was able to sit anywhere I liked (being a solo traveler, restaurants often try to stick me at the bar but I prefer to sit at a table.)  The tables were clean and organized well, and each table had a stack of paper menus to look at.  It felt like a comfy, good ol' local dinner where you can casually relax and eat.\n\nStaff:  During my visit, the staff was great!  There was only one waitress and one cook, but both were pleasant and greeted me as soon as I walked in.  The waitress was attentive and friendly.  The cook also thanked me for patronizing there while I was leaving.\n\nOver all, I basically came here just to say that I visited a famous Pittsburgh restaurant, but I most likely will not go there again.  If I was with friends or family who wanted to go to Primanti's I would go along, but I wouldn't go solo.  The blandness of the food is what kills it for me.  I would rather get a sandwich that is half the size with more flavor, then a huge pile of bland food.", "business_id": "NeUf9FyCCIN4MEseNyqkXQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-03-07", "type": "review"}

It was the absolute worst salad I've ever had, how can you screw up a salad? The chicken was tasteless and rubbery. Got it to go and the girl who took the order over the phone was rude and rushed and was equally rude when I picked it up. She assumed she knew my name and my order and handed me a random bag of food. I told her I was missing a sandwich and she tossed another bag at me without saying a word. I will NEVER go back to any of these locations. I'd rather eat a ham sandwich from Sheetz.

Thank goodness for cell phones, we were able to change our theater tickets to the following weekend, and had our van driver turn around and get us the hell out of the mess. \n\nBut now that we had the day planned and thwarted by the city that can't think fully, what were we going to do?  We asked the driver to drop us off in Bloomfield, and we would have lunch there...but where?  Tessaro's was OUT (see my review for Tessaro's) and so many things had come and gone since I've been to Bloomfield that we weren't sure what would be there.  Pleasure Bar was out, after redneck hillbillies with guns started bashing 'fags', and Pleasure Bar didn't seem too concerned about it. \n\nAHA!  I've heard so much about it, and never actually went in and tried it...so voila, the plan was hatched...Armand's for a fish sandwich!\n\nI had just thought about a 'fish fry' type sandwich the night before, knowing that St. Raphael's down the street was holding their Lent fish fry...but I have a problem handing money over to a Catholic fundraiser anything, and frankly, their spaghetti dinner for a army officer's fundraiser was a little on the Chef-Boy-Ar-Dee side.\n\nWalking into Armand's was a little bit of a shock.  I did NOT expect it to be an absolute dive bar, and at 1:30 in the afternoon, it was pretty much full of dive bar regulars.  My second surprise was that they also allowed smoking, which I am not for or against, being a smoker, but the air was a deep stale rank dive bar smoke filled atmosphere.  \n\nWe started to sit in the bar area, and then I noticed some Burger King type booths in a back room, and asked the bar tender how we ordered the fish? He directed us to the back room, and said that we'd have to order there.\n\nWe made our way to the back room, and there we found a little ordering window, with a minimal menu.  Fish sandwiches, large and small, shrimp baskets, large and small, burger, a few toppings that were extra (cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles) and a few sides (fries, zucchini planks, cheese sticks, cole slaw, etc.) and that was about it.  Sodas were $1, and came from a machine in the room.\n\nWe ordered one large, and one small fish sandwich, fries, and zucchini planks, and I bought two cans of soda from the machine.  We did have to wait a little while for the food, but we learned why, and it was absolutely fine.  \n\nA woman from the bar came back and asked if the lady in the kitchen had 'forgotten' her fish.  The lady responded \"No, I didn't forget it, I have a bunch of orders, and I have to cut it, bread it, clean the grease, and cook it!  I'll bring it out to you as soon as it's done!\"\n\nThis one woman was doing it ALL, and she was doing it from scratch.  When she got the other woman's fish on a plate and started walking it out, she paused by our table and said that she'd have ours in just a minute.  She then explained the woman asking if she'd forgotten again, and the whole process, and said \"She ain't at McDonald's!  This is the best fish sandwich in town for a reason!  People can be a real F$%king pain in my A$$!\"  \n\nAnd I thought - atta girl - I'm at home!  This is going to be great!\n\nShe brought out our plates.  Ilene's 'small' was rather large, and my large was basically the same 'size' but with a double helping of fish. The fries were decent, and the zucchini really looked like she had taken one medium sized zucchini, rammed it through a slicer lengthwise, battered it, and fried it up. They were HUGE strips, all from the same zucchini.  \n\nThe food was good.  I'm not going to say 'best' fish sandwich. But it was huge, tasty, and the sides were good.  I will say that Frankie's fish sandwich at Cattivo is more complete, and a little more flavorful, but not nearly as big...and it's pretty big.  So so far, Cattivo still wins, but Armand's comes in second.  Both places are bars, and both allow smoking, but Cattivo is bigger and airier (which can dissipate the smoke concentration), and sandwich has a bit more 'flair' to make it tastier.  \n\nPrices at Armand's are average. $8 something for the small and $10 something for the large, but all toppings are ala carte.\n\nDon't dismiss the sandwich though for the dive bar atmosphere.  It IS a sought after years old tradition - and apparently consistent.  If you're hankering for a good jumbo sized fish sandwich, no frills, like the corner dive bar used to serve up all over town - well kids, this one still does it the way it's supposed to be done.

At the register, I went with the eponymous Chicago Dog of course. But I knew that one hot dog wouldn't fill me up, so I had a Carolina Dog to go with it. And a Diet Coke, to cancel out all those bad calories.\n\nThe Chicago Dog was made almost perfectly traditionally. An all-beef hot dog on a poppy seed bun, topped with sport peppers (a little too hot for my taste, I took one bite and had to put them to the side), tomato wedges, chopped onions, yellow mustard, celery salt and that green relish that practically glowed in the dark. The only ding is that the pickle was a slice (lengthwise) rather than a spear. It doesn't matter to me personally, but a Chicago Dog connoisseur might be upset. Whatever, it tasted AWESOME.\n\nThe Carolina Dog was ON THE MONEY. Also an all-beef hot dog, it was topped chili, mustard, chopped onion, and cole slaw. Messy as all get out, but I was prepared and didn't wear any of it home.\n\nAfter seeing the mentions of the fries, I skipped 'em. Free refills on the soda.

My club had bacon pieces instead of strips and the bread was kind of stale.  But there was plenty of meat and the potato salad side was good.\n\nMy second visit for ultimate nachos was A-OK.  Chips were as good as bagged chips get, smothered with cheese and chili, it made for a decent snack before grocery shopping (don't grocery shop hangry!).\n\nAt the start of summer 2014, they had some new tea and lemonade concoctions.  I decided to try the strawberry lemonade - which is McAlister's lemonade with strawberry syrup and topped with fresh strawberries.  It was quite refreshing and good.  They also have a mixed berry and a watermelon lemonade.  I shall return to try those.  \n\nThe staff was pleasant on both of my visits (especially the second on 5/30, late afternoon, there was a brunette gentleman working that was a delight, in case anyone from McAlister's reads this).

Tucked in a strip mall among Burger King and Papa John's, Jumpin' Java is a jewel in the Fort Mill culinary crown. Or maybe it is just a culinary tiara, because there aren't enough decent restaurants in Fort Mill to justify a crown.

The pasta salad is a unique side, and the croissants are the freshest I have found in the area. \n\nYears ago, they were open for dinner and offered tapas and flights of wine. I was wildly disappointed when they abbreviated their hours to breakfast and lunch only. Their drive-thru option for coffee and call-ahead food orders almost makes up for the lack of dinner hours, though. I can't tell you how fabulous it is to call ahead, order my Warm Goat Cheese Salad, and pay for and receive it from the window without having to unload the kids from the car, take them inside, wait for the order, and then take them back out and get them loaded again. \n\nA word of warning, though. This is not fast food. Though I find the atmosphere welcoming to children with a kid's menu and high chairs, there have been times when I have waited for food for longer than I would have liked or felt necessary.  Since it is difficult to surmise when those times might be, I would not suggest dining there if your children are unable to entertain themselves at a table or if you are in a hurry.

That's all well and good, but the guy kept bumping stuff into us (the bar stools don't have backs)... he was like a bull in a china shop.\n\n+ Batter on the cod was delicious, if not quite salty. Violet L is a salt fan, and she even commented that it was overly salty\n- The cod itself was dry, slightly chewy, and meh. My fisherman friend said it was \"jerky-like.\" He was, however, quite impressed (as were all of us) by how well the batter clung to the cod. The two components were very well bonded.\n- I thought the batter had a taste similar to KFC's original coating - salty with a bit of pepper. I suspect that those who truly enjoy this fish fry are mostly in love with the batter.\n\nI didn't try the slaw; the roll was your typical cafeteria-style white bread roll.\n\n+ Inexpensive; four of the 3-piece cod dinners with a round of drinks was $34.\n\nI'm not sure why Madison Fish Fry likes this place so much. Perhaps we got a bad round of cod, along with bad service. Fish that sits after being cooked never bodes well... and while I believe in second chances, the overall experience left me quite sour, so it may be difficult to return in a timely manner.", "business_id": "zAsxPh3h9xMQnSDGl41kSg", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-05-05", "type": "review"}

A friend suggested I ask for hummus inside the pita (strange I know) but that really does the trick in terms of having a \"good\" pita there and if only they could improve their service speed so you don't have to wait 20 minutes each time they would get a 4. I almost gave them 4 this time around because a manager approached us as we were having dinner and of course noticed that we had to get up twice to ask if our order was almost ready.

They accommodated to my party's needs (chicken and pita bread on sides for vegetarians/gluten free folks). I had the chicken kabob lunch and it was so good!

Help-yourself complimentary coffee and tea counter, with shakers of Splenda available to those inclined to use them- nice touches!

I decided we'd try the Friday fish special of grilled tilapia over salad and a gyro pita with a side salad, extra feta.  I did not enjoy eating the tilapia as it would magically crumble into tiny pieces the moment I cut it with a fork or a knife.  Very annoying!  Besides this, the whole dish tasted very bland since I opted to forgo the housemade vinaigrette (contained allergens); Thankfully, the extra feta (LOVE feta!) salvaged the dish and I was able to down the fish even without the use of a spoon, of which I was constantly wishing would be on hand.  The gyro pita was a much tastier experience, although Mom did not like the meat.  Truth be told, this could not compare with the meat in the gyro dinner I just had a few nights before at MBFGR, but for the price (around $6), it made for a quick and satisfying lunch (and the extra feta in the pita didn't hurt, either)!  While the gyro is not made in-house, AE does have it shipped in three times a week from Chicago, so I was told by the man behind the counter.\n\nBaklava looked awesome, but I couldn't try it since it contained an allergen, but no worries since any item offered here would be fulfiiling enough!", "business_id": "odhXwWaYZvD_icIN6f_DbA", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-04-07", "type": "review"}

I had the 'Veggie Jackson' wrap - no onions or rice, add tofu with a side of fresh fruit. My friend had the 'Very Brady Clubster' with a side of fruit as well.

The veggies in my sandwich were grilled to perfection and the combination of flavors from the feta and balsamic salsa blended just right.  I felt like each bite was a party in my mouth.  Sounds cheesy, but I swear, it's true!  Serving size was perfect and so was the price!

Finding this unique sandwich shop, which is in a house that has been transformed into a restaurant, is indeed a welcome find. The real estate is limited, so parking is compact and circles around the back of the building.\n\nThe dining area is mainly indoors, but there is also a small patio facing the back portion of the parking lot, which is not very scenic. Inside there is art on the wall that can be purchased.\n\nThey serve wraps, bowls and salads. The food has been pretty good, although it did not knock my socks off. I ordered the Baja Bowl, which is described on their online menu as \"Southwestern chicken atop garlic rice, black beans, Monterey jack cheese and topped with lime sour cream and pico de gallo.\" It was OK, but the chicken was dry and cut in fairly large chunks. It could have possibly been microwaved -- not sure, but there were no southwest flavors to speak of. I have done a better job of cooking chicken on my George Foreman grill at home. Perhaps the garlic rice would have helped with the flavor, but I had substituted the rice with organic brown rice which did little to add flavor. Sour cream was not \"lime\". There was a small slice of lime served on the edge of the bowl. I would not bother ordering this again -- especially if I have a craving for some southwest food.\n\nOn another recent visit I ordered a wrap called \"Prince of Thai's - Spicy peanut chicken with baby spinach, garlic rice, fresh ginger slaw, cucumber pico and red onion wrapped in a spinach tortilla.\" That had better flavor than the baja bowl. Vegetable ingredients were fresh and good. Again, I was not very impressed with the chicken chunks.\n\nOne thing I think That's A Wrap needs to address is the use of styrafoam cups. Afterall their slogan is \"Healthy Food for a Hungry Planet\" and they have a link for a new restaurant \"Green\" for Vegan food on their website. For such an artsy, earthy place, I would have thought That's A Wrap would have made more conscious, earth-friendly choices.

Inside was very different from the outside perception.  It is a huge space with a lot of dining tables and is very clean minus a few uncleared tables.  We each ordered two big slices - him sausage and me pepperoni, green pepper, and pineapple.  Yum!  It was cooked to order (although a tiny bit burnt) and nice and hot.  You won't find pizza that has sat under the lamps for hours on end.  There are a variety of condiments (red pepper flakes, parmesean, etc.) and they also have a few desserts.  I haven't ventured to the sub side yet - maybe next time.  What's even better?  My two custom pie slices rang in at just under $7.

I ended up getting a large Pepperoni with black olives, and a chopped antipasto salad. It turned out the be a great choice. The pizza was great. New York style, etc. The best aspect was probably the salad. Really great. The waitress was attentive, but not of the highest quality. It was a fun atmosphere and I'd definitely go back soon.

Love, love, love their chewy crust, excellent sauce, and high-quality ingredients!

Even from down the road you can smell the aroma of garlic and freshly baked pizza and I lamented the fact that there was nothing on the menu that was within my diet. Fast forward 5 years and they now have a gluten free pizza menu as well as several appetizers available for those with Celiac of gluten sensitivity.\n\nFor starters, they offer a gluten free version of bruschetta as well as a spinach and artichoke dip that will nearly have you licking the plate. The spin-dip was by far my favorite, boasting just enough vegetables to make you think you're eating health food, but with a hearty helping of cheese to remind you that you're actually indulging. We also ordered up a batch of their gluten free honey BBQ wings and my 3 year old couldn't get enough of those, shrieking excitedly every time she licked the sweet sauce. Be sure to specify when you order wings that you need them prepared gluten free; they have a separate preparation process for gluten free wings to help reduce any possibility of cross contamination.\n\nLet's talk pizza: I've been eating a lot of it the last few years since more and more restaurants are now serving it. My main concern with many pizza places that sell gluten free is that they serve the crust, but don't know squat about proper preparation techniques. Jimmy, the General Manager at the Camelback and 3rd St. location, gave me a tour of the kitchen on my recent visit. He showed me their gluten free preparation area, the separate tray and utensil storage area, and their cooler to show me that they follow recommended techniques to reduce the risk of cross contamination. Additionally, they use separate ingredients, racks, plates, gloves, and utensils to do their best to serve the Celiac and gluten free community. All locations have been trained on safe handling methods by Lynn Rae Ries of Gluten Free Creations, who also supplies their gluten free products.\n\nWe ordered 2 pizzas, both were 10 inch \"personal\" pizzas, but you could easily split one with a friend if you started with an appetizer. All ingredients tasted very fresh and the crust had a great texture, which is one of the hardest things to get right in the gluten free world. I personally like a combo of black olives, salami, and spinach, which won't break the bank at around $15. My husband opted for a garlic chicken, peppers, and mushroom pizza, which was tasty as well. They will even deliver and offer catering of their gluten free items for the big game or an office party.\n\nThe atmosphere reminds me a lot of a pizza place in Boston my mom used to take me - the kind of place that you would go celebrate winning a soccer match with your team, go on a casual first date, or take the family out for Sunday lunch. After dark, the lights go down and the candles come out while their patio lights up with fairy lights.\n\nThe only thing I could suggest for Streets of New York is to add some gluten free offerings to the dessert menu (I'm a sucker for chocolate) and to add a gluten free beer or cider option to the drink menu. Overall, it was a great dining experience and I'm sure that my family will be back soon!\n\nCheck out my gluten free blog too: www.GlutenFreeAZ.com", "business_id": "JN2qXIuDXnV2d8WnSqd28A", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-03-18", "type": "review"}

I expected to bite into my sandwich and be wowed. While I really enjoyed the mozzarella and soppressata sandwiches we split and certainly found them both more enjoyable than many sandwiches I have had in the Phoenix area, I just don't think this place is deserving of the Salvation Army of fans that seems to be willing to fight a holy war for that mozzarella sandwich. \n\nIn my eyes, what makes Pane Bianco's sandwiches good (and still worthy of 3 stars) is the fact that they are simple. Unlike some yuppy establishments where Arcadia ladies \"lunch\" (think Wildflower, Acacia Cafe or Chelsea's Kitchen), Pane Bianco (and by the transitive property, Chris Bianco) clearly has the European sensibility of \"less is more.\" A sandwich doesn't need to be piled high with garlic aioli, carmelized onions, and herb goat cheese to be good. If the ingredients are high enough quality, the bread and a few fillings should be able to stand alone and make for a great sandwich. \n\nI guess that's where my problem with Pane Bianco comes in. The individual ingredients of the sandwiches just weren't that great. Certainly, the mozzarella is good but I have had better mozzarella from nice local grocery stores and of course, at countless Italian places. I also agree with Kristin S that the soppressata was overly salty, which obscured the flavor. Finally, I didn't think the bread was as delicious as I had pictured it would be many times before actually coming. It certainly tasted fresh but I thought it could have a bit more flavor complexity (as it was, it tasted very white-bread and didn't have the slightly sour kick that housmade bread often does. \n\nI've got to be honest that after trying Pane Bianco, I am convinced that I would be a bit disappointed if I waited in line to eat at PIzzeria Bianco. While I can definitely appreciate a simple but delicious Pizza Margherita in a world where buffalo chicken pizza is somehow an appealing dish, the individual pizza ingredients would have to be better than the ones at Pane Bianco for me to truly feel like the wait was worth it.", "business_id": "-AAig9FG0s8gYE4f8GfowQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-03-03", "type": "review"}

At the same time, the foccacia at Bianco has enough heft to keep from getting soggy if you save the sandwiches for later.

The mozzarella, tomato, and basil sandwich was delicious as well.  \n\nThe sandwiches were so good that we stopped back here on our last day in Phoenix to get some take-out for our plane ride home.

The tuna, made with red onion, lemon and olives, is topped with wild arugula, which provides a bitter bite and counters the fishiness. My suggestion - go with a friend and order one of each.

In my mind my first thought was \"okay, maybe a place like this doesn't do substitutions\", which I understood. She told me that they won't put the peppers on the tuna because it wouldn't work with the sandwich. I was shocked... so I asked her nicely to please ask someone if they could do it. After waiting around for awhile, I went to pay for my meal. As my sandwich was being wrapped, she said yes they could do it, but for some large fee (I believe 2.50 or 3 dollars, remind you this is an 8 dollar sandwich). By this time I was pretty worn out of the whole experience of Pane Bianco that I just said no thanks and went to eat my sandwich.

I went to pizzeria bianco this past week and bar bianco, so when we headed out to try Lux this morning, I figured, why not wait around and try Pane Bianco too. So that's what the BF and I did. Right when the restaurant opened I went in intending to only order one sandwich for the BF and I to share, but once inside, I saw they had a special focaccia and decided to get that too so we could have a more broad idea of what the food is like at this place. Both the sandwich and focaccia had mozz, basil, and tomato. So I went up and ordered and the man taking the orders was less than super friendly, but I can understand that for a place trying to be fast that is also super busy. Then I stepped to the side to pay with some other guy, who was actually pretty nice. After that, you have to sit around and wait for your food.... this is kind of awkward because the space is very small and warm and there are products all around so no matter where I stood I felt like I was in someone's way. Finally, they called my name and I got a little paper bag with my food in it and went to sit outside. The BF and I started by splitting the sandwich. Ok, so the sandwich was alright, I liked how the ingredients tasted fresh and the bread was very good, but it really could use something to make it a little more interesting. If they were to drizzle a little bit of aged balsamic on the sandwich, it would be delicious and I would want to come back for it all the time. As is.... I thought it was a little boring and would be kind of easy to make at home, so why would I come here for it? So after we finished that, we moved on to the focaccia. \n\nNow this was a different story. The focaccia was really good. It's like a corner slice of a square pizza almost. It had the same ingredients as the sandwich, but somehow tasted way better. I guess it's the melted cheese, the type of bread, and the fact that there was clearly olive oil on it that helped it be so much more flavorful. This was close to as good as the pizza was that we got at pizzeria bianco the other day. So, that made me happy and it only cost $4.50, so that made me even happier. I would be much more likely to come here than to wait three hours for the other. \n\nSo why does this place get 3 stars and the other get 4? I thought the selection here was very limited, which is fine if it helps them put out more quality food, but man, there's not a lot of choice. Also, the service was much better at the pizzeria. Finally, the appetizers at the pizzeria were freakin amazing and nothing I got today was amazing. HOWEVER I would probably come here again before going back to the pizzeria due to wait time.\n\nPS I didn't get a sweet! Now I feel sad. :-(", "business_id": "-AAig9FG0s8gYE4f8GfowQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-03-26", "type": "review"}

It is that good.  It is also (for me) large enough to have half for lunch and half as an afternoon snack around 3:30 pm.\n\nI have tried the tuna salad.

His simple honest to goodness approach to food is not only inspiring but down right delicious. If you're one of his fans who don't mind waiting 4 hours for one of his amazing pies at Pizzeria Bianco, then you're in for a real treat. While they don't serve pizza, one of my all time favorites, Pane Bianco is now serving dinner and no serious wait either! In addition to ordering one of their famous sandwiches, you can expect an ever changing menu of rustic Italian inspired plates.\n\nIf you've been to Pane you know the drill, go in, order at the counter then either decide to take your score home, or eat there on one of the communal outdoor tables. No wine or beer is served at this time but there is talk of Pane expanding into the Lux Coffee space next door which will eventually offer inside seating and hopefully wine by the glass. If all of this goes down, Lux will simply move to the adjacent building also getting a larger space. For me Bianco's food just screams for a glassed of red wine.\n\nOrdering the Crespelle ($12) had me really excited due to the unique nature of the dish itself. Basically an Italian crepe made the garbanzo bean flour; it's filled with luscious ricotta cheese, hints of spinach then bathed in a slightly sweet tomato sauce. It was clear that after the first bite I was in love with this dish, I simply couldn't stop though glares from my dining companions made me to relinquish the plate. \n\nI can't sing enough praises for Biancos Housemade Mozzarella ($8), thick slabs of hand pulled cheese is paired with fresh tomatoes, a few leaves of basil, olive oil and a sprinkling of salt, that's it. The resulting texture and flavor is so toothsome and fresh that I've yet to have another as good. The salad comes with bread which I put to good use soaking up every drop of the salads milky elixir. \n\nServed on house made flat bread, the Soppressata with Aged Provolone ($8) which also comes topped with a healthy shave of Parmesan cheese and slices of roasted onion. The pungency from the provolone is a nice compliment to the pork-tastic slices of soppressata. \n\nBianco is dedicated to local purveyors and for good reason, they make some of the best Phoenix has to offer. Take the Sausage with beluga lentils and polenta ($10) for instance. The sausage comes from our very own Schreiner's Fine Sausages over on 7th Street and let me just say, this plump link had just the right amount of meaty well seasoned punch to compliment the hearty lentils and super moist polenta cake.\n\nIf you're more of a lighter eater, I'd suggest the highly flavorful Roasted Seasonal Vegetables ($5). On my last visit the pan was filled with long thick spears of asparagus, sweet potato, cabbage, radishes, broccolini and cloves of garlic. Grab a loaf of their chewy bread ($3) and you have yourself a vegetarian option even a meat eater like me would love.\n\nNow if they added pizza to the menu, my life would be complete.", "business_id": "-AAig9FG0s8gYE4f8GfowQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-04-24", "type": "review"}

They have a sister restaurant across town that serves EXACTLY the same pizza?  And we can essentially stroll in there with no problems?  Sign us up.

For lunch I have the Housemade Mozzarella, Local Tomato & Basil sandwich or salad. The Mozzarella is fresh and delicious and I do not normally eat cheese. One more thing, I love that I can buy a pizza here and go next door to Lux, order a lemonade and read a book while enjoying my pizza. Great place! The only caveat is that the wait at lunch time can be up to 20-25 mins during peak hours (downtown Phoenix lunch crowd).", "business_id": "-AAig9FG0s8gYE4f8GfowQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-04-26", "type": "review"}

If the food is from Chris Bianco you know it's going to be good,  but was tad dissapointed at our antipasto plate.

We also ordered the Rosa which is one of their signature pizza pies with cheese, onion and Arizona pistachios. Delicious. We also thought wine would be a nice choice. Unfortunately, they don't have their liquor license sorted out yet. So a hit and a two misses. \n\nBut here's the main reason they only got two stars: \n\nWe ordered the antipasto plate and when we asked the blonde female waitstaff person who brought it for bread she said they didn't have any. OK, uh, what? Seems that Pane Bianco (White Bread in Italian) doesn't make bread on Saturday's. I said, well, since they make pizza, perhaps you can throw some dough into the oven and bake some. She said they couldn't do that. What? In the meantime our resourceful waiter overheard the conversation and brought us some...wait for it...BREAD.

So I suggested it for lunch today and off we went.  We were very pleased all around.  The ambiance is great- kind of rustic Italian chic with low and high tables, a bar, and a takeout area next door.  The service was fantastic.  It took maybe 3 minutes to get our food, although sandwiches and salads aren't too taxing to make, and it wasn't crowded.  Still, it was noted and much appreciated.  I got the Caprese salad.  I debated between that and the sandwich, but finally decided on the salad because it did come with bread (which I definitely wanted to try, it being PANE Bianco, but sometimes sandwiches are just too bready).  I spent 2 weeks a couple of years ago literally eating my way through Italy on Caprese salads, and this was as good as many and better than some.  The tomatoes were red ripe and tasty.  The mozzarella was fresh, and it had just the right amount of basil, olive oil, and salt and pepper.  Yum- thinking about it now makes me hungry all over again.  The bread was as expected, fresh and crusty.  I also got the pickled vegetables, which were good and interesting.  It was a plate of baby carrots, onions, cauliflower, and peas pickled in what seemed to be apple cider vinegar, so they were sweet and sour at the same time.  Sweet Pea got the Soppresata sandwich, which came with the chile Soppreseta today (which was great, as we are both notorious spicy hounds), and he really enjoyed it.  It also came with sort of a saucy cold bean salad, I think they were lima or fava beans, which he didn't like but I LOVED.  I ate all of his too.  They serve Mexican sodas but aren't too precious about it- always appreciated.  We will definitely be going back, and I will go by the takeout for a loaf of bread when I'm having a party.

In the end, I settled on three though its probably closer to 3.5 stars.  There's plenty to like about this spot, though I wouldn't say it has the wow factor.  Though in the interest of full disclosure you should know that Pizzeria Bianco doesn't have a wow factor for me either.  If you're a big Pizzeria Bianco fan, you'll probably love this place.  If you're sorta meh about Pizzeria Bianco as I am, you'll probably have some of the same gripes as I do about Pane.\n\nI've been to Pizzeria Bianco a number of times, but I've never tried Pane despite driving past it thousands of times over the years.  Finally on a Wednesday mid afternoon I made the journey here.  My timing was perfect as I arrived right in between the end of the lunch rush and prior to the dinner brigade.  However despite my good timing, finding a parking spot was still a chore as I had to park about two blocks away.  I couldn't even imagine how brutal parking would be when its busy (especially since Lux, another wildly popular establishment, is right next door).  I got a little confused walking inside as you've got two entrances.  The left door gets you into the restaurant while the right door gets you to the take out counter.  You guessed it, walked into the wrong door.  No matter, as I detoured straight to the bar area.\n\nThe aesthetics here are somewhat hard to describe, though the numerous Yelp photos of the interior pretty much paint an accurate picture.  A small place with a hipster vibe, though perhaps with a hint of elegance in the decor.  Not unlike the setup you'd find at Chris Bianco's other establishments, though I'd say this one is a little more laid back.  The bar area is pretty small, though they had a decent number of craft beers and wines to choose from.  They also feature a number of daily dish specials in addition to the regular menu they advertise (including a number of dessert options).\n\nFor starters I went with the Four Peaks Sunbru for my beverage of choice as it was on tap for the day.  For my main dish, it seemed like the Sopressata sandwich with provolone and red peppers is a huge hit based on Yelper reviews so I went with that.  The sandwich comes with what I suppose is a side salad, though its so small it could basically be a garnish.  First off, no complaints about the foccacia bread.  Cooked perfectly for the right amount of crunch while soft on the inside.  But the sandwich itself was a little disappointing to be honest.  The seasoning of the red peppers was such that it basically overpowered the texture of the meat and the cheese, to the point where the red pepper was pretty much all I could taste.  Perhaps swapping provolone for mozzarella would've mellowed out the red peppers just enough to balance it out.  The portion size was about right and the side salad (what little there was) was good so the dish wasn't a total disappointment.  For dessert, I asked for a piece of their tres leches cake, but they had just run out.  So instead I went with their flourless chocolate cake (which I've had before at Pizzeria Bianco).  Just as I expected, it was outstanding.  Super moist and decadent with a light vanilla creme sauce as an accompaniment.  Every bit as good as the one they serve at Pizzeria Bianco and a perfect cap on any meal.\n\nTotal cost for the beer, sandwich, cake, tax and tip came to about $28.  Pretty pricey (especially the sandwich), though to Chris Bianco's credit he and his staff do take great pains to source their ingredients locally which I appreciate.  Still, the markup seems a little steep.  Much like Sam Fox, Chris Bianco's strong brand identity probably drives the prices higher.  So like I said, if you think everything Chris Bianco touches turns to gold, you'll love this place.  And better still, they also serve Chris's famous pizzas at Pane as well.  I'd come back if asked by a friend or family member, but overall I feel like Chris Bianco's original pizzeria in Heritage Square is still a preferable experience to his CenPho concept.", "business_id": "-AAig9FG0s8gYE4f8GfowQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-04-01", "type": "review"}

I come from the Northeast... when it comes to authentic Jewish delis, it's the land of plenty. In Arizona, I'm lucky to find a deli that even has actually edible corned beef on rye. Scott's Generation offers very good pseudo-Jewish food, but for being \"unofficial\" in my mind, it's pretty good.\n\nScott's has all the staples of an East Coast Jewish deli:\n\n1. Dr. Browns soda\n2. Matzaball Soup\n3. A \"special\" (cole slaw and russian dressing on X sandwich)\n4. Wise chips\n\nUnfortunately when going to Scott's, I felt like the only Jew in a few mile radius. This was highlighted even more when I asked for Challah french toast. The waitress responded with just \"huh?\"... As I looked down on the menu, I realized their challah french toast is actually \"Kelly's American Toast\" with challah french toast written in small font underneath. Looking further on the menu, I was happy to see that they have an option to get kreplach in your soup... but upon further inspection, next to kreplach it says \"wonton\" in parentheses...\n\n*rustling sound*\n\nThat sound you just heard (read) was my great grandparents rolling over in their graves. That's like going to an Italian restaurant in Israel, ordering spaghetti and marinara, and in parentheses seeing \"egg noodles and ketchup\" (at least to me).\n\nAnyway... food wise, I give Scott's Generation a solid 3.5 stars. The service was also a solid 3.5. I give Scott's a 2 on the Jewish deli scale.

If I'm going to have something, I want a lot of it, not just a little sampler. The breakfast here is pretty good, as well. Now, my favorite part: the cheesecake. Holyyyyyy....yes, it is amazing. I've had a lot of cheese cake - though I would not consider myself a connoisseur - and, in my opinion, Generations' cheesecake is pretty phenomenal. \n\nI recommend sitting outside - the inside feels a little shabby, and a little stuffy. Surprisingly, I haven't come across any flies yet while eating outside. Oh - and you can smoke outside, which is just fantastic for smokers. For those who don't smoke, fortunately, there are a lot of tables outside, so you can sit far away from me. \n\nThe bad: some of the employees come across as, oh, I don't know..bitter? The average waitress there is at retirement age, which is fine, and that can be really nice: \"what would ya like sweetie?\". But the one of the waitresses at Generations doesn't seem too happy to be there - and she shows it.  That waitress, well,  you can definitely tell when she is having a bad day. I once asked for a little cup of powdered sugar and she gave me the evil eyes!! I couldn't believe it! And neither could my friends and family! But there have been times when she has been very sweet. Though you're walking on eggshells with her. If you get her, be careful not to ask for anything extra. The other employees, I'm not sure about, because we've only really gotten 'her', but I know there is a younger waitress who happens to be very nice and professional. \n\nAnyways, over all, Generations is an authentic deli, with great food (and cheesecake).

Odd? not to me.  So, off I went scouring the menu for other items.  I will say, the waiter was extremely knowledgeable and explained that all that sort of stuff comes from New York and as of recently, there's been \"issues\" getting their hands on this stuff? Is there a gefilte fish strike going on somewhere? A beet farmer protest that I don't know about? SERIOUSLY?!?!?\n\nOverall Robyn and I had a great time here. We really enjoyed our food, the service was great and it went really well.  I would eat here again, but I would insist on them having Gefilte fish before I go.....(ok ok I'm just kidding, but seriously, I need gefilte fish.....)", "business_id": "PxeX1M8WtyPxX1MuuGIh-g", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-05-27", "type": "review"}

Didn't bother me at all.\n\nI ordered the L.E.O Special - lox, eggs, onions and a bagel.

I got fresh hand carved Nova Scotia, White Fish and Lake Sturgeon that came with many sides and a bagel. They do have belly lox on the menu but were out of it. The hand carved Nova was very good and maybe the best you can find anywhere. The white fish was outstanding. You can't find better anywhere. I thought the sturgeon was good but I don't have much exsperience eating sturgeon because it's normally about $70.00 a pound so I haven't eaten that much. The potato salad and the cole slaw had good flavors but were a little drippy. The pickle was really great and above average. The everything bagel was really different but good. It was almost like a very oniony onion bagel with also with the everything toppings and was really packed with flavor. My platter was very large and I took enough home for another meal.\n\nMy husband ordered a triple decker sandwich with turkey pastrami and corned beef. The turkey tasted like fresh roasted. The corned beef was good. The pastrami taste very similar to what regular pastrami taste like back east. It had the right amount of fat and the correct flavors. The sandwich platter came with a mountain of crispy fries that might have been fresh cut red potatoes with several tasty pickles and fresh coleslaw.\n\nAfter I watched the movie \"Deli Man\" I learned that Deli's have the highest food cost of all restaurants because they sell mostly meat so it isn't the cheapest food because it can't be.

Being tucked away in newer buildings behind a starbucks, with kind of a goofy name for a lunch market, I was pretty sure this place was going to be a big disappointment.  WRONG (yay)\n\nThough a confusing layout/way of doing things, the small but impressive market of cheeses, meats, pastas, beverages, teas, coffees, sauces and little do-dads is cute cozy and inviting.  The wine room is small but good and fairly well stocked with a good variety of wines, though a measly wine by the glass selection for a fairly impressive cellar.  \n\nWorkers were a little awkward at times but really helpful in making selections.  We opted for a sandwich and a cheese platter for two, accompanied by a bottle of Reisling.  The sandwich was really good and fresh, the sun dried tomatoes were awesome - though as a sandwich in whole i've had better.  The make your own cheese platter was AWESOME-you get to choose as many cheeses as you'd like, getting the chance to look through them and read descriptions and touch, great for someone like me who loves a good cheese but knows nilch about names and pairings.  It was fresh, BIG, and simple-A in my book. \n\nThe owners son was friendly and knowledgeable, helping us select the right bottle of wine to go with our cheeses, a not easy task being I like sweeter whites while he likes dry crisp ones.  Though not the best wine i've had, we got a very good bottle for 15 bucks that was enjoyable. \n\nAs far as seating goes they have multiple areas inside and out, we very much enjoyed the front outdoor patio with sun covers, live music, grass, and the dog and children friendly atmosphere. \n\nOnly downsides I'd have to say would be the confusing layout with lack of direction, and the sometimes \"airy\" staff behind the counters.

Before my husband and I set out on our groupon redeeming adventure all over Phoenix, we decided to stop in here for lunch. This is the first time I have been in here to eat since becoming vegetarian almost a year and a half ago, and before then we used to come in all of the time. At least once a month to get some sandwiches while we were out shopping in this part of town. Today I decided would be a good day to check this place back out, as I was craving sandwiches anyways. We must have come in at an off time because it wasn't very crowded. But then again, most people don't eat lunch at 3pm. There was a musician playing out on the patio for a few guests.\n\nWe walked in and my husband and I both decided on the Where's the beef? sandwich, which was lettuce, tomato, avocado, jicama, celery, sprouts, cucumber, swiss cheese, mayo and mustard. I got mine on an onion roll and my husband decided on whole wheat. We paroozed the store while we were waiting for our sandwiches and we also purchased a large bottle of water and chips. There is also a little section inside where you can purchase teas, coffees, jams, spices, oils, kitchen tools, among other items. I can't say that I have ever bought any of these items but some of them are pretty interesting. Today I saw boxed potatoes. I don't know why but I thought it was the strangest thing ever. \n\nAnyways. So our sandwiches are ready and we pay and we sat upstairs overlooking the rest of the store. I dig into my sandwich and I really love it. I'm a sandwich slut anyways so its easy to make me happy, but there were a ton of veggies. I didn't feel like I was gipped at all. Most sandwich places will give you the flattest sandwich possible. But this one was large and in charge. I got full half way through and still ate the whole thing because of how good it tasted. I think the value for a sandwich like this is just about the same as every other sandwich shop I have had that has a vegetarian option. It was $7, which is about average. So I don't feel like I was robbed or anything. We will definitely be back soon!", "business_id": "HIiVx2mseVWKtx8TKfWC_A", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-04-30", "type": "review"}

I'm so glad I finally ventured in. It's adorable!  \n\nWith copious amounts of places to sit (inside and out) it's perfect for a leisurely bite. My adventure was during a Friday happy hour. (M-F, 5-7pm. $3 drafts! $3 house wine!) Arriving early to secure an outdoor patio spot we meandered thru the space. There's live music on Fridays with a start time of ~ 6pm. \n\nTHE BASICS\nCooking accessories, teas, coffees, spices, a wide array of imported specialty foods line the shelves. Need some meat? They've got it. Want a sweet? Yep. In the mood for a sandwich? Si. Want some cheese? Be adventurous! They have adorable tiny wedges for a buck and change. \"Try something new without fear of commitment.\" Ha!\n\nThe wine / bar area, though petite in size, is lined floor to ceiling with wine bottles. Bob, the bartender on Fridays, is the friendliest gentlemen you could ever meet. The beer fridge is filled with a respectable number of bottles. \n\nSEATING\nThere's plenty of it. Two floors. My visit we were focused on nabbing seating outside near the live music. Turns out the music is fairly loud and you don't need to sit that close! You order your food inside and service your own tables here.\n\nFor noshing we nibbled on a patio cheese tray. I'm not entirely sure what cheese was served. Our platter included a small palmful of soft cheese, a jam spread, sliced bread and sliced apple. For the price point I'd actually have preferred a sandwich. But still tasty!\n\nWINE TASTINGS\nAt Duck & Decanter you can arrange a private wine & beer tasting for groups of 14-24 ppl. Lasting two hours in duration the sessions include the booze (duh!), cheese, printed info and a host. Sometimes they can include additional food. It depends on headcount and budget. ($20-$35 /person + gratuity + tax). This seems like a really neat thing to set up.\n\nTasting menu examples...The Beer Tasting has you traveling thru six different countries. The Business Mixer offers three red and three white wines. The Blind Tasting sounds awesome! Wine is served from a brown bag and it's up to guests to pick the grape. \n\nSo anyway, Duck & Decanter is a pretty neat experience!

We were at the Ulta just around the corner and she said she was hungry and she LOVES pizza.  We have been here twice as of this writing.  The second time around was \"Kids Eat Free\" night.  That is Wednesay for those of you with kids and it's a good deal.  I will eventually put together a list of Kids Eat Free places in the area.  For now let me tell you about NYPD.....\n\nThe pizza is a winner!  Nice crust, great topppings!  They use paper thin slices of sausage instead of hunks of sausage.  The flavore is great too.  My daughter had a slice of black olive pizza and they were very generous with the olives....she loved it!  I have had the ceaser and the house salads and both were good and fresh.  \n\nSo for the Kids Eat Free night adults need to order an entree (I think this includes a whole pizza too, not sure though) There were several things to choose from including cheese ravioli, baked ziti, and  lasagne.  I chose the lasagne and it was delish!  Piping hot with melted mozeralla over the top, I could not stop eating it!!  The flavors melded together nicely and it reminded me of my Mom's lasagne.  And did I mention the bread......OMG!!  The little ibites of heaven are sooooo good!!  I could have eaten ten of them!!  They are homemade, the real deal, yeasty goodness!!  Warm and just a little chewy, the flavor was amazing!!  \nOh and the Desert Flower Ice Tea.....so refreshing!!!  I keep thinking about it, that's how good it is!!\n\nTry the canollis.....you won't be disappointned.  Kids get an ice cream sundae with their meal.  On our first visit Lori, our server, was a real sweetheart.  She gave me some coupons and signed me up for the email list.  And on our next visit , Jessica was awesome and attentive too!\n\nThis is a small place but they also have an outdoor patio with misters.  The bar is tiny, probably seats 10.  Flat screen for watching the D'backs and some good beers on tap, along with Happy Hour specials makes this a great place!!  This will be somewhere we will frequent!!

That's how long my four-year-old son and I waited from the time we sat down until we received our lunch. Granted, my son is more patient than most children his age, but after about 20 minutes, he started to ask about where his food was. This occurred on Good Friday between 1:30 and 2:30 pm.\n\nI guess I should have been alerted to this situation from the moment I walked in. No one greeted us, and it took about three minutes before we were even acknowledged. We wanted to sit outside, but after 60 seconds of debating with a colleague, the gentleman told us there were no outside seats - although we clearly saw two empty tables. Then, the shirts on the employees said, \"Unique like a Brooklyn accent.\" I really should question a company that doesn't use proper grammar. (It should read, \"Unique, like a Brooklyn accent.\")\n\nThe person who seated us also took our order moments after we sat down. I asked for apple juice for my son and was told they were out, so we switched to iced tea for him and water with lemon for me. We shortly received our drinks - sans lemon. \n\nAfter we were there about 10 minutes, a large party of 10 was seated near us. Half were small children my son's age and they received lemons with their beverages, so my thought that the restaurant was perhaps out of those too was erased. Unfortunately, our waiter never checked on us, and I actually had to flag him down as my son was whining for food to get a water refill and ask - again - for a lemon. It was then that he told me he'd check on our food.\n\nFINALLY, 35 minutes in, our food arrived. I think we were so hungry at that point that dirt would have sufficed. My son doesn't usually like mac and cheese that is penne with cheese sauce, but he ate nearly all of it. My eggplant lasagna was certainly not the best I've had. Neither of our items was baked, so I'm still not sure what the holdup was. And, by the way, the table of 10 received their food before we did and came and left in the hour we were there. While I'm complaining, my son's ice cream was so frozen I almost needed a knife to cut it for him.\n\nI would like to say the poor service was because the restaurant was understaffed. Although the place was full, I counted seven employees, including a manager. Other tables were receiving much better service, so I'd have to say the problem was more with our server (who never shared his name). My son and I eat out about once a week, and I always leave 20% for a tip, but this time I left $1 on a $16 bill. At first, I felt badly about it, but then I remembered, \"Oh yeah, it's not like I'm ever coming back here.\"\n\n*** On 4/5/10, Alana, a representative from NYPD Pizza sent me an e-mail when she came across my review and offered her sincere apologies, a follow-up call from customer service, and a coupon for a free pizza / meal. I was very appreciative of the response, and as I told her, I've been to other NYPD Pizza locations with much better results; I think this episode was the result of a new or poorly trained server.", "business_id": "TqHTtjPANCBKGsjGBjDoQQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-04-02", "type": "review"}

This really isn't that much of a deli. It's more of a Luby's meets Subway.

I'd been hearing people rave about this place and how it was a NY style deli. Chompie's is more NY than this place and the food is generally tastier there. I ordered a turkey sandwich on french bread with Swiss and cranberry sauce... It was okay and filled me up but it wasn't anything particularly memorable.\n\nThird: Miracle Mile dishes out pretty solid portions. It's not too much and it's not too little. To be honest, it's probably a little more toward too much... but in a good way.\n\nGo to Miracle Mile for a decent meal, just don't expect the Second Coming.", "business_id": "fmuj7u1gflmEjW-h0v9bwg", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-03-26", "type": "review"}

I had been wanting to check it out for a while since it is just down the street from my office.  The reviews saying it was expensive kept me away but now after seeing the menu I don't think it so bad compared to other places in the area.  You really can't get a lunch for less than $10 anywhere in Old Town Scottsdale unless you do fast food or the food court in the mall.  I thought the place was decorated super cute and with a nice relaxing atmosphere and the staff was very friendly.\n\nBut the food was just kind of average.  I had a 1/2 panini and soup and they both pretty much tasted like something I could make at home.

His pastries are fantastic. They have a new FRENCH chef who makes amazing and authentic French food.  -- Are you getting the theme here: FRENCH from FRANCE!!!\n\nIt is superb food. The owner couldn't be nicer. Service was excellent. \n\nAnd, here's the deal with the prices. The have this thing called a 'menu' which lists, in an itemized fashion, adjacent to each dish, the PRICE. You can actually calculate what the bill will be by summing each item ordered, adding tax and tip. -- I know, completely crazy new concept; but they have it here, and it works beautifully. That way, you won't be shocked by the prices. \n\nAnother thing: This is SCOTTSDALE, which is like the Beverly Hills of Arizona. Real estate is expensive; the clientele expects good product and pays for it. You don't walk into Barneys of NY and SCREAM how frigg'n expensive it is and how you can get pants in Walmart for a fraction of the price. -That would reflect poorly on YOU, not Barneys. -- Same goes for this place. \n\nBottom line: GREAT food, GREAT service, STUPID reviewers.", "business_id": "wftoNIA0Q8nX-Da47psBCA", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-04-28", "type": "review"}

My mom (R.I.P) used bring me here and it is one of the few childhood memories I hang on to. For those who do not know about this place as the food detective I will share a little background info from my case files to help you out. \n\nMr. Submarine is actually a small chain that really got it's start here in the valley in the early 80's. At one time the locations stretched from the east valley to west phoenix. With increased competition from larger sub chains ( Subway, Cousins, Blimpy, and Quiznos they were forced to limit their growth and use word of mouth advertising to keep customers coming in. This resulted in store closings and now only two locations remain open. When you try and compare a place like this to say a subway which spends big time money to advertise their five dollar foot long special, or their new breakfast sandwich there is no competition. \n\nThis place wins by a mile. Who needs a 5 dollar foot long that is served by some teenager who only cares about his shift ending so he can escape. No, I would rather have the owner there serving me a sandwich that he himself is going to eat for lunch. Don't give me slimy meat and dried out looking cheese. I want soft fresh bread with toppings that enhance the other components of my sandwich not cover it up! OK enough with the ranting, this place is a no frills type of place. No wraps or cookies. They offer the normal meat choices including ham, turkey, tuna and your choice of bread ( white, wheat, and sourdough).\n\nNo annoying jingles or sandwich Nazis (read my subway review), just good food, made and served by someone who cares about what they are selling you.  They are open Monday through Friday 10am to 10pm and Saturday and Sunday from 10am to 8pm.\n\nThey are a little more pricey than Subway but for a great sandwich and great service it is well worth the price.\n\nCase closed", "business_id": "C6oCdg9wVaS81Re0WfBJzw", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-04-14", "type": "review"}

The ambiance of the place is classic 70's fast food, and not much has changed. The owner usually works the counter and is pretty friendly and seems to know all the regulars.\nThis is NOT a gourmet or hipster sandwich shop. To be succinct, the sandwiches here are about as plain and simple as it gets - variety of cold cuts with some toppings and condiments, on white or wheat bread. There are also some hot menu items like meatball. The bread, meats, toppings etc are all decent. Not the best, and definitely not the worst. My main complaint would be the weak bread-to-meat ratio - I've gotten the popular Italian sub and found it to be more bread than cold cuts. I enjoyed it, but it left me wanting more. \nDon't go with high expectations -this is a plain everyday local sub shop and their consistency and simplicity keep the customers coming back, who seem to support this iconic mom 'n pop location at 24th St & Osborne.\n\nUPDATE: I've been several times now, because its conveniently located near my work.

I've driven by the center literally hundreds of times over the years, and have never noticed the pizza shop.  It was only just recently that I noticed them, based on their sign on the street advertising the lunch special of two slices and a soda for $3.99.  Fast forward to a few weeks later when I was sitting at my desk pondering where to go, but being unable to decide.  My memory bank finally remembered Frank's and away I went.\n\nI gotta admit, I was extremely nervous going in.  Here it was, right in prime lunch hour and there was nary a soul to be seen, other than the guy working there who was in the back (maybe it was Frank!).  Anywho, takes me order, and goes back to make the pie and I sat down and waited.  And waited a little bit more.  Then a guy came in and 'Frank' came out and chatted with him as they appeared to know each other.  Then a little more waiting happened.  I thought it was taking way too long as this point, seems at any other 'slice' joint I go to (Ray's/NYPD/etc.), it's just a few minutes.  Finally, 'Frank' brings my slices out and apologies to me that they were in the oven too long and would I like him to make new ones.  Well...I looked at that pizza, and all I saw was golden brown delicious cheese staring at me.  Which to me, is great when you have nice golden brown cheese.  So I told him no need, it looked great to me, and I started to chow down.\n\nWhile the temperature was hot, and I kind of burned my mouth a bit (stupid lack of self control to wait for it to cool), the pizza was terrific.  I mentioned the cheese before, but the crust was also very good, being nice and crispy on the bottom.  And then, when I got to the thick part, not only was the crust nice and chewy, the bottom was still crispy.  \n\nOverall, a good couple slices of pie.

It's slimy and tastes like ham flavoring.  I am not a ham snob by any means, but this is not edible.   For a sandwich that costs this much, they need to use better product.

Last night when we were decided what to do for dinner I said, let's have pizza and let's look on Yelp for a recommendation.  We decided that Slice of Sicily would be our choice based on closeness to our apartment and the good reviews it received.    \n\nWe drive up and get a spot right in front!  Hooray for good luck!  There were only two people eating inside so we picked out a table and took a seat.  The tables were all red and white checkered and the walls full of Italian maps and posters.  The west wall was an interesting mural of an Italian landscape with bare trees and sunflowers.  The decor reminded me of how much I missed Italy. \n\nWe took a look at the menu, ordered and looked on the huge map of Italy next to us.  I asked Gary if he knew where I was born... he knew it was up north.  So I showed him, I also showed him the placed I lived in Italy and the place we are going to retire too.  He always laughs when I say that.  He doesn't know how serious I am!\n\nOur waitress was nice and between her and the owner we got everything we needed.  The owner's family is from Sicily, but her mother was born in the states.  \n\nOur food was fantastic.  I no longer need to drive all the way to NYPD for New York Style Pizza, I can drive up the street to Slice of Sicily.\n\nThere was a nice steady stream of people in and out of the restaurant.

We will definitely be regulars. \n\nI would have given this place 5 stars but when we ordered two canolli's they went back to grab them and came out empty  handed.

Trying to transform a four top into a five top, a skinny, grey-haired  woman shuffled over to assist.  This was Donna, my new favorite Phoenix waitress.

All three were great!  Fresh toppings, thin, crispy crust and cheesed to perfection.  Take note of the wall mural.  The farm house scene is very entertaining.  I had a small obsession with real wreath added on the painted door.  \n\nDonna definitely enhanced my visit.

It's a good tasting, quick, and fairly priced meal. The shmears are good, the bagels are fresh, and the sandwiches are filling. So, I must let you know this review applies only to this Einstein's.\n\nI've come here quite a few times, but finally decided to write a review because I'm sick of the mistakes - it needs to be said. At any fast(ish) food restaurant, there is always an expectation of some mistakes being made on your food. But when those mistakes are continually made and cost you extra money...you start getting fed up.\n\nI've had certain staff members screw up my order every time they make it. This is very frustrating, especially when you order cream-cheese (at something like $1.50 extra..which is kinda ridiculous in the first place) and you don't get it with your food, it's infuriating. When you often get your food to go, you don't realize until you reach your destination and it is too late by then. You always have to check your order after leaving Taco Bell, but I thought Einsteins was a little higher than that - apparently not this one.\n\nHowever, there is one shining star - Cathrin. If everybody made your order as quickly or perfectly as her, this place would be getting a much higher rating from me.\n\nSo, if you are going to this location, I warn you.

Pats was one that we tried once, and will never try again. Let me state my story.\n\nSo one night, I decided that we should try Pat's Pizza Plus. I called ahead, ordered 1 large pepperoni pizza. They said that it would take about thirty minutes, so I waited a while and drove there. I got there thirty minutes from that time, and was told my pizza was not ready yet. So I sat and waited in their tiny lobby. Eventually, my overpriced pizza was ready, and I drove home.\n\nI set the pizza on my counter, opened the box and looked inside. This thing looked terrible. There were literally POOLS of grease. I understand, New york style pizza, But this was ridiculous. So I grabbed a paper towel or 10, patted down both the top and the bottom of the pizza, and made it bearable.\n\nI took a bite of the pizza and literally had to tear at it like a wolf to even get a mouthful off of the slice. It was very similar to trying to eat cardboard. It was ridiculous. Myself, My father, and my Mother didn't even make it through our first slices before throwing the \"pizza\" away and looking elsewhere for food.

I got an \"everything\" and a plain cheese, got it for delivery, to be paid in cash (I thought that was a good way to go with the other reviews...)\nComplaint - the delivery took a lot longer than expected. Almost an hour. On a week day (not Friday or Saturday). This was kind of irritating, when I was quoted 30 min.\nBut stuff happens. Delivery guy eventually called asking for directions.\n(Nice gesture, they stuck in a few take-out menus on our box for future use!)\n\nI'm from Boston. I'm picky about my pizza. I hate deep-dish doughy crust nonsense. \nIt's just gotta be crispy - it shouldn't be soggy anywhere, and the sauce should be good and tomato-ey without having too much garlic or salt. Semi-sweet. Cheese should be melty and gooey without being glue-y. Pat's hit the mark.\nPizzas come in small or large. The crust was lightly floured and crisp all the way through - something that lead me off the bandwagon of Spinato's (Square slices are also just somewhat... odd) \nWhile I am begrudged to give a good review for New York pizza, Pat's just made themselves a new customer. \nJust don't expect me to cheer on the Yankees.", "business_id": "GvwDppcJLm9lso9iS2hSIw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-03-06", "type": "review"}

The delivery driver didn't follow them and, instead, went to the front office of the apartment complex.

And PB&J. haven't tried that yet - maybe next week. No grilled sandwiches. They have a selection of several bagged chips, and side orders of pasta or potato salad.

From the time we sat down (both visits), the service was top-notch and friendly. \n\nFirst visit, we had the specialty spinach pizza with plenty of garlic and tomatoes ($15 for a medium). It was delicious but way too much pizza for us 4 when we paired it when their large order of ravioli and two meatball. That was so good too! Oh did I forget to mention the garlic cheese bread that we ordered with the baked bread and butter. Both, simply amazing. Clearly I was aiming for the food going straight towards my waistline. I also had a glass of wine since they are half off on Sundays and made sure to get some of their chocolate chip cookies to go. \n\nFor the second visit (a week later), we dialed it back a bit. Of course we had to have the garlic cheese bread, kids ravioli ($5 for the ravioli, a breadstick, drink, and scoop of gelato), small specialty pizza ($10 and plenty for my husband and son to share) and I had the \"lil\" spinach calzone (7\" for $5). That calzone was so delicious, I couldn't save the half I set aside for lunch. Add two glasses of wine (half off), and two piccola brownie desserts, and our total bill was $45. For a family of four with drinks, an appetizer and 2 desserts???? Pretty damn reasonable in this day in age. And it has been a long time since I was that blissfully satisfied with a meal (or two).

The real question is why don't I go every month!?\n\nSo, now I'm hopped up on a dirty chai latte and I must share the details about this neighborhood gem. Truly, the Valley's BEST neighborhood coffee shop! For a number of reasons...\n\n1.) Grinders is a place where everyone feels welcome from high school kids to retirees taking advantage of the free wi-fi.\n\n2.) They roast their OWN beans. That's right. They wheel a roaster out onto the same concrete slab that becomes the stage for Valley blues legends like Ronnie Whitehead on 2nd Saturdays and roast the beans for themselves!! I find their coffees to be pretty earthy and smooth. \n\n3.) The fudgy pecan brownies are rich and chocolaty. The scones are biscuit-like and just the right amount of barely sweet. (I haven't tried the danish, but they look deadly!)\n\n4.) They are generous in sharing their own talents and promoting the talents of others, ensuring access to arts and culture. Each month, they allow a different local artist to show their work on the coffee shop walls. And while ordinarily they are not open past 6 p.m. on Saturday, an exception is made on the 2nd Saturday of each month when you can sit outside and listen to  live jazz and/or blues from 8 - 10 p.m.  And, by the way, Dennis, the owner, is a bad ass on the harmonica! \n\nWe really are so lucky to have such a great business, doing great things, in the community!", "business_id": "4eFIVmbeCvJGCrhzmd-VYA", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-03-14", "type": "review"}

It's about time I wrote a review, since I'm a regular. I can be found sitting on one of the giant chairs surfing on the wi-fi many mornings.\n\nI'm the one who brought the plants in. I used to water them a couple times a week but nowadays I'm lazy and they really need to be repotted. I should get on that ...\n\nThe music is always playing and everyone knows my regular drink ... they've continued to memorize it for me even as I started to slowly decrease the fat & calories of my regular order. Now it's an ice skim latte with sugar free vanilla. I used to get an Everything bagel with egg, cheese and potatoes most mornings. Now I get it on multigrain toast. Eh, it's the little things.\n\nThe coffee at Grinders is really really good. It's not bitter and sharp, it's smooth. They grind their beans outside many mornings per week. Sometimes it gets too warm inside during the winter so we prop the doors open, but if the grinder is going outside, it'll blow coffee bean fumes in the door.\n\nThere's some retired motorcycle cops who meet up every morning and sit around the big round table. They often park their motorcycles in front of the place together. They call themselves the Geezerados.\n\nThere's sometimes a few right-wingers having conversations mid-day. One time I listened to their meeting and heard them trying to come up with controversial topics to get people to come to church. They spent a long time trying to figure out who could get them proof that global warming isn't happening, so they could use that as their hook.\n\nA lot of moms come in with their kids. Seeing siblings piled up in one of the oversized chairs together is common. There are a few regulars who come in specifically to sit on the internet all day. I'm not there all day, but I'm there at all times of the day because I have a home office, and you never know when you suddenly need caffeine.\n\nEarly in the morning and after 3pm the place becomes flooded with Sunnyslope High School kids. They range from ROTC kids wearing pickle suits to trendy girls in neon to the alternative crowd. They often lay around the couch splayed across each other or gazing into each others' eyes. \n\nOrdinarily I'm a real talker and I can't usually keep my mouth shut, but Grinders is the one place that I go where I barely make a peep. I just eavesdrop on everyone's conversations and sometimes run into friends I know. I usually go before my brain is fully awake in the morning, that's part of it. For the record, a couple months ago one of the girls there said I was practically invisible and she hardly knew I was there, because I was so quiet.\n\nThere's nothing pretentious about Grinders at all, and it's also down to earth without being ghetto. It has character. Some months the art is better than other months. Hannah has been there for years (they call her Big Hannah now, only because there's another girl named Hannah who is tiny and they call her Little Hannah) and Hannah rocks and makes the best breakfast ever. \n\nI can ride my bike in the morning and be wearing my pajamas and not have anyone really bat an eye. That's the beauty of Grinders. I've seen other people come in wearing their pajamas, too. It's a little bit like the cafeteria in a college dorm, except the people are of all ages and we live down the street from each other instead of down the hall from each other.\n\nGrinders has a location inside the John C. Lincoln hospital across the street, too. It's common to see the hospital workers walk in wearing their scrubs. I think they're also opening one at Devry, or they just did. I was frustrated to hear that they tried to open a location at the Art Institute but they were one week too late, Stupid Starbucks had just gotten there.
