It seems there are so many breweries out there that offer great beer, and slack off on the food. Unfortunately Rock Bottom is one that falls into that category. Let's be honest, when you go to a brewery, you want the full experience. If it was only about the beer, I'd go buy a growler and take it home. \n\nSo, about the beer....EXCELLENT!!!!! The Jagoff IPA is with out a doubt one of the best IPAs I have ever had! They only I can think of that I think is better is Dogfish Head, but that's a matter of opinion. The beer selection is constantly changing, and they always have some excellent seasonal beers. You can't go wrong, there's bound to be a beer everyone will like. \n\nAs for the food.......it's pretty much a crap shoot. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's terrible. My biggest problem is there is absolutely no consistency when it comes to the food. One time it's perfect, then maybe it's cold, or it's burned, or it tastes completely different from the last time you had it. Unfortunately, it seems there is zero attention to food quality. \n\nThat's pretty much it. This place fixes it's food consistency, and it's a five star place.

He a wheat beer of their brewing, me my fave Bloody Mary with Absolut Peppar.  The hubster deemed the beer acceptable, but wouldn't go out of his way to come back just for another one....yes, he DID order another one \"just to be sure.\"  My Bloody sucked.  Watered down tomato juice with no discernible Peppar of any kind, let alone any other seasonings.  Even a good standard mix would have been better.  Our very efficient and friendly waitress took it back and watched while it was remade by the other bartender.  Nope, no better at all.  That went back and I went with a you-can't-screw-it-up Amaretto sour.  It was fine.\n\nHub ordered a Reuben - why, I'll never know because they simply never measure up to the gold standard of what used to be at the long-lamented Gazebo in Shadyside.  You younguns wouldn't have a clue of the establishment of which I speak.  He said this one was \"fine.\"  I had the Texas Fire steak with jalapeno butter which I enjoyed very much!  Packed a punch of heat and flavor, but the sides were uninspired.  Steamed veggies.  Any flavor was steamed out in the process - eh.  Cheddar mashed potatoes - there was cheddar in there?????  No way!\n\nThe tab was reasonable - we DID have a Living Social deal that took $30 off, so our check was for $12 and change, not including tip.

He is a beer buff, and neither of us had ever been there, so we gave it a go.\n\nWe walked in around 8pm and we were told that there would be an hour long wait. We put our names on the list and went shopping around the area. About 25 minutes later, our table was ready. Parking was a cluster since the lot is shared with Dave & Busters and a karaoke bar called Sing Sing. Tom dropped me off at the door so I could secure our table.\n\nOur server, Jackie, approached me almost immediately and brought two waters to the table to start. She was very attentive and funny, and probably the best part of our experience at the restaurant. Tom ordered a Red Ale and to his surprise, didn't care for it. Jackie gave Tom three free samples of beers she thought he would like after talking to him about his beer drinking habits. He loved all three, and chose the most bizarre (and expensive) beer. Jackie switched the Red Ale to the beer of Tom's choice, and charged us for the less expensive beer. Very nice of her!\n\nWe started out with the Ball Park Pretzels with Jalapeno dip. The pretzels came out quickly and they were very fresh, not to mention huge! We only ate one and took the other to go. Very good app though! \n\nTom ordered some sort of bacon cheeseburger, and I got the Chicken Fried Chicken, which was a pounded chicken breast, breaded and fried, over white cheddar mashed potatoes with a side of gravy and some apple coleslaw.  Tom's burger came with a small handful of fries, and my meal was very spread out on my plate, like something was missing. Not very good presentation at all. The food itself was okay, nothing to write home about. The potatoes were my favorite part. Tom said that his burger was mediocre.\n\nAnother note: The bathrooms are shared with the Sing Sing karaoke bar that is in the same building, so expect drunk singing women in the bathrooms and brides-to-be puking in the stall next to you after enjoying too much alcohol at their bachelorette party...

The one chain that I can't break from is rock bottom. \n\nTheir beer is always good- as far as their staples go, I really love their white ale. Their seasonal IPAs have been good and my favorite seasonals of all time included their chocolate raspberry stout (...yes, it tasted as good as it sounds; they had it last year around Christmas) and their smoky BBQ brown ale (tasted like summer, complemented BBQ amazingly ; they had it this past summer, I bought a growler of it lol). \n\nAs far as their food goes, I typically stay away from the appetizers. $10 and up is a little too pricey for me as far as appetizers go. I've had their southwestern rolls and they were good but not worth $10. \n\nAlmost every time I go I order the Baja chicken sandwich. It's my favorite chicken sandwich! So good. The chicken is actually grilled (which goes for all of their chicken sandwiches) and I love the charred flavor that it has. The bun is soft but sturdy and doesn't fall apart while eating the sandwich, the sauce is amazing, the onion frizzles are the best and last but not least... There's a half of a fresh avocado on this sandwich. Mhm! I love it. My boyfriend usually gets the hickory BBQ bacon chicken sandwich and loves it as well. \n\nAnother item I ALWAYS get... Their apple coleslaw. I've yet to find better coleslaw in a restaurant. So simple, yet oh so good. \n\nThey also recently changed their fries and these are much better than their old ones. \n\nTheir side salads are awesome as well. They are decent in size- spring mix topped with sunflower seeds, raisins, half of a hard boiled egg (which I give to the boyfriend), chopped cucumbers and tomatoes and croutons. Yum! \n\nI usually order the same thing every time I go. I steered off my normal path once and ordered the buffalo Mac and cheese and found it to be quite tasteless.

It's clean and tidy, and you can stock your fridge and pantry as you see fit, and with a pleasant 'How ya doin'?'\n\nKuhn's still does the double-coupon thing, and they have some pretty good sales - ten boxes of pasta for ten bucks, the weekly soda sales - three fridge packs for nine bucks beats monster bird's $12.\n\nNow I will say that on occasion, it will feel a little like you've somehow been sucked into deep Appalachia in regard to some of the clientele, but that's pretty much everywhere in da burgh that's on the 'outskirts'.

There is a police officer that sits at the front of the building, which is good, that makes me feel a bit better. Most cashiers are friendly and nice. Some are very slow. The shift supervisor that hangs out around the cash registers is extremely unfriendly and often shows little disregard for her job, her employees, and customers. More than once she has yelled at me to \"move faster\" when using the self checkout, and when my self checkout lane has needed the assistance of an employee because it wasn't working, she makes sure you know you've bothered her from what she was doing. I can't wait to return to this Giant Eagle so I can get her name and post it on my Yelp review. Hopefully someone will get her some customer service training or etiquette classes.", "business_id": "BG4N0V93wml9kaU6YYRxRA", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-09-17", "type": "review"}

It took me far too long to come around and love Tazza D'oro. A horrible ex of mine loved this place and I admit that this soured me. I regret the time I wasted not going here. The dark wood inside comforts me. The small tables outside are a great place to spend the summer. \n\nTazza D'Oro brews Batdorf and Bronson beans (amazing), provides Enrico pastries (amazing) free wireless (amazing) and one of the most talented and friendly staffs I've ever met (amazing). Everyone who works there is *so* nice and *so* good at what they do. \n\nThey have a small menu of local/fresh food that looks amazing, but I have never actually eaten it. The espresso served here is actually better than the average shot served at Batdorf and Bronson locations in Olympia, WA. I talked about this with one of the barristas at TD'o and they were offended - \"we calibrate our machines the same, we use the same beans, the exact same blends and milks and everything, it can't be different.\" Sorry, Tazza D'oro, you are better. \n\nThe lines get long on weekend mornings, but they move quickly. There's a sense of community nestled here, just off the \"main drag\" of Highland Park, between Bryant st. and the reservoir.

Tucked away in the middle of a charming old residential neighbourhood, you'll likely miss it the first drive by. Turning around is worth it.\n\nYes the staff tends to be the typical hipster, bike-riding sort that so commonly seems to staff indie coffee shops, but they're friendly and unpretentious, so don't hold it against them.  The patrons are almost exclusively college students (anyone else tends to drive by and take their coffee to go), though hipsters are actually in the minority here.  Anyone under the age of 25 will fit in perfectly, and no one 35 and under will feel uncomfortable.  \n\nThe noise level is perfect.  Most students are on their laptops with headphones, a few are chatting quietly, and the background (indie) music is just that.  You don't need headphones to concentrate here.\n\nDecor is decent without being great.  The ceiling is crossed by beautiful wooden beams, and the floor is a pleasantly bland creamy ceramic tile.  So is the wallpaper, though the original modern paintings tend to help make things interesting.  Where it loses points is in the furnishings: the mixture of wall lamps, hanging fixtures, and pot lights doesn't work well, the serving bar itself is an ugly cheap laminate, and the touches of plastic greenery dribbled around the place fails misserably.\n\nIced water is provided, which is decent (plastic cups are a minus), but inferior to the mineral water other places serve. We tried their richly brewed Ethiopian to rave reviews, with the party split on whether the thick ceramic mug was a plus (hefty and warming) or minus (hard to drink from). Truly fantastic coffee, but the lattes were rather disappointing: Beautifully steamed milk in every cup, but a rather bland espresso shot left the latte rather lacking in the nuanced flavour one finds in a 5 star establishment.  The medium latte (12oz, with 2 shots of espresso -- the steongest ratio they offer) should have been far better.\n\nThe food looked worth having, but we'd just eaten. Homemade pastries and fresh sandwiches looked tempting, and we certainly will come hungrier next time.\n\nA solid four stars, held back a bit by decor and a lot by espresso.", "business_id": "83_p9vIqOq1TUIf3_GD7bA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-09-05", "type": "review"}

They're small, so get 2 for yourself at least :)\n\nWe've also tried the Nutella tart, which i've had twice now because it's SO DELICIOUS. The fruit tart is not bad, cinnamon buns are great, jewish pizza is ok (not what I was expecting - it's kinda like a fruitcake - like the dreaded holiday kind - but denser and drier), strata (eggy bread dish) which was pretty good, key lime cake - so so good, and quiche (good). \n\nSeating is hit or miss, since there's only a few tables (3 of them seat 4 people, 1 seats 2 people). On a quieter morning you should be able to find a seat. They serve coffee as well (nothing to write home about), $2 a cup, but if you like coffee with your dessert like me, it's nice to have.", "business_id": "YMEtEsUDQKOYJOcE5Fx3gQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-09-10", "type": "review"}

You walk in and the wonderful smells just overwhelm you in just an amazing way. The ambiance is that of an old style kitchen- personally, it reminds me of one of my aunts kitchens, which gives it that homey feel that is so comforting. They have seating- which I never saw in any bakeries prior to this one. They also serve coffee and encourage you to take a seat and enjoy your sweet treat. \n\nThey offer such a unique array of sweets. Definitely not your typical bakery. Pies, tortes, mooses and cookies.. And when they do have cinnamon rolls, grab them! They are a hot commodity! My personal favorite is their key lime pie. Oh my goodness. It's amazing. They have had it every time that I came, thank goodness. Their key lime cake is phenomenal as well. Their fruit tarts are incredible, the chocolate moose is amazing- they have a lot of items with fresh fruit which I love! \n\nMy only critiques- the hours: they are closed on Mondays and Sundays :/, not ideal for someone whose only day off is typically Sunday. And also, they write all the items thy have in the case on a small chalkboard posted on the wall to the right of the case. Every time I go, I find myself asking the employees what everything is, which I find to be a little annoying. Regardless- it's worth it.

(I guess I'm not cool enough to ride Pat Transit from the South Pittsburgh home).  When I find a place to park, after the Lexus SUV (HA!) pulls out, I find that they didn't put their cart back.  \n\nSo I enter the store and admire how their design is very appealing to the eyes (how DO organic oranges get so ROUND and so ORANGE) and everything is stacked so neatly.  Then I read that a pound of these oranges are $1.99...  Then I go to the meat section, which I don't even eat, to find that the prices are double those of Trader Joe's or even Market District (see future review).  So I walk around and debate to see if I should buy Clif Bars and Naked Juice (which happens to be on sale) because LORD KNOWS I don't need bulk-blanched-almonds.  But then I decide to buy \"fresh\" CHUNKY peanut butter because it would be fun to try.  (When I get home later, however, I bought Valencia peanut butter, whatever the hell that is, and cannot stomach it.  Gimmie my Jif.)  So while I am waiting in line, I see the  bikes (those rebellious urbanites moved from Quiet Storm) and wonder if my money is better spent elsewhere.  \n\nRegardless, I whole-heartedly (no pun intended) support organic and sustainable farming, but I'd rather go to the farmer's market or drive a bit further out of the city to go somewhere real to buy my \"whole food\".

My dream weekend starts with waking up and taking a nice long walk, stopping for coffee then heading on to WF to pick up Eggs Rancheros Burritos and Sausage patties from the breakfast bar. I may get creamed by a bus the second I leave, but I will die happy. \n\nSome of my other favorites are a Vegan General Tso's \"chicken\" that has the BEST real chicken texture. It's really good! The mozzarella pasta salad, Sicilian cauliflower and the egg rolls which are seasonal. Don't forget to check out the packaged hot foods across from the salad bar; same stuff but pre-packaged. \n\nAs a note though, the chicken fiesta soup is nooooot good. Bland with a capital B! In general the soups are hit or miss, but a real hit is the triple squash or Butternut squash, something like that. It's next to sushi. It's very good", "business_id": "wfCLz9-aeShbPB7CaTY-qQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-10-09", "type": "review"}

I first visited whole foods in February of this year.. In my opinion, it is a little overwhelming at first and here's why. Like most People in the US, I was brought up on all of the \"typical\" mainstream American food brands. So when I walked into this place and barely recognized any brands, it was slightly overwhelming. It took a little research and I still do some research on some products before making a trip. I recommend going online and checking their coupons before making a trip - I tried a bunch of new products that way. I have also googled \"best snacks at whole foods\" to get some more ideas of what to try. \n\nNow here's the sucky part- overall, whole foods is pretty overpriced. BUT I will say that it is not ENTIRELY their fault. They sell higher quality products than your average grocery store. Mostly all of their products are made with the best ingredients and are often organic and gmo free. They are vegan and vegetarian friendly and have tons of options for people with allergies. If companies are spending more money on better ingredients , they are going to have to sell their products for a higher price. \n\nHaving said that, tazo tea for $4 a box is not a sale. I went a couple weeks ago and saw the sale price advertised, did a quick google search and realized target sells their tazo tea for $3.50 NOT on sale. Needless to say I took the trip down the street and saved myself some money for the tea. I also recently wanted to purchase kale chips that I heard so much about (brand is called brad's raw and the flavor was vampire killer)... Until I realized they were $9 for 2 oz ! You can get fresh kale for less than half the cost! \n\nAlthough whole foods can be expensive they aren't ALWAYS that bad. My favorite yogurt, wallaby organic yogurt, is sold here. On a normal day, it cost $1 each. A couple days ago, they were 89 cents each- not bad for organic yogurt. They also have an amazing selection of uniquely flavored chocolates and they are pretty reasonably priced. Justin's organic peanut butter cups are incredible! \n\nThe customer service has  always been awesome in this particular location. I hear that whole foods is very willing to take back anything that you don't enjoy , as long as you have your receipt. \n\nas other yelpers have said- the parking sucks in this location, it's a nightmare. So keep that in mind before you visit. \n\nOverall, when I want to treat myself a little, I come to whole foods.", "business_id": "wfCLz9-aeShbPB7CaTY-qQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-11-25", "type": "review"}

I love the produce selection, the cheeses, and the meats. The hot bar is lovely and the bakery pretty good. When I moved to Pittsburgh, I was elated to finally have a Whole Foods I could shop at! \n\nBut the experience is just... unpleasant. Humans in BMW's/Audi's/beat up subarus have turned into vultures, circling... waiting... for the next spot to open up in the impossibly tiny lot. There are no words to describe the anguish of being stuck behind one of these vultures stalking a shopper with a full grocery cart, only to see a spot just ahead, that someone else pounces on while you helplessly look on. It sounds trivial and I get that this is a city, but is this what one really wants to deal with as they are trying to run errands on their day off when there are other, less stressful options near by? \n\nAnd, you know, I think the trauma of trying to find a parking spot remains with the shoppers long after parking their car because people the atmosphere is kind of stressful inside as well. The jockeying for the shortest line in the check out, the pushing people out of the way for the last organic horseradish root... it's about the same as any other urban grocery store but after the parking! Knowing the dangerous gauntlet I must run to get back to my car with my groceries! The prices! It's just not worth it. \n\nAnd I'd be willing to forgive all of this if it were an above average Whole Foods, but it's not. This brings me, at last, to the turkey. I called ahead in late October TWICE to make sure the turkey I ordered would be fresh for Thanksgiving. It was supposed to be fresh. It was labelled fresh. But it was frozen. If I'm going to pay 60 bucks for a bird, it really should come as labeled and advertised. I don't need the stress of hoping my bird will thaw before the big day (spoiler alert... it won't).

There are enough good options on the menu that a seasoned QS diner could guide a newbie past the landmines of total-miss dishes, in search of the greener pastures of the spicy peanut tofu wrap and other local faves. The scrambled tofu is a shining star. The kitchen often does remarkable things with potatoes. The salads go above and beyond to woo your heart, with way more toppings & stuff than any other salad I've eaten in Pittsburgh -- this includes salads served with French Fries! Nothing here is fried - even the \"fried\" foods are baked. Your arteries are grateful. The kitchen is unfortunately very inconsistent, and an attentive & caring cook is a very different experience here than the apathetic, distracted or exhausted cook. \n\nThis used to be The Place to Brunch, and I'm sure it's still busy on the weekend mornings, but I had to quit when all these SUV families started monopolizing my fave tables -- apparently the QS made it into some kind of \"VISIT PENNSYLVANIA\" travel guide as a great brunch spot. I hate to be that \"I liked their old stuff better\" kind of a person, but, well... \n\nDon't be caught unawares- in my cashless world, dinner at the QS means making a special ATM run. \n\nThe QS is super kid-friendly. Books, magazines, and children's toys accompany the wireless internet (which sometimes works, and sometimes doesnt, and no, the staff can't help you). The menu is kid-friendly, the staff is used to dealing with kids, and if you really hate children, you might not want to go there since their peals of laughter and joy might melt your wicked black heart. I wouldn't hesitate to take the 2 year olds or 12 year olds I know. \n\nThe drip coffee is good and bottomless- soy creamer is available. The espresso drinks are really really hit or miss. You may have the tastiest drink you could imagine, or you might be left choking down a $5 drink made by someone who has never drank a cup of coffee. No liquor license but you can BYOB for a nominal charge. \n\nThe service is sometimes swift, but more often lacking. I would never take a date here again --- getting the totally wrong order & waiting half an hour for it to be even acknowledged by the staff is an embarrassment when you tell your date the restaurant is one of your faves.

To top it off, almost all flavors were available in the form of vegan milkshakes. How they concocted all of these culinary ideas is absolutely beyond me. (I apologize to the coffee drinkers. As a tea drinker myself, I hardly paid attention to that half of the menu.)\n\nThe apple panini I ordered came out quickly and was complemented with a side of tortilla chips and salsa.

The apple butter, which seemed almost an add-on when I looked at the menu, was actually the star here and the sandwich comes on sundried tomato bread that really adds a lot of flavor to a very simple idea.  My only complaint is about the size of the sandwich.  It could have been larger.  My girlfriend ordered a burrito that was honestly huge and she found it tasty and worthy of a doggie bag.  I would definitely go back and would like to try their weekend brunch, which is supposedly quite good.\n\nAccording to the menu and reputation, Quiet Storm goes out of their way to use local products and makes quite a few of their products in-house.  That's always a good thing especially when the results are tasty and relatively affordable.", "business_id": "PzG0XmAmtXFs6Fdnubf41g", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-09-27", "type": "review"}

I have returned now in 2011 for a veg brunch, and it was a pleasant, if not-so-good-value-for-money experience.

In that it does some things right, but none of the important things.  It has a decent sized shop with large windows and its bright, so that's good.  They have good music, but unfortunately we were seated right below one of what looked like two speakers in the place.  Its a large restaurant so in order to make it the right volume for people far away from the speaker it has to be too loud for the people close to the speaker.  I know the trade-offs of sound systems all too well.  If only there was a way to solve this problem like... just riffing here... more speakers at a lower volume?\n\nThey had a greatest hits of the thrift store type of decor and the standard shitty artists selling their paintings like at every coffee house you've ever been to.  They include coffee/tea/juice/whatever in the price of the brunch because, like everyone, I hate choices too and I definitely wanted at least one of those.  I'm looking at the menu and its a vegan/veggie place so we're never going to be good friends but I'd like to think that there's something that looks halfway decent but it all looks awful.  There are two Tex-Mex-Ranchero breakfast dishes... that's at least one too many; and there's only like eight choices which sounds like plenty as a number but I assure you it was not enough here.\n\nI go with the Egg Frittata as my least bad option and it ends up tasting mostly flavorless but with a distinct stale note.  It comes with a salad that is not bad, but who wants a salad for breakfast.  As we're leaving the waiter, who's been fine the whole time, asks us where we're from and my girlfriend answers \"D.C.\"  The waiter replies, \"Oh, I'm sorry about that.\"  Now, neither of us is actually born in the D.C. area, nor do I even particularly like living there.  So I'm not personally offended, but I'm not sure if someone from or living in Pittsburgh has solid footing to talk the business about Washington D.C. or almost any other large city.  Its not like property values in Pittsburgh are indicating that everyone's clammoring to live there, whereas in Washington D.C., they are.\n\nI was not enjoying the restaurant before that, but this kid actually threw me to straight up hating it.

The worst thing about this place is also Sam.\n\nWhat was great was that Sam made me feel at home and treated me like someone he had known for a long time. He took me to the back of his warehouse, gave me a free beer to drink, and engaged me in plenty of conversation. At one point, though, he said, \"You look oriental, but you also look American.\" I'm pretty sure he wasn't meaning for it to be offensive, and I just discounted it as his being an old man who didn't know it was no longer politically correct to say things like that.\n\nThis is not why I recommend against Caruso's, however. The reason why I'll never go there again is because Sam knowingly sold me expired beer.\n\nI was on my way back from the North Side to the East End where I live and after seeing these good reviews, I decided to stop by. I wanted a case of Yuengling, but Sam said, \"Why don't you try this instead,\" and popped open a fresh bottle of Castello, an Italian beer. He had me drink it, all the while espousing its comparative taste to Yuengling at a cheaper price point. It certainly tasted alright, and a case of it was a couple dollars less than what Yuengling was going for.\n\nSince the Castello tasted fine, I ended up buying a case of it on Sam's recommendation. A few days later when I opened the box and drank a couple of the beers, however, I noticed that they tasted funny. That's when I looked at the label and saw how each of the bottles had its \"sell by\" date marked out in black Sharpie. You could see the numbers underneath the Sharpie, and the dates were for well over two years ago. So basically, Sam had convinced me to buy something he hadn't been able to sell, knowing that I lived in the East End and probably wasn't going to visit again anyway.\n\nStale beer aside, there's another big reason not to go to Caruso's: Their prices are steep--$24 for a case of Yuengling. While Sam might be a more charming character than the young folks at my neighborhood distributor Pistella's, at least I know that Pistella's has significantly lower prices and actually has enough customers and product turnover that they won't purposely sell me something that's not fresh.", "business_id": "zq--BGVHu7_fb1VHEwg2ow", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-10-15", "type": "review"}

Despite being much smaller than most Giant Eagle stores, this one offers a decent selection of international foods, organic products, and vegetarian/vegan items.  I regularly buy produce here and see no difference between the quality/freshness of what this store offers and what other Giant Eagle stores sell.  The main difference in the produce section is, truly, the lack of dim, directional lighting that new and newly renovated stores use to give their produce that false garden-fresh glow.  Harsh overhead lighting doesn't create much of a mood, but at least I can see clearly enough to choose the freshest items.\n\nAs for all the remarks about this store's clientele...wow.  It's amazing how people in the politically-correct 21st century manage to find new ways to express 19th-century bigotry.  All the comments about \"thugs\" and \"bums\" and \"EBT cards\"?

Generally, even though they weren't busy, everyone seemed as though they'd rather be somewhere else. I asked whether their beef was USDA Choice, the butcher responded that it was angus beef. There was no sign that it was \"certified angus beef,\" which is only choice or prime grade, so I can only assume that was referring to the breed of cattle, and had ignored my request for the grade of beef being used.

This place has been here for years, and as I sit drinking my bitter, bitter coffee, and smelling the overwhelming scent of (I believe) dog pee, I wonder how it's even possible.  \n\nThe three times I've been here, I'm greeted as if I'm a colonial space marine trying to fish a child out of a vent.  They always sit in the corner peeking over the top of the counter as if I am terrifying to them, then duck out of the way.  Then grudgingly come when I peek around the counter at them.  If I didn't, I'm convinced that they would just sit there, as if they're not certain of what position they hold in this place, or what the next step should even be.  This is what I like to call, \"The Dance of Shitty Customer Service.\"  \n\nToday (and I write this longingly looking over at Square Cafe) I decided to give it a chance because it never is crowded, and I figured the quiet would be a good thing.  The girl at the counter was on the phone, and that's the way it stayed for two minutes until I said 'excuse me?'.  The charming reply: \"Yeah?\" She grudgingly got off the phone, and after accomplishing the Herculean task of handing me a cup, I pumped this swill that I'm currently drinking.\n\nShe's currently muttering under her breath back in her corner.  I'm not sure if maybe she's having a bad day, or she's just an asshole, but...if I had to bet, I'm going with asshole.\n\nThis place has pretty expensive coffee for how awful it is, and the food...Just don't eat the food.  \n\n(side note: this place isn't quiet at all when somebody orders something.  She stomps around like she's being sent to her room.  Then continues muttering)\n\nOkay, so this place is a travesty.  Bad coffee, bad odor, bad lighting, unbelievably bad, grudging service.  I would beg the owners to put any effort into this place.  As it is now, it's cornered the market in Regent Square, and sits like a middle finger boastfully pointing at the people of Braddock Avenue.", "business_id": "D9sHwmqlNkrVxmX-057i1g", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-10-04", "type": "review"}

The kid at the counter was nice enough, so service was not an issue. The atmosphere inside pretty much sucks though...and you have to work pretty hard to make a cute little neighborhood coffee shop have zero atmosphere. \n\nThe first thing you see when you walk in a sign alerting you of the \"RULES\": to not use your cell phone at the counter, and that you must pay for something to sit inside, use the restrooms, or use the WiFi. Now, I understand the sentiment of these rules, they are common sense and fair. But it's a rather negative note to start off your experience being yelled at by a sign assuming you are there to steal their interwebz. It just doesn't feel warm or welcoming somehow. The front counter is poorly organized and rather unattractive. If it ever gets busy in there I'm willing to bet it gets rather chaotic.\n\nI ordered an iced vanilla latte, so I was quite surprised when the kid pulls out a pitcher from the fridge of what I can only guess was refrigerated espresso. That was rather disappointing; there's no reason an iced latte shouldn't be prepared with fresh espresso shots. Not surprisingly, it tasted bitter like...old espresso. Then I finished the drink to find the cup was 90% full of ice. I mean, come on. My lemon almond biscotti was delicious. The rest of the offerings in the pastry case appeared pretty underwhelming though; standard prepackaged muffins and cookies. With the number of excellent bakeries in this area, I don't see why they couldn't partner up with someone to provide some higher quality foods.\n\n\nI think this place could learn a lot from Square Cafe as far as decor and atmosphere go. It needs a little pep, a little warmth, SOMETHING. And they need to learn how to make iced lattes correctly. And they could also use an upgrade on their website...it's pretty amateurish and has a 1992 flair... Basically they just need to show a little effort.\n\nI love to support local businesses, but there should be more of a reason for me to return than the fact that it's the only coffee shop in town.", "business_id": "D9sHwmqlNkrVxmX-057i1g", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-11-19", "type": "review"}

The comments should be obvious to those with any common sense, but unfortunately, I find myself having to state them anyway. First and foremost, and I feel like i am stating the obvious here, the cinnamon & sugar (c&s) bagels are very sticky, especially on the bottom. With that being said:\n1. Do not store c&s bagels underneath any of the following bagels: onion, poppy seed, sesame seed, everything, or any other bagel that has \"loose parts\". When the loose parts fall off  they stick to the c&s bagel. Biting into a sweet c&s bagel and getting a bite of onion (which I dislike) is AWFUL. \n2. either wipe off the counter or place a new sheet of wax paper on the counter after prepping one of the above mentioned bagels with loose parts. Again, when you place a c&s bagel on top of these loose parts, they stick to the bagel. \n3. when someone orders a tub of cream cheese to go with a c&s, please wrap the bagel. If not wrapped, the container becomes sticky and messy from coming into contact with the bagel.\nI was a \"regular\" at the Market Square location before changing jobs and never had any of the above issues. The C&S bagels were kept on the top shelf and they wiped the counter off after EVERY order.The only good thing I can say about this location is that it has drive through.", "business_id": "uwiD9jxs09xxXG0by_xKuA", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-10-06", "type": "review"}

Frankly they take these ready-made empanadas and microwave them before serving them to the customer, so i don't understand why they coudln't have just gotten some more from the huge mound of empanadas i saw in the store just minutes before. but i was too lazy to ask. also, they microwave the empanadas on styrofoam plates....no comment.\n\nthe 1 taco for $3/ 2 tacos for $5 was probably the best deal that I could find in pittsburgh for some close to authentic mexican tacos as i coudl find.  They indeed pack your taco with a lot of the fixings, but in doing so, they don't realize that all the juicyness that comes from the meat (especially the lengua) causes the little corn tortilla to rip very easily.  i have not been any other mexican joint that serves these style tacos with only one little corn tortilla: they're always made with two corn tortillas with the presumed purpose of protecting rippage.  one star off for that.  The salsa on the side that was left out that was the perfect consistency of the type of salsa i like (non chunky) was somehow too dry.  this may have been due to lack of freshness.  if only it were fresher, it would have been a nice complement to my tacos. on the upside, they prepare the meat from scratch, putting a little blot of uncooked meat on their grill, while they prepare it in front of your eyes. that was a welcome difference for this joint compared to other taco joints.\n\nall in all, compared to the other place in pittsburgh i've tried for tacos (Mexico City), I'd much rather come here.  closer, cheaper, and tastier. mexico city does not do mexican food justice.", "business_id": "buVALudg30kgkDusqB3yJw", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-10-17", "type": "review"}

Pittsburgh simply isn't a big city for them (I've heard San Francisco is the best place for Food Trucks). Other then the occasional hot dog vender they are few and far between here. As far as I remember today was my first street food experience and that took place at Reyna's Taco Shack in the Strip District.\n\nI've been told for the past three months by Kandace that they had the best tacos in Pittsburgh here. Being a fan of tacos, and Mexican food in general, I had to judge them for myself. The shack is staffed by a single man armed with two skillets and few ingredients. I ordered a chicken taco and a steak taco to mix it up a bit.\n\n\nThe Chicken Taco:\n\nKandace might be right. This was easily one of the best tacos I've ever had in my life. Tortillas are something that can easily make or break a taco and these ones were excellent. They were obviously homemade and perfectly cooked. The guy manning the shack briefly grilled them on one skillet then transferred them on top of the filling for awhile. It really added to the overall taste of the taco. The chicken was shredded pretty thin which worried me at first because the chance of it being dry was greatly increased. I couldn't have been more wrong. The chicken was extremely moist and juicy. Perfectly cooked. This guy was a master of his craft. Each taco was topped with a good amount of sour cream, lettuce, tomato, cheese, and cilantro (which was a nice touch). They had three different salsa to choose from but I chose to eat mine plain. I'm glad I did. I could easily eat these tacos 2 or 3 times a week.\n\nThe Steak Taco:\n\nBasically copy and paste everything I just said above about the chicken tacos. I did have one issue with the steak though. It was cut into tiny cubes which made some (not all) pieces pretty chewy. It wasn't as perfect as the chicken but it was pretty close.\n\nThe Rating:\n\nWas it filling?: I had 2 tacos and was pretty full. I could have probably had another 2 but I normally devour tacos\n\nDid I feel gross afterwards?: Not really\n\nWould I go there again?: Yes 100%. I'd like to try a burrito or shrimp taco\n\nWould I order it again?: The chicken yes. I think I'd opt to try something different before I got the steak again", "business_id": "buVALudg30kgkDusqB3yJw", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-09-02", "type": "review"}

Unfortunately, it was not as good as I hoped. The cashier argued with my boyfriend over what kind of dried red chiles to buy, and harassed him when he was browsing the store (she yelled across the store: \"Are you done yet? I already started ringing you up.\"). The house-made corn tortillas were bland and only with the help of a guy running a nearby taco stand (who did not work at Reyna's) did we find the right chiles... The cashier had no idea what we were asking for.\n\nThen there was the Hatch green chile fiasco. Shortly after arriving here, I was searching for Hatch green chile in the area and found out Reyna's would be doing pre-orders. Hooray! I ordered and paid for some online. The website said they would be roasting at the store so I called to ask about it. I was told in a very rude manner that roasting would only happen at the pepper festival, which I would have to pay $7 per person to attend, just to get my chile and get it roasted. Okay, fine. The day before the festival I called the store to confirm that my actual pre-order would be available at the festival. I was mid-question when the clerk on the phone interrupted me: \"What? ... Can you call back later, I'm really busy.\" WTF?\n\nSo I go to the festival to get my chile. The people at the roasting station seem confused when I present my pre-order receipt, but they eventually figure it out, telling me to come back later to get t because it isn't roasted yet. We walked around the festival for an hour then went back, and there is even more confusion over whether ours is ready. Finally they figure it out and give us the roasted chile. Hooray!\n\nOh wait though. We get home and open it up and... Apparently they don't know how to roast it correctly. We bought bulk roasted chiles in New Mexico every year and never had issues peeling it before freezing it. This chile they roasted? It's somehow completely mushy and falling apart, but has almost no visible char, and it's fucking impossible to remove the peel. It's horrible. \n\nSo tl;dr - rude employees, both in person and on the phone. Little product knowledge. And absolutely no knowledge of how to roast green chiles, despite having a whole event around the chiles.

I was so excited while standing in line. \n\nThen the service. First, the girl at the register practically threw the man ahead of us back his credit card. He didn't make a comment but I thought, rude. When it was our turn I asked for a cappuccino and questioned what kind of milk they have. She responded \"uh, 2%\" like I was stupid (rude) then the guy behind her said \"anything you want really\" (not so rude) and so I asked for a whole milk cappuccino. What I received  was a whole milk latte. It's a coffee shop at least get the drink craft down. I can't drink the amount of milk in lattes. I didn't order a latte. So I walked back apologized for being \"that person\" and asked for a whole milk cappuccino less hot so I can drink it right away. She said \"fine\" (Rude). She made me a 2% cappuccino scalding hot. Was it decaf? I don't know but I wouldn't put it past her. As she handed it to me she said in a condescending tone \"this should be enough foam for you\".\n\nThe foam was light and airy. Very pretty. But this isn't what I ordered. I burnt my tongue. And am not a fan of the 2%. Rude. So very rude.

But I still have to give them one star down for the times when I saw them being extremely mean to customers, even more so than what I'm used to in typical Asian grocery stores (dude, that's saying a lot).\n\nBeing a Vietnamese guy born and raised in Little Saigon, Southern California, my transition to Pittsburgh was a little rough. Being the typical student who is afraid of going past the university bubble, I rarely trekked far from school. One day, my friend with a car showed me the beauty that is Lotus. Now I take the effort to make trips there by bus or car because it's worth it. The selection is the most expansive: sure there are other Asian specialty stores, but none as big as Lotus. It's really hard to find Vietnamese cooking ingredients in Pittsburgh, but Lotus has most of it. \n\nThe pricing is pretty legit. For example, let's say I wanted to just get some noodles for some pho (Vietnamese beef noodle soup. If you don't know what it is, Yelp the closest pho restaurant and get a bowl, now). Giant Eagle would sell it for 3-4 bucks. Lotus sells it for $1.50 for about the same amount. And if you wanted rice? Seriously... you can get as much rice as you want. \n\nThen I walked to the fruit isle, I saw rambutan, lychee, dragonfruit, etc. etc. etc. etc. AHH! It's like home! Time to make some \"che\" (Vietnamese dessert). Also, if you are feeling adventurous, they sell durian sometimes too.\n\nOf course, the prices will never compare to my hometown.

So that explains the frequent visits from time to time. I heard they kept the store the way it was after the new management. The style was definitely old school but I liked it. \n\nThey served the ice cream behind the bar and the cash register is behind a glass case. They usually take your order when you come up to the bar or sit down at a table. You actually pay AFTER you eat.  This makes the entire process quite troublesome since the store does get filled up easily and you find yourself standing at the cash register waiting for someone to take your money. I will give them some time for the service to improve since they are new and still learning. Besides that, the man that works there (I assume the manager) is always accommodating and offered us cups of water.", "business_id": "kj3qws3WSMgOotUeACSdFA", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-09-05", "type": "review"}

We came on a Saturday afternoon after walking the strip district. When we entered there were lots of people and and no structure for procedure in ordering. We sat at the bar and waited 5 mins or more to be acknowledged by employees who were making ice cream 24 inches away from us. Literally they kept their heads down and refused to make eye contact. Just when I was about to get up and leave a lady said I'll be with you in a minute thanks for your patience. So I decided to stay and listen to her complain to another employee about a customer who changed her order from cake cone to waffle cone. Maybe that's a thing here in PGH or just the establishments I walk into where employees openly complain about customers in front of other customers.\nMy son only wanted a scoop of ice cream and I had a 1 scoop hot fudge sundae. Some how the total came to $7.38 for that. The ice cream was icy like the kind you would buy in those gallon buckets. \n\nToo bad. It's the kind of place that should be a treat not a 2 star review.

Entering was kind of a wonderment initially, scoping out a somewhat back-in-time feel and appearance, with shelves of old style candies and gums for sale, a menu board with a handful of varieties of ice creams, sundaes and other concoctions available for somewhat reasonable prices. And the Terrazzo floors are pristine and gorgeous. \n\nThe decor is mostly original old soda fountain, with original shelves and display cases, beautiful marble tables and wooden booths, and original snack counter, vintage blenders, etc.\n\nI ordered a double espresso and my friend ordered a coffee, and I do have to say kudos for knowing how to properly fill a double shot demitasse. The espresso was a little on the sour side, but good enough for what I expected at an ice cream store.\n\nI think that what could make this place fantastic would be eliminating the 'youth' from the employee team, or at least replacing them with folks who had a clue what that era represents, and how to recreate it, or, at the very, VERY least, educating the youth on what it was like, and how to recreate it.\n\nWhen I'm sitting at a vintage marble table, sipping espresso from a demitasse, I'm a bit thrown off by hipster music coming from a Pandora box, and a service staff that looks like they just came to work directly from the Urban charter school, dressed like silly high school kids.\n\nI sampled the ice cream, the death by chocolate...and although it tasted 'ok', hearing the story that this old fashioned ice cream parlor bought their ice creams from Penn State Creamery, and did not make their own, well, that was about as 'authentic' as the Necco company candy reproductions being sold to 'look' vintage, but all of which were really just watered down versions of the originals.\n\nThis place could be so much more than it is, a true destination, if the 'theming' was carried through in a more careful and thoughtful manner. Turn off the hipster tunes, and put on some big band or old fashioned malt shop tunes. Try a nice crisp uniform instead of saggy (or skinny) jeans with a sloppy looking over shirt or T-shirt. \n\nWhat should be a very cool and warm, inviting atmosphere plays off as a little cold and sadly weathered.\n\nCreate a few more aspects of the true old fashioned malt shop, ice cream parlour and lunch counter, instead of a 'trendy' collection of outside sourced lunch options, and the run of the mill sundae collection, simply renamed to be 'cool'. Throw in a kitchen sink challenge, maybe some home made baked good...\n\nIt's a very cool little building and spot...with SO much potential. \n\nIn South Florida is a place called Jaxson's...this place ALWAYS had a line so far out the door that they'd hire a keyboardist to play in the parking lot to keep people entertained while waiting, and they'd pass popcorn out to the waiting line.  They also had the vintage candy shelves, and you could truly find ANYTHING still made. Their ice creams were all made in house, and they would have bells and whistles going off if you ate the whole 'Kitchen Sink', or similar creation. They had a nice simple kitschy line of 'real' meals, to accompany the ice cream\n\nTHIS was a 'destination', not just an after thought.  And this is what Klavon's SHOULD strive to be.", "business_id": "kj3qws3WSMgOotUeACSdFA", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-11-08", "type": "review"}

Needless to say, after leaving this place, I felt like the dumbest person alive and am now frightened to ever enter another legit coffee shop.\n\nI walked into Fortunes with a couple of friends and looked at the menu dumbfounded because I had no idea what I was reading.  All I knew was that I had drunk a \"macchiato\" before and had enjoyed it.  So I thought, \"What the heck, I'll order a caramel macchiato.\"  This is how the conversation went with the barista:\n\nMe:  Hi, I'd like a medium caramel macchiato.\nBarista:  So, you want to order OUR macchiato?\nMe:  Uhh...sure...?\n\nTwo minutes later I get a tiny cup with a meager amount of liquid in it.  I turn around and look to my friends confusedly, wondering where I had went wrong.  The barista notices this and gets my attention:\n\nBarista:  That's why I asked you whether you wanted OUR macchiato.\nMe:  Oh...ok...\n\nThe barista, clearly frustrated, takes my cup, pours it out and makes me a caramel latte.\n\nAlright all you avid coffee drinkers, laugh all you want that I had no idea that there is a difference between a Caff\u00e8 macchiato (espresso macchiato) and the American replicate (Latte Macchiato???).  I'm not even sure if what I just said is correct.\n\nFor the drink I got, I can't complain about the price (Did I over- or underpay the actual price of a caramel latte?), especially given the prices at Starbucks these days.  Also, given the fact that I made such a stupid mistake means that this place must be a good coffee shop.  Beyond that, unfortunately, I can't make any judgment -- hence my modest rating.

Every time I get stuck going to Giant Ripoff Market District, I realize how much those rat bastards overcharge for everything.  Penn Mac is so damned cheap for cheese, I can see why people come from all over the place to get it here. FYI...my favorite new cheese is Fleur Vert...it's seasonal, but a game changer of a goat cheese.  I paid $14.49/lb for it.  Giant Ripoff wanted $22.99.  Jerks.  Also, make sure to buy ricotta here...it's freshly made!  Be forewarned...you have to buy your cheeses in 1/2 lb increments.  They like me, so when I ask for a small 1/2lb, I can sometimes get lucky.  \n\nSeriously, go here for cheese, fancy meats (they have frickin' Iberian jamon...good luck finding that elsewhere) and random Italian things.  I wouldn't say the prices on everything else is as cheap as the cheese counter, but I heart it here and am sad that they're not open during normal working people hours(i.e. after 5pm on weekdays.)", "business_id": "niW0ggRVPW5fafcfImdK7w", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-09-06", "type": "review"}

Established in the 1940's, Penn Mac is famous for their cheese selection with hundreds of choices.  I always leave with a small tub of their fresh mozzarella which is made daily and goes perfect with a little basil and cherry tomatoes.  The employees working the cheese counter have all been there for years and are very knowledgeable.  If you're lucky, you'll hear Carol affectionately refer to each customer as \"Dearheart\" as she offers up suggestions and samples to ensure that the customer gets exactly what they're looking for.\n\nThe balsamic and olive oil selections are just as impressive as are the fresh pastas, local breads, olives, and Italian cured meats.  I can't remember a time I've gone to Penn Mac without buying something that I had no intention of going home with.  On this trip, I picked up a few pastas that I can't find at home as well as an aged balsamic that I hope makes its way back to Atlanta without exploding in my luggage. \n\nIf you need any off-the-wall Italian ingredient that you can't find anywhere, I guarantee that Penn Mac not only regularly carries it, but probably has 12 different varieties to choose from.\n\n(For Part IX, go to: http://www.yelp.com/review_share/EnJS6OeeknzOjVUX6RYwlQ/review/8hA8rRHss2PRlroWujzT_Q?fsid=D3ZAe8-bG1Zz-raxtTTr8Q)", "business_id": "niW0ggRVPW5fafcfImdK7w", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-09-03", "type": "review"}

The milk oolong tea is a little more pricey, but tastes almost like buttery popcorn! It is so unique and exquisite. There are so many coffees and teas to choose from that you could get lost all day just smelling the coffees and choosing which ones you want to take home! You can buy tea pots and infusers here to accompany your new loose leaf teas if you need something new or want to try different ways to drink tea. The prices are absolutely phenomenal. Depending on the tea, for about 2 oz of loose leaf teas or coffee, you are looking at a minimum of $1 and some change! The space is small, so it can be overwhelming when it's busy, but once the crowd dies down, you can really take your time and enjoy the coffees and teas without feeling rushed. Definitely check out this place, you won't be disappointed!", "business_id": "TASUnYvk_nvTUyKtroCJSA", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-10-20", "type": "review"}

I considered getting the raviolis, but decided against it because (1) I already had some frozen raviolis in the freezer (though I'm sure theirs are much better); (2) They're not cheap, at $7ish per box; (3) I wanted a hot take-out dinner.  Since I'd heard good things about the pepperoni rolls but had never tried a pepperoni roll, I asked the guy working behind the counter if they had any.  He confirmed that they did, so I bought one of them plus a tiramisu, which came to about $12.\n\nUpon arriving home, I decided to heat up the pepperoni roll in the toaster oven.  It was excellent, with light and fluffy but substantial bread, plenty of pepperoni slices, and a layer of mozzarella cheese.  While I liked the flavor, it occurred to me that some marinara sauce would make it even more flavorful, so I heated up some in the microwave and proceeded to dip the roll in the sauce as I ate it.  (As a newbie to pepperoni rolls, I don't know if this is a common practice.)  Ideally, I should have asked if they had any marinara sauce for dipping, since a higher-quality marinara sauce would have been even better.  Oh, well--I'll do that next time.\n\nThe tiramisu was even better than the pepperoni roll.  I've had tiramisu a couple of times, but I don't seek it out since I'm not a huge fan of coffee-flavored desserts.  This tiramisu is addictive, however, and the espresso-soaked ladyfingers had me wanting more every time I ate a piece.  Even if you're not a big tiramisu fan, I'd suggest trying their version--it's tiramisu the way tiramisu should taste.\n\nPerhaps the most notable thing about this store is that the majority of products appear to be homemade (i.e., non-commercial).  Aside from the items I've already mentioned, they have an assortment of cheeses, pasta, and pizzelles.  I look forward to visiting again and partaking of some more Italian goodness soon!\n\nEDIT: I tried the sun dried tomato basil ravioli, and they were absolutely delicious.

Good friends on the east coast had this famous cake shipped to us in California. \n\nIt was very carefully packed with ice above and below. Bubble wrap around it. The cake itself was on cardboard and sealed in plastic wrap. I was surprised that it was completely intact. A few almonds strayed but that would have happened on a five minute ride home. \n\nWe both enjoyed the cake a lot. A simple white cake with a whisper of custard, good frosting a lots of toasted almonds. Nothing fancy, really, but good real taste. No neon fake tasting frosting with weird sprinkles and layers of goop between poofy tasteless cake layers. \n\nIf I lived closer I would get this cake again.

The prices are higher than some may be used to, but relax, its worth it. You are getting a rocks glass with little ice, filled nearly to the top with your booze of choice, and a mist of whatever else you wanted to water down the drink.

I also am an avid coffee drinker and therefore have a fair amount of knowledge that can be used to compare this place with others.\n\nI visited awhile back. Upon arriving I immediately didn't feel welcome. There were four baristas there and I had to wait over a minute before one of them even greeted me. After ordering I decided upon a mocha. It tasted like hot chocolate. Where was the coffee flavor? All the while I noticed the four baristas standing in a corner laughing with one another while giving off an \"exclusive high school club\" vibe. Geez!\n\nAND....when I left (mind you there was only one other customer in the lobby) I took up my dishware, as well as some others on a nearby table and the dude working just gave me a look and didn't even say thank you! Things like that really bother me. Let me tell you, as somebody who has worked in retail and food it can be a PAIN to be friendly towards customers, but it's just something that should be done in that business.\n\nBottom line: Not terrible, but very underwhelmed by the coffee and service. I highly recommend the Caribou Coffee right across the street. The baristas have always been pleasant and the drinks quite good! I have had far better experiences at the Coffee Tree Roasters in Shadyside and Squirrel Hill which tells me that this one certainly can become better!", "business_id": "I2qqSBe5sWwE9pkC6PgmqA", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-11-19", "type": "review"}

During my first (and last) visit to this store, I received the worst customer service I have ever had in my entire life. Never has any clerk been as rude to me as the man running this store was.\n\nWhen my friends and I walked in, the store was empty and the clerk was stocking the candy aisle. I walked up to the counter to purchase a pack of cigarettes, for which I had a coupon. I waited at the counter for at least five minutes, while the clerk, who had obviously acknowledged my prescence, continued stocking with seemingly no intent on interrupting his task to help me. Finally, I got too tired of waiting and asked him very politely could he get assist me. He blantantly sighed loudly and hesitantly walked behind the counter. \n\nI was in the store with my (female) partner, and one of our friends. My partner and I, who were holding hands, were given a very judgemental, mean look from the clerk as he walked up. Before I asked after my cigarettes, another patron walked in, and lined up behind us. I showed him my coupon, and asked him if he accepted them. Before he even could answer, he took his hand, and physically pushed my partner and I out of the line and waved the man behind us, who was white, clean-cut, in a suit, and obviously heterosexual, up to the front of the line. I stood there, absolutely bewildered at this, not even knowing what to say. He told the man, \"Since these TWO,\" pointing at us and sneering at our interwoven hands, obviously disgusted, \"have no idea what they are doing, and are wasting time, you can go ahead of them.\" At this point, I was absolutely furious, and so completely insulted, that we just stormed out of the store without even commenting.\n\nI have never been so obviously, and literally pushed aside due to a store clerk's homophobia. My partner and I were basically refused service from this man because we are a same-sex couple.

I stop here at least once a week to get my carb on.  I absolutely love this place, and let me tell you why.\n\nI first discovered their delectable bread at the farmer's market a few months ago.  I'm forever on a quest for a good bakery.  The had samples of everything they offered that day, so I got to try a few different things.  That first day, I purchase their spinach and feta bread (like a savory, moist challah bread - so good!!).  The texture was perfect, and the eggs made it such a moist bread.  I also tried their blondies that day.  For two dollars a piece, you get a 3x3x1 (or slightly bigger, depending) bar cookie.  It was so buttery and fantastic!  Since then, I've tried many different styles of their bread and desserts.  Their garlic cheddar bread is divine, and they have some of the best whole grain breads I've ever tasted.  If you like a nuttier bread, their Dakota is chocked full of pepitas and sunflower seeds.  Even their low carb whole grain bread is fantastic, and it doesn't taste like the light bread you buy in the store.\n\nBest of all, they don't use any preservatives in their bread.  They use freshly milled grains (ground within 24 hours), which apparently retains some of the natural protein found in the grain.  They also sell all of their goods within 48 hours and donate unsold bread to charity.  Their ingredient list and nutrition information is readily available on their website, along with a schedule of days when certain bread is produced.  The rotate their menu every month, although they do have some bread they offer every day.  The staff has always been patient, friendly, and helpful in answering questions.\n\nWhen you go to their bakery location, you can try anything they have out that day as well, including desserts, cookies, and \"scuffins\" (a cross between a scone and a muffin).  They also offer sandwiches, homemade jelly, and coffee, but I've not tried any of them.  For the holidays, you can purchase pies or their \"jewel bread,\" which is basically a super delicious fruit cake.\n\nTheir prices on bread are about $4.50 to $6.50, which seems a little steep until I think about all the bread I end up wasting when I purchase store-bought loaves.  It's a rare occasion that the bread I buy here doesn't get eaten.  \n\nIf you're looking for healthy, fresh bread, this is definitely the place to go.", "business_id": "q6liXMxYTMYx7evcgz1eQQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-11-21", "type": "review"}

They also brought sweet tea, unsweet tea, and bottled water.  \n\nThey also prepared an entire table of desserts which included pecan pie, tiramsu, pumpkin pie, assorted brownies, cheesecake pops, and a few other things.  \n\nAgain, everything was delish but I guess we'll all be wearing our fat pants to work tomorrow!

One side is for beer and wine and the other is for liquor.  They are carrying more and more craft beers, but the masses generally aren't buying them.  I've seen Fat Tire, arguably the most popular craft beer next to Sam Adams, close to expiration.  People tend to go here to get a lot of cheap beer for a party and not necessarily to find local or micro brews,  They recently installed a growler station which is decent, but doesn't compare to Grapevine's just a few miles down the interstate.  Two of the four taps were from New Belgium, another one was from a different Coloroda based brewery, and the only Carolina one was Thomas Creek.  I wanted some of that but the keg was spent.  They brought a keg of yet another New Belgium beer - the Ranger IPA.  I got that because it was relatively inexpensive and it's similar to the Thomas Creek IPA.  The actual growler bottles were cheap though at only $3.  Most places charges between $10-20 for your first time purchase.\n\nYou will find the major beer you want in here, although you will really only save money if buying a lot of it.  Also, they offer a cash discount, so if you pay with a credit/debit card you'll pay more (yes, this is perfectly legal).

Like another reviewer pointed out, very basic produce (basically, anything green) is often wilty, slimey and/or brown. I pointed this out to a produce worker once and asked if they had anything more fresh and he went to the back for better lettuce ... which was only slightly better than what was out. \n\nThe prices, however, are my biggest beef. For example, an avocado at Woodman's is $.69-.79 each, whereas at Pick 'n Save, they are $1.69-1.79 each. Now and then they run a sale: 2 for $3. Whoa! The savings! HA. A 96 oz. bottle of Welch's grape juice costs $6.19 at Pick 'n Save; at Woodman's the same bottle costs about $3.59. A container of heavy whipping cream is double the cost of the same size whipping cream at Woodman's. A Palermo's Thin Crust pizza is $6-7 at Pick 'n Save; 2 for $10 at Woodman's (although they have been running an occasional sale at PNS with BOGO on the Palermo's, making them an excellent deal). Small carving pumpkins: $3.99 at Pick 'n Save, HUGE-ASS carving pumpkins at Woodman's were $3.49. And on and on. If you're on a grocery budget, Pick 'n Save makes saving money and getting good buys a major battle of the wits with its customers.

I really liked the scones, but I didn't like the fact that they didn't open until 7 which usually made me a bit late.  I didn't even consider that they might have more than bakery goods, and every time I had stopped the place seemed empty.  This was of course due to the fact that it was 7:01 AM and I was the first person through the door.  So this weekend, based on Chris & Kelly's recommendations, I stopped in for a nice leisurely breakfast before heading into the office.  I found out that all this time I was seriously overlooking a great place right in my neighborhood.\n\nI was a bit taken aback by the number of people inside.  The place was pleasantly crowded, with the warm buzz of morning conversations and a relaxed atmosphere.  I walked up and ordered the breakfast special - I was used to just picking out scones so it took me a minute to get my bearings and find the menu board.  The price was OK, not under $6 but not more than I would have expected anywhere else.  I was given a number and found a nice table along the bookshelves.  I'd never really taken the time to look around the place before, and I was really impressed by the decor.  I got a cup of coffee from the self-service area, which is a great idea - I love diners where your cup is constantly refilled but I tend to keep drinking so long as there's coffee in the cup, leading to the over-caffienated jitters.  The coffee was excellent, truly delicious and fair trade to boot.  I savored it while I read a magazine and waited on my breakfast.\n\nAfter a bit of a wait the breakfast special came out.  The wait wasn't especially long considering the amount of people there, but I was into my second cup of coffee by the time my food came.  It was served on a fairly large plate, so my first impression was that there was not much to it, but this was a mistake.  The special, which was basically a Denver scrambler, was completely satisfying, filling but not heavy.  The wheat toast was much better than the average bread you get with breakfast, quite possibly highlight of the food.  I was pleasantly surprised by the whole breakfast experience here.

The selection isn't on par with Steve's or Woodmans but there are always a decent number of different options.  The standards such as New Glarus and Capital are always present, and there seems to be a nice rotating selection of regional and national micros.  The prices for beer have been rising across the board due to hops and shipping costs but Neil's pricing has always seemed to be relatively equal to most other places of the same volume - no one is ever going to be as cheap as Woodmans but I'm not driving 20 minutes out of my way to save 50 cents.  I've never really perused the wine aisles but I do know they've got Wollersheim's Domaine du Sac at a good price.  I also know that my Chivas Regal is always in stock at a decent price, though the selection of single malts is a bit sparse and seems to be priced higher.  I like that Neil's carries selections for some of the local distilleries such as Death's Door and Yahara Bay.  I managed to get my hands on a bottle of Death's Door white whiskey from here, and they've almost always got the DD vodka which for my money is the best vodka on the market.\n\nBack when the liquor store was called Jersey's the selection was not nearly as good and the store layout was less organized.  When Neil's bought the location they cleared everything out and reorganized the shelving.  The place is showing its age a bit and the parking lot in front of the store is in pretty terrible shape.  I think the other two Neil's stores (Fitchburg & Waunakee) are better stocked and in better shape, but the Middleton Neil's is still a big improvement over the old Jersey's.  The new management has also brought in friendlier employees who actually know their doppelbocks from their IPAs.  I've gotten quite a few decent recommendations from the staff.  The place could still use more room and more selection, but for a quick stop after work or to pick up a sixer to bring to the card game Neil's is better than most.", "business_id": "Aq5tEQ0OFzlDKSUkyISx9w", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-09-23", "type": "review"}

We took one sip and realized it was bad.  The nose was off, and so was the taste.  We decided to return it.\n\nI took it back to the store where I bought it at about 1:30 PM Friday.  The young clerk seemed astounded that I would try to return an opened bottle of wine and refused by request for a refund.  I asked him how we were supposed to know it was bad without tasting it.  He had no answer.  It was plainly obvious that we had drank almost none of the wine and were not trying to cheat anyone.  I just wanted them to make it right.  The clerk was oblivious to my concerns.\n\nThis is a perfect example of extremely poor service.  I have had similar issues a couple times in the past with other local merchants, and they gladly refunded my money.  But not Neil's.

The beer garden (bier garten?) is huge, filled with weather-beaten picnic tables, and covered with a big awning to keep out the sun. Trees insulate the place, and the whole thing is topped off with a nice stage for weekly summer performances by local staples such as Westside Andy and the Mel Ford band. People bring their kids, their dogs, decks of cards and board games, and enjoy the excellent beer that's doled out at the outdoor taps by friendly staff. Bring your own food - some local joints like the Roman Candle will even deliver right to your picnic table.

We would drive up a few times a year to visit them, and after 2 hours of peering out the car windows along 94, my brother and cousins and I would be dying to get out of the car at any of the attractions along the way--Six Flags, the outlet malls, or any of the many cheese shops that announced your arrival to Wisconsin.  \n\nWhen I went skiing with friends at Cascade Mountain last winter, years of unfulfilled longing swept over me and I demanded that we stop at one.

I probably walked out with a good 2 lbs of various cheeses (and am still wondering how those seemed to add 10 lbs to my figure, but that's another story).  In addition, there were the usual Wisconsin knick knacks, including many types of beers, wines, and other kitsch-y stuff like ashtrays and bottle openers.

I love cheese as much at the next guy, but M is seriously addicted to the stuff. It blows my mind how much cheese he eats!  So obviously Mousehouse is his Disney World, and on our way back from Hayward, we of course had to stop here to stock up.  And by stocking up, I mean that we filled a cooler with a variety of cheeses you can't find in your local store. And I will admit that this wasn't the first time we filled a cooler with cheese.\n\nThe inside is a decent size, but it fills up fast so it doesn't take long for claustrophobia to kick in. They let you sample any cheese you'd like before purchasing, which is freakin' awesome! \n\nThe employees are friendly and helpful, which is always appreciated when you're getting elbowed and stepped on by other cheese addicts scrambling to get their fix with a sample slice. A little bit of cheer can (sort of) help you forget about your toes getting smashed.\n\nThey also carry quite a selection of craft beers, and of course fudge, knick knacks, and other Wisconsin-y items. So if you forgot to grab a souvenir elsewhere, you can pick up some postcards, shot glasses, and the like. If you're hungry for more than cheese samples, they do make sandwiches or offer pre-made ones.\n\nSo, we ended up buying ten different kinds of cheese, and with the fancy schmancy check-in offer, I saved 10%.  \n\nChicken soup is one of our favorites; it tastes exactly like the soup.  The Ghost Pepper cheese was fabulously spicy as anticipated. I didn't really care for the Taco Cheese, Raspberry Chipotle Cheddar or Pizza cheese; the flavors weren't what I expected. \n\nTomato & Basil Cheddar, Buffalo Wing, Salami Colby, Cheddar with Bleu Cheese, Green and Black Olive, Horseradish and Chive, and Beer Cheddar were our favorites this time around. The curds are delicious but you can find them anywhere in Wisconsin. The Whips were interesting; it was our first time trying them but we didn't purchase any.\n\nWe once drove here just for cheese. Seriously. We weren't on our way up north or had other plans. We literally drove from Naperville to Windsor just to get cheese for M. \nHis mother commented on our freezer, stating that we could build a \"cheese-gloo\" out of all the bricks of cheese. I laughed at the thought, and without missing a beat, M said \"No, that wouldn't work. I would eat myself out of house and home.\"  And I wouldn't doubt that for a second.", "business_id": "jpxlSFhdrtbNyxS6vB036A", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-09-06", "type": "review"}

Most days the food is tasty if unimaginative, they can accommodate groups, and they usually can get you in and out pretty quick despite the lobby being packed to the gills on weekend mornings. \n\nFor the last few years I've avoided Perkins on the whole because of sub-par food and service from another location (an annual stop after a camping music festival due to their being open on holidays and ability to seat 10-12 of us with no reservation), but my man friend really likes their breakfast and, more specifically, not having to wait for breakfast like you do at most places downtown. Over the summer I had an avocado/queso/english muffin creation that actually really surprised me with how good it was and breakfast potatoes that were clearly deep fried but similarly surprising in how much I enjoyed them. The breakfast combo price was right ($8ish dollars), and for some reason one of the available sides was a muffin, so I came away with breakfast the next day, too. \n\nFast forward to a couple weeks ago when we stopped back in. Sadly, my breakfast find had disappeared from the menu and they appear to have done away with the bonkers muffin side. Nothing was really striking my fancy on the most recent menu, so I decided to pick one of the most ridiculous offerings, an apple cinnamon muffin that was sliced into thirds and turned into french toast. I'm sure it was terrible for me, and while the flavor was surprisingly good, muffins just aren't stable enough to hold up to being battered and so it was kind of mushy mess. Compounding my meh meal was the fact that it took close to 40 minutes for our food to arrive, tracking down our server was difficult, and my appetite was put off by how dirty the ledge under our booth was. We were seated in one of their tiny (but cool) two-person booths along the window and with the morning sun pouring in I could see all the crumbs, bits of paper, and rusty bobby pins on the window sill. If anyone from Perkins happens to read this, please, please clean that up. The fact that the pins were rusty tells me it's been awhile since a vacuum has made its way to that area.

There were only a couple lanes open for checkout, plus the self-check kiosks. We opted for the self-check, and it took so long. So, so long. Part of the problem was that not one, but two machines broke down in the process. The woman in charge of the area had to shuffle people over to the regular checkouts, which took an enormous amount of time. This was in part due to her actually shuffling - instead of shoes she opted for socks. Not okay. Yes, they were cute Packers knee-highs, but you still need real shoes, ma'am. \n\nWhen I finally got up the kiosk, the touch screen and scale were both wonky - it took me nearly twice as long to check out as usual because it kept not recognizing my items or what payment method I'd selected. \n\nI'm glad there's a store available in this area for neighborhood residents, but I will probably start going out of my way if I have to in order to have a better shopping experience.", "business_id": "ZjwZIQM4TfFO7T7ck7FtYQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-11-03", "type": "review"}

After fellow Yelper Tawnie R boldly declared the People's Bakery as the worthy successor to Dimitri's, I knew a trip to the People's Bakery was in the cards for me.\n\nIf you are looking for elegant digs, this place is not for you.  It's a kitschy, little greasy spoon nestled into a strip mall at the corner of East Wash and East Johnson.  There's not a lot of seating and if someone is on the phone, you're going to be privy to their conversation.  In my case, I got a comprehensive update on a bedbug infestation of a family member that the owner's wife was describing in painstaking detail.  And while the chairs and tables are mismatched and the floor tiles are coming loose in places, the eating surfaces were all impeccably clean and the pictures on the wall gave the joint a homey feel.  And the husband and wife team that run the place have a great rapport with the regular customers getting their lunch fix. \n\nI ordered the $5.50 gyros and fries and grabbed a seat.  About ten minutes later, a massive foil wrapped gyros was delivered to my table.  I swear that an entire herd of sheep were sacrificed for this meal.  In terms of quantity, the People's Bakery delivered big time.  \n\nOn the quality side, things were a little less clear cut. First the negatives:\n* The next time I visit, I'm going to ask to have the pita spend a little time on the grill.  This dish deserves better than a cold, doughy pita.\n* More tzatziki sauce please!!!  When you give me a metric ton of lamb meat, I need more than a tablespoon of sauce to balance out the dish.\n* The same can be said of the tomatoes.  I need more than two very thinly cut slices.\n\nNow the positives:\n* The meat was served piping hot, moist and well seasoned.  It was clear this meat wasn't sitting under a heat lamp awaiting the lunch time crush.  The only thing I would have changed is to have a little char on some of the pieces to provide more textural contrast.\n* The onions served with the dish were pure awesomeness.  I'll be honest, I usually pick most of the onions off my gyros because they can overpower the other ingredients with their sulfuric pungency.  With a medium dice, these onions were fresh and sweet and complemented each bite.\n* I l-o-v-e-d the fries that accompanied the meal.  Salty and crunchy on the outside and hot and moist on the outside.   Yummmmmm.\n\nSo, does the People's Bakery unseat Trader Gus as my King of Madison Gyros.  I say it's too close to call right now.  What I do know is that I plan to return to the People's Bakery to conduct more extensive research.  And if you find yourself on the east side with an empty stomach and a light wallet, People's Bakery is an option worth considering.", "business_id": "Ryq600aoE3h8_qRQGIed9A", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-11-16", "type": "review"}

I saw the whole process.  It was not very impressive whatsoever.  The flavor was ok.  \n\n2 - The food.  I had a chili cheese dog.  This is my standard order when it is available on the menu.  The chili tasted like Hormel.  The hot dog was hot and the chili was warm.  I like that they have shredded cheese on it, rather than liquid cheese.\n\n3 - My dining companion got a burger.  It tasted ok, but it was a very thing patty. He also ordered cheese curds with it.  They were so greasy and lacked any good flavor in the breading.  \n\nOverall, we spent nearly $20 there and I was not satisfied with my meal.  Every talks so much about how great the custard is.  Nope.  Not good.  Go to Culver's!  Seriously, for $6 you can get something TWICE the size with more mix-ins.  Better yet?  Get a cone for you AND a friend.", "business_id": "Jb5SB2OXbRW0e7ErGlMK-Q", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-09-26", "type": "review"}

I love free stuff. Even if it appears to be absurd, like a Sunday paper. The deal is, you spend five dollars and they give you a two dollar Wisconsin Sunday paper. Okay, so know you know how I ended up here, let me tell you all about the magnificent Metcalfe's.\n\nIt is just a supermarket. Not of a Safeway variety, but a Gelson's or Bristol Farms variety. Despite the many Yelpers who proclaimed that this is expensive, its not expensive. If you are buying toilet paper or paper towel here, it is expensive, but it is no more expensive on food than anyone else. I don't care about some Brat Fest, I don't even care about brats. Cheese is just cheese, in fact, if you have been to cheese stores in New York and Paris, you realize everything else pales in comparison. In fact, everything pales to New York and Paris anyway.\n\nBack to the review. The store is well laid out, clean, the produce appeared fresh. It was early on a Sunday morning, but a lot of the prepared foods were already out. They looked good, but I don't buy prepared foods in a supermarket, unless its Wegmans, but that isn't a supermarket, its nirvana. Thus I can not assess the prepared section. I do buy baked goods, and it is on this basis that the store failed. As I was walking down the bakery aisle, I noticed a slice of white cake. I love white cake. The soft, dewy white cake, enrobed in creamy butter cream frosting *cue the angels and ethereal music* Anyway, as part of my five dollars, I bought a 2.49 piece of white cake. *gag* How much sugar do you people eat? The cake was okay, but the frosting was just a sugary, you could taste the granules, nightmare. This is not white cake!!\n\nThere was nothing wrong with the store, but if your bakery sucks, it is a good indication that the other prepared foods are not going to be very good and there are also some other flaws. I didn't see anything that was unique or that would make me want to come here. There wasn't any Bell and Evans Chicken. I did see they sold Boar's Head cold meats, which is always a plus, but is it worthy of five stars? No.\n\nSorry Mr. and Mrs. Metcalfe (or whomever you are), work on the bakery, let me know and I will come back and re-evaluate you again.", "business_id": "OxR3b_qcMJlzwzGPU5fmdA", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-11-21", "type": "review"}

It was definitely a bit more than I'd usually pay for trays of meats, cheeses, and the like, but I chalked this up to a wedding expense and didn't think much of it.\n\nCome the day of the wedding, I was happy hitched and getting photos taken when I get a call \"Hi, this is SoAndSo from Metcalfe's and I have a delivery.\" \"Yes,\" I say. \"I'm the bride and I'm not there. There are 2 planners on site as well as venue staff.\" \"But I'm at the back door and no one is here. I have a delivery,\" says Metcalfe's dude. \"I'm not there! I've just gotten married. I'm having my pictures taken. Please just go knock on the front door. There are a bunch of people who can help you.\" \"Yeah, I went to the front door, but it says {the venue} is closed for a private event.\" *FACEPALM* Now I was annoyed. \"YES! And YOU ARE BRINGING THE APPETIZERS!\" I then just snapped a bit and told him to sort it out and that I wasn't to be bothered.\n\nLater (perhaps 20-30 minutes later) we parked our car at the venue for more photo taking and the delivery van from Metcalfe's was just leaving. I got a dirty look.  When I later spoke to the person managing the venue for our reception, he had a laughable mention about the delivery guy as well. Clearly the dude was not a people person and very confused about how to deliver to an event (as opposed to a person's house, etc.).\n\nThe food was good, but didn't have labels as to what it was. I'd asked about this and was told it would have. So our very expensive platter of Wisconsin artisanal cheeses and dried fruits and such didn't get eaten as much as it might have. That thing was *not* inexpensive. I was a bit miffed. \n\nAll in all, the appetizers from Metcalfe's were delicious.

I have never been to a supermarket that has its combination of size, local products and management.  It carries everything from value (Sentry Brands) to premium version of products.  \n\nThey also GIVE out free Sunday papers.  There is no low end of purchase to get this offer - I bought a pack of gum for under a dollar and they asked if I wanted a newspaper.  Righteous!\n\nEvery department runs extremely well.  I've never had a problem with rotten or outdated goods while shopping.  The staff are plentiful and friendly. Even at the busiest times, they staff cashiers smartly and the lines are rarely longer than three deep. \n\nDuring the late afternoon and early evening, you are bound to run into a vendor providing samples of their local product.  Unlike every other store I went to, it's often an owner or manager that handles the stand.  Frequently they even have WINE!  Delicious wine at that. \n\nLocal foods and brands are center stage here.  They are clearly identified as local on their display.  You'll see local everywhere from the bakery, frozen foods and cheeses (of course).\n\nThe only critique is that the deli prepared foods and the bakery are good, but not great.  If I have a little more disposable income, I go down the road to Whole Foods to get my prepared deli/bakery fix.  With that written, I am very picky and their deli is much superior to Copps (read my review of the very sad S. Park Copps -- I really deserve Metcalfe's!) or other like grocers. \n\nAlthough Whole Foods has a short list of better prepared products (for example, their deli and bakery), they cost so much more (it's referred to as \"Whole Paycheck\" for a reason) and have nowhere near the variety and local selection Metcalfe's has.\n\n\nTips:  \n\n1 - Be careful in the parking lot.  Their are many patrons that have lost their driving skill (think that South Park episode) and it may be frightening at times.  Drive very defensively and always given certain drivers the right of way.\n\n2 - Like their Facebook page for insight on demos and events.  For example, last month they had a three-day cheese tasting event hosted by cheesemakers in town for the American Cheese Society Conference. \n\n3 - If you must use plastic bags, Metcalfe's has the best in the business - they are an awesome green (some sort of implied \"gentle\" dig, I know ... but whatever) and very sturdy.  I use those for my small wastepaper baskets - they look and hold up better than anything I paid Hefty for...", "business_id": "OxR3b_qcMJlzwzGPU5fmdA", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-09-09", "type": "review"}

Especially if you are looking for quick American Chinese that is not super greasy- this is seriously my go to- not a Chinese restaurant. \n\nSo are there cons? \n\nAs far at Grocery Stores go Metcalfes is not the most affordable. I do not do my regular shopping her for that reason. But that date night when you want to get good ingredients- This place. That weird ingredient a recipe call for- this place. Food for company- this place! Great quality produce- this place.

They are very organized package bakery perfectly.  I never had anything smushed by being jammed in (like other places).  They rarely struggle with stocking or maintaining an attractive display.  I have never felt ignored or frustrated by cash handlers.  These are amazing accomplishments factoring in the madness of the CSFM.\n\nMy change your life recommendation is their Napoleon. It is the eclair's hotter sibling. Oakhouse's offering is a ginormous & gorgeous pile of puff pastry, vanilla cream and vanilla/chocolate glaze decadence.

A line had formed at the bar, so my date and I joined and waited for several minutes before a server came to take our order directly from the line.  Though the place was packed, servers also came by to check on us after we found a seat.\n\nThe place offered a broad selection of wine by the glass, in addition to a few beers.  For wine, prices stayed mostly around $7 to $10 per glass, but house wines sold for $5.  Given the busy state of service, I wasn't able to ask, but I'm sure that all the wines chosen for the bar (just like the wines sold at Corkscrew) are favorites of the people who work there.\n\nJudging from the interior, construction has still not been fully completed (unless they're going for that industrial grunge look).  Bare wood panels were exposed on some walls, but the place was still in fine state for a night where people were more excited by wine and conversation.

We said forget it, and went next door to Cracker Barrel and got seated & our food very quickly.  \n\nIt appears that the other reviews for this location are similar to what we experienced.  Poor management, poor attitudes, and I can only imagine what goes on with the food preparation.

The drinks are almost always tasty and the food is pretty good.  Their sandwiches are freshly made every morning, with day-old sandwiches marked 40% off.  I like the chicken salad sandwich, which has cranberries in it.  Nom.  Baked goods are ok but a bit overpriced.  Good Americanos and their cappuccino royale is also a good choice (cappuccino with an extra shot).  They also have cold-brewed iced coffee (iced Toddy), which is really tasty.  It's written on some chalkboard SOMEWHERE around the counter, not on the main menu.  Aside from the iced Toddy I've never gotten regular coffee here, so can't comment on that.\n\nI think their prices are reasonable--on par with other cafes in the area.  They have good daily specials--I almost always get what ever the special is (there's one for each day of the week,  same specials every week).\n\nThe staff at this location are friendly and efficient, although they frequently make errors when ringing up orders (sometimes to your benefit...sometimes not), so pay attention that you're not being overcharged by accident.\n\nI generally avoid the bathroom here because it's awkward and I can never tell if there's someone actually in there or not.  Some of the comfy armchairs downstairs are kind of grimy and gross, but they are indeed cozy.  I like that there are a lot of small tables, and I don't think I've ever not been able to find a seat, despite the waves of students that pass through here every hour between classes.\n\nOverall, good stuff.

I order a house coffee to start off with, and after I taste it I am horrified at what I've been drinking out of my Mr. Coffee in the mornings.\n\nI grab a table next to a wall, and next to the place where the cook the food.  And right over the air conditioning vent.  I really don't study well when I'm hot, so the air conditioning was a huge plus.  The food smelled great, the lighting was perfect, it wasn't too loud with people talking, but the soft background noise helped me to focus and study.\n\nI tried the pesto turkey panini which was fabulous.  And they wear gloves when they make your sandwhiches.  And cute garnishes.  And the coffee was reasonably price (I always think paying over $5 for a sandwhich is a little too much, but you're paying for wifi and atmosphere as well... and supporting a local busines... so...  I suppose it's worth it).\n\nOverall I plan to spend many a weeknight there studying and drinking coffee (although I may have to switch to decaf because I was up way too late after that!)\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nOkay, not all tables and chairs are created equal.  I ended up sitting at a very uncomfortable table.  Now if I was just there hanging out with friends and playing a game or something, I probably wouldn't have cared.  But I was trying to read and study, and sometimes I fidget or sit cross-legged on the chair, but the table had these panels on it that made it too short to do either.\n\nAnd the tables that look out the glass front window are great to people watch, but once it gets dark the lighting is pretty low.  To visit and chat- no problem.  But studying- towards the back would be better.\n\nLuckily someone left and I grabbed a different table.  But still, great coffee, music, and good place to go.  I still definitely recommend.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nI was here the other night, and maybe it was a fluke last time, but there was plenty of lighting by the tables in the front, by the windows...

The store also has a serious shoplifting problem. I'm not sure if they just don't staff the loss prevention unit, or if they are inept, but I have seen at least four episodes where a cashier is confronting a thief. It makes for an unsafe situation for everyone. They do have private security there, and the guys seem really nice, but clearly in over their heads. At this point the store is so far gone, they really need off-duty police officers to make it safe.\n\nIt really seems like this store just doesn't give a shit.

She said they give hefty portions, so I thought to myself that this might just be a good replacement for my vodka concoctions.\n\nThe place is called A Touch of Yogurt, and their fro-yo is yummy to the tummy. They are pretty generous with their servings, and the toppings you choose to include in your fro-yo. And then when I did some diggin' about fro-yos, I found out fro-yo can: 1. Help to overcome lactose intolerance; 2. aid digestion of milk protein: 3. help prevent and combat digestive tract infections. Okay...fro-yo had me at \"overcome lactose intolerance...\" that's all I'm going to say about that! They change their menu of flavors...you know, to mix it up a little...keeps you guessing.

Even though I prefer spicier food, the mild salsa verde was very flavorful and delicious.  The salsa habanera had a good kick to it and satisfied my craving for something hot.\n\nLa Tolteca is awesome, and it's unfortunate that I didn't find it until after I moved out of Phoenix.

It was definitely one of the best salsas I've ever had, and my girlfriend considered it the best she had ever had. That's not to be taken lightly because we eat salsa almost religiously. Because my girlfriend got the chilaquiles, I went with the huevos rancheros. They were piping fresh and everything one would expect. The second I cut open the yolk of the egg and saw the yellow and red run together, I knew I was in for a treat. The flavors of that mixed with beans and a little rice were really great! For those of you that have had good huevos rancheros before you'll know what to expect. Alright, and lastly the chilaquiles. In all seriousness, these were the best, and I mean the BEST chilaquiles I've ever had! I'm not sure exactly what was going on in the kitchen, but I suspect a tiny sprinkling of crack right before it was served to us, but that may have just been the garlic.

Now I can get a roasted chicken here too, and while priced equally to Costco or Safeway...neither give you the tortillas and salsa that make it a meal.\n\nOther times I have picked up some ceviche at the fish counter, and for the price/lb they include avocado, tostadas and  extra limes. Again a full meal.  They will also fillet or fry up any whole fresh fish right there for you. \n\nYou can't forget your fresh pasteries, baked goods and cakes.  Or maybe just some Ice Cream or a large agua fresca in one of at least 6 flavors. Of course now that the fall is here they also serve up Mexican Hot Chocolate and Chompurado....\n\nIf you are in for a cultural experience stop in here.  Don't worry most people speak both English and Spanish.  I prefer to practice my Spanish when I stop in.", "business_id": "VXIkI9_EbDbYHeO9IzKjJg", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-11-08", "type": "review"}

The staff are invariably polite, friendly, welcoming and just (dare one say it?) plain NICE people. The food is good. Exactly what you'd hoped for but usually do not find. The service is fast and accurate even when the place is packed. We moved into a large condo building near by, and we have met many of our neighbors at Coco's. Seems the whole building dines there at one time or another.  \n\nThe other evening our A/C in the building failed and was out for about 6 hours on a 100+ degree afternoon and evening. We went over to Coco's for an ice tea, and we mentioned to them what had happened with the failing AC. Along with the Iced Tea, they gave us some of their wonderful Cocoanut Creme Pie 'on the house' in a thoughtful and kind attempt to cheer us up after living with no AC for several hours.  This little kindness mean so much to us and certainly it was not expected... but that bit of reaching out to cheer us up did in fact make the whole world look brighter for a while! We survived the heat, loved their iced tea and when we got back home the AC was running again at last! \n\nIf you're in the area, stop in. The food is good, the service above your expectations and the people are incredible.  Much more than we would have ever expected from a small chain-type restaurant.

Enjoy our Arizona Diversity\n\nHave you ever eaten a Frozfruit bar?  That is a Paleta Michoacana.  Those bars were made in Michoacan Mexico long before they met the Blue Bunny.  Some paletas beat the bunny easily.  Does your neighborhood have a Mexican (legal of course) vendor pushing a freezer chest on wheels?  They are making their $50.00 or less a day selling paletas and other frozen delights.  Coconut, one of the most delicious flavors, will keep your brain from unraveling like mine is.  Eat them early in life and often.  \n\nWhen I was 15, I had one of the most anxious nights of my life. Maria Fraga invited me to her Quinceanera.  A six syllable word I'd never heard or seen before I got the invitation.  The only question I asked was should I dress up?  My best at the time were some black chino pants I'd grown through, three inches above the shoes on my white-socked feet.  I also had a white shirt, also recently miniaturized.  I did have a tie, a one-inch wide bright green iridescent one I really liked because the color reminded me of a green tree snake.  \n\nEquivalent words in English to Quinceanera is Debutante Ball.  Parents save from the day a girl is born, there's a formal coming of age mass, everybody's in a gown or tux, and there's a giant ball at a rented hall.  Being some some flavor of Protestant, I didn't attend the mass.  I was dropped off at the rocking hard ball with the live band.  I was the only white guy.  I did not know how to dance.  My clothes were too small, my tie glowed in the dark and 100 people were dressed To The 9's.  Plus, cool Santos Ortiz was out in the crowd, dancing sua-ve with all the girls.  I did find Gilbert, dressed a little better than me.  We hung out making small talk in a dark corner.  I left within an hour.  \n\nThe night I met Cesar Chavez felt the same.  I was one of four white kids and one adult in a sea of migrant workers, nobody apparently speaking English,  The green chile, frijoles and home made tortillas nothing like the tacos my Queens New York Mom and Kansas City Dad whipped up for all the hungry kids.  \n\nIf cross-cultural situations like the above or even the potential to step into another culture freak you out, I'm here to tell you it's totally survivable.        \n\nLa Michoacana is a great place to dip your toes in the water.  I've seen it walking up and down 16th Street, but never went in.  The outside has a sleek traditional Mexican exterior, the inside is Mexico.  My stop was for water and an investigation.  I found an inviting, artful interior I was not allowed to take pictures in.  Mural copyright or something I suppose.  \n\nFood is served, shave ice is served, plus a variety of raspados, which you should try.  Fresas con Crema, fresh strawberries in cream will shoot your socks to the other end of the room.  The water was excellent, saving me from a dehydrated afternoon on the mean streets of Tempe.  I'm definitely going back.  I'll report more.", "business_id": "9pYBiLe3k5Gi-AJqRklXcQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-11-04", "type": "review"}

Immediately when I walk in, I feel like there's a bright, shinning light over my head, as if I'm on stage and it's otherwise pitch black. Translation: I don't belong here. \n\nI walk the aisles, admire the plethora of things I've never been seen or heard of. I look at the frozen fish and wonder how in the world to prepare such things. I look at the sake aisle and wish I knew which to pick, which one wouldn't soil my taste buds. Sometimes I'm tempted to pick up their fresh slices of sashimi, but I usually pass. I just can't talk myself into it. \n\nI walk by the fresh fish, past the butchers and men with their imploring eyes. I feel uncomfortable under their gaze. I can only imagine what they're thinking. That's when I pretend even harder - pretend that I know what I'm doing, instead of wandering the aisles looking at anything from poxy stix to soy sauce. \n\nThen I end up in the meat section, dumbstruck. Gizzards. Tongue. Heart. It's like a lab here, animals dissected to entertain my morbid fascination. I tend to get repulsed when I get to the chicken feet. \n\nSo, I pass through the produce aisle and stutter near the bakery. Here is where I once picked up the most delicious bread I've ever had. It certainly wasn't healthy, but I don't care. I've since gone back looking for another loaf, but have yet to find it fresh on display. I keep hoping, though, that someday we will be re-united -- myself and that delectable bread - otherwise known as \"crack in a bag.\"  \n\nSo, if I'm so uncomfortable, why do I even bother? Because I like trying new things, from teas to bread to meat. I just can't seem to pick up the latter, for fear of self-poisoning. Plus, nothing beats cheap bags of edamame here. Other stores want nearly $4 for a bag. Screw that. \n\nI've also tried their milk pearl tea here. It's not bad. It's not something I'd get very often, for I can find better concoctions elsewhere.

Let's get the bad out of the way first.  For years, Costco Tire Center was my goto for tires.  Then, the Michelin tires starting blowing up on me.  To be fair, I am hard on tires.  But blowouts are hard on vehicles, so I stopped getting tires at Costco. \n\n I can't really think of much more bad, unless you consider they keep moving the inventory around, so you are always looking for that stuff you bought last time, because it's not where it was before.  Sometimes when you see that thing that you just gotta have, but cannot really afford it?  Well, you better bite, because it may not be there the next time.  Prices are great, but you have to buy in bulk.  This is okay for things that will keep, but stuff like bread and pastries- you better really like because you are either gonna get tired of them or they spoil.  I use a vacuum sealer for stuff I don't think will last.\n\nI like that you can get more organic stuff now.  We buy as much organic as we can afford, and Costco is good for things like Half/half and eggs.  We go through a lot of half and half.  Gas?  you bet.  Always priced great.

What's even cooler, though, is buying the dough and make your own special pizza, which I did. The crust turned out great!\n\n* * *\n\nHere is where I'll find my new favorite bread, AJ's brand. It's multi-grain, only 70 calories a slice with 6 grams of protein in each delicious cut. I couldn't ask for more. \n\nBut, since I sometimes go shopping for more than bread, I know you can find pretty much anything at this AJ's, especially when making unique and exciting dinner entrees. From cheeses to nuts to produce and wine, you'll find what you need here. If you have any trouble, just ask. The people working here are really quite friendly. I actually enjoy going to a grocery store - GASP - so I can tell you that this place far outshines other retailers. Of course, it far outprices them, too. But, if it's a special affair or you just don't care, then this AJ's is for you. \n\nI love how it's in walking distance too, situated in an easy-access plaza that offers other interesting treats, too, like Booster Juice and Sweet Tomatoes. \n\nOh, did I mention this place has a great beer selection? You can buy the 6-pack, sure, but for those nights when you're uncertain of what you're craving, you have the option of buying a single beer - mix and match, if you will - and not choking on the cost. Single beers here are cheaper than what you'll find at the bar. Granted, although it comes chilled, you can't open it on the spot. Wouldn't it be great if you could? (Beer tasting, anyone?!)\n\nIf you're not fond of beer (my god, what's the matter with you?), then peruse the liquor or wine selection. You can even find Mexican tequila that isn't your typical Jose. As for wine, I have always loved AJ's selection. Now I love them even more after discovering my new favorite Italian meritage.

Then my phone number. \n\nApparently my order wasn't anywhere in their system. \n\nAlright, whatever. I'll just reorder them on my phone. I do that, wait a while, and then the guy at the counter finds my 4X6 prints in the 8X10 box. Jesus.

The Walnut Square - Available in both a truffle and a candy bar, this dark chocolate coated chunk of heaven (butter caramel and English walnuts) haunts my reverie 2-3 times a week. The only problem with the bar is that you have to bite into it, meaning there are opportune moments to drool while eating. Embarrassing? Yes. Worth it? Yes.\n2. Key Lime Truffle - A totally unique, decadent delight, this creamy cube of white chocolate houses a key lime cream flavored center. It's tangy, sweet, and addictive.\n3. Kona Mocha - The perfect blend of texture and flavor, toasted coconut and white chocolate surround a coffee and milk chocolate truffle. If there was a coffee that tasted like this, my mornings would rock.\n4. Almond Truffle - Somewhat reminiscent of an inside-out sushi roll, the roasted almonds coat the outside, followed by white chocolate, and finally smooth milk chocolate in the center. They don't really look like truffles, which makes it easy to eat, oh, say, 10 of them at a time.\n5. Chelsea - The ultimate classy truffle, pecans and chocolate liquor surrounded by milk chocolate create a mini-explosion of awesome on your taste buds. \n6. Scotchmallow - Available in a bar and a truffle, a layer of marshmallow and flavorful caramel are enveloped in dark chocolate. If I could put this between graham crackers I'd be a) in s'mores heaven, and b) a total glutton.\n7. Dark Almonds - Technically this is just a dark almond cluster, but I'll be damned if it's not the best almond cluster I've ever had. \n8. Dark Chocolate Truffle - A pure, smooth chocolate with a bit of texture, this semisweet chocolate truffle and chocolate liquor center is topped with nut crunch. It's simple, but perfect.\n9/10. Mocha/Bordeaux - Both of these truffles are covered in chocolate sprinkles, which I usually hate, but for some reason, they taste amazing. The Bordeaux is a pure chocolate flavor with a hint of brown sugar, and the Mocha is chocolate-coffee (obviously) available in both milk and dark flavors.\n\nTraveling back through my childhood by writing about these exceptional chocolates has made me realize something: these are some of the best truffles I've ever had, local or not. The price is fair (maybe too fair), the quality is evident, and the selection is grand. In fact, I'd pick these over $4.00 French truffles at a shmancy-pants chocolatier any day.", "business_id": "ezM-93i6eNb4LnYp3J101Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-11-14", "type": "review"}

It's such a strange little throwback to east coast style delis.  The service here is truly amazing, they just don't treat people like this much anywhere else.  They get to know you, they smile, wink, tell jokes, make you feel good about buying your lunch. I buy local whenever I can, and love that I can eat here before or after a little shopping jaunt to the ultra-local strip behind here that includes Halo, Frances, Red Hot Robot, Stinkweeds and Smeeks.  It's also right on the light rail.\n\nThe macaroni salad is my favorite anywhere.  I know everyone wants exactly what they want, which is often what their grandma/mom/Aunt Jenny made.  Lucky for me, this stuff tastes just like home to me. I can hardly drive by without stopping in for at the very least, a cup of macaroni salad. If I am lucky, I'm hungry, and I can get a cheese sandwich, (which is perfect in every way) or something with the Russian dressing on it.  (The Russian dressing makes me want to get naked and swim around in it.)\n\nThe weirdest thing about this place is the menu, which is on randomly placed sheets of paper hanging over the deli counter.  Do not rush, take your time.  Read it all, they don't mind.  They have a pre-printed menu, which has some (but not all) of the items on it, so you can start sorting things in your head.  The first time I went in I ordered whatever struck my fancy first, and while waiting for it to be made, I found about ten other things I might have ordered instead.", "business_id": "UWrB5H3G-hhiHMy3iKV2ew", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-11-18", "type": "review"}

You can only get about 8 different cheeses here on your sandwich (the rest you must buy) and they only carry one style of Boars Head turkey. No pepper or pastrami style, nothing but boring old plain turkey. Whoever is raving about the macaroni salad must be a rookie as well. The mac salad lacked any flavor and resembled ones you will find in a supermarket tub.

I have been to this DQ several times with minimal complaint. It is small and seating is limited but that never really bothered me. Today I brought my daughter and we purchased ice cream and food and the cashier told me the bill total was $8.00 even. I gave him my credit card and he ran it. At first I didn't think he was going to give me a receipt. I guess they just have a slow credit card machine.  He finally handed me the credit card receipt, not the actual receipt the cash register produces and I noticed that the card had been swiped for $10.00. At first I thought maybe there was a fee for using a credit/debit card and next I thought, wow, that's ridiculous. When he delivered the food, I asked him why the bill was $8 and the receipt showed my card had been charged $10 and he said, \"oh\" and walked back the register and instantly popped the drawer open, took out $2 and ripped the receipt off and walked over to me. He showed me the total and said, \"you were right\" and handed me the $2. Umm....ok. So basically, my advice is to watch your receipts very closely, ask for both copies, the credit card and the register one, and maybe even pay with cash cuz last time I checked the 8 and the 10 weren't \"next to each other\" on a keyboard and I am not sure there's a plausible excuse for this accidentally happening. I am thinking that that employee thinks he's running some kind of scam where he skims a couple bucks off every credit card transaction and pockets the extra money at the end of the day and that's some bullsh*t. I will be contacting the store directly tomorrow to voice my concerns with their manager although maybe he or she's in on it too.

The staff, though, makes the brewhouse.\n\nSince it's a brewhouse, let's start with the beer. Sonora has a brew for nearly everybody. If you like it dark and heavy, there's usually a mix of stout, porter or barley wine. For the lighter folks, there's a very competent mix of hefeweizens and pale ales. For big beer flavors, there's usually an IPA. The best stuff, though, comes out of the cask. Cask-conditioned ales have an awesome flavor that allows the character of the hops to shine out. My main quibble with Sonora's cask selections is that they're too often of the pale variety. I'd love to see a stout or porter in the cask at least once a month. I would celebrate to see a Belgian trippel wind up on the menu, too.\n\nSonora also serves food. The cottage pie is tasty, as are the fish 'n' chips and homemade soups, and the nachos are a nice snack. The burgers, both the pub and Kobe varieties, depend greatly on how the person at the grill defines rare, medium and done well. Unfortunately, their definitions are often differerent from mine.\n\nThis brewpub also has a great atmosphere. Sit at the bar and chat with the other brew lovers. It's a friendly place, and you'll have fun conversations. They staff actually know their beers and have strong opinions. And they're just as friendly as the drinkers.

The outdoor patio in the middle should be very nice to sit at and enjoy one of their finely crafted brews in the next couple of months. The mural on the back is awesome too.", "business_id": "3UMcsN9IjoeV8JZvC4apag", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-10-30", "type": "review"}

That's why this classy little beauty less than a mile away from our house was a definite must-try. Let me begin the review by letting you know, up front, that we really enjoyed everything about the place. Minimal complaints! \n\nWe visited Sonora on a Friday at around 7:00...there were a few parking spots left in what is really a very ample parking lot for downtown Phoenix. I mean, damn! There must be at least 20 spaces. I'm a worrier and I stress out about things like, \"WHERE WILL WE PARK?!\" before I go anywhere. I know...I know. So, I was pleased to see that I needn't have gifted myself with an ulcer over where we could park without getting towed or ending up on blocks. \n\nSonora Brewhouse is comprised of two buildings, joined by an outside dining area between them. The building you first walk into, (the older building, I perhaps incorrectly surmised), is small and was filled with many jovial patrons on our visit. We wouldn't have wanted to sit at the bar, but we couldn't have, anyway! It was completely full, as were almost all of the booths and tables. We made our way to the outside seating area, and were about to sit down when we noticed the second building...right on the other side of the outdoor seating. We ventured in, and it was much less full than the other building, but several times as noisy. Oh, well. We sat down and surveyed our new environs. \n\nI've read several reviews on here vaguely bashing the ambiance of the restaurant - I found nothing to complain about. Then again, I like faux exposed-brick walls and dark wood paneling. \"Duly noted.\" Alright, cool. Thanks. I also liked the kind of fun, amateurish canvas paintings of the images they pair with each of their beers that are strewn about said exposed-brick walls. Plasma TVs abound, which I hate, but I know people eat that technology crap up so I guess it's worth mentioning. \n\nOur waitress was just friendly enough, avoided all bitchiness, and was on top of things without being obnoxious. In other words, perfect. My boyfriend ordered the pale ale, (I think it's called The Stinger? Something like that?), and I, not a beer drinker in the slightest, decided to throw caution and personal preference to the wind and have a Vanilla Porter. Because, you know. It would taste like vanilla. And...vanilla is for girls. Like me. That don't drink beer. My boyfriend chuckled at this logic, and told me I wouldn't like it and that I didn't know what I was ordering. \n\n... \n\nYep. Just about right. As far as beer goes, I did like the kind of bitter and still beer-like hint of baked goods flavor, but it was not anything like I cluelessly imagined. I still drank it! My boyfriend really enjoyed his pale ale with no criticisms. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered the Tavern Steak with steamed vegetables and steak fries, and I ordered the Santa Fe Chicken Sandwich with the kettle chips/chipotle ketchup. We were both very pleased with our entrees...the jalapeno butter (?) on the steak is pretty tasty. As for the sandwich, I'll eat anything if it is slathered in guacamole. The steak fries were as good as steak fries ever are, and the kettle chips are as good as all of the other reviews have told you. I don't eat potato chips and I hate ketchup, but I loved the combination here. Fun tip: I tried putting some of the chipotle ketchup on my sandwich, and it tasted really gross. Maybe limit your use of the ketchup to its intended, menu-endorsed purpose. \n\nWhen we were done, we had no problem getting the bill, paying the bill, and getting out. The parking lot was completely full when we left, and there were two cars jockeying for our spot. That was probably around 8:00 - 8:30 PM, so if you're a damaged individual like me who finds cause to stress about parking, go earlier than that. \n\nThere were a lot of other options on the menu that sounded like they might be on the \"delicious\" side. If you are like us, and not into the drama-filled 20-something bar scene downtown, this might be a nice alternative. It's so close, and we were both really down with the experience...we will definitely be back.", "business_id": "3UMcsN9IjoeV8JZvC4apag", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-09-21", "type": "review"}

And then confusion...both of us looked at each other and said \"WTF???\"  Worst RB EVER!\n\nWhat the heck was in this drink that made it taste like ass?  We looked all over the menu and found nothing.  Then we saw the \"fine print\" on a small table sign...STEVIA.  It's made with Stevia NOT sugar...I'm sorry, but I have to say that this is the lame-est root beer on the planet.  If I'm going to treat myself to a big glass of homemade root beer, I want it to be delectable...sugar and all...no freaking high fructose corn syrup and no bloody artificial sugars (and yes, I know stevia is \"natural\" but who gives a crap...it tastes terrible anyway).\n\nAfter the root beer debacle, it didn't get better.  The food was meh...service was not so great (there were moments of \"is she ever coming back???\").  I'd say, go here for the beer, sans root, but that's about it.

Considering it was not very busy I expected more out of someone, anyone for that matter! (maybe they were angry because they had to work on Halloween) My drinks took longer than normal to receive and my Kobe burger took quite awhile too.

Not impressed and I will not be returning, if the beer and food were amazing I might come back even if the service sucked but if all three of these important factors are not up to par I will spend my money else where. Next time I'll take the extra 10 minutes to get to Four Peaks.\n\nAlso I noticed the menu was really, really random. They don't specialize in any particular type of food.

We'd all been wanting to try out the place and sample their brews for a while. We arrived, and were told to pick any seat we desired, so we grabbed a booth. The first thing I noticed was the interior, it was fairly small but in a good way, the ambience of the place has a classic southwestern feel to it; and not in the kitschy way that non natives might assume a \"sw\" theme should feel. Perusing the menu I noticed that the prices seemed a little higher than i'm used to for pub grub, but i'm sure the quality would be deserving. after a while of checking out their digs and studying over the menu and drink/food specials they had for weekends we opted to go for the \"order any regular appetizer and get you're first beer for $1\" deal. seems like a good deal right? Scott ordered the light rail cream ale, Justin ordered the IPA? i think and I got their Vanilla stout. They were all delicious. My stout was especially good as the vanilla taste was merely a mild hint which gave it a great background flavor and left a lingering sweetness that was refreshing rather than sickeningly fruity/sweet. It was a classic stout whose femme-y name belies it's body and drinkability; certainly not a lady drink imo. My compatriots order the light rail cream ale wings and i order the \"beer bread\" w/ queso dip. The appetizers were, decent. not bad but not great. The real reason to come here is the beer; despite the fact i didnt try any entrees, or their delicious sounding kobe beef burger- i'm gonna go ahead and stand by my sentiment. When our lackluster waitress finally returned i asked for MY bill, she returned after 15 min. or so with all of our checks on one tab, and she had overcharged us after we'd asked her if the weekend special (order any app and get 1st beer for $1) was still in effect, to which she'd said yes. To be fair i'm sure it was an honest mistake, and she was probably really busy....yada yada yada we asked her for our seperate checks and about the special one more time, she apologized and returned with our checks and cheaper tabs. So all in all i like SunUp brewery but i'd return solely for the brews and leaves the eats to some place more qualified for my refined tastebuds.", "business_id": "3UMcsN9IjoeV8JZvC4apag", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-10-11", "type": "review"}

I used to love this place.  I loved it because it was not only a great brew house but it also offered deliciously consistent food that was served by a friendly staff.  The Kobe burgers and the fish and chips were to die for and the micro IPA and other brew delights were as good if not better than the micro brews in Portland, OR. \n\nI cannot express enough how disappointed I am with the old Sonora; with the red chili gone, the only vegetarian item on the old menu gone, and the kicker are the fish and chips!

I have had the burger with the blue cheese fondue on it several times now, and it is amazing. The bun is chewy, burger is juicy, and the blue cheese is very blue-cheesy. It was cooked to perfection and served with some crispy fries that were also very good. I have yet to be disappointed. \n\nMy friend had the club, and it is a giant sandwich and looked delicious. His only compliant was there isn't any \"regular\" white bread available to put it on. Another friend had the green chile pulled pork and said he really enjoyed it.\n\nThe beer on the other hand - I really have struggled to like. As an avid drinker of the \"other\" brewery in Tempe's flagship beer, I am always looking for a red-type ale, which they have, but I find too hoppy. So I recently have had the Pale Ale, which has a good flavor, but once again I run into a hop issue. I just really am not a fan of hoppy beers, and as of my last sampler tasting, these are too much for me.\n\nAnother bonus of SunUp is the small, partially-covered patio.

I love that staff has left me to my own devices, gone above and beyond to be helpful, but has never tried to push me into buying more.\n\nNot that I needed another reason to love it here, but tonight I got one.  I left work a bit early to get some last minute supplies (and to avoid ending up on Cake Wrecks), so, of course, traffic was awful and I arrived right at 6p--closing time.  I decided to chance it and wait at the door until a staffer caught my eye.  Once she did I peeked my head in to request permission to enter for 'just one thing'.  I know she didn't want to let me in.  I know how badly they all wanted to go home after a long day as I've been in that position many times myself.  But she allowed it and did so with a smile.  I jogged back to get my one thing and remembered I also needed boxes.  She was so very gracious to help me out with that as well.  I said thank you a billion times, but I am truly appreciative of folks going the extra mile.  The only way I could think of to thank them further was to write a glowing review.\n\nAgain, I already loved it here.  Tonight I was given even more reasons to love it.  Thank you to the young woman that helped me and to the gentleman who was also working.  I appreciate the kindness as we sometimes seem to be running so low on that.  You have earned a fan for life!", "business_id": "XAaXT0e70-USVYVKcnljsg", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-10-23", "type": "review"}

It's not my favorite one, for a variety of different reasons.  First, seating here is awkward.  Inside, they have one really long table, a couch, and like 2 small tables.  More of a group oriented seating arrangement then bunches of individual tables.  They do have ample outdoor seating, but I don't always feel like sitting outside.\n\nThe service here is fine, but nothing exceptional.

The staff is nice, but not as nice as others I have been to.\n\nMy only formal complaint is that half the time I go in here, thier out of half and half.  At 7AM.  I get tired of having to walk the container back and forth to the counter at least 1 day a week, usually more.  I know the baristas are busy, but there's nothing worse then waiting in line twice.  Once for your coffee order and another time while the barista finishes waiting on 3 other customers before he can get to the empty creamer.\n\nI mean, I do have good days in here, but its always the same 2 or 3 issues that they fail on when I'm in here.  Generic service, running out of essential supplies, and limited seating indoors.  I mean, I know seating is seating, but it gets frustrating sometimes when I want to sit down at 7AM to eat my muffin and Ive got to tough it out in the summer when its scortching hot and I'd rather be in the AC...\n\nI guess I've had better experiences at Starbucks throughout the valley that I can say these things as comparisons to this location.", "business_id": "TGb6D6zmx1KP4aDDH5Aihw", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-11-02", "type": "review"}

The staff here is definitely the Best in the area.

They are simply not tended to...which creates the occasional influx of homeless and crackheads hollering for a dollar.. or some change \"for the bus\".

You see each stool already has its own price tag correctly attached as you just reviewed each one. He's stoic. Well, what's the price then? Hmm.. he doesn't know and he goes back to look it up. Turns out it is $50. I don't understand. An associate was just working with me and confirmed that $30 was the price. \n\nManager is adamant that customers probably just moved the signs around. I pointed around the furniture displays. Okay. Where is the $50 sign then? Was it shuffled around? Nope. No $50 sign anywhere. Just 4 stools, 4 price tags all at $30.

There was a small couch on clearance. I liked the size and color and it was comfortable to sit on. I noticed there was no sales tag. There was a sign that said clearance . I asked the sales person how much it would be for this small couch. I ended up waiting forever to have my question answered. About 45 min or so. She finally comes out and tells me what the price was. It' was a reasonable price. Then I noticed there was a black stain on the seat of the couch. It's pretty noticeable when sitting on the couch.  I pointed it out and said to the sales person what I had found. No comment coming from her. She just stares at it. I asked the sales person if there is another couch for sale or not for sale. There was none left in that style that I liked. I was surprised that they would have a dirty stained couch on their floor. I left and went else where. I hope they change managers there. That place has changed. It use to be a fun place to go to with good sale people.

Cars just end up sitting at a stand-still, and I have been stuck trying to exit at times for up to 15 minutes. Why can't they put up a barrier?

I think 7 checks in all. They seemed cool with it...at first. \n\nI have to preface by saying, the worst service I've ever received has been at the Cheesecake Factory. Out of the four times I've been, every single time has been horrendous. The very first time I went (this was a different location)  one of my dining partners didn't get their meal for 20 minutes after ours. We were completely through with our meals but the server never offered to comp her meal. In fact, he was never seen after taking our order. We had to flag down a manager to take care of the issue. \n\nThe other few times I've had the slowest, rudest service of my life. This time was no different. The server acted thoroughly annoyed by our group, was short with us, refused to smile AT ALL, and generally was a complete wench. Splitting the tab was clearly WAY too much work for her, as it took 20 minutes for her to figure out who ordered what (even though we asked if it was ok to split tabs long before we ordered) but actually running the tabs? Wow, add on another 10 minutes! We apologized again for having to split tabs, hoping maybe that would make her less huffy, but she never acknowledged that we were trying to be nice, and instead just went around acting huffy and like we were thorns in her side. \n\nWell, obviously she could be a total b*tch because gratuity was already included. 18% on the tab, which I understand with large groups. However, I felt she was acting as bitchy as she wanted to because in the end, she'd be getting a good tip regardless. \n\nAs for the food, it's a big whatever. Anything other than lunch is overpriced. In the end it's just overpriced ridiculously sized chain food . I don't understand why people love it so much.

It will give you a little yellow token that you can validate when you are leaving and will save you the hassle of trying to find a spot in this busy location. \n\nNow for the restaurant! This is one of my favorite restaurants to go to and the only Cheesecake Factory location I really like. The atmosphere is very lively sometimes noisy and most workers are very friendly and helpful. The lighting is rather dim in certain seating locations. I would say it is \"too romantic\" when it comes to the lighting if that was a lighting setting. \n\nAlmost all of the servers I have had in the past were great with timing, knowledge of the vast menu, friendliness and attention to your needs. The food is always great and I have never regretted my decision when ordering. The Red Sangria and Moscow Mules were perfect for drink choices. I even ordered an A.M.F. (a dangerously blue heavier alcoholic drink. Those who know understand) which was not even on the drink menu. I was surprised on how accommodating this location was. They even bring an extra plate if you are sharing a dish and have split it up before. I recommend the Shrimp Bistro Pasta or Chicken Madeira for a main entree and the Portabella, Avocado and Zucchini Fries for an appetizer. Those are just my go to choices. \n\nThe only problem, as with every other Cheesecake Factory or Man vs. Food competition, is trying to reach that last bite and in this scenario it's the cheesecake. This cheesecake is probably more total calories than all the food leading up to it and it's worth it. If you ask for a cheesecake to-go container you will put it in the fridge only to open it up before bed and finish it.\n\nI highly recommend this location and restaurant chain and don't forget to validate before leaving.", "business_id": "2r8jGeuYvMkyP2ik_X-Bxw", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-09-14", "type": "review"}

Located in the old town area, I thought that a small, family-owned french breakfast place would be the perfect refreshing break from the trendy (Read: untsss unttsss untss music) mimosa-brunch places and overly-priced-food restaurants. I wanted something fresh, homemade, french and delicious.\n\nWe ordered an iced latte, a nutella crepe with fresh fruit and whipped cream, a croissant with egg and sausage and a normandy creme (ham, cheese and egg). The food came in before the waters and drinks, and unfortunately, they seemed prepared ahead of time and left to sit.\n\nMy normandy crepe looked (visually) delicious. When I started digging in, I noticed that it was a little cold (aka not prepared fresh) and that the cheese was barely there and already solidified and not gooey. The flavors were ok but the crepe contents were very flat, so they were very stingy on the portions of their ingredients. The crepe was topped with a sunny side-up egg but had no sauce or added flavors to it. I tried adding hot sauce but it really didn't make the dish any better. That was about $8. My iced latte was approximately $5 and really tasted like coffee with whole milk - and the coffee was not a great quality. Not an enjoyable meal.\n\nMy friend ordered the nutella crepe but was delivered a crepe stuffed with fresh fruit instead. Apparently, the order is EITHER a fruit crepe or a nutella crepe, not a nutella crepe served with fruit. When they took it back, they returned the same plate with a hint of nutella placed on top (my friend has already cut into the crepe earlier). The whipping cream was not your typical type: it was very dense and heavy, a weird combo between whipped cream and thick evaporated milk.\n\nThe service was decent but we were the only people at the restaurant besides from 2 other ladies who were just having coffee. The place was very empty, which is sad to see considering the 3 breakfast places adjacent to it had a 30-40min waiting line.

We finally went for breakfast last Sunday and I was pleasantly surprised. It is not the cutest place - it lacks any real decor which is a shame (at least it's not pretentious) but what it lacks in atmosphere it makes up for with the food.\n\nBEST CROISSANTS EVER. My only complaint about them is that they aren't bigger. I was literally rationing my croissant throughout my meal so that I could have a bite of it with every bite of my spinach & mushroom omelette - which by the way was also fantastic - and that's coming from someone who's paranoid about undercooked eggs and NEVER eats eggs unless they are cooked in her very own kitchen. \n\nWe ended up wracking up an almost $60 bill because we brought home a doggy bag of baked goods from the attached bakery. THEY WERE TO DIE FOR.\n\nhttp://instagram.com/p/SbAhDjsBH7/\n^ pic of the baked goods I got. Tiramisu, fruit tart, and assorted macarons.\n\nDownside: not a great variety of options for vegetarians like me... but enough that you can repeatedly go back for those few dishes you specifically crave.", "business_id": "wftoNIA0Q8nX-Da47psBCA", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-11-28", "type": "review"}

There wasn't much going on with the exterior decor of this place and unless you were looking for this place you would easily walk right by and not even notice it. The interior was decorated with pictures and paintings of Paris and France. There are two tables only on the entrance patio and about 20 tables total on the inside. Out of all of the times I have been here there has never been more than 3 other tables filled at a time. Its very quiet with mellow French music playing in the background. The owner has a very sharp french accent which I really enjoy and it always brings back a lot of great memories of my past trips to France. There were a lot of great options to choose from on the menu. I myself am a HUGE fan of the crepes and swear by them and they are cooked to perfection and there are a ton of great choices to choose from. The eggs benedict is also amazing! I have only had the breakfast here and its as good as the phenomenal and authentic food I have experienced throughout France. The service here has always been great.

After all, each time I've been, I've gotten the impression it's like a half-market. Perhaps I'm wrong, but I still get that impression. Regardless, I went this past weekend because I wanted to look for my all-time favorite nut mix. Ironically, they didn't have the World Mix variety. I figured while I was there, I'd pick up some milk and look around. I began at the cheeses. I picked up a blend o fontino and asiago. Yum. Then I opted to try Trade Joe's chicken apple sausage. Of course, yams (or sweet potatoes) are a must. I also wandered the aisles, was tempted by a couple items but opted to spend $$ on wine and spirits, instead of garlic olive oil and coffee. Yeah, maybe my priorities are a bit skewed.\n\nAnyway, I was disappointed with their beer selection. I wanted something for the holidays, for the \"winter\" I pretend is coming, to whet my whistle. I walked away empty-handed. Instead, I picked up 2 reasonably priced bottles of red wine - both intriguing blends. Why not, I thought. \n\nCheck out was easy. The cashier was super friendly. She double bagged. Good for her! I walked out feeling victorious, like I had gotten a really good deal. To prove my point, I compared price points between what I spent at Trader Joe's and what I spent at Fry's. Come to find out, everything was less expensive at TJ's. I swear it. Even their baby spinach salad didn't break $2. The skim milk, the yams, the chicken sausage... all less at TJ's. This tells me I need to shop here more often. \n\nThe only downside is the crowd. It's always cramped and I feel like I'm in every body's way. I damn sure know everybody is in my way. I don't like dodging people or obstacles. I don't like getting bumped into by carts and huge lady purses. There was even one point after picking up my spinach that I was trapped by two carts. The drivers were oblivious. I stood there, trying to figure out my best route of escape. Finally one lady looked up at me and moved her cart an inch out of the way.

My debit card does not go through . I don't have back up card. After she tried couple of times and no luck, she asks for the manager to help her. \n\nThey tried every possible option but no luck. It was a debit card from Chase and I had this problem before. So I decide to call them. \n\nLong story short, they couldn't do anything because their system were down. Horrible, I couldn't use my own money. \n\nEnough about awful Chase, I am writing this review about my all time favorite grocery store. I apologized to them and told them my hideous bank can not do anything since their systems were down. I felt bad that they will have to put all of the groceries back. \n\nThey said no need to apologize and said they were sorry I had to go trough the hassle. Not only that they showed sympathy but the manager would not let me leave the store without packing some dinner on Trader Joe's. How amazing are they?\n\nI was bit embarrassed  of the whole situation even though it was clearly my banks fault, I must say Trader Joe's took that away and made me feel comfortable and safe. \n\nThank you Trader Joe's for being you, for being simply the best!!!", "business_id": "Sy-hmzSH1OmWpHmAfZtxRA", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-10-20", "type": "review"}

Is this place really the best? Hmmm. \n\nAfter forking over $2.75 for a double shot of espresso, I made my way to the coffee bar where there was cold skim milk, plenty of sugar packs and a variety of flavor-adds, like cocoa. Then, I took my first sip. Yum. Of course, can you really mess up a double shot of espresso? God, I hope not. \n\nIn any case, this place is \"nifty.\" I use that word because it's situated next door to The Gelato Spot and is a bit crammed for space. A splattering of like 4 people at the tables near the door made this place look a bit too crowded to me. Then again, if I had been at one of those tables, I probably wouldn't have noticed, or even cared. \n\nThe girl behind the counter was very friendly. I appreciated that. It's not often I joke around with baristas. She managed to make me laugh, too. To me, that's sweeter than an extra pack of Splenda. \n\nHava Java is a great location. I wondered over here after stuffing my belly full of wonderful sushi at Zen 32. My cohorts were immediately pulled into The Gelato Spot while I ordered my beverage. 66% of 'em wound up with gelato. Having already ordered and flavored my double to taste, I went hunting for them. That's where I found 2 of them cozied up to gelato and another teasing herself with the idea. I sampled a couple, but was very content with my coffee. So, if you plan to drop by Hava Java, just make sure you walk right up to the counter and order, or you may be sucked next door where you'll succumb to your sweet tooth. \n\nThen again, if gelato isn't your thing, I did see ridiciously huge muffins and bagels on display at Hava Java. They looked ridiciously delicious. I don't know why anyone would need a muffin the size of King Kong's fist. But, then again, I couldn't resist the after-lunch pick-me-up that Hava Java delivered. \n\nBy the way, did somebody say free wi-fi? Uhm, yeah.

The cheerful barista asked what she could get for me and when I said I wasn't sure, she not only told me to take my time, but pulled out laminated sheets listing their syrups and teas. That intuitive customer service set things off right from the get-go. I noticed they had one of my favorite (yet hard to come-by) flavors- praline, and ordered a decaf iced praline latte. The barista made the drink quickly, in spite of her accidental initial pull of regular espresso, which she noticed right away and fixed. She also asked my milk preference which I liked because let's face it girls, some days are skim days and others are 2% days and it helps to have someone remind me of that. :)\n\nThe latte was satisfying. It wasn't mind-blowing, but it was made well and wasn't overwhelmingly sweet like the lattes they usually serve at Starbucks (this coming from a sugar fanatic!). The pitcher of water and water cups they have out with the cream and sugar is a nice touch that I'd like to see in every coffee shop. \n\nThe decor is sort of rustic with burlap coffee sacks above the door and local art on the walls. The atmosphere, which can't really be pinned down to one thing, is welcoming and relaxed and I felt like I could hide away for hours there. \n\nThere were a few negatives. The first was the mess of a baked goods display. I'm sure it looked great at opening, but by the time I was there, it was disheveled, half empty and didn't look like it had been tidied up all day. Typically I ignore the food offerings at coffee-shops, but I skipped lunch today and could have been persuaded to drop a few dollars if I'd seen anything remotely interesting. The other thing is that they have a drink refrigerator containing water bottles, juices and other bottled drinks for sale. It's so loud!! It cycles on and off, but when it's on, it can be pretty distracting. \n\nI will definitely come back to this place, especially as the weather improves and all the outdoor seating becomes a viable option. Now I just need to silence those evil thoughts that tell me it's acceptable to get a gelato within the same hour as getting a sugary latte...", "business_id": "2h9LsLPdJ7OvZrYJZhVdAw", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-09-09", "type": "review"}

Hava Java employees are mainly high school and college kids - usually the best have been at it for years. (i kinda sound like a barista writing this, but i am not, in fact i have never worked any food job. i do have chefs in my family though and just understand food/drink.)\n\nlook, for a strip mall hangout for pros in the a.m. and students mid-day, Hava Java is cool and pleasant enough. three stars.", "business_id": "2h9LsLPdJ7OvZrYJZhVdAw", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-11-02", "type": "review"}

I meant to make it special and bake her a cake, but we were leaving for Disneyland the next morning and I simply ran out of time to contend for the 'Mom of the Year' awards in my house, so I did the next best thing and I went to Barb's Bakery to get a cash and carry cake.  \n\nSince there were only 6 of us at her little party I opted for a new offering at Barb's; miniature 6\" cakes for around $12.  It was a beautiful, pure white cake with elegant white roses and piped drapes and beading.  It was a sight to behold in its monochromatic simplicity!  My daughter was very impressed with her tiny creation in pure white.  \n\nThe only drawback about the cake was the taste of the frosting, it didn't have any kind of a special flavor, like Barb's cakes normally do, it was just plain and sweet.  Not even a vanilla flavor.  This seems odd for Barb's so I'm almost wondering if someone forgot to add vanilla flavoring to that frosting batch?  If it's on purpose then I'd politely suggest adding some kind of extract to the frosting as it just needs something more to really take it from a simply 'good' cake to a 'delicious' cake.  \n\nJust my two cents!

For previous birthdays, we had gone to Bakerwee, Tami Coe, and some other delicious bakeries in our area. This time, I was on short notice and I needed a cake that would be big enough to feed a lot of kids, and that my daughter could personalize with some custom options. \n\nEnter Barb's Bakery. We read the reviews on yelp and looked at their site online - their prices were fantastic and their reviews were stellar! We placed and order and hoped it would all work out. We had a couple of last minute changes, but they were more than accommodating, and they were still as friendly as can be!\n\nWhen we went to pick up the cake, it was HUGE and it was gorgeous! The half sheet was PERFECT for what we needed. Better yet, it was DELICIOUS. Seriously. Out of all of the bakeries we  had been to before, I've never raided my fridge on subsequent days after the big event to get cake. I did this time... several times. \n\nPerfectly moist, the custard filling was perfect (perfectly sweet, but not too sweet!), and it held up for at least three days after her birthday before it was gone! Our fridge was raided constantly by cake seekers, looking for that afternoon pick-me-up or something sweet to go with their coffee. \n\nWe will be doing ALL of our cake shopping at Barb's from here on out. The price is incredible for what you get, and the taste just can't be beat.

Hardly any pizza places west of the Empire state building use oregeno and I have very rarely spotted this true symbol of NY pizza.

It could use just a bit of the orange grease that is also a NY tradition, but otherwise it was a great effort to replicate the Big Apple Classic. The cheese was not overwhelming, easily foldable and the cheese actually stuck to the sauce (sounds weird), but you just have to have eaten a million slices in NY to know what I'm talking about. Only about $12 for a 14\" cheese pie and even better and crispier when heated up. I also tried a Chicken parmesan hero which was top notch containing nicely breaded cutlets nestled in a italian roll with plenty of tasty red sauce and a good dose of melted cheese on top which also had oregeno dusted in for effect. THis is a really small pizzeria, but they are cranking out what so far has become the closest to NY style I have seen in Arizona yet.

The ricotta was well seasoned, the crust was perfectly cooked, crispy, and had garlicky seasoning on top. I would definitely get this again. Oh ya, it was also big enough for two meals.

The girl at the counter argued with me with the type of bagel it was to go on (1. I thought you always had a choice in bagel, and 2. I'm pretty sure I've ordered this sandwich more times than I care to count; I know what's what).  She said that it was supposed to be on an Everything Bagel, and I wanted it on an Asiago (the bagel it's slated to go on).  She then had the gall to ask if I even knew what I was ordering.  I politely smiled, and said I know what I'm asking for so please give me my order as I have asked for it.  She checked me out, I took my sandwiches home, and lo and behold my sandwiches were on an Everything bagel; not the Asiago like I've asked.  Whammy.\n\nThis is just an isolated incident from the staff here.  I think every time I come something goes awry with the staff.

In my world, this does not compute. It needs to be as tasty as it is pretty. Period.\n\nSo I can only give kudos to the artfulness of a Tammie Coe Cake, but nothing more. Cakes where you are told to remove the fondant and then eat it... that's not right--you should be able to eat it all--and yummily so. If you like the taste of fondant... you've got to be kidding me--Yucky!\n\nSo take my review or leave it.

Not me. So I'm putting my foot down and saying I won't eat a cake or cupcake that isn't tasty to me.\n\nNow, I must state that I am more a fan of cake than frosting. Frosting is secondary to me. So if you are more for frosting than for cake, ignore my note and have at all the Tammie Coe's and Sprinkles of the world--and have mine... no really, go ahead.\n\nIf there IS frosting--for me and others like me, a little bit of frosting goes a long way with one exception: If it's Whipped Cream Frosting... then BRING IT ON! I like frosting's more subtler relative so if it's a Whipped Cream Iced cake, I won't make it a point to get an inside piece, or scrape off the icing at all as I would a basic frosted cake.\n\nAnyway, Tammie Coe's cakes or cupcakes don't do it for me. If I have to partake in one of her treats, I'd shoot for her pastries or cookies before cake or cupcake.\n\nAs for MJ Bread, I have no complaints there... their breads really impressed.

It's on the opposite side of the spectrum compared to Three Roots, Lux or Copper Star in that respect.  If you don't luck out and snag the sofa or easy chair you could be subject to the most uncomfy cafe chairs ever.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I appreciate an independent coffeehouse like Mama Java's that supports the arts, local performers and functions as a community center.  But this seemed like this could have been \"Generic Coffee House, Anytown, USA.\"\n\nI'm not a coffee drinker, so I opted for iced tea -- wild strawberry black tea over ice, to be exact.  But that's not what the barista thought I ordered here.  She gave me hot tea, which was decently brewed and tasty, btw.  I went back up to ask for it over ice and proceeds to give me a small ramekin of ice, before she finally clued in and realized I wanted iced tea.  She was really cool about it and we shared a laugh.  No big deal, but worth mentioning.\n\nThe crowd of patrons was diverse this Friday night - streaming in steadily all night.

Here is my problem.... \n\nProducts take on the name as the product, i.e Band-aid, Levis, Q-tip, Duck Tape, ect. I think it is VERY rude to correct a customer when you know what they mean. This happened to me - I should have stated Medium however I forgot and said Grande - OMG shoot me now, the look of disgust and the correction. I wanted to take my $4 back and go to Sbux, at least they don't correct you and the customer is always right \n\nThis become more evident when I was at Tuesday morning with a friend and I told her we should grab some coffee, but I actually had to tell her before we went in to not say Grande. She laughed her light hearted self and rolled with it. Really though, I have to tell a friend make sure you order correctly. \n\nAnyway, the last straw was yesterday when my boyfriend asked for cream in his ice coffee and they stared at him like it was crazy. I get wanting to be a liberal elitist, I think of my self as one sometimes. You just can't forget the customer is the business. If you know what they mean roll with it - DONT correct them.

I recently moved to Phoenix and was delighted to find this place in my new neighborhood. Their 24-hour cold brewed coffee is refreshing and flavorful... not watered down even as the ice melts. I am excited to work my way through the many coffees, sandwiches, pizzas, and other menu items - - there are plenty vegetarian options! (They even keep vegans in mind and offer adjustments/alternatives on their menu.) I tried their signature english muffins for breakfast one day, on recommendation of many Yelpers, and they were amazing. I wouldn't pay the price for them every day, but they are a great treat to enjoy with a coffee out on the patio.\nDownsides: The prices are high. The service is inconsistent... I've been at the barista counter several times and waited for someone to acknowledge my presence. Luckily, when they do, they are nice and my order is up on the counter quickly. It is crazy chaotic most of the day, and gets difficult to navigate through the store without bumping into someone. Luckily, as you weave through the store, you get to look at all of the unique merchandise LGO has to offer, from the perfect handmade greeting card, the small but significant selection of beer, or the coffee table book you never knew you needed.", "business_id": "R8VwdLyvsp9iybNqRvm94g", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-11-19", "type": "review"}

Beginning first with my love of pastries, the first of these six stops would be at the combined grocery, caf\u00e9, bakery, liquor store, souvenir stand, and pizza parlor that is La Grande Orange Grocery; the sort of place you have to see to believe yet the sort of place where it all seems to \"fit.\"\n\nHarbored in a small strip mall with plenty of parking plus curbside checkout for those on the go I made my way into La Grande Orange only half knowing what to expect and having already mentioned the commodities entailed the only thing I could think of when I entered the door was a trip to Whole Foods if you condensed the entirety of one store into a space approximately one quarter the size.  With cups to one side and cupcakes to the other, wine to my right and coffee to my left my first impression was one of total sensory overload yet at the same once I entered and started to browse I detected a sort of controlled chaos as the various lines moved toward their destination with a good flow.  \n\nHaving already eaten breakfast and had plenty of coffee with pizza plans at Bianco for later in the day I took my time investigating the space - children's toys, shirts, travel mugs, cheeses, pre-made salads, locally roasted coffees - before finally approaching the pastry counter to browse the cornucopia of goods.  With many items baked in house and others provided by Tammie Coe Bakery two doors down I weighed the options carefully while additionally gauging my hunger and although any number of the options sounded delectable I ended up settling for two; one my own choice and a sort of obligation at this point and the other a recommendation from the young woman at the counter as \"the best thing in the world;\" a promise I told her I'd hold her to if she was wrong, and after paying the modest tab I made my way to the street with my choices packed up (ostensibly for later, but in reality for enjoyment less than thirty minutes later as I checked into my hotel.)\n\nBeginning first with my selection, La Grande Orange's very own Red Velvet Cupcake, this large specimen wrapped in red wax paper and topped with an ample pile of cream cheese frosting would prove to be one of the better Red Velvets I've had in some time save for the stellar version at Bouchon Bakery just one month prior.  Loaded with notes of cocoa and sugar plus the faint taste of cinnamon and what I'm pretty sure was clove I really enjoyed the subtle nuance to this cake and despite the $3.95 price tag the portion was substantially larger and the cake significantly more moist than more expensive versions in other major cities.\n\nMoving next to the suggestion of my cashier, the Tammie Coe Crumb Bun, I really was not sure what to expect of the $2.50 option but what I received, while not the best thing in the world, was without a doubt the best sweet I had on my visit to Arizona.  Beginning first with the exterior, this golden biscuit looked something like a cinnamon roll meets a scone with a spiral texture encased in crystal sugar, but digging deeper and peeling off a layer the texture was instead somewhat akin to the famous Breton Kouign Amann kissed with cinnamon and topped with streusel.  Layer after buttery layer, bite after yeasty bite, and making a mess of the carpet (crumb bun indeed) all the while all I can say is that if you find yourself in the Phoenix area this is a must try and given the quality of both selections I was lucky to be staying so far from La Grande Orange and Tammie Coe because otherwise I'd have gone back for more.", "business_id": "R8VwdLyvsp9iybNqRvm94g", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-10-13", "type": "review"}

It doesn't look happy, so I snag one along with an ahi sandwich to share. Eating here could be an adventure, but we missed the lunch rush. Choices are the floor of the grocery, (bad idea), the restaurant which isn't open yet or the 96 degree beautiful day. Hmmm.....the empty restaurant seems logical. Here, I find china, silverware, drinks, glasses, ice, etc and I'm able to correct the presentation of the wonderful kale salad which makes it taste much better! \n\nThe ahi sandwich is a first---I've never seen in in the Pasadena LGO (a completely different concept), or the Luggage Room (also in Pasadena).\n\nLGO Grocery also sells Italian recipe authentic homemade gelato. Incredible! Oh, and did I mention there's a coffee bar with great coffees and a knowledgeable barista! \n\nWow, the only thing I missed was the cookies, but the raspberry and espresso gelatos were wonderful as was the entire experience.\n\nAs for the store, cute stuff, nice food items and an excellent wine selection. There was a lot of rare Northwest Pinot Noirs, Red Blend and other favorites. Apparently, free corkage during happy hour, too!\n\nNow, I understand the genesis of Misfit and next stop is Chelsea's Kitchen.\n\nFood 5 star\nAmbiance 5 star\nStaff 5+ star", "business_id": "R8VwdLyvsp9iybNqRvm94g", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-10-08", "type": "review"}

Sure there have been other restaurants that have stirred such emotions but for whatever reason - generally distance or a desire to try something new - I have not yet had the opportunity.  With that said, I've now been to La Grande Orange Grocery and Pizzeria four times in four months and if you count Chelsea's kitchen as part of the LGO empire that number becomes five - the most times I've been to any single space except perhaps the quick casual and fast food restaurants I frequented during my childhood and early years of college.\n\nDescribed simply as \"an organic coffee and breakfast bar, caf\u00e9, pizzeria, and funky retail grocery\" La Grande Orange was one of the first places I visited on my seminal trip to Phoenix and the place I first suggested to my mother after driving cross country to pick up gifts for my sister and aunt back home. Sort of like The Cracker Barrel (for mainstream reference - I apologize to those I may have offended) or Southport Grocery and Caf\u00e9 (more appropriately) in scope with a small store and bakery up front and a full-fledged kitchen/restaurant in back I'd originally planned to write my standard review of LGO and all of the things I've purchased, eaten, and loved but eventually decided that such a mission would be shortsighted and considering the fact that I now own a home in Phoenix also rather futile - unless they close/burn down or I move/die this list will simply grown and grow.  Instead what I will do from here on out is seasonal updates with salient notes and pictures; from the black and white garden gnome salt&pepper shakers, toad banks and elk-horn knives to the baked goods, pancakes, and pizzas I love this place.\n\nEthiopian Reserve Coffee/Decaf/Black and Tan from ROC2:  I'd be lying if I didn't admit that at least half the reason I spend so much time at LGO is related to the free Wi-Fi and copious refills of coffee from The Roastery of Cave Creek.  Owned and operated by Dave Anderson and Michael Smith with operations not far from my home I've been lucky enough to enjoy some of their single origins from Central America, but for a blend the two offered up at LGO are both excellent with brighter citrus notes accenting the Ethiopian and lower cocoa and earthen notes in the Black and Tan.  Beats wildflower or paradise any day of the week in the battle for best freely refillable coffee.\n\nCroque Madame with Whole Wheat, Tomato, Egg, Ham, Gruyere:  I don't like Dijon and as such I requested the Croque without and what I received was superlative as the savory ham and aged gruyere were briny and bold yet tamed admirably by the crusty bread and sweet, bright tomatoes.  Topped off with a runny egg, sea salt, and just a touch of cracked pepper this wasn't quite a traditional croque but it was delicious...though the accoutrements of sour pickles and sweet melon didn't really 'fit.'\n\nFamous French Pancakes with honey, strawberries, and cr\u00e8me fraiche:  My grandmother was Hungarian and as I remember it she was also a very good cook, a talent my mother unfortunately did not inherit save for a couple of dishes; one of these dishes was Hungarian palacsinta or sweet pancakes.  Sort of like a French crepe but with a bit more tooth LGO's \"French Pancakes\" reminded me much more of palacsinta than crepe and while others may think this a bad thing I thought it was sublime.  When mom comes back to visit this is on the short list of 'must tries.'\n\nBlueberry Muffin with Whole Wheat Streusel:  Admitting my sweet tooth and wearing it on my sleeve, the first of many pastries sampled at LGO (aside from the Red Velvet Cupcake during my recruitment trip) was this, a killer whole wheat muffin topped with buttery cinnamon streusel and literally bursting with fresh blueberries.  Clearly seasonal with their focus on using fresh, never frozen ingredients I was stunned by the quality of the berries as summer had recently come to a close but hefty in butter and berries while light and fluffy on the bite this was a great muffin.\n\nPumpkin Spice Muffin:  A second muffin, this one just before Halloween, was even better than the first in terms of composition - and with a surprise burst of tangy cream cheese filling on the inside a contender for best pumpkin novelty I've had in recent memory.  Big and bold with the flavors of pumpkin, cinnamon, and nutmeg all perfuming the palate and moist like pumpkin pie without being wet I particularly loved the salty toasted pumpkin seeds topping off the muffin - a savory touch that worked nicely with the sweet filling.\n\n...more to come", "business_id": "R8VwdLyvsp9iybNqRvm94g", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-10-26", "type": "review"}

A bag of these and a jar of local honey, preserves, or pretty much any topping sold at LGO Grocery would make for a lovely start to Sunday breakfast at home.\n\nBlackberry Almond Dumpling:  If this is available at LGO you should do yourself a favor and buy two.  Powder sugar dusted and crispy like a croissant on its exterior with a wispy pull-apart interior somewhere between the aforementioned croissant and a cinnamon roll this 'dumpling' was rife with frangipane and fresh blackberries, but more so with butter.  Served warm and well-endowed to make a substantial mess of clothing both black and white I would recommend this one only as a fork and knife pastry, though any mess you make will be worth it.\n\nPistachio Chocolate Cream Puff:  A cream puff per LGO but a dressed up Paris Brest to me this wheel of choux was perhaps not as texturally sound or traditional as some of the hazelnut versions of France and elsewhere but with crackling pastry topped with a cocoa shell and crunchy pistachios plus an interior of pistachio tinged pastry cream it would be hard to be disappointed by this one.  Every bit as unique as Dominique Ansel's Paris/NY but not quite as decadent I personally loved the sweet meets savory aspects of this one but would definitely go early as the shell was starting to get a bit moist by the time I enjoyed this around noon.\n\nCr\u00e8me Fraiche Coffee Cake:  I'll totally admit to being a sucker for coffee cake, and even more for butter cake - but prior to entering La Grande Orange that Saturday morning I had no idea there was cr\u00e8me fraiche cake.  With the traditional style obviously focused on sour cream, or in the rare case cream cheese, this take would up the ante in the savories department and with sours nicely balanced by cinnamon and what I swear was cardamom and maybe even rosemary I could have eaten a whole loaf of this if LGO had provided me jam.  With a fine crumb and delicately sweet this went great with coffee but I could see it equally well suited alongside afternoon tea and sandwiches or cheese.\n\nOld Timer Cupcake:  Having already enjoyed the Red Velvet cupcake on a prior visit (as well as the Red Velvet Cake from LGO at Chelsea's Kitchen earlier that day) I decided to try the Old Timer on my most recent visit to LGO and while I'm not sure if you can call it a cupcake since it is covered top to bottom with a crunchy dark chocolate shell and therefore more like a Ding Dong (or King Don for you Midwesterners) it is still quite delicious as the dark chocolate shell, airy chocolate angel food cake, and light cream all come together much like the classic Hostess version, but with a bit less of the artificial sweetness.  Great with a cup of coffee there is really nothing 'special' here, just a really good piece of chocolate cake that goes nicely with a cup of coffee (or a big glass of milk.)\n\nAtoZ Cookie and French Sea Salt Chocolate Chip Cookie:  Two more things that go great with milk or coffee, these half pound cookies are without a doubt amongst the best I've ever tasted.  Two choices amongst a daily half-dozen or so each of these decadent creations sets a high standard for texture with the outer rim slightly crisp while the interior falls just short of 'set' but where they truly excel are the ingredients - the former a sort of kitchen sink concoction of corn flakes, caramel, oats, toffee, and who knows what else while the second is simply a perfect dark chocolate chunk cookie heavily garnished with a hefty shake of fresh flaked fleur de sel.  Go early when they're warm - and before they sell out.\n\nCampfire Smores Brownie:  In a word, decadent and in another, intense; for the chocolate lover this is an absolute must (but even then it is probably best shared.)  Dense, moist, and rife with dark chocolate while house made marshmallows and graham crackers attempt to add some levity this certainly isn't an everyday treat but as a capper to a an LGO pizza it worked quite nicely.", "business_id": "R8VwdLyvsp9iybNqRvm94g", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-10-27", "type": "review"}

You'll have to go to Customer Service.\"\n\nOn my way to customer service, I stop at the dairy case for an 88\u00a2 carton of milk, believing that Customer Service will see the logic of placing said carton at the Deli counter.

We ordered our wedding cake here. I'm not going to lie the cake was beautiful and it tasted great. I had quite a few compliments and questions about where I ordered the cake from. The reason I am writing this today is because a month ago I had a recent charge to my checking account and it was the deposit check for $50 from Fleur de Lis. This check was a deposit for cake parts that we returned. Anyway, parts were returned but yet my check was still cashed over a year and a half later! I have tried to talk to the owner/ manager Liana, who said she would check on the situation and get back with me, but I never received a call back. I tried to call back today and find out why this check was cashed when I know these parts were returned. She even ventured to say \" this has happened before!\" Which made me think they have done this to other customers. It's not the $50 that irritates me it's the principal of the matter. After I spoke with her today she said she would have her accountant call me back, but I have yet to receive one call back. This is just bad business and I would encourage others to go elsewhere for your wedding cakes because this bad experience is not worth dealing with no matter if the cake is good or not. I would never recommend this place to anyone for their wedding cakes after dealing with this!!! I am still very irritated with the lack of follow through on this matter and customer service.", "business_id": "Rd5SDxM3S9QUvRayhqZl4Q", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-10-17", "type": "review"}

The salami with the cheese they used plus the condiments gave the sub a nice little kick. Everything tasted quite fresh. The tomatoes were smaller and shiny, bright red. The prices are great. What I could tell a sub runs 2.50- 4.00. Well worth it for its size. They also have the option of getting a side with your sub.

I did quit though and immediately celebrated by eating a sandwich outside of you.\n\nI miss you a lot.  I don't really drive my car very much anymore, and if I did drive, no offense, that's pretty much the last part of town I'd like to be in, aside from obvious ghettos.

If you're not comfortable, I won't press it any further.  \n\nWith that, I just wanted to let you know that I love you.  I'm still a member of your sandwich club and have the card in my wallet.

The prepared foods area at this WF is much more restrained than at any other WF I've been to, which is sad because I used to love ogling the selections at my Boston shop. I think this location has a somewhat small but interesting wine selection but my real purpose for this review is to talk about the cheese shop. \n\nArizonans have absolutely no cheese culture. Sorry. I love AZ and I'm glad I live here, but when I think about exotic cheese I don't think 'gruyere'. Cheese selection is the only way in which Arizona has failed me, until I met Laura, my Whole Foods Cheese Monger (not Lara of Petit Fromage).  After truly depressing excursions to AJs (their cheese is a JOKE and they should be embarrassed), then Trader Joe's and Safeway I called over to Whole Foods and connected with Laura. I asked her about certain cheeses I was looking for and we agreed to meet that evening to find unique options for a wine tasting I was hosting. \n\n Laura explained that in the heat of the summer her cheese selection is rather sparse and that it would be picking back up in the fall. The cheese area is one of the smaller that I've seen, but there are some fun options beyond a simple Parrano or Gorgonzola Dolce. I saw some of my old favs like Taleggio, Explorateur, and Humboldt Fog and Laura introduced me to a few new friends, like Hirtenkase, the delightful german cheese that is made from some of the most pampered cows in the world! I decided on a refreshing chevre called Fleur Vert from California, Mimolette and Chaubier, though Laura very generously let me taste through a horde of options to find the right cheese and wine pairings. \n\nI really look forward to checking back in with her to see what new treats are in. I hope I can use her expertise for more wine events and I encourage you, nay, I insist you step away from that enormous Costco Manchego and talk to the Whole Foods Cheese staff about your exotic dairy needs.

Today I needed ingredients for baking, including King Arthur flour (only one I'll use), rye flour, ww flour, yeast, baking powder & baking soda.  An example of why I like WF - they carry King Arthur, and they have other flours (a huge variety -rye, barley, potato, soy, you name it) in small bags!  Yeah!  No more tossing 3 lbs of rye flour because I haven't used it in months.\n\nI needed anchovies for making salad dressing - they have a nice choice from $3.00 to $12.00.  Need some juice... check, nice selection. W ant a nice cheese to munch on the drive home... got it.  No, the cheese isn't cheap, but when i'm craving a good one I'll pay a buck more rather than run over to TJs.  \n\nIt seems whenever I'm doing a special dinner and want specialty, high quality ingredients, I go to WF first, and usually leave with everything i need. I've had no problem with anything being out of stock.\n\nThe downers?  The lack of some \"normal\" thinks I'd like to pick up whole there, i.e. those toilet scrub sponges on a stick; hit or miss produce quality; terrible parking lot for maneuvering when it's full; and an over abundance of snotty customers.

I'm also lazy and prefer one-stop shopping.  After reading some positive information on their website (and hoping it's at least partially true), I headed to Whole Foods to check out their offerings.\n\nFirst off, their seafood selection was really incredible.  Since I wasn't going to be able to cook it in the next few days, I settled on some frozen salmon filets certified by the Marine Stewardship Council.  That means they can charge $7 for an 8-oz filet.  Off to the meat counter.  I purchased flank steak for $15/lb.  First off, I would like to know why flank steak is ever more than free.  It's a crappy cut of meat in my opinion, but works well for slow cooking.  I also purchased stew meat for $9/lb.  Stew meat!  Another crappy cut of meat.  Needless to say, I did not buy steaks at WFM.  What about pork?  Again, ridiculous prices for chops.  Chicken?  I did find prepackaged chicken for $4.99/lb.  \n\nI did not bother checking out their organic produce since I'm more than happy to consume pesticides like my forefathers.  And wasn't there a big stink lately about some of the frozen produce at WFM labeled \"organic\" actually coming from China? A variety of other items also made their way into my cart totaling $188 for very little.  Needless to say, WFM will not be a grocery store I frequent regularly, but with their pretty amazing selection of seafood, prepared foods, cheese, locally made breads, I will be back occasionally.  I'm a fan of the store, just not their prices.\n\nAs for beef, I found a ranch in Arizona that makes monthly deliveries to the Valley and charges half of WFM without the middle man.

The guy helping me, offered to call other locations for my stuff. Very nice of him.\n\nAfter I picked up everything I \"needed\", I walked over to the prepared food section.

They have the best (in mine, and most Yelpers) ice cream around: Sweet Republic. \n\nI knew exactly what I wanted, so the guy packed up a pint for me to take home. If you are one of those people that can't make a decision on their own like a grownup, then you can sample each of the flavors, while you dilly dally...the lady in front of me was like that. The ice cream guy was VERY patient with her, and even kept up a smile the whole time.\n\nI said it before in a Quick Tip, but this is the second best WF in the area (next to the Mayo location), but the staff here makes up the difference.\n\nWell done, Whole Foods.

The impression I get is almost complete apathy and disorganization -- that no one cares and/or no one gives a damn.\n\nThey got me with their \"one stop shopping\", but in the end it's not worth it and I'm starting to spend more and more time and money at Costco, Home Depot, Target, Macy's, Sprouts, and Fry's, etc, etc.\n\nThe worst part is that there are 6-8 associates and 1-2 managers that I encounter regularly and are really, really nice and really trying to do a good job.  My heart goes out to them.  And they're the ONLY reason this store gets 2 stars from me and not just 1!\n\nAnd the only reason I'm filing such a scathing review is in hopes that someone in management will take notice and do something.  You can see from my other reviews that I'd rather rave about great experiences than complain, LoL!\n\nHere we go!\n\n1. I have 2 qualified service dogs and was accosted on one visit by one \"greeter\" who demanded to see their \"papers\" and told me that if they bit someone we (WalMart) won't be responsible.  These are 2 toy Yorkies who were sitting calmly in my cart as I entered.  When i told him politely but firmly that there is no such thing as \"papers\" for service dogs and that it was against federal law and store policy for him to ask, he called the undercover security guard who was also very rude.  I tried to call the number posted on the door for just such an occasion but it took me to a complete dead end on their phone system\n2. Store is FILTHY most of the time -- except the one time that I could clearly see that there was a group of VIPs touring the store from corporate that day\n3. I observed one jewelry counter associate being so incredibly rude to a customers it almost brought tears to my eyes and I had the complain (the customers themselves seemed a bit intimidated, they were not \"native\" English speakers)\n4. BIG, BIG disparity in service level -- some associates are SO nice and some are soooo rude!  I know it's WalMart but if management is doing its job...  Oh, no!  I forgot, IT WAS MANAGEMENT -- 2x -- that was rude to the point of hostility!\n5. Basic items out of stock for MONTHS! What's wrong with their forcasting system???  Just a few examples: Smart Balance margarine (3# size), Great Value Parmesan cheese (all sizes), Arrowhead water (1 gal), Huggies Naturals wipes, OUT Puppy Pads (size varies), and more. And this is not after a busy weekend, this is Tue afternoon, etc.  I found all these items at the next 2 closest WM stores, so they ARE available from their warehouse.\n6.  Premium items (e.g., Evian water (6pk), Ghirardelli chocolate chips, etc with no shelf tags (not priced).  This is consistent with the few higher end items they do carry\n7. So called Supercenter doesn't even stock a few bottles of Perrier or Pelligrino (or substitute); other WMs in Phoenix do\n8.  GREEN meat in case still for sale -- it was marked down, but come on!\n9.  Other reduced food that's obviously spoiled (e.g., wilted, browning veggies)\n10. Items that are marked down in every other nearby store in the city that I've visited (about 6) have still not been marked down at this store\n11. 1/2 off bakery items after 1 pm -- even though they've been re-ticketed with a new UPC, it's up to the cashier to remember to take 1/2 off at the register - do you think they forget sometimes?  And no option for customers to do it at the self-check (and no instructions to ask or remind the cashier)\n12. More expensive packages of meat stocked in the slot labeled for the less expensive cuts and/or smaller packages\n13. Site-to-Store online order pick up system -- a complete circus, don't bother!  I spent over an hour trying to pick up 2 items that were sold online as \"READY for pick up TODAY\" and was insulted by front end managers and patronized by the assistant store manager\n14. Ladies room disgusting mid-day, mid-week (i.e., not an especially busy time)\n15.

You can't deny that they have some of the best prices on brand name items, but at the same time, they have some of the worst customer service around. So really it comes down to shopping there for items that we know where they are located, and we don't have questions about whether we want to buy something or not. \n\nThis particular Walmart is pretty much the same as most Walmart Superstores. Plenty of options, lots of stock of each option, clean and organized aisle ways, decent rollbacks and regular prices on most brand items and of course their own brand items, and overall you are almost always able to find something you did or didn't plan on buying before you leave.\n\nOn this particular visit we struck out on what we were looking for in Halloween decorations, but that's more so because we are looking for pretty specific things not just general decor - which they had about 3 aisles worth!\n\nOverall: B-\nAll things being said it's still Walmart, and we still dread the beast of a store that they offer, but who can deny the cheap prices?", "business_id": "1OigyqVxIfE6AGKNGWZjnw", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-10-22", "type": "review"}

Even for Wal mart's standards, this place is horrendous.  I went there to buy a dove stamp for my hunting license for the opening day of the season and my god, I couldn't have made a worse choice coming here. \n\nFor starters, the sporting goods section only had one person behind the counter who was clearly inexperienced at his job and was frantically shuffling through papers and drawers trying to figure out how to complete a transaction.  There was a line of about 6 people when I arrived and this incompetent person was left in charge of this entire department.  After about at least 30 minutes, I was finally at the front of the line, ONLY to be told that he has to clock out and he's already off so he said he was going to go find someone else to help me, even though I was the last person there and it wouldve only taken a minute. \n\nSO then begins another 45 minute struggle of running all over the store trying to find someone who could help me.  The customer service department didnt care much, the manager on duty didn't do a damn thing, she wasn't concerned about it in the least bit, and finally a random employee showed up and I had to state my case for 5 minutes with this belligerent man in order for him to take precious time out of his night to finally help me.  I'd say from this point, it took another half an hour for me to finally get my stamp.  So all in all about an hour and a half at Walmart was spent to buy a $4 dove stamp.\n\nNot to mention when I finally got the last guy to help me out, there was a line of 3 or 4 more people that had been building up in the mean time, and he refused to check me out separately.  I was told to wait until the 4 people behind me got all their stamps and paper work filled out as well (20 minutes) so that we can all trek as a group from the sporting goods section to the front of the store where I finally paid $4 and was able to put an end to this disgusting experience.\n\nThese people are understaffed, inexperienced, jaded and have no business behind in ANY sort of customer service positions because the main issue here and my main complaint is that THEY DONT CARE.  I can't emphasize this enough, THEY DONT CARE about you or your problems, or what you're looking for or any of that nonsensical Wal Mart rhetoric that they all have written on their blue shirts.  What these people care about is what time they can clock out.  Thats it. \n\nPLEASE DO NOT COME HERE.  Anyone is who up at 2 AM and needs something urgently from a grocery store, please find somewhere else.  I know the huge selection and low prices might make wal mart sound like a tempting idea, but don't do it!  I hope I wake up one morning and find out that this location has been wiped out from the face of the planet.

I'm not sure how or why this happens. If you ask around many have already formulated a various theories. Some feel it's the way the condiments are layered amongst the slices of meat and cheese. Others think that it's a secret ingredient that maker uses like a dash of celery salt or paprika. My mom used to make me a sandwich of sliced turkey, Muenster cheese, Miracle Whip, bread and butter pickles on Wonder bread. I've made this sandwich so many times but have never been able to make it taste as good as hers. \n\nI recently tested this out at Breadcrafters Bakery and Cafe in Paradise Valley where they specialize in fresh bakes breads, house made salads and of course sandwiches made by someone else. Breadcrafters isn't your ordinary sandwich shop, as the name indicates they also bake bread and pastries, but oh the bread! For me this is one of the best bread bakeries in a town that only has a handful of really good bread makers. \n\nTo celebrate such amazing bread, why not make amazing sandwiches? \n\nNancy's Favorite ($7.75) arrived piled high with roast beef, Gorgonzola and roasted onion spread, roasted red peppers, lettuce and tomato on a crusty baguette. Aside form the chewy flavorful baguette and the tender roast beef, the bold and creamy notes of the cheese spread makes this sandwich a stack-of-love. By contrast the Turkey Jack Stack ($7.75) had a spicy bite thanks to pepper jack cheese and red onion. The sourdough bread it was served on was so spongy and flavorful I ordered a loaf ($4.50) to go. \n\nUnfortunately the Park Avenue Chicken Salad ($7.75) was under-seasoned; its only saving grace was the incredible raisin walnut pecan bread it was served on. On my next visit, Ill just pick up a loaf ($4.50) of the bread and skip the salad. \n\nWhen you order a sandwich you have your choice of potato salad, pasta salad, fruit, coleslaw or potato chips. I might avoid the disappointing potato salad. The potatoes were oven roasted which is great but the spuds were over cooked and dehydrated making for a chewy strange tasting mess. \n\nThe love doesn't stop at their bread; they make cupcakes that are moist and inviting. On my last visit I picked up a Red Velvet Cupcake ($2.75) and a Strawberry Shortcake Cupcake ($2.75).  On my way back home I couldn't stop thinking about the cute little white box housing my treats. Once home, dessert came first! The shortcake cupcake wasn't shortcake at all but made from angel food cake, then topped with real whipped cream and a glazed strawberry. This was one of those desserts you savor and enjoy though I ended up eating the whole thing in about four bites, yes it was that good. Wiping the crumbs from my face I proceeded to convince myself that I would only have a single bite of the red velvet, wrong. I couldn't resist licking the cream cheese frosting off before devouring the moist and ultra chewy cake. \n\nWhile there is still no concrete reason why a sandwich made by someone else's hand is better, I do know this, I enjoyed trying to prove this one out.", "business_id": "j5HLcBru7FEirYJPbKFVWA", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-10-15", "type": "review"}

People in the back making food could see us and even made eye contact.  I can't figure out why nobody was up front or was told we were waiting. When someone finally came up we told them we were about to leave and they didn't seem to care.  I decided to try again today... Same thing.  Exact same experience except this time I walked out after 4 minutes, and there was food in the window that I assume was ready for the couple that was in there.  I can't imagine going back after this weekend.", "business_id": "j5HLcBru7FEirYJPbKFVWA", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-09-13", "type": "review"}

I love smoothies and had never been to a Smoothie King and was in the area so decided to give it a try.  Big Mistake!!  When I entered the store there was an older man towards the front and a younger girl making smoothies towards the back.   The place only had about two people in it.   No greeting given by the older man at the front.   The menu here is very, very hard to decipher.   The menu board is so discombobulated you don't know what end is up.   It lists the name of the smoothie for example, \"Cranberry Cooler\" or \"Immune Builder\" but they don't list what is in these smoothies.    You have to look at a \"to-go\" menu to have the smoothie ingredients explained.   I asked the older man what was in the \"electrolyte mix\" (as this was listed as part of the ingredients in a smoothie I was considering)  his answer to me was \"ARE YOU KIDDING?\"   \"You have electrolytes in your body.  They are minerals\"    I have no idea why I even continued with my order after this rude treatment.   Anyway,  I ordered a \"Light and Fluffy\" smoothie.

First it's difficult to get in and out of the Ranch Market on S. Central on the weekends -- it's VERY VERY CROWDED!  Second, this is an \"ethnic\" experience.   My husband, a \"gringo,\" has, on occasion, encountered some language barrier challenges, but has always been successful in navigating it. - so don't let it stop you!\n\nThe Ranch Market is always on the tour for out-of-town-guests who visit us from the East Coast.

The cashier said they didn't have enough cash after standing in line what seemed like forever.  Ok, i can deal with it, its a grocery store not a bank.\n\nA few weeks later I went and again stood in line for a lifetime.  The cashier was nice but the food cost was too much for what i got.  I saw later that day the same item for $3 cheaper.  Ok, my fault for not bargain shopping.\n\nThe last straw was a day ago.  I went to pick up a few quick items.  I wanted smoked salmon but I felt that the refrigerator the package was in was too warm.  I looked at the dial on the wall and it read over 55 degrees.  I honestly don't know if that's too warm but for me I didn't want to risk the food poisoning. That fish could kill me!  Okay I'm extreme it would have made me sicker than a homeless dog but I'm strong enough to survive.  I just don't want to have to survive my dinner.\n\nNext I stood in line again for ever and the cashier asked for my Safeway card.  I forgot it and my phone number didn't work.  I asked the cashier if I could use hers.  She looked at me if I asked if I could borrow her house and husband for the weekend. Our conversation went like this:\n\nMe:  \"My phone number inset working.  My I use your (the stores) card please?\"\n\nCashier: \"NO!\"  \n\nMe:  \"Geeze, I said please.  Can your manager enter a store number for me please?\"\n\nCashier:  \"NO!\"\n\nMe: to the lady behind me...\"My I use your Safeway card?\"\n\nCashier:  Started yelling at the woman behind me in Spanish not to give her card to me.  She shouldn't assume I didn't know what she was saying.\n\nMe:  \"Can you call your manager please?\"\n\nCashier:  \"I could get fired for giving you my personal information.  I just can't steal points from Safeway.  I don't think you understand I could loose me job and its too bad you feel this way about it.\"\n\nI'm sorry if her day was bad but all i wanted to do was get $2 off the high priced items and eat.\n\nMe:  \"I'm sorry you have to go to work and feel like your going to get fired for helping customers.  Shame on your manager for not giving you the tools to do your job and making you afraid to assist me.\"\n\nFinally, the woman behind me shared her card as she was shaking her head at the cashier.  I will never shop there again. I also have a $600 per week budget in grocery's for my office.

But, as I was saying, this was just apple-cinnamon flavored butter.  It was tasty, but I thought I would be adding something somewhat nutritious to their french toast when I requested it.  Quite the opposite...  To continue, the gravy for my country fried steak tasted fantastic- peppery and creamy and delicious!  But my eggs were completely undercooked and I had to send them back.  My husband was charged for a coffee he didn't get, and overall I think it was a bit pricey for the quality.  \n\nWe'll probably be giving it another chance soon since it's just a great way to spend the morning and so close to the places we like to hike.", "business_id": "MLcXtnpzygZvQ9BtseLLlw", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-11-18", "type": "review"}

If this might bother you or guests, this may not be the place for you.

I over heard the conversation with a man who said \"that is an extra charge for the box\"   She came back and rang me up  at the same time the man (I can only assume was owner or manager)  walked by and I expressed my  dismay that I was being charged (yes only $1) for a box that on the phone i was told I could have. (did I mention that the cake was NOT even in a box but in a bag.  He then said to me ...\"oh  i remember you.. we spent 1/2 hour on the phone with the half birthday.\" (apparently my order  was an annoyance)  I quickly corrected him because it was no where near 1/2 hr and that I understood that he could not accommodate my other request  but I am a little surpised that you are charging me $1 for a box that you told me I could have. He then said to me rather sarcastically \"what would you have done? What would you have done if  I told you it was $1 on the phone??.... I have to pay for the boxes they cost me money \"   Then he went to the cash register  opened it up and rudely  SHOVED a $1 in my Target shopping bag!!  I chose this store because it is in Ahwatukee and the Cakes are supposed to be amazing, but when  the customer service is so incredibly rude I will NOT be back and I'll be sure to pass on my experience to anyone who desires a cake for a special occasion.  WHY? because anyone can defrost a cake and put frosting on it but it is the customer service part (the feeling like your business is wanted ) that will bring people back. \n\n PS...The cake was Just ok...  I was trying to choose between Lemon and Pineapple when I ask him  on the phone  for his advice his reply was \"well we only have pineapple once a year\"  not distinctive at all.....   Costco cakes are amazing and moist and their customer service is always stellar.", "business_id": "vPJ4iCOSuxCxHPtb18gwWw", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-09-22", "type": "review"}

There was a review for another location where the reviewer says it looks when you step in the door that Paradise has promise. That is so true.\n\nWhen you first walk in and are looking at the bagels, the baked goods, the menu, the purple lights, you almost forget about your last, horrible experience. Have no fear, once the food is served, you quickly remember. I ordered a croissant breakfast sandwich - no ham, and a medium coffee. Seems simple enough. They brought me the sandwich WITH ham. I didn't know when I first bit into it. This ham is still alive, it is so tough, I am sure this is what Wilson rejects for their footballs. What is wrong with you Paradise? Why would you stick a huge slab of tough ham inside a croissant. A croissant that wasn't even toasted. Which brings me to my next comment. You stick an egg on a croissant and you make no attempt to toast the croissant? Even Dunkin Donuts toasts the croissant. You have no clue how to make anything. Even after Panera acquired you, they couldn't impart any wisdom into you? And coming from Panera, that would be little wisdom since they have a terrible menu, which you made worse.\n\nIt was good to taste the same bitter mud, er, coffee, that Panera serves.\n\nParadise, you owe me more money for this disgusting crap you served me, but why can't you try to improve? You clearly can't think this food is good? You remind me of the fat girl in school who boys would tell her, she had a cute face just to get some action out of her.

The day before Thanksgiving.  The Black Friday of grocery stores. \n\n...\n\nYes.  I wait until the last minute to get some items.  Don't be hatin'!\n\nI have been living in this area for coming on 2 years now.  I have my preferences on where I go.\n\nI do not normally go here for a full load of groceries.  Their prices are significantly higher than the competition and I don't have the time to do the price matching stuff.\n\nThey are missing the 5th star because of this.\n\nBut... if I need a couple things... I go here because it's convenient for me and I like the people (no crazies or bums).   I'll pay the extra dollar for my convenience in those cases.\n\nToday was a shining moment for this location and I just had to share.\n\nI pull into the parking lot where there are cars backed up, people honking all pissed off at each other, racing to empty spots... I ignore them and calmly move on... \n\n... and find ROCKSTAR parking.  If you don't know what Rockstar parking is... you'll never address it as the same \"front row next to the handicap spots\" again.\n\nI didn't even have to fight for it!\n\nSo thinking this is a good omen that I chose Albertsons to do my almost belated shopping, I park... find a nice shopping cart where it belongs inside the building and in the shopping cart \"corral\".\n\nI walk around... find my things.  I figure out that the Albertson's fried onions are only 2.50 and they have an excellent recipe for cheesy green bean casserole right on the back that fits the only dish I happen to have at home for a casserole!  Sign me up!!\n\nIt cost me $16.64 (not including tax) to build up this recipe (see the back of the Albertson's Fried Onions can for the recipe... and attempting to not use name brand if I can help it due to their prices)... and that's amazing! To feed like 12 people???  That's great!\n\nAs I walk around, there are so many Albertson's employees walking around.  I wonder why... then figure out that they are restocking the shelves as they empty.  I didn't have to fight for my cream of mushroom.  I didn't have to fight for the frozen green beans.\n\nWe all know, as we read this, that this happened last year at Walmart.\n\nSo... finished with my recipe and confident that I'm going to dazzle my family with my amazing culinary skills... I walk toward the front of the store with my cart, sifting thru the crying babies, squealing kids, irritated mom's on the phone with their sister's fighting over who's going to do the gravy... \n\n... to a line that only has ONE person in it... who is only purchasing 15 items or so.\n\nThe clerk handles them quickly, and they move on.  My stuff moves forward... she handles me quickly with a smile... and never admits that she's going insane with all this noise.\n\nThe sign of a true lady. :-)\n\nI leave peacefully after paying for my goods... and thank the gods that I listened to my gut instinct to go to Albertsons versus Walmart.\n\nThey have proven themselves to me... so that when I need to go somewhere on Christmas Eve to pick up butter... that's where I'm going. :-)", "business_id": "I4uAbB_i9dLtPkWJvyOXiQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-11-23", "type": "review"}

The store has a very friendly atmosphere, that is felt immediately on entering.\nThe store is always clean including the restrooms. \nThe store manager of this store, #1004, is always out and about in his store. Bob S. is an example of an excellent manager, and strives to please his customers. One of many examples of this, is when I purchased some Honeycrisp-apples.  Once I got home with them, I couldn't wait to sample one, and found a couple of them had brown spots inside.  As the price was 3.99 per pound, I reluctantly returned to the store where I mentioned this to Bob. He promptly escorted me to his produce Department,  and introduced his produce manager. He showed him the brown spots inside the apples, in spite of the beautiful appearance\nof the outside.\nBob and his produce manager apologized profusely, \n(Which certainty was not necessary) \nBob then gave me several apples to replace the bad ones. and offered for me to take more. That experience spoke volumes to me.\nThe cashiers,  (Tanya) and all others that have checked me out,  are friendly and also are committed to customer satisfaction. Tanya, for example, left her check stand to escort me back to the smoked salmon. \nOnce in the seafood section she showed me the smoked salmon products, as the package I had purchased was priced differently than at the check stand, and I had read the wrong sale price marking. \nAnother person in Bob's store that deserves mentioning is Janet, the florist Manager. Janet always has a smile, and enjoys her job. Upon asking her\nexpert opinion on several occasions,  she went out of her way to show me the best options for the event.\nIn closing, I applaud the entire staff for a job cheerfully,  well done.\nThank you.\nMike Larsen", "business_id": "I4uAbB_i9dLtPkWJvyOXiQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-09-26", "type": "review"}

Wait staff service is iffy on how fast it is, and if your coffee is refilled.  Wait staff are long timers and good, but the place seems to be short staffed all the time.\nEvery time you check out--in my experience--there is a line at the register--it's either not staffed or the person is in efficient.\nOn Sunday it took 20 min to check out and pay.  And it was the Coco's lady at the counter--not the customers.  The pie orders are very manual and take a long time.  The lady here today did not know how to process a coupon for the customer in front of me--she had to call a manager to authorize it.  She was also answering callers from outside--who were ordering those slow manual pie orders.  The line was still stacked up to 8 behind me (like it was when I got in line).  It's a backup line becuase it's so slow and inefficient.  The checkout needs help.\nThe restaurant was maybe 1/2 full when I cam in, but all 5 of the booths in the room with the counter, were not bussed, and two seats at the counter too.

Its part of a market/grocery store as everyone else has already noted. Its a little hidden, and I think that hurts this place a little bit.\n\nAnyways, the food is VERY good. The chicken shawarma is probably some of the best I have ever had. Hummus, yellow rice, and couscous also go very well with the food. There is the garlic-butter sauce that comes with the shawarma and kabobs, and that REALLY makes the food that much better. Gyro plate is also very commendable, but its hard to get this wrong since the gyro comes on a huge slab and rotates on a rotisserie. Yet, a lot of places do get the gyro plate wrong. I think this place does a good job of heating up the gyro meat on the rotisserie and then the grill.\n\nBaklava also deserves a mention. Its damn good. You can get some exotic mediterranean stuff like olives and feta cheese by the pound, i love that stuff.\n\nThe pricing of this place along with the good quality food makes this place a hidden gem. Its like $8 for almost any plate you'd want. Its plenty of food per plate, and for under $20 for 2 people, its worth a visit. Its very easy to compare this stuff to haji baba, its a tough pick. However, I think the hummus here tastes much better, it doesn't taste like its straight out of a can. The plates here I think are a better deal. If you just want a gyro sandwich, then go to haji baba.", "business_id": "4rr-CJp0jMKr-kg9wnrTdw", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-11-06", "type": "review"}

I am a huge fan of middle eastern cuisine and I was surprised they had one of my favorites, kafta, on the menu. The kofta here is great it gets a nice light char from the grill on the outside but is still juicy and tender on the inside. I love it. The fact that the platter is only $8 and comes with rice, hummus and salad is a deal I can't pass up.\n\nThose who know me know that I am picky on what hummus I enjoy since i have been making my own for almost 20 years. The hummus here is the rare exception to my normal rule that I don't like the super smooth and creamy hummus. I am not sure what exactly it is but I like it here.\n\nFor lunch I usually get the tabouli instead of the salad as my second side. It's really fresh and has a nice bite to it. I usually mix it with some hummus and apply to pita bread as the flavors work well together.\n\nAs for other things on the menu I have sampled most of their range of baklava thanks to the great yelp check in deal they had. I really liked the walnut but usually I will just look into the case and point at whatever looks good. That plan hasn't left me disappointed yet so I think I will stick with it. For entree's the chicken shwarma is my second favorite, the garlic sauce really makes this dish; the beef shawarma is pretty tasty but I have a hard time passing over the chicken for this one.\n\nThe staff is friendly and I can't find a negative thing to say about this place.

I arrived with plenty of time to spare before needing to clock in at work, but there are no grab and go boxes at 7am.  Okay,fine - so I get in line.  There are 3 guys working but one is the only cashier, one is taking orders, and the other appears to be working in the back.  There is now a line for bagels and the person taking orders doesn't appear to be motivated to work quicker then a snail.  After waiting for the one person in front of me, I request a box of bagels to be informed that I will have to build one.  Fine.  I decide on them as fast as I can because i need to get to work.  I get my box, my cream cheese,and now I am waiting in line again for 2 individuals in front of me and another person trying to cut the line to get another cup of coffee - which he was able to do since the cashier appeared to be having issues with his machine or he wasn't trained properly, I don't know.  This excursion that should have only taken 10 minutes tops, took double the time.  I was late to work, and I will never go to this establishment again.

I knew that my favorite coffee shop in Minnesota, Caribou Coffee, didn't exist in the desert southwest.  Tired, a bit intimidated, and craving coffee, I find my first local Starbucks about 2 miles from where I live.  I park my car and walk up to the store, and from the moment the coffee aroma hit me, I knew I had found a place I could get away, drink great coffee, and relax reading my book, just like I had done back home.  The baristas (at least 2 or 3 of them) are extraordinarily friendly.  I had an extended conversation with one about Near Eastern and Asian culture and languages, which blew my mind. That had never happened to me before, and it brought a profound joy to my heart.  I had spent nearly 30 years in MN and I had never encountered such friendly staff *anywhere*, not even in the coveted \"uptown\" area of Minneapolis (known for being down to earth, organic, open minded folks).  I felt immediately welcomed in a strange land, one in which I wasn't yet comfortable.  I don't have much money, but this Starbucks gets what little dollars I do have; it gives me an escape, a feeling that I am \"home\", and that sense of community I so dearly miss.  I've spend many hours in their cushy chairs, either applying for jobs on my laptop, or reading a book out of my favorite series.  I don't know what I would've done if I hadn't found this Starbucks in my first few days in Arizona.  I know, many of you would say, \"Gee, Starbucks?  Really?  Couldn't you have found a more local coffee shop?\"  No.  I couldn't have.  I'm broke, and I have no internet access where I live.  To stumble upon this shop was awesome; I was never a fan of Starbucks when I lived in MN, but now, I'm a huge fan.  At certain hours of the day, you can't find a place to sit, but that makes it all the more warm and friendly.  People here don't seem to mind if you sit directly next to them when it's busy (Minnesotans apparently really like their personal bubble).  I give it 2 thumbs up, but you'll have to see it for yourself.  I may be merely a lonely traveler looking for something familiar, but I was impressed with the service, the friendly faces, the product and the cleanliness of this coffee shop.", "business_id": "1FkRvL3fj2ERBoddXwanTQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-11-28", "type": "review"}

It was a basically tasted more mayo than anything and I basically had to spit it out.

I know this, I will not be returning to any Paradise Bakery as this company feels to overlook quality.  \n\nIf you want to see what tuna fish taste should like, go to Wildflower Bakery located on Val Vista and Baseline.

There were only 2 cars ahead of me and somehow was in the drive-thru for a total of almost 20 minutes. The girl at the drive-thru window did apologize for the wait but still, not the reason why I go to the drive thru...I go because it's supposed to be fast and convenient!!! When I took out the sandwich, it had some sort of sauce all over the wrapper and the paper was sticking to the bag. When I opened the sandwich, I bit into stale bread and a horrible tasting sauce on the turkey! It was so nasty!! On top of that, I opened up the sandwich to wipe the sauce off and noticed a torn off piece of notebook paper stuck to the turkey!!! The chai they gave me was also sticky and had brown stuff floating on the top. The drink was also warm, even though I ordered it iced.

I drink at least 1 Starbucks everyday not to mention food and drink purchases for my family. It's ridiculous to try and fool your customers.

I never asked for extra lime juice? You put extra lime juice so that the drink would be filled to the top, which was your decision to do. I told them they should tell customers before they charge you extra for something and she responded with \"yeah, I know\". If you know, then tell the customer. .80 cost more than an upgrade in size and almost a 25% mark up on the drink. I will never come to this Starbucks again or bashas, because of the customer service.

It's cheap, you almost can't find cheaper produce around town.  However, it comes with a price.  The produce quality is hit and miss.  One week you may find great deals on grapes, but the cauliflower that was on deal starting two weeks earlier is still there and in pretty bad shape.  So you can stock up on the grapes, but you have to pass on the cauliflower.  That's sort of how it is.\n\nThat said, if you don't mind shopping like that, you can get a ton of fruit and veg, like bags full for $20.  \n\nThe other thing is they don't really do organic options at all.  I've found that some of their produce (rarely, I should say, does this happen) but I'll examine the label and see that it's actually organic.  But it's just by happenstance, they don't have an organic section or options.  When it does happen though, it's a great deal, you can get it for really cheap.  But more often than not, the produce is not organic and is not local.  The oranges in the spring are almost always from Mesa though, so that's nice.\n\nSo it's sort of like the dollar store for produce.  You can get some great deals, you just need to be willing to pick through things and figure out what is decent quality.  Beyond the produce, they do also have a nice selection of cheeses and dry goods, along with local honeys, salsas, soup mixes, etc.  Those tend to be a little more pricey, but it's nice to be able to buy local products.\n\nOverall, I wish I could give it 3.5 stars.  I'll err on the generous side and do 4.  What makes me want to vote it a little lower is the overall produce quality, the fact that most of the produce is not local, and that there are few, if any, organic options.  But I suppose all that comes at a price, and that's what Ranch Market is really good at is keeping the prices low.", "business_id": "zZFXEqWY_bE6s_f38RhNMw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-09-04", "type": "review"}

According to my parents, one of my first words was \"K,\" for Circle K. My grandmother drew a Circle K symbol next to her signature on my early birthday cards. When I was a little bit older, I had a TV Guide route (yes, the weekly magazines were delivered door to door at one time). I spent most of my earnings at Circle K, giving me an important lesson in money management and nutrition. Today, Circle K no longer dominates the convenience store market in Arizona as it did back then, but on weekdays, I am still a daily customer.\n\nAs a Circle K devotee, I was thrilled when the small, rundown, hard-to-see store on Pinal Avenue in Casa Grande moved a few months ago to the corner of Pinal and Rodeo, the site of the former Chevron. They literally closed the old store one afternoon and opened the new one the next evening.\n\nWhat a difference a day makes. The new store is better in just about every way. It's bigger with wider aisles and better staffed. It has twice as many gas pumps, a bigger soda fountain, and more grilling space for Tornados and Diamondback wieners. They now have a car wash and even an RV wash.\n\nThen there is the beer cave, which has become the hallmark of newer Circle K stores. I love to go in there on hot summer days. I don't drink, so I don't actually buy any beer. But it's a great place to cool off. Of course, if a store clerk or another customer walks in, I pretend to be perusing the beer selection.\n\nOther people have noticed the new Circle K too. Lots of them. The old Chevron hardly had any business, mainly because their gas prices were so high. At the new store, you are lucky to find a parking space in the morning.\n\nThis brings me to a suggestion: Because of the parking shortage, many customers create their own parking spaces, creating havoc in the parking lot. Perhaps Circle K could add parking spaces by painting lines on the pavement on the south side of the building and by the curb along the north and west sides of the parking lot. It would make things much more orderly.\n\nAnother slight negative is that the cashiers often serve two customers at once on the same counter. There is little room between the cash registers, so serving one customer to the right of one cash register and another customer to the left of the next cash register makes no sense. They might want to take a lesson in customer queuing from the folks at QuikTrip.\n\nThe employees at the new Circle K are very friendly and better trained than at the old store. Someone behind the counter always says \"hi\" the second I walk in. They act as if they actually like their jobs. Having said that, I loved the manager and employees at the old Circle K. They were good down-to-earth people who worked hard because they were terribly understaffed. They didn't move to the new store, so I hope they got good jobs elsewhere in the Circle K world.\n\nAlso, this is strictly a personal thing, but I miss the pay phone in front of the old store. I never used it, nor did anybody else, but you rarely see pay phones these days. They should have moved the phone to the new store strictly for nostalgia or novelty purposes.\n\nAlong our commute to work, my wife and I wouldn't think of starting our day without a trip to Circle K. To us, every day is a Circle K day. \n\nHey, maybe that would make a good marketing slogan.", "business_id": "PHn9GiHHipKJf73N0ujhlQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-09-05", "type": "review"}

The only life form encountered was a woman named Councellar, who asks a lot of questions and seems to be adept at circular logic. She was not blue, so I did not make out with her and besides, that would violate the prime directive. Spock acted illogical even though he can't.  Bones said that he wasn't something and I made Scotty do a complex engineering job in less time then he said he needed.\n\nDuring the Shuttle ride home, I  veered from my plotted course and visited the pleasure planet Angel Sweet in the Gelato Nebula.  A fine distraction after such a mind numbing session...errr, I mean mission. Why all the questions? Why the poor artwork?  Why is there a dead tree in her office?   Hmm...\n\nUpon docking at Planet Angel Sweet, the away team (me) was greeted by one of the inhabitants. A ditsy young thing that clearly has no clue about anything other than Hannah Montana, a local preslut from a nearby Planet Horseshit.  I believe The Universal Translator was on the fritz, because I could have swore she said \"I would rather shave than wash\" and \"What!? We have a website? I did not know that.\"  Clearly  a linguist will need to be sent to this planet.\n\nThe Angel Sweet planet offers up many distracting delectable treats to take  the weary space traveler's mind off of his mind.  What to choose, which flavors should I mix?  Should I mix Cream and fruit or chocolate and peanut butter?  Where is Zulu when I need to plot a course? Only one thing to do. Taste all of them and then make a hasty choice.  Just say the first thing that spills out of your mouth. \n(Keep reading in the Kirk Voice!)  \n\"I'll.......have.........The Panna Cotta.......and Buttter......Finger.\n\nA wise choice.   The Carmel in the Panna Cotta mixed well with the Terran delicacy of fingers dipped in butter.

She was going on and on about how awesome it was when she lived here, and even though it wasn't the hottest AZ weather we've experienced, gelato sounded like a great idea at the time. I was not disappointed in the slightest. It's a welcome alternative to the too-icy nonfat frozen yogurt trend that seems to have exploded everywhere recently. \n\nThe problem when faced with so many mouth-watering flavors at once is, well, like others, I get overwhelmed. Do I want something fresh and fruity or something rich and creamy? I was the last of our party of four to order, so I made a last-minute decision and picked the super dark chocolate. It was super dark, and it was definitely dark chocolate, and definitely tasty. I did, however, kinda regret my decision because my sister had the panna cotta & pumpkin, which was amaaaazing, and my husband had the best tasting strawberry gelato I'd ever had. My sister's boyfriend had the hazelnut and something else (I can't remember), but he said the hazelnut got a little tiring after awhile. Oh, we overheard another customer being helped--the employee said, \"Most people like one third [this flavor] and three quarters [another flavor],\" which made us laugh quietly. I love this place.\n\nThe day before we headed back home, we stopped here again and had a different employee waiting on us. She was friendly (and cute; can't ignore that), and when I asked for a taste of the orange gelato, she gave me a little spoonful and said it went really well with the plain creamy gelato, for a creamsicle taste. But I went with a serving of orange, chocolate, and panna cotta. Creamy taste explosion: achieved. The orange and chocolate gelatos were reminiscent of Starbucks' Mocha Valencia, which Starbucks no longer offers. *sad horn*\n\nI feel like I should add that upon first impression, immature idiot in me thought that the super dark chocolate looked like a tub full o' something one might find on http://www.regretsy.com.", "business_id": "XWpkTxBLgRXxl7g2Hw62Qg", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-11-10", "type": "review"}

I-mart has now expanded to include a restaurant just a few doors down from the market. Wise decision, because the market part smells whack. It is pretty obvious and common knowledge that they cut their meat in the back of the store. I suppose the market and restaurant deserve their own review, but I think its the same rating, I'll just merge them.\n\nThe market has your basic Indo-Pak foods. Don't confuse the owner for an Indian or Paki though, he's from Bangladesh. He's an extremely nice guy, but I feel like every since he moved from Tempe, near ASU, his store has just lost substance. If you need to buy substantial amounts of halal meat I suggest you go elsewhere, probably Baiz Market would be a good idea. The meat here is very inconsistent. He's got your basic Shan masala amongst other odd brands. Of course he has asian rice and everything else you'd really expect from this type of store. The mango juices he stocks are weird, but he has some Pakistani soda, Pakola. That's pretty cool.\n\nThe restaurant should be avoided. My fellow Indo-Pak friends rave about this place all the time, but I don't think they know any better. I walked in and the owner was taking orders... I was slightly confused and surprised (today was the first time I went to the restaurant). I thought to myself, \"Hey man, he's usually at the store cuttin' my meat, what the heck is he doing here?\" He must have made the food, because when he disappeared again he didn't reappear until my food was ready. My friends had bought me a tandoori chicken wrap, I'm being very ungrateful, but it was not enjoyable at all. The naan was obviously microwaved a few seconds too long, because by the time I got to it it was like chewing on plastic. Taking bites out my 'wrap' was just painful. I'm sad because the filling was actually pretty good, but how can you overmicrowave naan to that point? It's like overmicrowaving your hotpocket (just follow the damn directions).\n\nThe owner clearly wants to retire soon, he first moved from the ASU location to a much smaller store, and now he is barely focusing on the store. To make things worse, he decided to open up a restaurant. If you could compare this place to a legit Indo-pak restaurant, it'd be something like comparing Filiberto's to Chipotle.

I tried many kinds of drinks, each were nothing special but certainly up to standard. I loved the lakeside vibe, and was glad to have a coffee shop nearby that wasnt a Starbucks. Each time I visited with one of my friends (all of whom were female) the staff treated us courteously and served us very quickly. \n\nSo I started to suggest this place whenever I had a meeting with a friend, including my male friends. This is when things changed dramatically. Each encounter I had with the staff from then on was beyond horrible. I had a staff member yell at me repeatedly for \"stealing\" the honey to use in my tea (apparently 2 minutes was too long for it to remain at my table before it was reported stolen). I had one give me a dirty look when I asked why they only allow debit cards on orders over 3.99 (which seems ridiculous to me considering how many customers use debit or credit now and how few stores even have a minimum charge). Then there was THE incident.\n\nOn this particular day it was early in the morning and I was without cash, and so I brought my own tea with me to Coffee Rush. The friend that I was with bought coffee and every other time I had been there I had bought something so i didnt think it was a big deal. Boy was I wrong. It wasnt long before the guy working stormed up to our table and sputtered out the phrase, \"Can you read!?\" Having no idea what he was talking about I just looked at him blankly as he pointed angrily at the microscopic lettering on the door that read: \"No outside food or drink\" . I apologized and offered to go outside and he snorted and stomped away. While I was still in shock, my friend was very upset by the rude way that the barista had treated me and as I walked outside he decided to inform him that if he wanted to keep customers he probably shouldnt yell at them and be so rude and that I was a regular customer and didnt had brought my tea from home and meant no harm.\n\nAfter this my friend and I continued to chat oustide. About 10 minutes later, the guy COMES BACK OUT and starts berrating us, asking us sarcastically how what he said could have possibly have been construed as rude. My friend told him that he thought that this whole thing was over, and he is sorry if we offended him, but we felt that his approach of informing us of \"company policy\" could have been seems as a bit rude. He paid no heed, instead continued to repeat the same phrases over and over again until finally asked him to please go inside because NOW he was DEFINTELY being rude. To which he responded, \"Well NOW...I am TRYING to be rude.\" and then stormed back into the store.\n\nNeedless to say I am never coming back here again, and I would advise you to tread very lightly even if you are regular customer here, as you never know when you might severely offend the server and then  never want to come back again.", "business_id": "l1MZjZK2tLxfFRB62lQmsg", "stars": 1, "date": "2009-09-22", "type": "review"}

The barista, Stepheno, was wonderful. I let him know it was my first time in and he explained their menu and how to order and what not. It was SO nice not having to deal with that smug hipster attitude you find at a lot of the local coffee shops in the valley. He also asked my name and my sons name. He let me know he made my sons chocolate milk at \"kids temp\" which was wonderful. Also, he told me you can get 1 or 2 shots of espresso for the same price. Awesome!\n\nYou can buy beans to take home. And if you buy 1 lb you get a free frost drink. Nice!\n\nThe barista also seemed to know pretty much everyone who came to the counter and their order. I was definitely impressed by that. \n\nMy coffee was pretty good. I'm sort of a coffee snob so I could tell they don't roast the beans, but that's just me being nitpicky. The coffee is good, just not the best I've had locally.\n\nI love the location. Patio in the back with a nice view of the water.\n\nReasonable prices\n\nDiverse crowd - young, old, moms with their young kids, people working or studying...no one will feel out of place here.\n\nNegatives:\n\nNow for the great customer service I received today, they have some policies I find totally anti-customer and irritating.\n\n1) You have to spend at least $3.99 to use a debit/credit card. I never carry cash so this is absolutely irritating and inconvenient. I hate it when businesses cheap out and pass this cost unto the customer. Look I get the there are fees, but at least hide it and raise the prices a bit to make up the cost. \n\n2) the wifi policy is ridiculous\n\n3) the patio is overrun with smokers so my son and I could not enjoy sitting out there.\n\nSo...I don't know.

It was clean, even the bathroom and when you have a child you see a lot of bathrooms!  A clean bathroom in a public place is a thing of beauty.  \n\nI don't live close to any of the really great coffee places so Starbucks will have to suffice.  And it helps when you find a Starbucks card in your purse too!!", "business_id": "_9JDgUdXbCn1Vx-nj49VJg", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-09-11", "type": "review"}

So I stopped in to check it out on my way to work yesterday. Everything I read in the reviews about Lee Lee seems to be true. This place is huge and well stocked. I was easily able to find plenty of the items I hadn't been able to find at 99 Ranch last time I was there (like my favorite brands of chicken dumplings and shrimp crackers). There is certainly a wide variety of merchandise to choose from. I have never seen a wider selection of chopsticks in all my life. \nI have two minor complaints: 1. I'm pretty sure whoever was given the pricing gun got a little confused from time to time. There were two steaming pots that were identical, one was $17.99, the other $19.00. I noticed price discrepencies amongst other items as well. Also, the organization and placement of certain products was a little confusing. For example, normally I would expect to find the shrimp crackers with the shrimp chips (if you don't even know what I'm talking about, just take my word for it). However, these items were in two completely different aisles. I found jam in a different aisle than peanut butter and Nutella, which seemed odd (these are all things spread on bread...so why not group them together). It may be that these items are grouped by country of origin or something (this is how it is done at Ta Lin Market in Albuquerque), but if this is the case, it should be made a little more clear...then again, maybe I missed the signs. When you go, whether you are looking for something specific or just browsing, you need to go up and down every aisle, otherwise you may miss something.\n\nAnyway, I'll still shop at 99 Ranch because I like going to the Chinese Cultural Center, even if it is little more than a strip mall playing dress up.

But thankfully I see folks of all flavors there and I just love it. \n\nI like the meat and seafood counter, and the one less star Lee Lee gets is for forcing me to buy a package of beef tenderloin instead of being able to pick up the one or two that I need for making pho tai. But the prices are great, so I make the pho and have steak the next day. \n\nThe produce section is great. Eggplants of all shapes and size! Lots of fresh herbs at great prices. All the cabbages you can stuff in your cart and haul home. \n\nI spend a little more time in this section for two reasons. First, sometimes the jalapenos are a little soft or herbs a little wilted so taking a few extra seconds to choose the best of the bunch. Plus, it seems like all the other patrons there touch every single item in every bin they shop from. I mean really, what's up with that? I can sit there patiently waiting for minutes while some lady picks up and puts down 487 bunches of sweet basil. Is that really necessary? And are these folks completely without spatial awareness and don't see me sitting there begging with my eyes for them to hurry so I can choose the best of three bunches and hit the road? Scoot your ass over lady and let me join the fun. But nooooo lest I get the prized collection of basil so good she'll only see that bunch once this lifetime, so I just wait my turn The produce section is agonizing for me. \n\nI like the organization of the store for the most part, as it makes it easy for me to find the related foods. My Swedish ethnicity makes these aisles not only fun, but educational. \n\nSpice aisle is your friend. Pick up some Star Anise in a bag big enough to last a lifetime for cheap. Take that McCormick spice jars! See if I ever buy anything from you again. \n\nI always spend a little time picking out some sweet treats in the candy section. Personal favorite Men's Pocky. Not sure why the dark chocolate is for men. Are the the milk chocolate ones for women? Why, because women can actually lactate? Anyway, questions I ask that will never find an answer don't stop me from trying lots of fun snacks from this section. The Hello Kitty shaped biscuits injected with something that had the texture of chocolate but was in fact strawberry flavored were probably filled with trans fats but tasty. Anyway, you don't care about all that. \n\nIf you are lucky enough to find fresh hot samosas at the hot food counter buy every single one of them. They're so great! Spicy, flaky goodness people. \n\nI agree with a previous reviewer that they clearly don't see the possible waste and damage plastic bags cause the environment, so be mindful of that. I put my stuff on the belt in order that I want them to bag it so they use less of them, but I really should remember to bring in my own bags next time. \n\nDon't be afraid of the smell. Just because it's not familiar, doesn't make it bad! It's exotic. Breathe deep and know that with that smell comes the best selection of items that used to be really hard to find at great prices. Oh and the beer is often really cheap. So look out for great prices on beer that's much more expensive in groceries and other specialty stores. \n\nYeah Beer!

To put the review in context, I've been to the best Korean grocery stores / Asian markets out there not only in Atlanta but also DC, Seattle areas as well. \nLOCATION: In a shopping center with Magic Noodle, Gelato shop, Bubble tea shop, Barber shop, etc. \nATMOSPHERE: Bustling on the weekends. People lined up to have their meats cut up. Clean enough. Ailes are categorized by region of the world. There's section for kitchen appliances and gifts as well.  This is not as big or as good of a selection as H-mart but it will do for Arizona. I can get my Asian fix. \nFOOD: Lots of different exotic foods like in the produce section persian cucumbers, lychee, bitter melon, green papaya, banana flower, taro root, purple yams, japanese yams. I haven't found the skinny eggplant (Chinese eggplant) anywhere else. They also have the miniature eggplant (Indian eggplant). \nRecent finds for me are sugar free aloe drink - yay! Finally an Asian diet drink. They have the Korean popcorn that I really like. Not too sweet.\nKimchee section is small with a few banchan (Korean side dishes you eat with rice), which included dried radish, dried anchovies, etc. They have radish kimchee, cabbage kimchee traditionally prepared and the white kimchee.  I just purchased some kimchee but haven't tasted it yet. \nFrom the frozen section, I've tried the mochi ice cream in taro flavor which just taste like sweet cream ice cream without much unique flavor. The date buns are pretty good though. \nPRICES: Fairly priced to dirt cheap. The fresh herbs are super cheap like the basil (what looks like to bunches is $1.50). The discount of 10% makes it even sweeter. Just ask for it at the register upon check out - that's it. \nPARKING: Shopping center parking lot with plenty of space. \nCONCLUSION: Although this is not as big as the other Asian market I've been to and I wish the selection was much better, Lee Lee's is pretty good and suffices.

To me, there are great similarities between Lee Lee's and the Ranch 99 chain stores found in California.  The main difference between these two stores is that they are located in different states.  For people living in Phoenix, Lee Lee's provides a variety of quality products that cannot be found anywhere else.  Lee Lee's is clean, well-stocked and organized, and all employees are helpful and attentive.  Perhaps the only negative drawback is that it can get very crowded on the weekends.\n\nWhile folks living on the west coast are spoiled with a great variety of specialty grocery stores and ethnic enclaves offering reminders of \"home\", people living in Phoenix are resigned to seek out the comforts of their background in whatever way they can.  Lee Lee's Oriental Supermarket conveniently provides products from a variety of countries such as Korea, Japan, Thailand, Holland, Brazil, Africa and Argentina.  Lee Lee's offers a wide variety of selections.  There is even an aisle dedicated to Goya products.  The store is easily accessible, as items are organized by country.  For example, if you are looking for Korean roasted seaweed, you can simply find the Korean aisle and you will most likely find it there.  All items are well-stocked, and maintained carefully.  You won't find dented cans or cluttered shelves, as everything is neatly organized and easily accessible.\n\nWhen I went there I was looking for a particular type of mayonnaise.  The kewpie mayonnaise was there; however, they only had the one-gallon size (they were in fact out of the 17.64 oz. container).  I certainly did not need such a large container of mayonnaise and I spoke with an employee there who ended up spending 15 minutes searching for the right product.  It turns out that Lee Lees did not have this particular item in stock; however, that the employee went to such great lengths to assist me was impressive and considerate of him.  \nPerhaps the only negative drawback of this store is that it tends to get very crowded on the weekends.  Most likely, this phenomenon is due to the fact that there are only two Lee Lee's locations in the Phoenix area and they are strategically located on opposite sides of the valley; families living in the middle must commute from the center of the city to the outside in order to stock up on supplies.  Most likely, these people are not able to make such a great trip after work and must wait until the weekend to go shopping.  It is extremely crowded on the weekends; in fact, navigating a cart around the produce aisle is an exercise in caution.\n\n All in all, I would recommend this grocery store to adventurous cooks who need ingredients that cannot be found in regular grocery stores.", "business_id": "5KG0A3WlC7K3DAXtrIFFjg", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-11-27", "type": "review"}

I went in looking for a specific item, a large pork belly to make homemade bacon,  I have bought them there several times before.  As I approached the counter I noticed the meat case was almost completely empty.  When I asked if they had any I was told no that they had to cut and wrap them and put them in the display cases now.  This causes a big problem:  You can't really inspect the meat for uniform thickness, freshness and fat to meat ratio.  I ended up buying two pieces out of the display case.  I have not opened them yet.  If I don't re-post something, then you can assume all is well.  Next, the fish counter.  What a mess.  First off, you could hardly see through the glass.  Second, the live tanks and several dead or dying fish in them and again the glass was so dirty it was hard to see what little fish they had.  The smell, I understand that it is somewhat of a fish market and a certain smell comes with that, but the stench is overwhelming.  I also noticed that the shelves seemed like they were not as full as they have been in the past.  We also noticed that in almost every aisle, in one spot or another, there was a rotten smell, like that of decaying food.

I really, really liked this place, but with Mekong's not really that far away and with that store being MUCH cleaner and smelling much better and Lee Lee's no longer carrying what I went there for, methinks I will stick with Mekong's.", "business_id": "5KG0A3WlC7K3DAXtrIFFjg", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-09-17", "type": "review"}

Meaning, if you know one store, then the next Target is going to be very similar. This Target is no exception.\n\nWhat is there to like? Well, I actually kind of like the lack of self-checkouts. for granted, they are kind of cool when in a rush but many we as humans sure are disconnected anymore. We can't even be bothered by waiting in line and talking to someone when they check us out? C'mon, people. This is a nice change of pace in comparison to other stores. I also like that for the most part, the carts aren't trashed. They are generally clean and don't have mounds of trash in them like other stores (not just talking about Walmart here). It is also across the street from the Chandler Fashion Mall. So if you want to kick your scantily clad teenage girl off at the mall and then skip over to target, then this is perfect. Also, it is located in a strip that isn't plagued with empty stores. to my knowledge, every shop in the strip-mall is occupied. This doesn't really matter *to* Target, but it makes the place look nicer. Plus, it gives you a lot more options to get all your daily tasks done as Costco is behind it, Bed Bath & Beyond is next door, as is a sporting good store and a office store.\n\nWhat is there to not like? They are probably a little more pricey and selective on certain things. However, I have found some tremendous deals here... you just have to look around sometimes. With that said, the quality is probably better than Walmart, so, you get what you pay for.\n\nOverall, it's good. hopefully this location doesn't get too much business stolen from it with the new target on Arizona and Ocotillo.", "business_id": "DcML-4f7oib19ed67Ruv6w", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-11-28", "type": "review"}

After many weeks of craving cupcakes, I finally relented and made a quick stop at AJ's to see if the boulangerie had cupcakes for sale.  I found a few cupcakes from Tammie Coe's and My Dad's Favorite (the clerk's fave out of the two) bakeries.  Out of the two, only MDF was available for purchase by the mini-cupcake ($1.50)-- TC's came in half-dozen or dozen batches.  (MDF also came in singular regular-sized cupcake packs for $4 each.)  I was jonesing for varied flavors, such as those I'd seen in Cupcake Wars, but all I had to choose from were chocolate minis w/ coconut-flaked frosting, or vanilla minis w/ multi-colored and glitter-dusted vanilla frostings (so uninspired), so I chose the coconut.  I should've let the mini cupcake sit out to warm up to temperature for awhile, bec. the frosting was so hard when I took a bite :(  The cake itself was OK, and I liked the bit of frosting that had coconut flakes in it, but all I could taste in the frosting was butter- yech!  Oh, but wait!  I didn't just try the cupcake here... oh no.  My attention was drawn to the salted caramel and BACON brownie when the woman ahead of me chose it for herself (along w/ a slice of key lime pie and a carrot cake).  May I sample the brownie, please?  Oh, yes?  Why, thank you!  I really shouldn't have asked for the sample, bec. I loved it so much, I bought a whole piece ($2.99).  Why do I torture myself like this?  I really don't enjoy working out on the treadmill!  No, that's not wholly true-- I don't like the first 15 mins.  But still!  I don't need to splurge on a brownie, much less one that is frosted w/ a chocolate ganache, salted caramel, AND crumbled bacon pieces!  \n\nNext time you're craving for something savory AND sweet, try the salted caramel and bacon brownie and thank me later.\n\np.s.

Anyway, the guy we asked for refills just stared at us blankly like he had no idea what we were talking about, almost like the refills didn't exist. I thought maybe he was newer too and didn't know about the free refills, but then he finally asked what drinks we got. I told him I got a frappucino which I know is t eligible for refills, but I always get the brewed tea refill. He just stared blankly again like I was an idiot before finally telling me since I didn't order brewed tea I couldn't have a refill. Anyway, I didn't want to argue with him and just left but I wanted to post a review, hoping he might see and read Starbucks' policy from their site regarding the free refills.

I forgot how much I loved this store. When shopping for a gift, you are a bound to find something for everyone at World Market. This store has so many cute and unique items that you can't find anywhere else (except for maybe online). Its the perfect place for the world traveler, home cook, wine enthusiast, and for many other hobbies. There are many other novelties that are available such as bath and body items, candles, specialty foods from around the world, candy, reading material, etc. A few of my favorite recent purchases:  Beer from around the world case (has 10 different beers each from other countries), a packing list tablet (checklist of items to pack when going on vacation), Moist towelette wipes that have pets dressed as certain celebrity's on the front (the Snoop Dog one is the best), Liquor filled chocolates, and mini hot sauces (you never know when you will need some hot sauce!). After shopping at World Market, I have so many ideas now for the holidays and for future gifts. Another great thing about shopping here is that the pricing is decent too. Nothing is overly expensive and all is within reason. Additionally, the cashiers are always super polite and friendly and the store is well organized and clean. Since Christmas is fast approaching, add World Market to your lists of places to shop if you are still questioning gifts for certain people.", "business_id": "809yQbiyWhniPQEeeqXuHA", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-11-27", "type": "review"}

Too many menu items! While variety is nice, the menu is overwhelming and the chef's have way too much room for error. My food has always been just okay here but it is clear to me why.

Tonight the chicken was terrible so over cooked it was like eating turkey jerky. Almost no sauce so we sent it back . Second time it was worse so we ordered something different. Came out great but the mashed potatoes ice cold not warm at all. This is a sign of a major problem in my opinion. Honestly I have eaten here at least two dozen times.

Sauce was great.  Pesto pasta was not overly aggressive with garlic.  It was just right.  \nKobe Burger with caramelized onions and mushrooms and sweet potato fries. Had this because there were no turkey burgers.  The Kobe Burger was OK but nothing to write home about.  Sweet potato fries were good.  \nThe bread was delicious but we had to ask about 3 times before we got our first service of bread although the place was not packed.  Tasty bread.  Other than that, the service was good as they kept our waters refreshed.  \nI will admit that I was shocked by how good their pasta dish was.

My most recent experience at the Chandler location hit rock bottom.  I was here with two friends and everything just seemed to go wrong.  No joke, at some point during the meal all three of us had to send our meals back to the kitchen (something that none of us had ever done before).  One friend received her meal about ten minutes before the rest of us (she didn't want to be the only person eating so her meal got cold).  When my other friend got her tacos, they included an ingredient that she specifically asked to be omitted for allergy reasons.  The highlight of the evening was what I found in my chicken Madeira .  What I thought was a burnt mushroom, upon closer inspection, turned out to be a piece of CARDBOARD!  Bizarre, right?!?  On a positive note, the food itself (when we finally got it ~14 minutes later) was tasty and the waitstaff was very apologetic.

I had the feta frittata, which looked like an egg omelette mixed with eggplant, zuchinni, bell peppers and roma tomatoes. The best part is, of course, the feta cheese... It came with a generous serving of buttered toast and papas fritas. For a drink, I ordered a chai tea, which is a tad overpriced at 3.95 for a small one. \n\nIf I talk to my parents about how good this place is, with any luck, I'll get a gift certificate for Christmas.", "business_id": "U9iWs_XQ88IEj_Cgawyz4w", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-09-13", "type": "review"}

Because up until about a month ago, I called Chicago home for the last 20 or so years.\n\nPizza has three main ingredients- a crust, a sauce (typically a tomato-based sauce), and cheese (typically mozzarella).  Serving two out of the three does not mean you can still call it a pizza.  This is pass/fail, all or nothing, an you are not graded on a curve; there is no 'E' for effort.\n\nNow some will argue, but typically, 'Chicago-style' pizza has a thick crust and, in at least a couple of restaurants, the sauce and cheese layers are inverted, but the pizza HAS sauce (am I making my point here, or am I being too subtle?).\n\nDo yourself a favor, BJ.  Go to Chicago, and go to Gino's East, Pizzeria Uno, Due's, and Lou Malnotti's for a crash course in what 'Chicago-Style' pizza is, then come back here and fix this trainwreck of bread and cheese before you do any permament damage to the phrase 'Chicago-Style Pizza'; well, no more than you've already done.\n\nYour one saving grace is the beer you brew right on premises, otherwise this two-star review would be a one-star review, and I'd never have a reason to darken your doorstep, or subject anyone else to your bread with melted cheese on top.\n\nKeep up the good work on the beer, but fire the guy that came up with your pizza recipe and start over.  Then I may try another one of your pies; until then, I'll just stick to the beer.\n\nViewing it from that angle, then, BJ's has a nice bar.  Its a bit loud inside for a restaurant, but for a bar, its just fine, and they do have lots of TVs tuned to just about anything you could want to watch.\n\nCome for the beer, stay for the... beer.

I read the reviews before I went so I had an idea of some of the areas where I might have problems.  I am happy to say that my experience was a good  one.  It was a Sunday evening so that might have helped since it was not very crowded.  The weather was nice so our group of 5 sat on the  patio.  The service we received was very good.  He was attentive and funny.  Also was helpful deciding what to order from the enormous menu.  I had their Pumpkin Ale.  It was decent.  I liked it better than Blue Moon's Pumpkin Ale since I could actually taste hints of spices.  I will definitely try other varieties of their own brews when I return.  Two of the other girls in my group went for the root beer.  I tasted it and it was good but I'm not enough of an expert to say it was any different than A&W in a can.  The other two had mixed drinks and found them to be a bit pricey - $9 for a frozen mixed drink?  The table started with chips and salsa.  Nothing special there at all.  I would pass on that in the future.  I ended up having the steak salad and it was very good.  I liked the touch of the roasted potatoes.   All in all a good visit but the food is on the high side so I can't see myself going there often.  If they had a reverse happy hour like Gordon Biersch I could see myself going more, but due to the price I will save trips here for special treats or during their happy hour in the day.", "business_id": "IMGW6y8wHQCfr_6k-YXg_A", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-10-23", "type": "review"}

It was my first time visiting this location, or any other one for that matter.  The one thing I was impressed by is that with the amount of people that were there, it wasn't as noisy as I thought it going to be.  Yes, you did have to raise your voice a bit, but it wasn't to the level of shouting, which is a definite plus.  Perhaps it's the high ceilings.  Anyway, my fiance and I opted for the appetizer (mozzarella sticks - you really can't go wrong with those) - they were good, but it's the marinara sauce they give you that make them even better!  My fiance ordered the bison burger, which I had a bite of and thought it was delicious.  My dish, the parmesan crusted chicken, was also quite tasty.  I love the sauce they put on it with the sun-dried tomatoes.  \n\nThe reason I'm giving this location five stars is simple:   the service.  Our server, Joanna, was amazing.  She was very attentive, but not overly annoying.  After everyone got their food, my dish still hadn't arrived.  She went back to check on it, and apparently, my dish went to another table by mistake, so she had the kitchen rush my dish out and even had the meal compensated without hesitation (I didn't even ask for it).

The first trip, my wife and I just went in for coffee - and unfortunately we had already eaten dinner and dessert.  I had a cappuccino which did not disappoint, and required no augmentation - and my wife got her usual decaf americano with splenda and milk.  The desserts we saw looked fantastic - and apparently we were there for one of Joe's friend's birthday and they had these fantastic looking cupcakes (how did I know?!)\n\nSecond trip was with my brother, mom, and step-dad for dinner.  I ordered the farmer sandwich (veggies + goat cheese) which was delicious, and a perfect size.  Not too large, not too small.  Bro ordered the sloppy joe extra spicy - it was good, but not knock your socks off.  Mom and step-dad ordered pizza (1/2 cheese, 1/2 pep), I tried a small piece, it had a great sauce, fresh cheese, and a crisp + chewy crust.  They also split a mixed greens salad which looked fantastic.\n\nWe ordered dessert which was a granola bar (awesome), brownie (great reports, but alas, no walnuts for this nut), and I got a slice of pumpkin-apple bread to go (eventually tried this at home and was yummy).\n\nThe decor is really nifty - there is an open kitchen that runs almost the entire indoor portion of the restaurant.  There is a wood-fired pizza oven and it looks like a prep-kitchen in the back.  The drinking glasses are actually glass, and all of the tables are nice dark wood with very comfortable chairs.\n\nI over-heard Joe talking to another table about not advertising just yet to make sure that all of the kinks are worked out.  He also mentioned later when I was ordering coffee that the cupcakes were a special event dessert and might not be a regular item.\n\nThe entire staff is incredibley friendly and made the experience that much better.  It's too bad that Gail W. had such a bad experience - and also too bad that there is no real detail in the review.\n\nGive it a try - you won't be disappointed.", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-11-17", "type": "review"}

My wife and I tried Liberty Market last December as a dinner and a show deal paired with the theatre next door.  The rain was pouring and as we dashed in the warmth of exposed rafters and good ambience reassured us we had made the right choice. That was where the fun ended.  For such a fancy looking place, the stand in line ordering was a little bit of a letdown.  We ordered a margherita pizza, unaware that the pizzas are barely a snack for a single person.  The pizza was good, though a little scorched, but the wood fired oven gave it a very nice artisinal touch.  We filled our drink cups at the oversized soda fountain and sat at a table that afforded a picture window view of Downtown Gilbert, and the feeling was cozy until the hardwood bench began to cramp my backside.  The food didn't take long to arrive, and the wait staff was friendly and helpful, if a little unnecessary. Apparently their only function is to serve the food and refill drinks, from the self serve fountain.  The real mystery came after our meal when we made our way past a very clean, completely empty kitchen.  It seemed extraneous, but must see more use during breakfast hours.  Then, arriving at the unisex washroom with highly decorated closet toilets providing little barrier between myself, my wife, and a fairly loud and smelly gentleman next to me, I was forced to flee screaming into the night.

They should read it, and then disavow it if need be.\n\nSo we've been to LM a bunch of times.  I famously said that I'd eat myself to death on their red velvet cake (more on that later) but had marginally less success with the rest of the menu.\n\nWell all that changed two visits ago.  My wife ordered the italia salad, which is sort of like an antipasto salad with garbanzo beans, kalamata olives (the lone blight on the salad, but I can appreciate that that's only my opinion), and italian meats with lettuce and tomatoes and all.  Totally delicious.  And I ordered the italian sausage pizza which is actually amazing.  Totally delicious.  It comes with ricotta cheese and onions, the ricotta being delightfully creamy and the pizza, on the whole, being perfect in every way.  Thinish crust (but not too thin) and just really flavorful.\n\nWe got all that last night, too, and it was amazing again, but the trip was marred by...\n\nthe worst customer ever to live.  If you see a mushroom-shaped woman probably in her mid 40s, wearing a visor on her mushroom shaped head, and a t-shirt with \"talk to the (paw print)\" emblazoned on the front, look out.  You'll recognize her by her disconsolate husband/significant other, who carries around with him the ethos of a beaten pet.\n\nWOMAN: I'll have the (five thousand different desserts to go) and the pecan bar.  But NOT the pecan bar that was cooked on the side of the pan.  I HATE that.\nHAPLESS EMPLOYEE: Okay... what about that pecan bar right there.\nWOMAN: NO! Not that one.  Look. You can tell that that one was cooked on the side of the pan.  No, I want that one (the one predictably buried under thirty others).  That *should* be all right.  It looks okay.\nHAPLESS EMPLOYEE: Uh.  Okay.  Sure.\nWOMAN: (orders fifty more things)\nHAPLESS EMPLOYEE: (rings up woman. she pays.)\nWOMAN: And MAKE SURE that I don't get the pecan bar because (points credit card menacingly at HAPLESS EMPLOYEE) I am *very particular* about this.  If it doesn't look right, I will send it right back.\nHAPLESS EMPLOYEE: Okay (reassuringly).  We will.  Thank you.\n\nSo I roll up behind her and give her a withering look as she turns away and commiserate with the homeboy at the bar.  Then we order, etc.\n\nA couple of pointers.  One) if my wife thinks you're an asshole, you are.  She's got a pretty long fuse for this sort of thing.  And yes, that's how come we're married.  Two) if you're fat, why would you act so... fat?  It just reinforces the fact that you're a great big fat person and what the hell?\n\nFat person code: (I am an authority)\n1. Don't act like if you don't get the exact pecan bar you want, that your life is OVER.  It may be true, but for fucks sake.\n2. Don't order a disgustingly fatty triple-super-size quadruple burger with extra mayo and then a large diet coke.  You get laughed at when you do this.\n3.  I would say DO diet and exercise but I'm fat and I think those two things are profoundly boring.\n\nAnyway, I know this has dragged on but I talk so that I can hear myself talk, and the same generally applies to my writing.  BUT: If you are from LM, I HOPE YOU READ THIS BECAUSE...\n\nOur red (please see updated below) velvet cake last night was (sorry about the parentheticals but the yelp-bots are to blame.) terrible**.  TERRIBLE!  We got it to go and whoever served it to us either grossly misunderstood the quality of what they were serving, or they should be fired.  I have (albeit indirect) experience with Joe (the owner/conceptual mastermind) and I am certain that if he knew that this five day old, dried up piece of cake were being given to customers, he would be upset. \n\nThere were even two people in line ahead of me trying to decide between the carrot and red velvet and I told them they should get red velvet, hands down.  YOU MADE A LIAR OUT OF ME, LIBERTY MARKET!  And for this, I won't forgive you unless I get a free slice of (do I even need to specify \"fresh\") red velvet cake.\n\nHaving said all of that, every restaurant has it's moments, bad or good, and I forgive that and on the strength of the usual red velvet perfection and the deliciousness of everything else, I give LM five stars.\n\n__________________\n\n**Red Velvet Update: I have been in twice since and this most recent time, Kiersten (one of the owners) gave me a new piece of red velvet cake.  And a pecan bar, from the middle of the pan no less!  But I want to make this clear, just in case it isn't: I love liberty market--it's exceptional.  And I really want everyone to know that I've had the RV cake many times before *and since* and it has, every time, been amazing.  I still hold that it is the best piece of cake I've ever had.  So it clearly was an aberration this time.  And the carrot cake is almost as good.  Really.  The bread pudding is totally sublime.  If you get a dessert there, you won't be disappointed.

The work that has been put into this space has payed off, and the pride the owners take in their business is evident.\n\nI've been here four times, once for lunch and the other times for dinner. They have a good menu that has expanded from my early visits. You order and pay at the counter. The pros of counter service far outweighed the cons every time I've visited. Joining a group of friends is as simple as saying hi, placing your order at the counter, and sitting down. This style of service really shines when I attend with #evfn. Very few restaurants handle our group of 40+ with so little hassle. This makes for a great place to hang out and meet up with people.\n\nWhen I had lunch here I had soup and a half size farmer's salad, the combo was on special. The minestrone hit the spot, and the salad was full of crisp, fresh vegetables. The salad and sandwich selection is good enough that I'd eat lunch here a few times a week if I lived or worked closer. For dinner the burger is my recommendation of the things I've tried. It was juicy and came with a good selection of condiments. I haven't had the opportunity to sample much of the new dinner menu. The grilled chicken pasta is pretty good, and I'm looking forward to trying the steak or the apricot glazed chicken on my next visit. I also hope to try their breakfast soon, I hear good things.\n\nMy only complaint is that the brewed tea by the soda fountain usually tastes old to me.

The bathroom is unisex sinks with separate doors for each stall.  Each room has it's own theme and music.  I love the creativity in something so often overlooked by most restaurants.  \n\nI've been here twice and had a great experience both times.  The first time I got the Italia Salad.  It was very large with lots of meat and cheese.  It was very tasty.  I followed that up by an ice cream sandwich which was at least 4x too big for me.  The cookie was fresh and warm with the ice cream wedged in between.  I say that baby is fit for 2 large adults or 3-4 people that know their limit.\n\nThe 2nd time I got the Italia sandwich.  It was fantastic.  The potato salad I chose as a side was good too.  Too often places overcook the hell out of the potatoes and it turns into mush.  Theirs still had some texture which was nice.  It was a very satisfying meal.  We chased our dish with their signature espresso which is a micro latte (two baby lattes). \n\nI love the uniqueness of the original brick wall, and the exposed wooden trusses that make up the roof.  Even the seemingly simple light bulbs are unique with a hoop-earring looking filament within them.  They have a brick oven for pizzas and a huge display for those tempting deserts.  In addition to the espresso bar they also have a nice selection of beer and wine.  This is a great lunch spot in an area of town not known for independent and unique dining options.  \n\nWorth the drive from Tempe.

When they take your order, if you don't order a drink they give you a complimentary water glass. Not a plastic cup like most other restaurants. This is a legit glass that they use for fountain drinks. They bring your food to your table and come back regularly to check on how you are doing. Then on the off chance that you get to meet Joe while you are in there, he is the definition of working patron. He checks up on everyone, customers and staff alike, and is always willing to answer questions.

I remember growing up in Gilbert and always passing by this building in the historic part of town; back then it was actually a market.\n\nThe first thing I noticed is the interesting variety of options on the menu.  They have Mr. Pibb-marinated steak, burgers, pizza, sicilian pizza, salads, and even a chef's special paella with mussels, shrimp, scallops, chorrizo, a variety of dessert options, and more.  It was difficult to decide, to say the least.\n\nI opted to have the white pizza and bread pudding.  The pizza was one of the most delicious I've had.  It was an amazing pizza.  So good that I'll have a difficult time trying something else next time I go there.\n\nThe bread pudding was bland.  The whipped cream was good, but the bread pudding itself was pretty flavorless.\n\nThe biggest gripe I have with this place is that it's a cafeteria style setup, but the prices are more in line with a sit down restaurant.  The service is pretty good, though.\n\nIt'll still be difficult to eat here with Joe's Real BBQ across the street, but I'll probably add it to my rotation.", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-10-09", "type": "review"}

It was a Sunday and I think there was a show at the Hale Theatre because the place was packed. We stood in line for quite a while. \n\nI ordered the demi-breakfast - eggs, biscuit and bacon and the boyfriend ordered the breakfast quesadilla with chorizo. We also ordered a slice of chocolate chip banana bread and a slice of red velvet cake to go because that's just how we roll.\n\nI thought the banana bread was pretty good, boyfriend thought it was too dry. My demi-breakfast was okay but my biscuit was too powdery, like they didn't mix the dough well enough. There was actually a clump of flour in part of it. Considering how amazing the biscuits are at the Farmhouse next door I was disappointed. Boyfriend was not impressed with the quesadilla either.\n\nLater that afternoon we decided to try out the red velvet cake. Like the breakfast, it was just okay. Nothing I would crave or make the trip across town for.\n\nOverall, I like Joe's other places (Joe's BBQ and Farm Grill) much better.

It looks as if it is family owned and some of them work here, which gives it a small town feel, yet it seems to be a pretty popular place in old Downtown Gilbert. We've been here a few times for Sunday b-fast. The styling of the place is true old-meets-new theme, which is pretty cool. \n\nEverything on there menu that we've had seems to be made of quality ingredients and cooked to perfection. The service is generally pretty good, we've had less-than-perfect service a couple times, but it's usually pretty good. They source there sausage products from Shriner's locally, which is great sausage. Their biscuit's and gravy are seriously some of the best you will ever have, the Turkey sausage is excellent and if you didn't know it was turkey, you would still think it is excellent sausage. The cheesy-potatoes (can't remember what they call them!) are usually amazing but we have noticed some times they are better than others.\n\nMy wife enjoys there espresso drinks, but they don't offer anything besides whole milk, and early on a Sunday we try to keep it light. Their brewed coffee is good as well. The only limitation they may have is the menu, there is not much other than basic breakfast combos and omelets, which are all great, but it would be nice to see sandwiches and other options. They do have an assortment of baked goods, which look amazing. They only offer scrambled egg's, which I like, but my wife likes her egg's over easy and she doesn't get that option.\n\nOverall, for a great breakfast experience, Liberty Market is one of the best, EVER!

Things I've had that I recommend: Pesto Burger, White Pizza, Sweet Potato dish, Blueberry Scone, Lattes, Wines and more.  I like that you stand in line to order, get a seat, and then you're brought your food.. makes it a casual, but upscale casual experience.  Every time I go I want to try something new because I look forward to being impressed again.  Location is great - easy parking; Atmosphere is also nice - lively, active, social, upscale feel yet still family-accomodating.  I always look forward to returning here.", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-10-11", "type": "review"}

Showered and refreshed by the in-room Starbucks Africa Kitamu and readied for another long day of eating, sightseeing, eating, hockey, and eating I made my way to the car and set my GPS for the town of Gilbert; destination Liberty Market, home of what many (including the local paper) have noted to be the best Bread Pudding around.\n\nA functioning grocery since 1935 and located in a building under a water tower every bit showing its age I approached Liberty Market slowly due to the local farmer's market - a market containing much of what has now been out of season in Ohio for at least a month - and with parking readily available I made my way into Liberty Market via the side door.  Passing the al fresco dining area, the kitchen, and subsequently the store and pastry counter to take my place in a line six deep I grabbed a paper menu on the way in to browse though in all reality it was not really necessary; I knew what I was there for and the pastry case had already tempted me with any number of appetizers.  \n\nStanding in line while others made their decisions, some a full meal and some merely pastries to go, when I eventually reached the coffee bar I was greeted by a young man with spacers and sleeves to fit his blas\u00e9 demeanor and placing my order the price was recited and a number was handed to me with any number of seats to choose from both inside and out.  Opting this time for the indoors and filling a glass with water and ice I took a seat with a full view of the room and placing my number on the table was left to wait for perhaps 10 minutes while reading a local guidebook detailing Liberty's history as well as  the other restaurants in Joe Johnston's stable.\n\nSipping my water while watching a small boy barely make a dent in his enormous pile of eggs my first course of the meal at Liberty would arrive hot from the pastry case in the form of the largest Cinnamon Roll I've eaten to date - a squared off yeasty pastry nearly filling the 12\" by 12\"plate and inundating what I can only imagine to be a 6 foot diameter with the smells of butter, cinnamon, and sugar.  Large yet impressively light with wispy dough sandwiching layers of cinnamon and butter and the entirely lacquered in a thin sugar shell the Cinnamon Roll wowed in flavor as much as it did in size and without being the belly buster of Cinnabon was a perfect size to share as an appetizer - or, if you're feeling truly ravenous (gluttonous) to enjoy on your own.\n\nWith the cinnamon roll easily dispatched of and now wishing I'd have gotten coffee but not wanting to withstand the 10+ deep line my second dish would arrive approximately fifteen minutes on the heels of the cinnamon roll and given all its hype I truly expected the Griddled Bread Pudding to be mind blowing, but alas it was merely very good.  Served with real maple syrup and approximately half the size and twice the weight of the cinnamon roll the bread pudding was in reality nearly flawless French Toast - a caramelized exterior and a moist custard interior, but what he had in texture it unfortunately lacked in taste.  Largely eggy but also with slight notes of cinnamon and vanilla that perked up with the syrup perhaps part of my disillusionment with the pudding was actually how sweet its predecessor had been but overall it just felt like something was missing - perhaps some fruit, whipped cream, or caramelized nuts to add a bit of texture and nuance (this is apparently how they serve the dessert, non-griddled, bread pudding.)\n\nOverall a very nice spot and a place I'd definitely return to for the baked goods as well as to try the pancakes, plus perhaps the griddled bread pudding with a side of fruit as a starter and one of those incredible looking Sticky Buns or scones as dessert.", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-10-12", "type": "review"}

It's in our rotation of restaurants so I'm not a stranger, but usually like more ethnic foods.\n\nLast night I had the pizza special of Wild Mushroom Pizza. It had no tomato sauce and no mozzarella cheese(a first for me). It was light, another first for pizza, with a thin coating of Parmesan cream sauce.  The crust was crisp and thin, and the mushrooms were tasty, if a little meager. I'm sure that the truffle oil added a certain something, and although I didn't sniff it out, my daughter did. \n\nShe had the Chicken Pasta with the same Parmesan cream sauce that was on my pizza. It was handy for me to dip the end pieces of crust into the sauce. I thought it was a bit salty. Her Caesar Salad came without any dressing, but with chicken, which she hadn't ordered. My husband had the Sausage Pizza, which tasted like sausage pizza. He liked it. I had Stella Artois Cidre which was very good. Neither bitter nor too sweet. \n\nFor dessert I bought a Lemon Bar, and I thought I would share it three ways. It was that big. I really wanted a Cream Cheese Brownie, but, alas, there weren't any. The lemon bar was good, but not the best. The crust was too thick in proportion to the lemon curd.\n\nWe were able to sit outside, the temperature was perfect and it was quieter than inside the restaurant.

Ask to get something like fruit or whatever instead of the potatoes but you can't do that either.  We walk by with our dogs and the girls that work at Liberty tell us to bring our dogs on the patio, while I'm standing out front and waiting for a coffee to go.

A guy in a red shirt and black hair comes out and tells us that this might not be our table and that we should basically stand in the middle of the sidewalk and wait, 5 people and 2 dogs.  Really, nobody is even out here.  If 5 tables worth of people show and your packed inside then we'll move.

We originally planned on going to The Farmhouse next door but the wait was out the door so we walked in to Liberty Market where the line was long but at least it was inside.  We were very happy with our experience. We were both super hungry  after waiting in line next to all of the fresh baked goods.  The sticky buns, cinnamon rolls, and sweet potato muffins were very inviting but we decided to wait and see what the situation was after we ate breakfast. \n\nI got the chilaquiles with chorizo. I was somewhat skeptical when ordering as I have been to places that basically put enchilada sauce on regular tortilla chips. These were the real deal!  The chorizo had that extra little kick of heat I look for in Mexican food. The cotijo cheese was a nice touch but my favorite part was the sunny side up eggs bringing it all together.\n\nMy wife had the biscuits and gravy with an egg over the top. Of course I had a few bites and enjoyed it. The biscuits were hearty and the sausage in the gravy was plentiful. It had a great flavor and we enjoyed it but would have liked the temperature to be a bit hotter. This was the only downside of our whole experience and the only thing that kept us from a 5.\n\nUnfortunately we didn't have enough room for any of the goodies we saw while waiting in line, not even to go since we planned a couple of other grub sessions in the day.\n\nGO HERE!", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-10-25", "type": "review"}

We waited in line for about 15-20 minutes.\nI had ordered their burger of the week which was a Philly cheese steak burger with the garlic smashed potatoes, and my husband ordered the 6 alarm burger with fries.\nThe Cheese Steak Burger was very yummy, although it lacked the cheese steak flavor I was looking for. The potatoes were to die for!!!! I love some garlic mashed potatoes, but these were probably one of the best I've ever had.\nMy husband love hot food. He is the guy you see adding hot sauce to everything!!! Well he said that this was almost too hot for him! He took his first few bites and his eyes went wide with delight, then after letting the heat settle in, he realized how hot it truly was. His fries were not that good. He had said he would rather have fast food fries. I tried them and I was disappointed as well. They were cold and didn't have much flavor to them.\nBy the time we left we were both super full. We usually share a meal, but wanted to try  the things we wanted for our first time there. \nThe one thing I will say is that we had to run to the bathroom when we got home.... Im not sure why, but the food didn't settle well. But boy did it taste good!!\n\nA day later, I'm regretting every delicious bite.

It does things its own way, and it does them well.\n\nSome key takeaways\n\n1. Everything tastes good. Literally every single thing on the menu that I've tried has been amazing.\n\n2. The burger, pizza and fish of the week change (you guessed it) every week. So there's always something new and exciting on the menu.\n\n3. Buy an eclair. I don't even like pastries, and I die for Liberty's eclairs. Buy one for dessert and one to take home. \n\n4. When in doubt, go Italia salad or any pizza. They're just magnificent.\n\n5. Buy the wine. Liberty is really good about having affordable and tasty wines. \n\n6. Expect to pay about $25 per person if you want food and a beverage. It's totally reasonable for the quality you get.

This time though, when we walked in the front entrance, we were greeted and really liked the the vibe so we figured we would wait. It took only about half an hour to put in our order which was less than expected looking at the line. The best part was that even though we had to order prior to sitting, we were given a number with a designated table so we didn't need to worry about others holding tables, etc.\n\nWe ordered the Crab Cake Po Boy with a side of roasted sweet potato salad ($1 extra for the side as their sandwiches normally come with chips) & the Pancakes with blueberries ($1 extra for the blueberries). Everything came out quickly & it looked great!\n\nThe blueberry pancakes were really fluffy & delicious with an ample helping of blueberries in each pancake. I think it's a bit of hit or miss when it comes to pancakes but these were so spot on! The Crab Cake Po Boy was also delicious; the crab cakes themselves were really light and seasoned well. I also really liked the chipotle aioli that was served with it. The portion size of this sandwich was really large, way too big for one person to finish. The accompanying sweet potato salad was also so so good! The reason why we got it is because when we were walking through the line, we passed by a case that had all the cold sides ... tricky tricky!\n\nThe other items in the pastry case also looked really good. Now that we know how quickly they get through the line & how delicious the food is, we'll most likely be frequent visitors!!", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-10-26", "type": "review"}

Not sure why I am just discovering this place but we will be going regularly from now on.\n\nWe went around 8AM on a Sunday and there were only a few people in line in front of us. The restaurant was pretty busy but we secured a table for two with the help of the hostess easily and quickly.\n\nI had the best biscuits and gravy of my life (added two eggs on top for $3) and my dining partner had a huge breakfast burrito (he couldn't finish it, it was so big). He chose the chorizo for his meat, it was pretty spicy so be warned. Both meals were delicious. The $3 a la carte pancake we ordered was just okay, but I am assuming when you get the full size pancake meal it is bigger and better.\n\nIt got really busy the later it got, so earlier is better if you don't want to wait too long. It also seems as if you can make reservations for larger parties, and sit at the coffee bar if there's just one or two of you (not sure how to secure a seat there and if you can order from the barista or still have to wait in the ordering line).\n\nAND their baked goods looked amazing.

The teens did the slide, the swings and the bee ride and enjoyed them all.  We rode the pedal bike course, our husbands pedaled us through and it was hilarious.  I really wanted to try the new jumping pillows, they looked like huge bouncers but flush with the ground, but we ran out of time :(\n\nThe \"Spooky Train\" was a hit, with scary monsters and clowns.

I really hope Intel has another event here soon, we had a wonderful time!!! Thanks Schnepf's!", "business_id": "1V8f3A7p3HV2r0BgAbqvaw", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-11-08", "type": "review"}

Inside was a congestion of people among lines of vendor booths and no one to point you to ANY of the food advertised on tv! Settled for expensive burgers/dogs with hot soda cans and chips.  In the store there were lines everywhere and no one helping except behind the counter to get your pastry and money.  Expensive everything and none of the fun shown in an empty farm on tv news!  Wish they would go to show the mess it is with 100's of people trying to have a good time!  We will go North/ South for better run and more fun festivals! Bring stroller/wagon for the long hike back to the car if you have kids. We helped carry bags for a guest so she could carry her hot, tired and crying girl back to the car!  Best part was meeting them!", "business_id": "1V8f3A7p3HV2r0BgAbqvaw", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-10-03", "type": "review"}

WAY WAY WAY over priced. $62 yes sixty two dollars for myself and 3 small children to get in! The staff at the front did face painting clearly stating they took tips.. Uh- I'm going to pay you to paint a tiny pumpkin on my child's face that took you all of 10 seconds? Wow- I'm clearly in the wrong line of work- the guy even had the nerve to tell me there were places I could get money and he'd be here all day! No thank you!!!! Oh- admission also did NOT include train ride, or picking pumpkins and food started at $8 and sno cones were $5? A lot of it was run down- dirty and very out of date- signs broken, not well kept . for $62 we rode a roller coaster, swings, an airplane toddler ride, a trampoline and got lost in the corn maze. There were absolutely no signs in the maze to help families with small children- we made our own path finally and ended up on a dirt road. I left with no pumpkins and very disappointed children. While my review will not stop anyone from going to Schnepf  I will not return or support it as a small business, neither will I recommend it as a must see place ...

Farm itself is quite isolated; it's located in Queen Creek and a drive for most Phoenicians.\n\nLet me just break down strengths and areas of opportunity, okay?\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n\n*Some friendly staff who genuinely try to interact in a country-ish way to get visitors in the \"country bumpkin mood\".\n\n*Lots to do - pillow jump, corn maze, petting zoo, rides, pumpkin patch picking, shows, etc.\n\n*Clean (with so many ppl and animals, I was nervous for poop everywhere and trash, but was pleasantly surprised...)\n\nAREAS OF OPPORTUNITY:\n\n*More training for the customer service AND product knowledge of food preparers/servers at the grilled chicken spot. I ordered one grilled chicken breast and 2 lil punk kids (looked like they were 17 or so) were bumbling around back there not knowing what to do w/the raw breast. Kids: if you don't know, go run and get an adult to help you out, k? Had to wait like 15 min for this. Not happy. Then, was totally ignored once chicken was grilled. POOR! Asked for a Diet Coke from a young girl. Got same zombie-like, non-blinking stare like I was asking for something in Greek. At this point, my patience had run out and I snipped, \"I just want a can of Diet Coke\".\n\nAlso asked another food server where I could go to buy a salad. NOTE: I had emailed Mrs. Schnepf herself prior to coming on Saturday, and she reassured me via email that salads were available. Person looked at me like I had 3 heads until another server came in and rescued her. Told me salads were only offered during season, and this was considered \"off season\". Oh well... :(\n\n*PLEASE invest in better signage within farm and parking. My friend followed a tractor to this grassy area w/flags thinking that this was where we needed to park. It wasn't. We were on the \"working farm\". Oops.\n\n\nAll in all, a pretty decent day -  great way to help get in the \"autumn mood\". :)", "business_id": "1V8f3A7p3HV2r0BgAbqvaw", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-10-11", "type": "review"}

The website makes it look so fun and festive, but that is absolutely not what you get. I come from Utah and have been to many pumpkin festivals. I was shocked at the cost of admission($39 for a family of four, one of which was free because he's under 2 bought in advance with a discount) but we justified it thinking that everything is included so we would just be paying for food. We also do like to support local businesses. I, however, do not like being ripped off. It was hot, dusty, and boring. The rides had tremendously long waits and were boring. My 1.5 year old was bored on the kid rides...that says something. They are also slightly terrifying because they look like they are about to fall apart. The petting zoo was crowded and the only animals you can pet are the goats. I felt bad for them because there were just way too many people. There are absolutely no signs on the pathways so we had to turn around at dead ends constantly. The pumpkins were few and were just sitting on the ground. You do not get to go out in the field and pick your own. The prices are incredibly steep, considering that we paid $39 to get in. $20 for a large pumpkin that would cost $5 at the grocery store. I expect to pay more at an event like that but not after paying such a hefty admission. The bathrooms were down right disgusting, and I am not one of those weird bathroom people. My idea of a pumpkin festival is a lot of fall festivity, getting to go out in the field and picking out your own pumpkin (with wagons) and paying by the pound, and maybe having a bowl of chili and hot apple cider for a reasonable price. I'll repeat: I like supporting local businesses. However, this place is a business and is not a charity. If anyone gave it 5 stars they are seriously missing out and need to go elsewhere to see what  a decent pumpkin festival is all about.", "business_id": "1V8f3A7p3HV2r0BgAbqvaw", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-10-14", "type": "review"}
