He was really, really hyper and I had to give him the raw sugar from the bar to make my drink. A friend got a caramel macchiato freeze (I think) and it was tasty- though more like a caramel milkshake than coffee, the thing was WHITE. We were in and out in less than 5 minutes with only one person working. Impressive but not in the best way. I was going to use my card but it had to be a charge of 3.99 to use it so I payed cash. I left with a weird feeling like \"what just happened\". It was a whirlwind experience.

A few firsts, sat at the coffee bar and was served table side--very nice.  Had the salmon special with a potato cake and mustard sauce which was awesome, love their specials.  However it was the post meal coffee that was life changing.  I am quite the coffee snob and am rather picky about where and how I have coffee.  Last night I wanted a little something sweet (the chocolate truffle cookie) and a small shot of espresso.  I was first going to ask for the Cubano but the Barista suggested the Cortadito.  WOW!  That little cup of goodness had escaped my radar but now I can't stop thinking about it.  So rich and lightly sweet with a nice foam. I know that it has dairy in it, steamed half and half I believe so nothing but the best of dairy, but for me it is just a small amount so I am willing to suffer the consequences and take an extra sinus pill.", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-07-18", "type": "review"}

Only having lived in the Gilbert area for about 9 years, I have been able to see much of the old town grow into a more upscale, urban vibe to it that sort of meshes well with the dusty, tumbleweed blowing across the street scene that it is.  Confusing and sort of awesome all in one, the little old street in Gilbert has become a place of choice not only for me, but throngs of east valley residents as well.  There are too many good places to eat in this area and this is a good problem.  \nThe review:\nLiberty has been a place I have been ordering take-out from for over two years now and my actual dine-in experience has been minimal. Parking is reasonable though can at times be difficult with Postino's, Joe's, and Oregano's all smashed together.  Phone-in orders are always courteous, almost always fully accurate with special order types, and the wait has never been prolonged.  The restaurant is clean and just fun to look at.  \nFood is delicious.  I have not sampled the entire menu but it is varied and well thought out.  Pricey?  Maybe.  I have learned that more imaginative and fresh food equals a more premium price and for the most part, I accept this.  \nAs a creature of habit, I can speak on the salmon blt with authority; never fishy, good char on the bun, bacon is always delicious, tomatoes are thick and red.  Sandwiches are clever with designer cheese and excellent breads.  Homemade kettle-styled chips = yum!  \nBreakfast is also varied and delicious.  \nCoffee bar:  This is my favorite region of  Liberty.  I have shed the Starbucks addiction and moved to more local coffee houses that can replicate a good cappuccino.  Liberty can do this to my satisfaction.  The baristas are knowledgeable and friendly.  They will remember your order and chat with you if not too busy.  Adult coffee drinks?  Sign me up.  \nI love this place.  I want to move in to this place.  I dislike people.  Herein lies the problem.  The times I can visit are always peak when there are throngs of \nobnoxious humans and the acoustics are terrible.  Navigating the Yukon models of strollers to a table is an exercise in patience and contortion; space between tables is at a premium.  \nIs this a place to quietly work on your laptop with a cup of coffee? Depends on the time.  Is this a place to get an excellent coffee drink?  Yes.  Food is delicious and the atmosphere is engaging.  \nPros:  Food and coffee drinks; decor and yes, bathrooms have character.\nCons:  (Peak hours) Parking, too much humanity in one establishment, acoustics.  \n  \nThe Joe's chain has another winner.", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-08-05", "type": "review"}
