I was in town on business with a couple co-workers and after having a not so great meal the night before, we asked one of the locals for a recomendation.  They told us to try this little Italian place called Papa J's and boy did they send us to a great place.\n\nFirst off, when you walk up to the place, the front and side windows give you a fantastic open view into the kitchen from the outside.  You can stand outside and watch the chef making all the wonderful food and you can smell the fresh bread before you even walk in the door.\n\nI am not sure how long this place has been around but the kitchen looked well used, while the dining area as well as the bar looked very clean and modern, almost as if it had been freshly updated.  \n\nThe server was quick to welcome us and suggested several different items off the menu as his favorites when asked.  The three of us were very hungry and wanting to try a few different things, so we began with a Margherita pizza which was absolutely perfect.  They obviously make their own breads and dough for the pizza and I don't think this pizza could have tasted any better.  Then came bowls of Italian wedding soup which was pretty good.  Of everything there, this was the one item I probably could have done without.  Not that it was bad, but there was nothing particularly special about it.  \n\nWe also ordered the Garlic Rolls (not that the bread they already give you and the pizza was not enough carbs for 1 meal) and they were to die for.  Crunchy on the outside and warm and chewy inside, these things were a meal by themselves.  One of the guys with me said the pizza sauce would be good on them so he ordered a cup of the pizza sauce (which is fresh made there, not out of some can) and he was right.  As if these little killer bread balls with garlic were not good enough, dipped in the pizza sauce they were even that much better.  \n\nBy the time our meals came, we were all pretty full, but we pushed on and continued to eat.  I had the Veal Parmigiano which was tender and very good.  It came with a side of pasta which I tasted just to try and it was excelent as well.  Had I not been eating a weeks worth of carbs in one sitting with all the pre-meal stuff, I certainly would have finished it.  As it was, I ate most but not all of the generous portion of veal.  \n\nOne of my co-workers had the Chicken Picatta which he said was one of the best he had ever had and the other guy tried a pasta dish which he said was very good as well.  \n\nThey had a great wine selection as well at reasonable prices by the glass or bottle.\n\nOverall a fantastic experience with great food and atmosphere.  I don't really know how expensive the area is for food, but coming from the Chicagoland area, I fouknd this place to be pretty reasonable.  The three of us ate very very well for an average of aproximately $30 each not including alcahol.  Fantastic fresh food at a reasonable price, who could ask for more.\n\nMy only complaint is that I had to return to Chicago and I am now craving to return to Papa J's.  I hope work sends me out here again sometime soon!!!", "business_id": "P1fJb2WQ1mXoiudj8UE44w", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-02-21", "type": "review"}

But my recent experience there has changed my mind a bit. \n\nFrom the minute we were seated, we were greeted by a server that was clearly inexperienced and didn't know the menu. As I said before, I've been to PaPa J's a good handful of times so I know the menu decently well, but the server couldn't explain any of the questions I had about a couple new dishes I was thinking about trying. I swear this guy must have just looked at the menu for the first time a few minutes ago.\n\nBut it wasn't just the knowledge of the menu. It was one thing after another with our server. My wife asked for a glass of water 4 times until she finally got it (at which point the meal was over, so we didn't care at that point).  I mean come on, for a restaurant of this calibre and price is it too much to ask for a glass of water? There was no one filling up water.\n\nMy biggest complaint, however, is what happened with our meals. My dad and I both ordered the trout special (trout with roasted red peppers and lump crabmeat). Instead, the meal that was delivered to both of us was trout with a heaping pile of spinach and mushrooms. Not what the special was at all.  And by the way, that item is on the menu as a regular item so whether or not the mistake was made by the server (which, we are sure it was) or the chef, who knows for certain. Not to mention, though, that a good server wouldn't have served us that regardless. \n\nBut before you think we had an unusal experience that was all due to a poor server, let me continue. When we informed our server of the mistake, he didn't really believe us until he checked his order sheet, and then he blamed the error on the chef. At this point, the meal had been sitting (because it took us forever to flag this guy down again) so the trout was basically cold. The server then said he would have the meals re-made. So, he took the meals back to the kitchen. Meanwhile, of course, my wife and mom are eating their meals and my dad and I are sitting there with no meals. Also keep in mind that my wife still had not gotten the water she had been asking for, and my iced tea had been refilled with a soda (yes, believe that or not). All the kitchen did was scrape their \"mistake\" off of our fish! They didn't remake anything. Our fish was served to us again with little pieces of spinach and mushrooms sticking all over it. Quite frankly, the fish wasn't good at all. I honestly would have rather had a fish sandwich from McDonald's that night. The server never did anything to try to make our experience better - he knew we weren't happy, but never offered anything such as dessert on the house. I'm not looking for a handout, but our experience was just plain awful that night. The guy never really even apologized for the mistake. Normally, I may have asked for a manager, but at this point I was ready to just get out of there (plus, we had to be somewhere else that night).\n\nMy opinion... for the money, there are many other restaurants I would rather eat at.", "business_id": "P1fJb2WQ1mXoiudj8UE44w", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-01-02", "type": "review"}

After arguing with me he ended up taking $6 off of our $200+ bill. Ridiculous. If it were up to me I would have never returned. Unfortunately my family decided to go here again tonight. Again it took a long time to get our food. My food was cold and bland, my kids food was cold. My husbands salmon was burnt to a crisp and my sister in law took one bite of her trout and refused to eat any more because she claims it was so disgusting. The wedding soup and bread were good, but that's it! My drink sat empty throughout my meal and never got refilled even when I asked. Bad food, slow service and rude managers.

First, the restaurant itself is on a convenient corner st in downtown Carnegie's main street. When you walk in you the first thing you see is a counter filled with desserts and amazing looking house made breads. It rather looks like a deli counter. You have to walk around to get to the hostess station and then can go left to the bar or right to the dining area. A bit confusing layout, but tastefully done. The dining area is brighter than the rest of the restaurant. It felt much more upscale once in the dining area, but I did find the overall restaurant tastefully unique. \n\nThe food - A wide range of Italian dishes and seafood. We ordered the crab hozel as an appetizer. It was an average serving of lump crab meat, I had to ask for cocktail sauce. It was tasty, but cost us $18. We then ordered the veal and shrimp entree with sauteed veggies like artichokes, eggplant, peppers, etc. There were 4 smaller sized cutlets of veal and 3 shrimp. $28. There was no salad or pasta side offered. The dish was prepared properly and was OK. We just felt it needed something else. \n\nNow the bread that was offered to our table came in a small basket and was filled with a variety of their house made breads. The pepperoni bread was AMAZING! I mean really delish. This alone I would have given 5 stars. \n\nThe service - Our server was...well....I'm not sure what he was quite frankly. Annoying?Confused? Hyper?  He appeared to have no idea what he was doing half the time. Bouncing around the table, asking the same questions over and over, forgetful, spastic, etc. At one point one of my colleagues said, \"Is he on crack?\" We chuckled, but seriously! He forgot to even ask us if we wanted dessert, which was too bad because we saw some amazing looking offerings in the cases as we were leaving.\n\nOverall - If I were in the area again I would definitely stop in to get some pepperoni bread to go, as they do sell it by the loaves. However, I think I would try somewhere else to dine.", "business_id": "P1fJb2WQ1mXoiudj8UE44w", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-02-07", "type": "review"}

I hadn't been in Pino's since they renovated, but I have to say that they made the interior beautiful.  We made reservations, but I don't think we would have needed them since there was just a few other parties seated when we came in.  \n\nMy two girlfriends and I always have a tough time deciding what to order...so naturally we order one of everything that looks good.  We started with the Charcuterie platter, which was a mix of absolutely delicious prosciutto, capicola, and soppressata with a bit of veggies and mozzarella.  This was an impressive way to start out the meal.  We all wanted to try the seasonal ravioli, which was pumpkin (too tempting for three certified pumpkin fanatics), so we got an order to share as an appetizer.  This was unlike other pumpkin ravioli I've had...very pumpkiny.  The ravioli was good, although we all agreed that we wouldn't have been able to eat a whole order.  It was very sweetly spiced and I was missing a little bit of savory with the dish.  \n\nI ordered the grilled sausage pizza for my entree, and was pleased with it.  I admittedly never get too excited about pizza, and this was good, but nothing that I was dreaming about later that night.  Overall, the food was a 3-4 for me.  \n\nThe service was outstanding.  Our waiter was very welcoming and knowledgable.  My friends got dessert, and when the chef (I assume Chef Pino?) came over to ask how it was, my friend jokingly said that it was delicious, but would be perfect with a bit of sauce.  Before she could take another bite, he whisked both of the desserts away and added fresh strawberries and sauce, saying that he would be serving the dish that way for now on.  Talk about service!  The whole experience was fantastic, service gets a 5.  \n\nAdded bonus:  Awesome beer selection, some brews I haven't seen.

In all honesty, we haven't been back for a year though we kept saying \" we have to get to Pinos!\" Needless to say, we were disappointed.  The place has changed and not for the better.  It seems in an effort to create a quaint wine bar, Pinos lost sight of the original draw and that was the food.  The menu has been scaled back considerably.  Though the food was adequate, it's not the same.  I came here because the food was amazing and with that no longer being the case, I doubt we will return.  Hopefully, things will change back to how they were.  Customer advice for what it's worth.  Refocus on great italian food not a wine bar concept.

I had the Del Sol pasta and it was very flavorful, though a little salty. The chicken was very moist and the sauce was very good. My husband had the cacciatore special and said the chicken was very good but they sauce could have been a bit more flavorful.

Imagine a cafeteria pasta dinner you might have been served as a child away at summer camp, and you'll have a pretty good idea. In other words, the food is perfectly edible here, but boring, and nothing you would want to actually pay for. There was nothing disgusting about it, it was just extremely uninspiring. To be fair, I only tried the pasta, bread, salad, soup, and calamari, so maybe they have amazing pizza here...

I had a dinner party there in the summer and have another one planned in March and Jonathan totally goes the extra effort to make it special.  He arranged for a dj last time, so we were able to dance off some of his food.  Okay, the food is great.  I especially recommend the Veal Chop.  The staff is awesome. I really like Marney and Errol (two main servers) and I like Jordan the bartender upstairs (Marney's daughter).  I'd like to give this place 5 stars, but it has a few smaller problems.  It's a little bit pricey.  The good is that the cost does include salad, pasta, and bread, but the bad is that you'll easily spend $50 on an entree.  The Veal Chop is $65.  That's a little much, especially considering the location.  The dishes also which are delicious are simply toooooo big.

There I chatted with the chef as he prepared my app. Explaining as he went on, first slicing fresh chantrel, portobellos, and button mushrooms. Next he saut\u00e9 them in olive oil, added brown sugar, brandy, raisins, and finished it with heavy cream. They were fantastic. There were a variety of specials including wild boar chops, a risotto with prawns, scallops, and black truffles. But I chose the dry aged filet with lump crab in a leek cream. It was the best piece of filet I've ever had. It was easily a pound of beef and a half pound of crab in a light cream sauce with leeks. I could barely touch it after the pasta, salad, bread, and appetizers. I brought my leftovers home and have them another time. Dessert consisted of a nice portion of carrot cake with an apricot cream cheese icing with apricot jam filling. It was a nice take on an old favorite.

I finally ate here this past Saturday and it was awesome.  Now I can't wait to come back!\n\nFirst, I urge you to make a reservation because every single table was filled while we were there, and for good reason--the food is AWESOME.  The food is so good you aren't even going to feel guilty about the calories you have consumed--because you will eat A LOT OF THEM.\n\nThe second thing you need to know is to show up HUNGRY.  Don't eat all day.  If possible, do what I did and work out earlier in the day, because you will leave this restaurant WELL FED.  To quote one of the great artists of our time, Ice Cube, \"Life ain't a track meet, its a marathon!\"\n\nIt is a marathon.  They're going to bring you out delicious warm bread as soon as you sit down, and supply you with heavenly toppings for it, including the famous Holy Oil that is truly divine.  Temperance is a virtue.  Don't be like me and commit a sin against your entree by eating it when you are STUFFED, and can't fully enjoy it. because like a fool you couldn't restrain yourself with the bread bc carbs turn you into AN ANIMAL and you didn't pace yourself.\n\nYou'll get all the bread you can handle.  Our waiter John, who was super nice and attentive, suggested we order the meatball appetizer and he was right.  Its huge, its literally the size of a softball and comes out wrapped in cheese, in a heavenly marinara sauce, served with love.  It was extremely good.  \n\nThen you get the salad course, which comes in a home made vinagrette which is also delicious.  \n\nThen comes the pasta course,  We had fusilli pasta in vodka sauce which was very good but at this point I was basically full and tapping out.  I ended up eating not even 1/4 of my pasta, but then the waiter offered to bag it up for me, so I had lunch for the next day.\n\nYour entree comes out after the pasta course, and you're going to be already stuffed at this point.\n\n Now, I took my friend here for his birthday.  I think they key is to come here when you are not paying, bc my bank account was crying when I saw the entrees start at $40.  More on that in a moment.\n\nI ordered the filet and it was SPECTACULAR.  I mean, amazing.  So good I did not share, and after I ate it, I fondly reflected on the time my filet and I spent together.  Temporarily in my mouth, forever in my heart.  Or on my hips.  It was not diet food, it was covered in some sort of heavenly cream cheese sauce that is the stuff dreams are made of.  It was a $60 dinner and it tasted like one too.  \n\nMy friend ordered the blackened sea bass and it came out looking like a work of art.  Both our dishes were basically food porn.  He loved his dinner too and said that his fish came out topped with large chunks of crab and he loved it.\n\nWe were waayyy too full to even think about dessert.  I'm sure the desserts would have been divine but we just could not do it.  In fact I ended up taking half my filet home with me.\n\nThis place is technically expensive, but if you think about it, it's really not that bad.  Our bill came to $200 for the two of us, but for what you get, it's really a pretty damn good deal.  You get top notch service, the restaurant itself is beautiful, and the food is absolutely incredible.  This was probably the best meal I have had in Pittsburgh.  Oh--and you get enough food that you get a full meal the next day.\n\n I cannot believe that I had not been here before, and I will absolutely be back.", "business_id": "qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-12-29", "type": "review"}

We have found that to find quality Italian worthy of spending $$ outside of our own home has been difficult to find in the Burg. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of Italian restaurants out there, but none we would seek out for a special occasion, so to speak. We have always found the New York/New Jersey establishments more to our liking....until now.\n\nAlla Famiglia is nestled in a not so nice of a neighborhood in the Burg called Allentown. Although we were never worried, but I could see how some may feel it is out of place in it's location. There is valet parking, so need to worry about your car while dining. Now once you are inside, you will soon forget where you are.\n\nThe inside is very small and there are 3 floors where you may be seated for your meal. On this occassion, we were seated on the third floor. Way up, climbing 3 flights of stairs can work up an appetite. Once on the 3rd level however, you can enjoy some of the religious artwork and beautiful stainglass featured throughout the dining area. There were 5 tables of various sizes and the bonus was the private restroom located nearby, so you did not have to manage the steps again until you were finished with your meal. \n\nI would also like to mention that we were dining early and although the room was rather private at first, it became QUITE loud as the evening went on and other patrons were being seated. I also think the free flowing wine helped the noise levels as the night progressed. Needless to say, we had difficulty hearing one another towards the end of the meal.\n\nThere were 5 in our party and our server was very attentive throughout the night to make sure any requests or special customizations were welcomed and met. We started our meal with the complimentary bread, dipping oils, goat cheese spread and cheese medley brought to the table. We all agreed to share the famous 12 oz stuffed meatball which was enjoyed by everyone at the table. In fact, everyone was asking for more of the wonderful sauce to accompany thier bread.\n\nSeveral items are served family style and come with any of the entrees that are ordered. We were then delivered and very tasty salad tossed with a light vinegarette which included olives, nuts and cranberries. Gorgonzola was brought on the side if desired. Then the pasta with vodka sauce made it's arrival. Several mentioned that they would have just ordered this if they knew how delicious it was. And this was just the beginning....\n\nOn came the entrees, several veal dishes were ordered, as it is their signature item on the menu. Although there were also many specials offered that night, everyone seemed to gear towards the classics. I ordered the veal marsala, which was delish! It was certainly one of the best I have had. One member of our dining party ordered the special pork chop offered that was huge! Another entree ordered was the filet mignon topped with lump crab meat and gorgonzola cream sauce. It literally melted in your mouth! I decided this would definitely be ordered on my next visit. All the food was cooked perfectly to order and scrumptious!\n\nWe were all pretty full but decided to share the Burnt almond tiramisu stuffed with raspberry for dessert. It was divine! I swear I heard the angels in the nearby painting sing as we devoured it!\n\nAs others had mentioned, it is a bit pricey, but for special occassions it is a must do. I felt it was quite worth every penny of our bill which was $306 for the party of 5. (We did BYOB) We have dined at much more expensive establishments and left unimpressed, which was not the case at all here.\n\nThe only negative was the long walk down the steps through the many other diners after too much wine. It can be challenging! So, watch your step! But do make a visit, you won't be disappointed!", "business_id": "qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-01-11", "type": "review"}

I now live in Philly otherwise I would probably end up here every other week (which would hit hard on the wallet since its delicious but pricey).\n\nIt's a small place with a very romantic/intimate vibe and an authentic feel. The portions were generous and extremely tasted even better re-heated the next day (a rare thing). \n\nThe one thing I would advise is do not gorge on the bread! This will be very difficult to do as it is delicious, along with the oil it is served with but you will regret it because there will be a lot of food coming afterwards.

While we were up there, we met the owner, and he made some recommendations to us. You have to get a meatball appetizer to split with the table.  Four of us split one and it was plenty. They had littleneck clams on special and they were done absolutely perfectly.  Our husbands got Veal Parmesan and loved it. We also had beans and greens appetizer it was delicious.

It was love at first bite. I went there frequently and tried to recruit as many allies as I could. The insanely crunchy crust, the zippy tomato sauce, the CHEESE! The first slice of the day with completely cold, unmelted cheese was always just as good as the last one which would have melted the cheese slightly and gotten the tiniest bit less crunchy. It doesn't matter because the ingredients themselves are just tasty. But tragedy struck and Cranberry failed hard again at supporting good pizza and the store closed. I did some research online and discovered that, yes, DiCarlo's did still exist, but only in faraway lands that I would likely never travel to for pizza or any other reason.\n\nBut one day, I noticed something exhilarating. Is that a DiCarlo's location IN PITTSBURGH?! HOW LONG HAS THIS BEEN HERE? I felt confused, excited, bashful, sleepy, doc, but most of all relieved. That is until I decided I would need to confirm their existence with a quick phone call. See above.\n\nThat very night, I traveled to the south hills (a rare treat...) to rekindle my love affair. I gotta say, friends, this was one of the best first bites I have ever had. Exactly as I remember it. Four slices of pepperoni pizza and an Orange Crush. This is living.

I finally got to try Legends North Shore after having the place booked mark for a few months now and so can cross this place off my list.

Our waitresses were sweet and did not kick us out after we remained at our table to finish wine 30 minutes after closing. \n\nLegends North Shore provides bread to munch on. Crunchy airy pieces that don't fill you up entirely before the entree which I so often do and they provide a bottle with seasoned olive oil (which was kind of oily on the outside). I tried the Tuesday 99 cent green and beans special along with a salad and spaghetti and meatballs. I wasn't sure what the green and beans were but they were cheesy and salty but very watery. I thought they were tasty but confused if what I ate were indeed what greens and beans were suppose to be. The salad was fresh but nothing special, and I felt the same for the spaghetti and meatballs (made in house from the meatball to the pasta). I feel that when you go to an Italian restaurant you can judge how well they cook based on classic dishes. I couldn't stop eating the spaghetti and meatballs though I felt full half way through. I thought the meal was overall good though not anything spectacular and pricey for what it was - ~$18 ($17 for spaghetti and meatballs and $.99 for the greens and beans plus some tax). Maybe if they knocked a few bucks off to $13 or $14 or so it would be more reasonable imho. Also points are deducted for the corkage fee of $4 per person, not per bottle.

I had made 7 PM reservations for us and we arrived shortly before that to a table that was ready for us.  The inside of the restaurant is actually much tinier than I had expected with as many people crammed in as possible.  It probably was helped that the night we were there, there was a party of 10+ next to us.  They would also order just before us understandably leading to some slower service times for us which I would guess is not the norm.  Other than it being crowded there was not much else in the dining room to look, just some table and chairs as well as some pictures on the walls.\n\nFor dinner my girlfriend and I decided to start of the evening with the polenta to share.  It came out cut into pieces and served with some sweet sausage and a pesto drizzle.  I thought that the sweet sausage was the best part of it with the polenta being ok while my girlfriend really enjoyed the polenta.  For our dinner entrees I ordered the Penne Vodka which came with a tomato basil cream sauce and prosciutto while my girlfriend went with the Penne Parma that had some artichoke hearts, roasted red peppers, olives and sweet sausage in a garlic wine sauce.  Both pastas also came with salads before the meal and both my girlfriend and I ordered the house balsamic dressing.  The salads came topped with many different things and I thought that they were pretty good salads for being included in the meal.  The Penne Vodka that I ordered ended up being really good!  It was delivered when still at a fairly hot temperature and I really enjoyed the sauce.  It's only peculiar item was that the prosciutto was almost off to the side and not in the pasta which I found to be odd but I still enjoyed it.  Even though I really enjoyed my pasta, I actually thought that my girlfriends meal tasted better.  The garlic wine sauce on hers was awesome and made each bite of her entr\u00e9e that I had a treat.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here again.  I was very happy with all of the food that we had and also loved that the prices were good for the quality of food that they were serving.", "business_id": "q_BKmbdlYfQJroJVHfYMUQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-02-21", "type": "review"}

She simmered her sauces until every seed melted away. My mother's sauce was a bit more thicker, using puree and paste as a base, later adding whole peeled tomatoes, garlic and fresh basil. Her sauce cooks down to a velvety pasta sauce that should be jarred and sold on super market shelves.\n\nSorry on to my review of Olive Garden. seriously? Really? No! I will admit it's good in a fit of really, REALLY needing a pasta fix, or if you want to eat breadstick and salad. But the sauces are overly rich, and I don't mean the tomato sauces. I mean the sauces they put over the pasta with chicken, beef or fish. And, let me be real Italian here, pasta is NEVER the main meal in an Italian supper, Pasta is normally the first course and NEVER served with meat, including MEATBALLS. Thats as American as fortune cookies. after pasta, comes the protein, that includes meatballs, then finally salad.\n\nOkay, I'm done being a snooty Italian who looks down upon Olive Garden, I got out all my frustrations on you, my readers.

We decided to stop for lunch here.  Normally when my husband and I think \"Italian\",  we think of a fine trattoria or an old-school place like Minutello's (we're childless).

About what you'd get at one of Olive Garden's better locations.   I opted for the penne pasta with Italian sausage and peppers and onions.  I forget what my husband had, but mine was good, although I wish their lunch menu was available on Saturdays (I would have prefferred a sandwich and soup).  \n\nBut they have a good kid's menu here, so that's why we stopped.  Kids can get a pasta or pizza meal for $3.99.  They really seemed to like it and their portions were just right.\n\nThey also have a fairly extensive beer and wine list here.  I'm a non-drinker but my husband Rick enjoyed a good Italian beer, Peroni, on tap.  \n\nThing about pasta places like this is that since I'm a type-1 diabetic, the insulin I have to take to cover a meal like this.

As I alway say it doesn't take a rocket scientist to boil noodles and open a jar of pasta sauce and grate some cheese. For years this place has been touted as a diamon in the ruff in an area of the strip that has since built up greatly over the last 20 years. I had gone in the past but most recently decided to visit again because of their 'no coupon lunch special' advertised in the Sunday paper and also in the Red Plum coupon section. It was around $5 for Spaghetti Marinara a salad and what they call fresh baked bread. Let me say the spaghetti came out in a bowl with alot of tomato chunks and what looked like some raw oregano shaken on top. The noodles (from a box, definately not fresh pasta) were room temperature along with a quite a bit of water that settled to the bottom of the bowl from the sauce seperating. I would honestly rather have had Ragu Robusto from a jar instead of this particular sauce. It tasted like stomach acid, was sour and had not texture to it. The oregano flavor was overbearing and quite off putting. The salad was as described in the review below mine, watery iceberg with brown edges and some dressing spooned on top. We ended up eating alot of bread since nothing else was appetizing. The first one came out warm and the second one was cold and a bit hard. I am going to take a wild guess and say that the bread loaves are made off site and come in a plastic bag inside a giant box such as brown and serve rolls. You can tell they are placed in some type of convection oven to be heated slightly before they serve it to you. It's pretty much a crap shoot if you get a warm one or not. With the special price, tax & tip and depending on if you buy a beverage or not you end up paying about $7 to $9 per person anyway. Not sure if this is your idea of a cheap lunch but at home I can make this meal from about $2 per person and it is always way better. Do yourself a favor and go out and buy some fresh pasta at one of the stores in the Strip, touch up one of your favorite jar sauces with a little Italian sausage, buy a bag of butter lettuce and some salad dressing from Aldi and a fresh loaf of Mancinis bread at your local supermarket and have a feast, save your money by not frequenting places like this.", "business_id": "9mwShpTgZofOujt4JfyGmw", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-01-09", "type": "review"}

I didn't care much for.the garlicky butter that came with the sourdough, but the bread was hot and fresh.\n\nA balloon artist came around and made a flamingo that had to be 4 feet tall for the bf's sister and a little penguin for the SIL.

He even added sugar trying to improve it. The second he gave back and the waitress didn't even apologize or take it off the bill.

We should have known better when we sat in the bar area to wait (me, my spouse, and my eight-year-old son) after the rather apathetic front-desk person took our name.  A couple tables taken, but no sign of staff in the bar.  Every table was dirty, covered with plates, glasses, and the remains of others.  We took one that had just a couple of glasses and an impressive amount of Parmesan cheese scattered about.  Took 10 minutes for any sign of a bartender, who promptly spent five minutes getting caught up on drink orders before wandering over.  No smile, no welcome, just \"what do you want, and are you waiting for a table\".  And certainly no \"let me clean this table for you\".  We had a beer and a wine and a root beer for the little one.  The pinot grigio was vile, but, hey, thanks for charging us for the more expensive version: lord knows how disgusting the cheaper version would have been.   Finally, after 20 minutes we were seated.  Not a table in the bar area had been cleaned in that period.\n\nAnd the restaurant is empty!  Maybe 20% full!  They made us wait simply because they can't staff correctly.  Acres of empty tables.  So we sit, look at the menu, check out the surrounding (few) tables and made the only good decision we made this night:  we left and found another place in the area.  A place that actually worked to seat us and made us feel welcome.\n\nThe most amazing thing:  between the greeter, the bartender, and the seater, there was not a single smile.  Not a single sign that they actually are happy that we chose their establishment.  And not a sign that that they gave a damn whether we ever wanted to come back.  No wonder it is 80% empty but still makes people wait.\n\nThe other reviews compare this to Olive Garden and the like.  As my review makes clear, I can't compare the food.  And I am certainly not a fan of the Olive Garden.  But the few times I have gone into one, I was made to feel welcome.

The evening we visited we had not made a reservation so we expected to have a little wait. There were some people waiting in the lobby, and what appeared to be a birthday party happening in the dining room. \nWhen we walked up to the host's counter, we noticed the tables at the bar were empty. There were three hostesses behind the counter talking with who we assumed to be the manager. When the manager walked away, one hostess picked up a ringing phone while the other two stood there staring anywhere but us. When the hostess finally got off the phone, she did not greet us in any way, we had to ask if there was a wait and for how long. When we were told there was a 45 min wait, we had to ask if the bar was available (she did not offer this option). The hostess said \"yes\" and handed us menus and pointed up the stairs toward the bar- she did not show us where to go. \nAfter sitting down, we then waited another 10min to put in our drink order. The woman waiting on us seemed to be the only one working in the bar area on this busy night. We wanted to be easy on the girl because she was apparently alone behind the bar, but she was very rude. After waiting 10min to put in our drink order, it then took another 10min to get our drinks. It took about 40 min for our food to come out. The chicken tasted like frozen out-of-a-bag grilled chicken and the \"wild mushroom cream sauce\" was condensed cream of mushroom soup (My boyfriends pesto was swimming in olive oil). I would like to say this was an unusually bad night, however when I saw several waiters and waitresses gabbing and paying little attention to customers, it's hard to believe it was a one time thing. At one point a waiter stopped and stood watching the football game that was on the tv for about 8-10min. The only think I liked were the women's restrooms- they were nice and clean. Needless to say, we will not be giving warehouse another chance. \n\nSummary: Awful service, terrible food, nice bathrooms.

At my last visit they were so severely understaffed that I waited about 20 - 30 minutes to be seated, even though I remember seeing open tables during my wait. This isn't to say that the staff didn't do the best they could during that night - in fact the poor girl who handled my table was very clearly doing her best to rush from table to table without dropping anything. And a manager even came out to apologize and bring me drinks because our poor waitress was handling so many tables. So they definitely earned some goodwill back with that.\n\nIt helps that the food hasn't let me down yet - it always comes out cooked well and seasoned well, and I always enjoy every bite. Sure, it's probably not what Italian die-hards are looking for, but it is a chain restaurant and it does a very good job once you consider that. I will continue to stop in for delicious glasses of sangria and huge portions of pasta and other \"Italian\" comfort foods - but only on days I'm not in a rush; and hopefully the trend of slower service and not calling in enough people to work won't last forever.", "business_id": "9mwShpTgZofOujt4JfyGmw", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-12-25", "type": "review"}

The fat troll of a manager kept walking past our table multiple times before he finally apologized for our \"delayed greeting\". We waited for re fills longer than we should have and so did another couple that sat across from us. I'll probably still come back due to the sentimental value that this place holds in my heart, but they most definitely need to go back to their old ways or I can foresee this place running itself into the ground.", "business_id": "9mwShpTgZofOujt4JfyGmw", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-12-16", "type": "review"}

We received the check before being asked if we even wanted dessert or coffee, for that matter.\n\nSo - service aside, the food is just mediocre and of no relevance to the Italian inspiration it proclaims.  Our stuffed banana pepper appetizer was too hard to cut with a fork but we had no knives.  The prime rib was fatty and cold.  The crab cakes were far more cake than crab, you had to eat around it leaving a pile of filler mush.

I hadn't been there for a million years and am not too thrilled with the downtown restaurant scene so I agreed. It all started when we were seated by the lack luster hostess. You could tell she either just didn't want to be at work yesterday or really hated her job. She had zero personality. Then we look at the menu. How much do you think they charge for simple bow tie pasta and meat sauce? You're probably thinking $10 or $12, right? WRONG! $20!! I was not happy about the ridiculous pricing, but my friend and I felt we were already sitting down and felt funny about leaving so we unfortunately stayed. Now I really wish we would have. I figured if I am going to spend $20 on simple pasta I'll spend $10 more and have a steak with it. I'm on an extremely strict diet of only 1200 calories a day so I could not have the bow ties with alfredo. All I asked for was for them to replace the alfredo with simple marinara. You would think I asked them to get Giada DeLaurentis to come and cook my pasta. The waitress gave me such an attitude and then punished us the rest of the time by ignoring us. After all that I get my meal, the steak is very good (even though it clearly was not well done, some of the pieces were practically still mooing) and the pasta was tasteless. I would have been furious if I paid $20 for tasteless pasta. Never again will I go there. That place is the worst and I recommend you guys don't waste your time or more importantly your money either. The staff needs an attitude adjustment, the prices need to be more reasonable given the global economic collapse and they need to work on creating more flavorful dishes.  The only reason I gave it a 2 is because the steak was good. Otherwise, it would have been a .5 or 1.", "business_id": "l2gPB9mqiHSbpwSUa7zrjg", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-12-13", "type": "review"}

The normal Friday night ritual erupted last night and that is finding a restaurant interesting enough for me and flexible enough for the lady's particular tastes.  She was going to be nice enough to go to \"Dish\" although I know it's not one of her favs'.  Mantini's also came across the radar screen.  However, I wanted to try somewhere new and we both wanted to try something budget friendly.  Annie's Mom gave us an \"entertainment\" book for Christmas and Papa J's was listed as an option.  I checked out the website and was less than enthusiastic.  Unlike its sister restaurant in Carnegie this spot has a stripped down menu.  I'm guessing because it does most of its business during lunch hours and maybe happy hour.  I called the restaurant and they did have many options not on the internet menu including a couple feature dishes (note to restaurant please update your website, you don't even list any pasta dishes as an option for the downtown location).  We decided to check it out after calling her brother Lee who goes often.  We get there around 730 PM last night (Friday).  Upon entering the extremely old (classic) building I'm struck by the interior which is truly \"old school\".  It's dark wood, exposed brick, ornate lighting and the like...  There are a group of regulars I'd guess sitting at the bar imbibing loudly.  The bartender notices us and asks if we need a table for two.  We are then greeted by a friendly gal (JJ) who takes us to the back dining room which is a bit crowded and she senses our hesitation and takes us to the other side of the bar which only has a few patrons.  Annie confirms with JJ that we can use the entertainment card, she confirms and we save 12 bucks.  She brings us over some decent bread, unfortunately not served warm.  The bread is served along with the obligatory oil and vinegar mix.  She left a big bowl of parmesan cheese for us to add as much as we wanted which was a nice touch.  Annie started with the wedding soup which was okay, but not memorable.  I tried the potato soup, which was pretty tasty although a little bland.  Annie then ordered the chicken Romano which was really good.  The chicken wasn't too \"eggy\" and the coating was almost light which is hard to accomplish with this dish.  In addition the portion size was pretty large and the chicken was cooked perfectly and not dry at all.  They also accommodated her request to have thin spaghetti for the pasta and serve with Alfredo Sauce, which they did for a dollar more.  The whole dish I think was $15.  I ordered the salmon with green beans.  It was a reasonable portion of fish cooked well.  The green beans were crisp and fresh.  The salmon was served on a chipotle pesto.  I found the pesto a bit overpowering and could have skipped it altogether, but if it did need to be served on pesto I would have preferred a traditional style pesto.  Service was spot on from start to finish.  I think JJ's family owns the restaurant.  We inquired about the rumors of the place being haunted and the former incarnations of this place being a brothel.  JJ took us down to the basement and showed us the underground tunnels that used to be used for the local politicians to make their way to the brothel unnoticed.  She also took us upstairs and showed us the Madame's bedroom (incidentally the headboard of the Madame's bed is now the bar downstairs (I took a picture and posted).  The whole meal with a couple of martinis was only $45 after the entertainment card discount not including tip.  And, we both had leftovers.  We stopped at the bar for a nightcap after dinner and the bartender said they are redesigning the menu and trying hard to make this more of a dinner spot than just happy hour.  There was also a band setting up as we left.  It seems like they are trying hard and I intend to be back.  However, be warned if you're looking for a hip happening spot a la \"tamari\" this probably isn't it.  But, if you're looking for decent (3 star) food, great value and service you could do a lot worse.

We had a large group before a theater show and I was excited to try a new place.  It's conveniently located for all downtown events.  They also have happy hour which is always nice.

I got the one with 2 months, go figure.\n\nI'm on a budget right now and pretty healthy, so I planned ahead to get a caesar salad.  I decided at the time to add \"shrimp\" (quoted on the menu as $2.50) and get a side of vegetables.  Now, the waiter said a lot of the dishes came with vegetables.  So I can order a side of them, right?  WRONG.  After I ordered, the waiter came back twice.  Once to tell me that they couldn't do the veggies.  Uh, what?  The second time to ask me how many shrimp I wanted.  hmm.  And he never refilled my water or asked if I wanted a drink.\n\nSo our food comes out and my salad is LEAVES and DRESSING.  Period.  The End.  Oh, with 3 pitiful shrimp on top.  That's it.  There was the powder parmesan on the table which I added myself.  So now I have 3 half broken, unseasoned, boiled shrimp with tails, lettuce and dressing.  Actually, everyone's food looked rather 'sad'.  Oh, but wait until I got my bill!!!\n\nMy lettuce, 3 pitiful shrimp, and self added powder parmesan was $18!!!!  The shrimp were $2.50 A PIECE.  For real real.  I wanted to throw down.  I could have had the salmon platter plus pasta for that.  What a rip off and so much for my budget.  \n\nWe had a big group but  my bill didn't have the tip added.  I was not happy with our idiot novice server so my tip would have been small.  Well, he brought me the credit card receipt and wrote in a tip himself.  Get me out of here!  Oh and because we were a 'group' they wouldn't accept one woman's coupon.  Weird.\n\nThe place is cool.  It's an old brothel and it's fun to look around.  But the upstairs is about 40 degrees colder than the downstairs.  The place is dated, but I liked it.  Intimate and creeky.  But jeez, go just for happy hour or a drink.

The heavy snow on the awning outside this restaurant gave it a festive look and I couldn't wait to enter!  The decor here is open and warehouse like with high ceilings-very appropriate to the Strip District area-but with the blown glass chandeliers dripping from the ceiling, the fireplace and warm colors, Lidia's is modern yet as warm and welcoming as any Italian household I've had the pleasure to visit and eat in.\n\nThe menu had a lot of traditional Italian fare and I was pleasantly surprised to see they had cabbage rolls too!  Everyone recommends the trio of pasta sampler, but I elected to go with their Monday night Tuscan prix fixe because the side offered was roasted butternut squash and who doesn't love THAT on a cold night looking outside at the blankets of white snow?!\n\nThe bread comes with a plate of some olive oil topped by a scoop of garbanzo bean and pesto and another small scoop of white beans blended with kalamata olives.  Divine!\n\nMy anitpasti course was described as lobster and shrimp brushcetta.  I got worried when what was served to me was half burnt toast with cold seafood salad mush on it.  My entree was a sliced beef dish that is typically served this side of rare, but I DID ask if I had it well-done would it be horrible.  The server reassured me, but it was very dry, so I learned my lesson there, BUT the butternut squash was HEAVEN.\nMy little pasta trio sampler course wasn't really anything over the top spectacular, but neat to try.  This IS a step up from The Olive Garden, but perhaps my expectations were so great that it just fell short of fabulous.\n\nDessert MORE than made up for it!  The ladies I was dining with had the tiramisu and the meyer lemon panna cotta which made my whole face implode with pucker!  My biscotti was a delicate sampling of Italian style cookies that make Starbucks biscotti look like Chips Ahoy.  With a shot of ice cream affogato it took me all the way back to Roma!  Not to mention our charming sommelier Franco was very friendly and a joy to chat with!  In fact, all the servers and host and staff were extremely attentive and friendly DESPITE having probably had a very hectic Vday weekend!

They always seem to serve up a dish with some crazy looking pasta that they say the name of and I can never remember. But obviously the best thing about it is the sauce! Oh, the sauce! Meat sauce, sweet sauce, lemon, butter, the list goes on and on. I'll never forget the first time I fell in the love there. I fell in love with this out of this world pumpkin ravioli. I'll never forgot you pumpkin ravioli, NEVER! (This was all said looking wistfully out the window like in a movie montage). \n\nBut don't fear if you need something other than pasta (I don't know why, but let's roll with it). I attended a party there once and we had a a three course meal. First we had a delish caesar salad, which was on the lemony side, just the way I like it! Then we had a choice between meats and a fish and I tried the fillet. It was...to. Die. For! I was very pleasantly surprised that my non-pasta meal was so utterly satisfying. Then came the light and fluffy tiramisu. Now I was officially in heaven! We were also sent home with a goodie bag that included Lidia's Eggplant Pasta Sauce. I tried it a couple days later and it was great! It's a red sweet sauce with a tiny kick to it. I loved that it had eggplant in it because it was something different than your normal meatie balls and sauce combination. \n\nAnd lastly, the ambiance is very unique. There's huge windows in the front to gaze out at well, a parking lot. But they're tinted so you have a nice intimate vibe going on. There's also a huge glass Chihuly chandelier hanging in the middle of the restaurant that's gorge! So please, convert over from the OG, you will not be disappointed.

They bring you some delicious breads (a Rosemary and Sea Salt bread, and another plainer Italian bread) to dip into a plate that had 2 perfectly rounded scoops of spreads in a pool of olive oil.\nThe scoops?  I think that one was an avocado-based spread and the other, I think, was a black bean spread--neither of them were overly flavorful, but both were relatively light and fresh.\n**My Faves Here:  Sea Salt & Rosemary Bread with the [Black Bean] Spread\n\n2.)  Next was salad: You can choose a Caesar salad or a pickier/plane salad (but the plane salad will take extra time to make because the servers prep the salads themselves--so it was explained to us, anyhow).\nThe Caesar was good!  The anchovies are diced into the dressing, but you can barely recognize them if you're not a fan of anchovies and are worried about that.\nI honestly wouldn't have even known they were in there, had I not asked!\n**My Faves Here: Go for the Ceasar; it was great!\n\n3.)  For an appetizer (this is a weird choice, but I'm happy we did it), we got the \"Chef's Vegetarian Sampler\".

Ugh... to die for!\n\nLet me tell you about this ravioli!\nThey were not \"doughey\" at all; they were perfect!\nVery thin pasta, but none were broken!\nDelicate and perfectly filled with the most amazing cheese.\nThe butter/thyme sauce wasn't the least bit overwhelming!\nIt was the perfect compliment to this dish!\n...just thinking about it makes me want to go back to Lidia's NOW!\n**My Faves Here:  OBVIOUSLY the Goat Cheese Ravioli!\n**My Least Fave:  The Orcchiette dish.  It wasn't \"bad\", it was just \"meh\".\n\n5.)  Oh, yes... there WAS dessert, too!  ;)\n(don't judge me!  lots of folks have dessert at lunch-time!)  ;)\nI enjoyed the Tiramisu!\nNow, some people like it when the lady fingers in Tiramisu are very Rummy tasting, but I am not a fan of too much of that!\nThis was perfect and delicious!\nI would def recommend it!\n\nAll in all...

I've visited the restaurant several times, but mostly for lunch or brunch.  The food is delicious and well prepared, though it can be a bit pricey.\n\nI've visited Lidia's most frequently for brunch, and find the value to be top-notch.  For $25, you have a large antipasti table selection, your choice of entree, a generous dessert table selection, and complimentary mimosa or Bloody Mary.  Other restaurants of this caliber would charge separately for all this food, putting the total bill far higher.  The foods are fresh and reflect a wide variety of Italian foods, not necessarily the same foods you would find at your corner Italian restaurant featuring spaghetti and lasagna.  \n\nThe food is good, but perhaps doesn't quite meet the high expectations people have before their first visit.  Letting go of the unnatural expectation that every bite of food you eat from a celebrity chef restaurant will be life-changing, you will have a pleasant and positive experience at Lidia's.  \n\nWhen we excitedly told the wait staff we were celebrating my birthday with them, they brought me a complimentary flour-less chocolate cake which was absolutely incredible.  The service at Lidia's is incomparable, always making you feel like the king or queen of the room.   \n\nI would recommend Lidia's to anyone looking for a quality Italian lunch or dinner with an upscale atmosphere.  This restaurant would be great for dates and special occasions.", "business_id": "XmdTkxKyJd7TuDLoiic1kg", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-02-11", "type": "review"}

Second, I love Lidia's cooking and have been waiting a long time to get to her place.\n\nThe restaurant is beautiful inside. The Valentine's menu was more limited than what I had hoped for - the whole menu - but it wasn't bad. We included the wine pairings with our menu. Bruschetta around as the first (with prosecco); the endive salad, tarte, and roasted beets (x2) for primi; three pastas (x2), swordfish, and salmon for mains. Both sets came with a selection of either a white or red wine. Dessert is four pieces per person (truffle, petit four, chocolate cookie, and one other), plus dessert wine. The food was excellent, with one misfire on the veggie version of the paparadelle (normally bolognese) - it was weak in the sauce and more tomato juice than sauce. Cost is an issue on the rating: the menu was $50 and the wine pairing (not required) was $25. Once you get into the $75 range pp, ($360 with tip), you actually expect a bit more than this - better wine, a few tweeks to the menu. I think that with a full menu we might do less food, different choices, and split a bottle of wine and get in for about $60 pp, which seems more reasonable to me. \n\nI suspect a night with the full set of options would work out better. 3.5 for this night; probably more like 4.5 on another night.

I was very disappointed. The duck was shredded and cooked into a sort of red congealed, thick mass with little texture.  The gnocchi were so underdone as to be a sort of glutinous paste sitting under the duck.  The texture was completely unappealing but I do have to say that the flavor of the duck ragu (ragout?) was pretty good. \n\nStill, the gnocchi - one of my favorite things and something I make myself probably once a month - were a disappointment.  I didn't send it back because it didn't seem appropriate in the setting of a very large group to monopolize the wait staff.  \n\nI'd still give it a try again when I'm there in June, but it seems that some of their efforts are focused more on being creative, which is good, but falling somewhat short.\n\nBy the way, if you like a more traditional Italian and happen to be in St. Louis, Charlie Gitto's on the Hill is a great place.

It was a lot to handle. \n\nFinished with a beautiful and immaculate dessert which you don't think you have room for until you take one bite and suddenly you've cleaned your plate. \n\nMy experience here was nothing less than excellent. The executive chef here is running a fantastic kitchen.", "business_id": "XmdTkxKyJd7TuDLoiic1kg", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-12-09", "type": "review"}

We made a reservation for seven of us, but there was no need to call ahead - the place was empty except for a man sitting at the bar, and a couple of girls at another table across the room.  Definitely not hoppin'.  The color of the walls and the decor remind me of a hotel restaurant that only serves a breakfast buffet.  It's very quiet in there, except for the low noises from a TV showing a football game in the next room.\n\nOur server was definitely \"set in her ways,\" as one of my coworkers said.  She had a routine in terms of when she took drink orders, when she took food orders, when she brought the check.  Deviations in the schedule seemed to cause a \"does not compute\" response across her face....like when I sat down and she asked what I wanted to drink.  I said I was going to wait until my next coworker arrived (thinking she might want to share some wine with me), and she was just like \"...you want to wait?  to order something to drink...?\" and I was all \"yes, I just got here....I don't even know what I want!\" and she looked so confused, like how could some idiot like me possibly not know what they wanted to drink - finally she was like \"oh, do you need a list or something?\"  I know, I'm one of those difficult customers who requires a wine list in order to determine what wine I plan to order.  I'm weird like that.  Trying to order food at the same time as drinks was also a no-go.  You have to play by her rules.  When we did figure out the complicated drink-ordering situation, my coworker and I enjoyed our half-carafe of chardonnay.  I'd recommend getting a half carafe - the wine glasses are so small, paying $6 for a glass is a total rip off.  Get a half or full carafe and get your money's worth.\n\nThe entrees come with soup and salad, which seems really old-school and kind of awesome to me.  They had one kind of soup, so you get what you get.  It was a chicken-vegetable-tortellini soup served in a little cup.  I liked it, because I like thin, brothy soups, but it wasn't anything special.  The four little tortellinis floating around were the best part, and it was nice to have some veggies too.  Salad was standard iceberg lettuce, carrot shreds, some tinny-tasting black olives, and the acidic but not-bad strawberry vinaigrette that came on the side.  I didn't bother with the bread - it didn't look like anything special and it just came with butter packets.\n\nI got the pasta roll for my entree.  Despite having lots of ingredients (pasta, spinach, prosciutto, pine nuts, sambuca, tomato cream sauce, probably some cheese somewhere), the dish was surprisingly one note.  I didn't think it was well-seasoned - I ended up pouring red pepper flakes on top to give it a zing, which didn't help terribly.  The texture was good, and it was a cool idea, and it wasn't a BAD dish, but it was just...meh.  Nothing exciting.  Very average.  Pretty bland.  I tasted a few other people's dishes and my response was the same.  It's just generic stuff.  Like I said, Olive Garden, only local.  Considering how \"meh\" the food was, I think it's way overpriced.\n\nSo I wouldn't go back.  It's not my kind of food, or place.  For all the Italian folks around here, I'm sure Pittsburgh must have way better Italian food offerings than this.", "business_id": "nUISXnW2Jo9ovnoFBIUY_Q", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-01-13", "type": "review"}

Can we all please finally shake off the illusion that Bloomfield has amazing Italian restaurants?  Granted, I haven't been to *all* of them, but I've been to most of them and for the mediocre Pleasure Bar to be the best of them is just sad.  \n\nThe real problem here:  This is food for fat people.  Lots of fried stuff.  Lots of oil.  Yeah, those potato balls were delicious, but dear god were they heavy.  I guess I should have expected fried balls of mashed potatoes to be heavy, but of course there wasn't just potato in there.  There was cheese and I think I even detected some mayonnaise.

So if you're not veg, you may want to take all of this with a grain of salt.  They may do meat dishes spectacularly.  But vegetarians, take note.\n\nItalian restaurants aren't really known for making decent veg food and this place is no different.  I had the portabello mushroom sandwich.  First off, the sandwich would have been better had the bread been toasted.  However, it was very soft and airy - not something I'd expect from ciabatta.  The mushrooms tasted like they had been marinated in Kraft Zesty Italian, cooked in more Kraft Zesty Italian and then topped with Kraft Zesty Italian.  This was by far the oiliest sandwich I've ever had.  To make it worse, there was too much cheese - two thick slices of provolone.  Am I the only who has noticed that too much cheese on things is a real problem in Pittsburgh?  \n\nOn the positive side, the bartender was very attentive and very polite.

It's a small neighborhood restaurant, the main dining room is small and it looks like you're in the banquet room of a Holiday Inn in 1985--but somehow the atmosphere is warm and friendly instead of dated and depressing.\n\nI have never called ahead for reservations and i have never had to wait for a table and I believe this is only bc I've got lucky every time I dine there.  The restaurant is ALWAYS busy and for good reason--the food is great!\n\nIs this authentic Italian food?  I have no idea.  I have an Oma and a Nain (german and welsh grandmothers, respectively).  Many dishes were served at our house growing up, nary a Pasta Pomodoro among them.  So while I do not know if this is authentic Italian food, I can tell you this food is the real deal.  It's really, really good.\n\nHeres what we had to eat last night:\n\nthe tomato and mozzarella salad.  Its a real pet peeve of mine when restaurants don't use very ripe roma tomatoes for these kinds of salads.  The tomato NEEDS to be very ripe and acidic and I was initially disappointed when I saw just regular beef steak tomato's in the dish.  These were no ordinary tomatoes!  They were marinated and amazing.  The mozzarella came out in large slices, and the waitress had recommended I dress it with balsamic vinegar which I did and it was excellent.\n\nMy friend ordered the Italian wedding soup and I found it a little bland but he loved the soup.  It was the perfect ratio of pasta to broth and it was not heavy on the salt which is a good sign--you know the kitchen staff TASTES the food before serving it!  (not your food, they taste the food as it is prepared.  you know what I mean)\n\nI ordered the Salmon del Mare as my main course, it was the special of the night and it was very good.  Broiled salmon topped with tomatoes, spinach, mozzarella cheese, and shrimp scampi. I asked for my shrimp on the side and I am very glad I did because I think they might have overwhelmed the salmon.  I thought they'd just put the shrimp on the side but instead they brought out a delicious shrimp scampi which was good and savory and garlicky...  mmmmmmmmmm i just had a moment.\n\nthe salmon was cooked just right--where it flakes but it's still moist and it was seasoned perfectly.  All of the ingredients were cooked so well I ended up deconstructing my dinner, and I had the salmon without any of the toppings, and then ate the spinach and tomatoes as if they were their own side.  A side of broccoli came with the entree and it was good but kind of unremarkable.  I mean, it's steamed broccoli.  It really didn't have a chance, considering it was brought out with the shrimp scampi.\n\nMy friend ordered the Pasta Christopher which had red peppers, chicken, and sausage mixed in with penne.  Full disclosure:  I'm freaking hate Italian sausage.  I'm german (American by way of Stuttgart, my German claims are legitimate!  Stimmt!) and I HATE spicy sausages.  I like sausage bland, covered in Senf (mustard), and made of ingredients you don't want to know about.\n\nMy friend found the Pasta Christopher delicious.  You're not going to leave the Pleasure Bar hungry, where he usually cleans his plate he asked for a to go box. \n\nWe were too full to have dessert.\n\nOur check came to $50, but $14 of that was beer, we each had a beer with dinner.\n\nthis restaurant is reasonable, and delicious.  If you bring a date here, they wont be impressed but they will be relaxed, have a great dinner, and you're not going to go broke.\n\nI highly recommend this place and I wish more people knew about it.  it is one of my favorite dining options in Bloomfield.\n\n\nGlossary:\n\nOma:  German for grandmother\nNain:  Welsh for grandmother\nStimmt:  True.

Corkage fee was charged for the wine we brought (since the wine list is practically nonexistent), which we completely expected and appreciated that we could bring our own wine; but our waiter took the cork out of the bottle and set it down on the table and walked away.

I didn't have high expectations - I thought I would get standard Italian fare with nothing special while also probably paying too much.  From the get go I was wrong!\n\nThe decor and ambiance isn't upscale but it also isn't terrible.  It feels like a down home, mom and pop type of restaurant.  It sort of reminded me of a place that Tony and his crew would eat at in \"The Sopranos\" - good food and cool ownership.  When we entered, it looked like the owner was chatting it up with some regulars.  Seeing us, he warmly greeted us and introduced us to our waitress.  Before I get to the food a note on the service.  Our waitress was great - super friendly, helping us with any questions, and checking up on us during our meal just enough to feel taken care of but not intrusive by any means.  I could tell this wasn't her first rodeo.\n\nThe food was spot on.  Along with our menus, we got a basket full of fresh Italian bread and butter.  The bread was standard white but it was moist and tasted very fresh.  But you know how it is - don't fill up on bread!  Perusing the menu, they had a lot of variation which I love - chicken marsala, spaghetti, etc but the chicken parmigiana sandwich was calling my name.  It came on hearty bread strong enough to hold the sandwich and not fall apart.  The best part was the chicken which was crispy!  It came with what tasted like homemade sauce and cheese.  It's a simple meal but very tasty - you bite into it and first get the slightly sweet sauce and cheese then the hearty chicken.  Mmmm.\n\nThe sandwich was around $9 and it came with fries.  A very good and hearty meal.

We decided to go simple and stick with the Pastabilities. I choose the Bolognese with penne  (~$12) and mushrooms (extra $1.50), while my husband ordered the Marfredo with farfelle ($11), sundried tomatoes and hot sausage (extra $4). Bolognese was solid though lacked mushrooms and my husband's dish was tasty too though the hot sausage was bland, it needed salt. Portions are huge, mine was easily two meals. Italian bread or rolls (not warmed up) w/ butter balls comes with the meal and there is EVOO on the table. For dessert, we ordered the chocolate chip cannolli which came with two - we enjoyed them but it pricey for the size $7. Aside from the dessert, the meal was reasonably priced.\n\nService was consistent with other Yelpers' reviews - really, really friendly. We liked our waitress. Because there were no mushrooms in my dish, she was suppose to take it off our bill but forgot so ended up giving a cash credit. Also I ended up packaging my Bolognese home since I couldn't eat it all and she asked if we wanted the rolls too and wrapped my pasta in saran wrap for the trip home to prevent any sauce spillage which was a smart move since we had walked here.\n\nOne comment though would be on the decor. You walk in and the bar area somewhat has a modern feel but then once you go into the dining room it is like you are warped back into time. There is just a lot of visual stimulation - over the top - that just doesn't go together.\n\nOverall though, Alexander's just gets it done - nothing fancy w/ home style food and  great prices and service.

Alexander's is  the place where the locals go for an inexpensive meal. The dining room is small and decorated to look like an Italian trattoria.

Come as you are: jeans, Steelers jersey, college sweatshirt, what have you. The service can be a bit flaky, but everyone is quite nice. Just relax. If they mix up an order they'll make it right. I love the wedding soup here and they make awesome chicken piccatta. I also like how they serve the meat and pasta dishes separately on small plates, instead of dumping everything together on a big dinner plate. For dessert they make a real tiramisu with lots of rum, and also really good rice pudding. One warning: it is really easy to overeat here.

The lack of pretentiousness and extraneous decor in the building are mirrored in the food that you get here.  I would recommend staying away during popular hours due to the fact that the parking is somewhat difficult -- the scant parking is on the side of the building and on the side of the road going up the steep hill.  \n\nIt really doesn't matter if you will be dining in or carrying out, you need to walk to the counter first to place your order.  If you have more than one person in your group, all the better since they can be on the look-out for a coveted table.  Once you order, pay for it.  On my first time here, I sat down and waited to be served -- they won't come.  I then ordered at the counter and was given the option of paying before or after the meal and I chose after -- the people making the food will assume you haven't arrived and will go slow in the preparation, PAY!\n\nWith the niceties out of the way, you can focus on finding a table or just sit back and relax if someone in your crew already found one.  I have been here twice already and these people just don't stop.  It is a well-greased assembly line that only lets you down if you don't follow the proper path (look at the above paragraph).  Both times I contented myself to watch the large numbers of people that enter through this pizza parlours doors while we waited on our order:\n\nFirst Trip only:\nGarlic bread\nHot wings\n\nBoth Trips:\nMeatballs (x2) and red sauce\nPepperoni Pizza with Extra Cheese (12\" - 8 cut)\n\nThe meatballs, wings, and bread came out rather quickly.  The garlic bread was nothing special, just a loaf brushed with a garlic oil and warmed.  Very simple, but somewhat weak in the garlic department.  The buffalo wings were good.  They were not hot/piquant; but they actually had good flavor and that is really what counts.  They were slightly more acidic than many of the wings that I have had in the area and that went well with a little bit of blue cheese.  The meatballs were about the size of a racketball.  Very little to no seasoning in both the sauce and the meatballs.  I was quite surprised to find that I enjoyed them.  The small number of ingredients that go into making this simple sauce and meatball had to be in proper proportion each time to get that wonderful flavor -- so far they are batting 2/2.  \n\nOur pizza arrived steaming hot and smelling wonderful.  I could tell from the small bits of brown that were beginning in the cheese that the pizza had been cooked fully and to the proper temperature.  There is nothing worse than a pizza that is pulled too soon.  I ate my first piece and was amazed at the flavors.  The pizza, overall, had a sweet undertone.  As I started on my second piece, I began to take more note of the flavors.  The crust had a slightly sweet flavor, was a tad doughy/soft, but was super thin and had a very good flavor.  The sauce was also sweet; it tasted like the sauce that came with the meatballs.  Tasting the pepperoni, again there was this sweet undertone to it.  \n\nI must say, I am not usually a fan of sweet foods, but this wasn't unnaturally sweet and it was tasting good.  What amazed me the most was the near-perfect execution of the pizza with so few ingredients and none of the usual and stereotypical Italian seasonings.  Yeah, I enjoyed this pizza.  It is definitely the best I have had in Pittsburgh.  I will be returning for my pizza fix again and again and again...  \n\nThey only accept cash, if you have none there is a convenient ATM near the singles/kiddie bar.  They are open until 3am on the weekends, so if you get a late night hankering for pizza you are in luck.  Just be advised you will have to then battle the post-bar crowd.\n\nNOTE:  If you must have the Italian seasoning, you won't like this pizza.  Also, be careful of ordering too many toppings or extra cheese as the crust is so thin and has a hard time holding it up -- not an issue if you eat with a fork.", "business_id": "r8jeeS3k_diihMDSu9IjlA", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-12-05", "type": "review"}

In a word: forgettable.\n\nThe last take-out pie we got was less than pleasing to the eye. All the cheese was on half the pie. The onions were diced - an interesting choice - and I actually liked that they were raw. The green peppers seemed to have been cut willy nilly, but that's OK. It's not 5-star, it's pizza. The pizza has a sweet taste to it, and I can't can't if it's the sauce or the dough, but I suspect the former. \n\nOverall, I'd eat it again, but wouldn't go out of my way.

Yes, Ricki, yes, Gina, yes, Alley and yes, Julie, I am talking to you. Spectacular.\n\nEdit: My 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th time at Fiori's - spectacular. I love the taste of the dough and the cheese and sauce, it's just so different to what they serve in Buffalo and elsewhere. It's wonderful, especially when it's fresh and the dough is still floury and doughy.\n\nSo anyway, my second time at Fiori's - not as good. The pizza was okay but it was definitely nothing special on my second visit. Maybe it's the best in the Pitt area, but it doesn't hold a candle to Buffalo or Chicago Pizza, so I have to reduce it by a star. That's really sad too because for some reason I had Fiori's as one of my top 10 Pizza in the country... I must have been really hungry that night or something!\n\nMy old review is below:\n\nwow, this Pizza is really, really good! I love it! It's the best in Pitt! And get the side of cheese, it's really worth it! It's cold and lovely and goes with it really well! Definitely a big time 5. 5/5\n\nIt is a little hard to find this place because it's hidden away, just across a bridge and on an incline up to the West End, if you don't know Pittsburgh well you could get lost, but then again that could be said about any location in Pittsburgh really, couldn't it. Definitely not the easiest city to drive around, but one of the most fun (except in snow or ice, which is common).\n\nThe people here are friendly (yes, I said friendly, Pittsburgh sometimes gets a bad rap), and as I said, the side of white cheese is an absolute must - mmmm. Locals in Pittsburgh told me this was the best Pittsburghese Pizza out there, and as far as I can tell they were right. I don't have anything to compare it to, but I will definitely be coming back here when I return to Pitt.", "business_id": "r8jeeS3k_diihMDSu9IjlA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-12-05", "type": "review"}

An overdose of cheese, sweet sauce, and a seemingly-sweet crust make's Fiori's pizza crave-worthy. How's the rest of the menu, you might wonder? I've always been a big fan of their chicken parm hoagie. The bread they use just softens up perfectly for take out orders. I've tried the meatballs and pasta, as well, and  while both are good, I have to stick with the real gems: the hoagies and pizza.\n\nThe only drawbacks are that Fiori's is cash only (but cheap!), they don't have delivery, and parking can be rough. Plus, it gets packed in the evening and late at night, so expect about a 40-minute wait to pick your pizza up. Regardless, if someone asks if it's worth it?

I'm sure that many of the foodie-types who frequent Yelp are going to dismiss this place, but having heard so much about it from my local pizza-loving friends about the pie at Fiori's, I finally decided to stop and order a couple of pizzas to go while I was in the neighborhood.  The sauce definitely isn't for everyone - it's a departure from the typical corporate pizza crap that everyone has gotten used to.  But the sauce is INTERESTING, and the crust is PERFECT.  A little too much flour used when it was flown, but I'm guessing that's because the place was doing such a high volume of business.  The pepperoni reminds me of the old Mineo's pizza, small slices that curl up and produce little grease pools.  WOW, now that's the pepperoni I love, and definitely not the pepperoni you'll find at Papa John's, or Vocelli's, or Domino's, or Little Caesar's, or Pizza Hut.

They do not deliver and its pretty hard to find parking on the Aggro Crag-esque hill that the shop sits upon.  The interior is dirty and uninviting...I would even go so far as to call it \"rapey\".  After illegally parking with my 4 ways on and waiting for a few minutes one of the employees gave me my pie and I headed home.\n\n\nThe pie it self was a real mess. It is obvious just by looking at the pie that whoever made it took no pride in making it well, they just threw everything together and plopped it in the oven on a wing and a prayer.  \n\nThe dough is some of the worst dough I have had yet in Pittsburgh.  They are using regular deck brick ovens and cooking the pies directly on the brick so there is no excuse for not being able to achieve some sort of crunch.  It is very dense and flavorless with no crunch at all.  The taste of salt and sugar come through a little bit in a very generic way, almost like a Papa Johns tasting dough.  The main problem was that  the dough obviously didn't rise at all and was very dense and hard to chew.  Its a dry dough too, very dry.  Plus the pizza was made so poorly that the middle of the pie was paper thin and inedible while the outside of the pie was way too thick and was hard to chew.  Basically what we have here is another bowl-like pizza where all of the ingredients pool into the middle because it was made so poorly.  \n\nIt is pretty clear who is wearing the pants in this pizza, good old Uncle Cheese....and the pants are soaked.  I watched the kid making one of the pies and he just filled up both of his hands with 2 pounds of cheese and tossed it into the middle of the pizza and just kind of scattered it towards the outside and said \"yeah, that will do\".  They are using a really high quality cheese and it does have a great taste and it has that gummy effect that you would get if you ordered extra-cheese.  Unfortunately there is just way way too much of it for the pizza to even be edible in some spots.  You couldn't even pull a slice off of the pie to put it onto your plate without pulling all of the cheese off into a big pile in the middle.  They are using lots and lots of cheese to compensate for how bad the best of the pie sucks.\n\nThe sauce is very forgettable and watery.  They put very little sauce on the pie anyway and its applied with no pride in the traditional lazy bulls-eye pattern where you sauce in some spots and none in others.  The sauce has a bit of a sweet taste, un-offensive and maybe tasty if they were to ever put enough on for anyone to taste it.\n\nIn general this is just lazy pizza where they would rather give you 2 pounds of cheese than actually have to take pride in their food.  I feel my butt hole starting to cry as I near the end of this review, save yourselves the T.P. and just leave this one alone.  \n\nI am giving it a 4 out of 10.", "business_id": "r8jeeS3k_diihMDSu9IjlA", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-01-10", "type": "review"}

Pizza that while eating makes you feel like you're in another country. The first bite was absurdly amazing...I wasn't expecting my taste buds to explode with delight. And the rest of the bites until the pizza was done were equally happy. The flavor of the pizza is completely different than any of our chains and independent pizza places (whose pizza I also love...this pizza is just different). I would recommend getting the pizzas with their sauce because some of the pizzas on the menu don't come with sauce and their sauce is probably what makes the pizza so good. I mean, the crust is special and the topping ingredients are fresher & a better quality than other pizza places...but the sauce has all the flavor. \n\nThe other food we had was good, but it pales in comparison. I had the mistacanza (spelling i'm not so sure on) salad, which was just ok (I would skip it next time). My boyfriend ordered one of the paninis which was pretty large & had a lot of meat and cheese, but I doubt it was nearly as good as the pizza (the pizza was finished, half the panini went home). The menu had a lot of homemade pastas, which we didn't try but are probably great. The other standout part of our meal was the complimentary bread & olive oil served at the start...the olive oil was fantastic tasting, much better than any other restaurant I've been to in the past few years and one of the breads (it was buttery & had coarse salt on the top) was delicious. \n\nThe only warning I have is they are quite finicky about changing their dishes. The bottom of the menu does say \"please no substitutions\" but they really mean it...as in we asked to have sauce added to our pizza (an easy & normal request at most places) and the waitress actually had to go ask the chef if it would be ok because they reallllly don't like to change their dishes.

Yelp scores another good suggestion - this place is everything an Italian restaurant should be, with an interesting twist.  As I walked in, I saw exactly what I love to see in an Italian restaurant - tables placed relatively closely together in an intimate setting, but not close enough to feel like you're sitting on top of someone's lap.  The decor was also contemporary with a traditional flair.  What I didn't expect was the hostess informing me that I can wait at the wine bar if I'd like - what a welcome twist.  Out of the back of the restaurant and into what should have been someone's kitchen, was a wonderfully decorated wine bar and lounge, with a small seating area adjacent to it.  It was nice to sit back and relax for a few minutes and take in everything.  The wait time wasn't too bad for a Saturday night at 6:30 pm, my guess it was only like 15 minutes (but I think that was because a large party had ended up leaving, but who's counting =) )   Anyway, after being seated I ordered the pizza (like everyone else who left reviews).  and it was out of this world awesome.  I laughed because I spent as much on the wine as I did on dinner.  I ordered Tiarmisu for dinner, which was perfect.  For two people going out on a Saturday night, spending under sixty bucks to have dinner, drinks, and dessert is pretty unusual.

Just so you all know I have tried almost every dish on the menu but will stick to what in my opinion is the best. I did not leave 5 stars because I do think it is a bit overpriced. The last time I went my server was really impatient and snobby when I was asking questions and trying to decide on the wine.  I arrived before the dinner rush on my birthday so I could take the time to really dine with my boyfriend. \n\nWhy I crave Pizzaiolo? Mozzarella di bufala. I know for a fact that every Thursday they fly in many choice ingredients directly from Italia. This creamy delicacy is by far my best loved. It either comes on the DOC Margherita pizza or mixed in with some of the pasta selections. I always order the DOC as an appetizer then the Rigatoni Alla Siciliana. They also only use San Marzano tomatoes in the marinara sauces which introduces a bold rich flavor without as much acidity. The key to these dense, deep red fruits is that they are grown in the fertile volcanic soil in Italy.  The Siciliana is an eggplant based dish that I find myself desiring often in my favorite dish spankbank. The perfect texture of the al dente pasta combined with the melt in your mouth salty, tart smoothness of the mozzarella and eggplant in the sweet heavily basil based garlic sauce is a party for the taste buds. I just keep eating until I am uncomfortably full. The wine selection is also above par, I enjoy the Berro Barberra. Full bodied, spicy, splashes of berry, and low in tannins. \n\nAs for the pizza, it is reminiscent of the famous brick oven pizzas of Da Michele found in only Napoli. The crust is extremely thin, light. and crispy. Follow that with my \"Pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance\" mozzarella di bufala, tangy san marzano tomato sauce, and fresh leaves of basil you will find that simplicity is more.

We got our pick of tables.  Service was meh.  Our service acted bored until we mentioned that this was our first visit, then we were given her high energy sales pitch, \"delicious food created using old-world techniques and the high quality ingredients.  Most menu items are hand-made and if they are not, they are imported from the best sources\".  Did she forget anything?  I hope not!  Wait, there is more, \"the mozzarella is direct from Naples\".  That's more like it, gf, show some enthusiam!\n\nLots of great choices on the menu!  BJ got the Chicken Cacciatore and I got the lasgana.  Our server warned us of the extra wait time for my meal.  No problem, I was willing to wait for this classic homemade dish!  Unfortunately, it did to live up to my expectations.  First off, it was served lukewarm.  Back to the oven for my dish!  It was a little better the second time around.  Nothing special about the sauce or meat.  BJ liked his dish, too.  But really nothing special.\n\nAll in all, a decent meal.  Maybe we ordered the wrong things.  But we had nothing that we would make us want to go back.", "business_id": "6-rJjW6ITl5o_FliiNgZRA", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-01-18", "type": "review"}

We were sat at the table with the most slant...which there were other open tables for two with No slant. Our glasses were sliding down the table so we used our silverware to stop them from sliding. No joke! The food I ordered was penne alla vodka, which was pretty tasty. But for $18, and that's all you get?! I've had better. The bread wasn't impressive, just sliced up sour dough bread with not so high end olive oil.

Nothing was overly amazing but the food was decent. Decor is your typical Tuscan style and the wood fire oven is interesting to watch. \n\nI had one of the veal dishes which reminded me a lot of Chicken Marsala and cost $28. There were no sides, salad and even bread to go with the meal but the size of my portion was ok. The only issue I had, besides the high cost, was that my meal had no surprises.  It was a very simple dish and for $28 I would expect something more complex. The sauce was everywhere, overpowering the cheese, prosciutto and mushrooms and there was nothing to counter it. A vegetable or anything would have improved the meal and helped me get through the overwhelming taste of the sauce.  \n\nMy husband had the lasagna which was very good but cost $19 and I know it did not fill him up. Again it was simple in design and we were expecting something more coming from an Italian background.  Maybe my family is full of over-achievers, so my opinion may be harsh but for the type of food they are creating the price is outrageous. \n\nIf prices were lower my review would be higher and I say this with years of dining experience in Mt. Lebanon. For the same amount you would be better of going next door to Bistro 19, one of the upscale restaurants in the area. In my opinion, they have a far better menu, it is creative, hearty and the atmosphere is trendy. We went there this summer and I loved everything about the place.

Supposedly, they have an extensive Italian beer selection and a wood-fired oven, so off my hubby and I went. I looked over the menu and discovered they only had two (2) Italian beers (Moretti, Peroni). Disappointed but not giving up, we ordered one of each and proceeded. The waiter (Adam) comes over and tells about the specials before leaving again so we have time to make a choice. FYI - the wait staff tries to class up the place by acting as if they've lived in Italy and personally prepared the food so we played along. We ordered a few appetizers to try, salads, and I ordered a Pizza Margherita and my hub-a-bub ordered a Calzone. After we order, Adam brings us some squares of wood fired bread with EVOO. The bread was thick and doughy (clearly a filler). Then comes the appetizers along with the salads. We ordered Rice Balls (both cheese and cheese and meat), which had *no* flavor. We also ordered the the Potato Croquettes, which tasted *sour*. The salads looked fresh but was all green until you dug down to the bottom of the plate where there were two small pieces of red and orange pepper, a cherry tomato, and an olive. Said salad would have been really tasty, had the vinaigrette not been too sweet. Next came the entrees. The place is suppose to be known for their pizzas (that Adam said was a thin crust personalized pizza) but what I was served was a big blob of pizza dough with some cheese and sauce on top. My hub-a-bub's Calzone was a huge blob of thinly stuffed dough with some cheese and sauce on top. Clearly these folks haven't been to Italy or know what true Neapolitan Pizza looks like. Needless to say, I couldn't bring myself to touch or eat what amounted to a loaf of bread (aka an Il Pizzaiolo Pizza) but paid for it anyway. A $100 later, we would have been much happier, and better off to stay at home enjoying a good red wine, a fresh loaf of Italian bread, and a hunk of Parma cheese!    \n\nLater that evening, my iron stomach started to gurgle. Needless to say, I ended up riding the porcelain bus in one bathroom, with my hub-a-bub in the other, for the rest of the evening.\n\nAll I can say if you eat there, be ready for a bumpy ride.\nHappy eating!", "business_id": "6-rJjW6ITl5o_FliiNgZRA", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-12-05", "type": "review"}

If only some other yelper could have prepared us for such disrespect perhaps we wouldn't have been taken so off guard (hence my warning to you...).  The lady and I wanted to try somewhere newish and I hadn't been here in over a year when I was the second to review this joint on yelp in 5/08.  I'm sure much of what I said then applies today, very loud...decent service, a little above average food with a seasonal menu.  I call and make a reservation well in advance so as to try to mitigate what I seem to remember always being a wait...We arrived at 8PM sharp for our reservation and don't get anyones' attention for a little while, but eventually do see who I assume is the owner.   We mention our reservation, he says no problem 15 min...Great!  I understand you're busy and we'll just wait a while...15 min, 20 min, 25 min...Okay, I'll try to make this easy..\"Sir, may I please give you my cell so you can just call when the table for 2 opens?\"...\"Sure, what is it?\".  We go across the road to starbucks and wait for the phone to ring 30 min, 35 min, 40 min, 50 min...Now, keep in mind I booked a reservation well in advance.  We go back to the restaurant and wait again cramped like sardines cautious to make eye contact, which we do.  Okay, I know what you're thinking why not just leave?  I've already admitted it's nothing special.  I know you've been there...we kept thinking what if we leave now just when he's about to call.  So, we continue to wait and then someone walks in right behind us bumps Annie out of the way and just stands for maybe 30 seconds...the owner runs over bursts through Annie and I and just grabs the couple and seats them immediately.  I have never seen such blatent disregard for other customers'.  It was clear these folks were just regulars so he seated them ahead of everyone...what's so bad is it was right in front of us.  I can appreciate that we are not regulars' , but c'mon pops' have a little discretion.  Please take this as a cautionary tale, doesn't matter if you have a reservation, doesn't matter if you leave your cell (btw, still hasn't rang) and you pretty much don't matter if you're not a regular'.  There is a happy ending...We ended up at the bar at Eleven, I had a great tuna tartare and a piece of fish and Annie had a wonderful order of steak/frites.

I understand that at a small business, wait times can be unpredictable. But there are other small(er!) restaurants in Pittsburgh that do not have this problem.

But when the bill came there was none of that.\nWe still had a good time since the company was good but it will be a long time before I go back to this restaurant.", "business_id": "xgK6AAhJ-cYBUCSaLzgTuw", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-01-13", "type": "review"}

The quaint, semi-hidden spot right off of Walnut Street accompanied by its warm and inviting atmosphere make it an excellent people pleaser. The menu is fairly small and changes seasonally to assure fresh and delicious ingredients. The wine list is extensive and the staff is very knowledgeable and friendly. The Spinach and Ricotta Ravioli is usually featured and always delicious. Another plus is that it's open for lunch as well and offers a slightly cheaper selection. Regardless, though, it is very reasonably priced for the quality of food and experience. The only downside is that the venue itself is tiny and it would definitely be difficult to accommodate a larger party. \n\nOne of my favorite things about Girasole is that the owner is also often the host! He has such a bold personality and really makes the whole atmosphere more homey and authentic feeling. To add to this mood, there is often live music in the restaurant--usually just a single violin or guitar player. My favorite experience at Girasole was one late summer night when it was beginning to cool down and I took some friends of mine from Cleveland to have dinner there. I knew they would enjoy Girasole but the wait was long so we wound up sitting outside on the patio even though it was a little cold. A man with a guitar went around the restaurant singing beautiful songs to each table and eventually made it outside. Since we were the only table outside we took our request and sang the best rendition of Al Green's \"Let's Stay Together\" I've ever heard! \n\nGirasole is a wonderful treat amongst Pittsburgh's restaurant scene and never fails to deliver a delicious meal and a wonderful dining experience!", "business_id": "xgK6AAhJ-cYBUCSaLzgTuw", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-12-19", "type": "review"}

Researched various reviews on Yelp and finally decided to try Girasole. We arrived at around 7:30 on a Saturday evening to find a full restaurant, but our timing was apparently good because we were seated within 5 minutes. The restaurant is small and seating is tight. This is not unusual for Shadyside however and was to be expected. Being a Saturday night there was quite a bit of noise and it was a little hard 2 have a conversation over dinner. On a positive note it was clear that everyone was enjoying their time and the food that we saw being ordered looked terrific.  \nThe menu is simple consisting of a limited number of rustic pasta dishes as well as daily specials. We ordered an appetizer of beans and greens with homemade sausage which was very popular as everyone else around us also was ordering it. For good reason as it was absolutely delicious. For entrees I ordered Gnocchi, which were light and fluffy and came in a delicious tomato sauce with bits of fresh mozzarella cheese infused through it.  Simple,  but really good,  one of the better pasta dishes I have had in a restaurant in some time.  My wife ordered a filet mignon special.  The steak was cooked to order and was nice and juicy, but a little under seasoned according to my wife. It sat on a base of truffle infused mashed potatoes and was topped with roasted portobello mushrooms. Delicious at $35. Entrees come with a  house Salad,  dressed with a simple Italian dressing.  Fresh and tasty.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant, but personally would probably consider coming back on a weeknight when perhaps it was not so busy.", "business_id": "xgK6AAhJ-cYBUCSaLzgTuw", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-12-07", "type": "review"}

The owner here can be very intimidating and if you're here during peak hours like Friday or Saturday night without a reservation? Forget about it.\n\nThe owner is the one who seats guests, but from what I observed, he doesn't have a very official seating system. I wasn't very confident that he was truly seating guests without reservations in the order in which they arrived. I understand that certain party sizes will be seated before others, regardless of arrival time, but even still, it didn't seem very legit. They'd benefit greatly from an experienced hostess. We had a reservation and were seated 45 minutes after our time. There was a group of 5 that arrived without a reservation a few minutes after we arrived and they were still waiting for a table after we finished eating and left nearly 2 hours later. God bless their patience!\n\nThe restaurant is very small and they cram as many tables and seats into this place as possible, making it very difficult to get around everybody to get to your table and exit. You cant get in and out of this place without at least a half dozen excuse me's. I know that more tables = more money, but they could definitely stand to remove a few tables to improve the comfort of their customers. But maybe this kind of atmosphere is their goal? A loud restaurant with close seating...very family like. Either way, I'm not sure it's for me.\n\nThe food here is very good and worth returning for. I had a garlic sauce pasta that was cooked to perfection. My husband had pasta with meat sauce that he said he really enjoyed. My friend and I shared a chocolate cake that was rich, moist and perfectly sweet.\n\nIn the summer, this place is likely more tolerable as they have outdoor seating, so I might give it a try again come summer. But as for winter, if you want a place where you can have a conversation, good luck being heard over all the noise. If you like your personal space when dining, this joint is not for you!

They've created such a welcoming and comfortable atmosphere in such a tiny space, and I find that the noisy closeness actually produces more intimate dinner conversation because your fellow diners--although right beside you--are also engaging in conversation at a normal volume. The result is a wonderful din that provides all the privacy you could ask for in a warm little stone room full of delicious smells. \n\nI've been to Girasole several times over the past couple of years, and they've never disappointed me. I've read the other reviews that talk about bad service and an unpleasant host, but every single server and especially the host have always been such wonderful, real people doing great work. I've had nothing but exceptional service, and the host always seats us well and very quickly even when there doesn't appear to be an empty seat in the place. The host is a lovely fixture and quite a character--just what any authentically Italian American restaurant requires. The staff is very down to earth and not at all pompous about the high-quality, honest food. You feel like a part of their family as soon as you step inside.\n\nI was especially amazed that my friend was able to make a reservation for 9 people on my birthday--9 people is like 1/4 of the restaurant. I cannot believe anyone who says that they don't accommodate reservations. And they took really good care of us, which I know can't be fun or easy on even the best server.\n\nNow, the food! Let's start with the free stuff. The never-ending complimentary bread is perfect. The oil and balsamic vinegar with a dash of salt makes it heaven--just as good if not better than the NOT-complimentary bread served throughout Italy these days. The house salad that comes with every entree is also so divine that I could never even dream of swapping it for one of the soups. It has chickpeas, sunflower seeds, kalamata olives, cherry tomatoes, plus red onions and gorgonzola which are optional. And I'd give them my first born for the vinaigrette recipe.\n\nThe entrees are mostly seasonal with a few favorites that stick around all year--the spinach ricotta raviolis for example. I have several friends who have declared this dish to be their final meal choice without question. I agree that the tomato cream sauce should be illegal. One of the chicken of the day specials was particularly memorable as well--probably the best chicken marsala I've ever had by a long shot. The pastas are always winners--just take your pick.\n\nFinally, their cocktails have got to be the most underrated in the city. The \"Italian Man\" in particular cannot be rivaled in my humble opinion. The bourbon, averno amaro, carpano antica, bitters, and flamed orange peel are in perfect harmony, and I fail every time to recreate his rugged beauty in my own kitchen. If I'd give up my first born for the vinaigrette, I'd sell my soul to be able to make the Italian Man cocktail. \n\nIf you're still not convinced, visit on a Tuesday night when they have a live singer guitarist who is worth sticking around for. Just request anything by Van Morrison--you'll leave very, very happy.", "business_id": "xgK6AAhJ-cYBUCSaLzgTuw", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-02-17", "type": "review"}

We also agreed that everyone was uncomfortable ordering  from a menu with no prices on 3 out of 4 of the main courses, the \"secondi\" selections. The menu states there are 3 market priced items. Inside the menu is a sheet of paper with the current date describing the days meat, chicken and fish specials. Prices were not listed on that daily special menu sheet either. I find that to be extremely disrespectful, not only to the diner who is paying for dinner but also to the guests. As dinner was my treat, I felt very awkward asking for prices. My waiter (the owner's son) asked the table if we had any questions about the menu. Really? Since the restaurant doesn't print prices I find it extra rude that the waiter doesn't mention them. Note that risotto, the only entree with a price, is $20. The beef turns out to be $35. It's fortunate for the waiter that a 20% gratuity was added to my bill because I wasn't feeling too generous when he delivered it.

There are also a couple of selections of baked pasta that do not include meat sauce. \n\nWhen I eat \"Italian\" food, I typically like to enjoy a glass of wine or two. As expected for a place like this, the wine selection is not very good and is  more overpriced than the typical restuarant wine mark-up.  \n\nEven with a coupon and not ordering the most expensive things on the menu, I generally end up paying more than I feel this place is worth.

The only thing mixed about this salad was the iceberg and red cabbage. I counted maybe five olives, and three pepperoncinis. The prosciutto and Gorgonzola were plentiful, though I'm not sure of the quality of prosciutto they use. It looked burnt and perhaps prepackaged like bacon bits. It was just okay as a whole.

I would definitely recommend this to anyone! \n\nWe also had the Zuppa Toscana which is spicy sausage, russet potatoes and cavolo greens in a creamy breath and salad. For the meals we had Tour di Mare which has three small portions of their creamy shrimp Alfredo, shrimp scampi fritta which are a new item of lightly fried shrimp tossed in a garlic and white wine sauce! They were very good the mix of favors offers a very unique taste! We also tried the Bucatini with meat sauce.

Thankfully, \"rush\" is not a concept here and, even from our initial greeting and coat check with the hostess, we were pampered  throughout the evening.  \n\nThe dining room is low lit in the evening, but not dark.  Plaster walls, travertine floors and mostly small tables along the walls.  A small bar sits off to the side, but seemed filled with regulars before the evening's end.  I'll agree with others- this is a place for date night, not a corporate function. \n\nWine list is ample and will cover most palates.  A drink menu holds a small selection of cocktail options.  While you peruse the menu, there is fresh-made bread with a white Italian whole-bean dip that we eventually had to push away lest we spoiled our appetites for the entrees to come.   \n\nThe menu seems to change but you really should listen to the specials of the evening- there is usually a fish of the day and a risotto and pasta of the day that all sounded worthy on our evening.  Our waitress took her time and seemed very knowledgeable about the menu.  While there are a few Italian staples here, like lasagna, there is a noticeable effort to focus on more Tuscan-style offerings that play on fresh vegetables and proteins light on sauce but skillfully chosen to complement the other ingredients.\n\nOn our night, I had pistachio-crusted Salmon alongside a risotto flavored with citrus and cardamom.  It was wonderful.  Salmon was cooked to order and light, while the risotto was rich and savory.  The Mrs. had a veal and risotto dish that was accented with truffle and was equally amazing.\n\nWhile we ate, it seemed all the staff stopped by to ask if we were enjoying our meal and whether we needed anything else.  Glasses never got close to empty and I got the feeling that our disapproval of anything would have resulted in immediate rectification.  In other words, the team-based service approach was seriously spot-on here.  The Italian accents by most staff were a pleasant surprise as well.  Pacing was appropriate and we were comfortable the entire time.  \n\nDessert menu was small, but what we picked out worked very well.  Chocolate lava cake and a pear tarte were both single-sized portions, but just enough to savor and cap off what had already been an exceptional meal.  \n\nBill was promptly delivered but we were never rushed.  Parking validation at the table was nice.  Even upon leaving it seems the floor staff made a point to wish us a good evening.  When the hostess refused our tip for the coat check, it just sealed the deal that these guys take customer serious seriously.  Refreshing.  \n\nLuce not only has some excellence in their kitchen, but it flows out to the floor staff as well.  This was a great choice and is a worthy contender for a romantic night out with one's significant other.", "business_id": "z24h6ZYnZiWjlDTuLXG9jw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-01-27", "type": "review"}

Parking is quite easy if you park in the Hearst Tower parking garage (Luce validates). \n\nLuce is a very nice looking restaurant. It is on the small side as far as the number of tables, but the space has high ceilings and they've decorated it so that it feels quite spacious. We were seated right away based on our reservation--no waiting.\n\nOne interesting thing is about Luce is that you can order wine by the glass or by the glass-and-a-half (which our entire table went for).\n\nI ordered the butternut squash soup appetizer, the linguine del mar for the entree, and the tiramasu for dessert. I thought it was all rather average given Luce's reputation and the way they present themselves.

I went there for a business lunch (basically the only reason I'll go) and had a roasted beet salad. I thought I was in the clear with a salad, but no- it was so salty too! A salad?? And not a nicoise salad?? It was very strange and it was very overdressed. Perhaps next time I'm forced to go, maybe I should try a sandwich? \n\nThe other complaint i have about this place is the service. One time recently the server was really inattentive. The second time, the server was really bitchy (and it was a guy). I've never understood how someone who relies on tips is smug and rude. Anyway that paired with the mediocre food means I'm never going to intentionally go here. I'd opt for Fiamma, Luciano's or Hawthorne's Pizza before here any day.", "business_id": "MQnNtW1lHS-eid3QNUoUIw", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-12-12", "type": "review"}

It's not really in my hood but decided I wanted some Rigatoni, Yelp'd it, and these guys came up. I've driven by it dozens of times and to be honest, thought it may be a sandwich/sub shop or some other take out type strip mall joint. DON\"T BE FOOLED by the unassuming street front. Go inside and check it out!! I literally stopped at the reception (yes, I was greeted and welcomed) and had to smile. While taking in the inviting, Italian Chalet ambience that looks like it should be situated on some Mediterranean bluff, I was directed over to the bar to pick up my take away order. The kind gent behind the bar, who was on the horn taking other orders, glanced over with a quick smile to let me know he knew I was there. This is something I always notice in a restaurant or anywhere customer service is important - does that staff look past you or do they make an effort for eye contact? Based on the time frame from order to when I actually arrived (10 min) he was able to guess who I was and promptly went to packaging my order. Needless to say I was already excited - it smelled like my Auntie Rita's (not really my aunt) kitchen on Sunday afternoon. An oversized handled bag (re-usable) was filled with what appeared to be my order plus maybe another 2 patrons orders. Everything was kept in a warmer cabinet (not under a heat lamp) until I arrived which was also housing baking sheets full of tear apart rolls...they'll change your life, for sure. I had a moment to look around their bar/lounge area which I will certainly be back to. I didn't see the wine list but it appears you'll most definitely be able to find something you like - I saw lots of good opened bottles meaning you can get it by the glass. There is a wood fired pizza oven as soon as you walk in and I saw a few being carried out by the staff that looked really nice. The bar keep thanked me, wished me Happy New Year and off I went.\nI ordered the Rigatoni with Meat Sauce and the Chopped Salad. Absolutely amazing!\nThe pasta was cooked perfectly - great texture and flavor. The gravy was bright red and full of fresh tomato flavor. The meat was tender and possibly rough chopped meatballs. The wife thought there should be more gravy but I thought it was just perfect. The salad was certainly a masterpiece. Chopped is certainly the right name for this salad. Everything in it was chopped so that it blended all of the flavors of the salad in every bight.  Olives, Pepperoncini, Tomatoes, Blue Cheese, Nuts (Walnuts??), Lettuce, Kale, Carrot, Onion, Chick Pea.....all I can say is, Damn!\nNeedless to say, I'll be back, lots - Can't wait to work my way through their menu. \nThanks, Mama!", "business_id": "MQnNtW1lHS-eid3QNUoUIw", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-12-31", "type": "review"}

We munched on the garlic rolls (served warm, with olive oil and red pepper, and you can get more if you ask the waiter nicely).

The best way for me to sum up the food here is: One step below Olive Garden and Ragazzis.  The food is watered-down and bland, Americanized 'fake Italian' dishes that cater to those patrons with unsophisticated palates who don't know the difference. \n\nI ordered the Pasta Carbonara when we are here, and I have no idea how they classify what was placed in front of me as 'Carbonara'.... It was basically a fake from-the-jar Alfredo sauce on top of undercooked vermicelli with some frozen peas and bacon thrown in.  In order to be Carbonara, the dish must have a sauce comprised mostly of whisked eggs, pasta water, Parmesan, and seasoning.  Calling what was served \"Carbonara\" is just wrong, and is an unfair representation of Italian food.\n\nThe wine was actually fairly good (I think we ordered a Pinot and a Riesling), and our waitress was very kind.  She was so nice that I felt bad about hardly touching my food, and didn't want to tell her how bad we all thought our meals were. It really wasn't her fault that the food was awful!\n\nThere are several other Italian cuisine restaurants in the area that are actually real Italian, and are far better than Mama Ricottas (for ex: Vivace, Fiamma).  If you enjoy real Italian food and/or are a foodie, save yourself the time and money and search out another option.\n\nSadly, the only reason that I even gave this place 2 stars is because the service and the staff were pleasant and attentive.", "business_id": "MQnNtW1lHS-eid3QNUoUIw", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-02-08", "type": "review"}

I recall seeing somewhere that they were only putting personal pizzas on the buffet these days, but that isn't the case, at least at this location.  They are full-fledged pies.  Pizza Hut pies, to be sure, but they are the real ones, not the baby-sized ones.  That can actually be both good and bad.\n\nIt's good because you can get a decent slice from the buffet.  It can be bad because with room for only four pizzas at a time, and with one of those at any given time being a dessert pizza, it means if one of the three main pizzas isn't one that you like, you may have to wait for one that you like.  This is an issue because the restaurant isn't very busy - probably the reason for the banner outside.  As such, the three pizzas don't go very fast.\n\nStill, if you're at Pizza Hut, chances are that you like their pizza at least okay.  It's not like you're out on a limb to try something adventurous.  If you want more variety, go to CiCi's Pizza.  If you want something good, try Big Guy's Pizza instead.\n\nAnyway, the pizza isn't bad.  You just don't get a lot of choices.  They also have pasta, but in my experience, it's usually almost gone.  I don't know if this is because people don't like the choices of pizza and eat all the pasta, because they don't put much out, or some combination of both.  There are also bread sticks, but they don't usually have many of those either.  There is a good bit of marinara sauce, but I'm not sure what you're supposed to use it on, since the pizza has plenty and there is usually little pasta or bread.  You can also get a salad, but it costs extra.\n\nThe service is generally friendly, but not very good.  The price is a bit much.  For all this and a drink you'll pay more than you should.  The one bright spot is the sweet tea.  It is sweet and syrupy, just like it should be.

Since it just so happened none of us had been to MG in a while, we decided this would be our spot (we used to go regularly as a group when we still worked together at a nearby office).  Things have changed.\n\nATMOSPHERE:\nThey still have this going for them.  This is one of the main reasons we used to gather here to begin with.  Still a great place to just kick back in a booth, relax with friends or loved ones, and not worry about having to be too quiet or having to talk over deafening music and patrons.  Noise level is just right, which is greatly appreciated.  Few places are able to balance debauchery and civility so well.\n\nSERVICE:\nWe had a great waitress. She was really on-point, even as the crowds increased, being neither too obtrusive nor inattentive.  One thing I really appreciated was that she attempted to quickly \"get to know us\" a bit--this helped her help a few of US make decisions when too many things looked yummy or weren't in the mood for anything specific.   Friendly. Prompt. Attentive. Knowledgeable. What more could you ask for?!\n\nFOOD:\nNOT WHAT IT USED TO BE.  Don't get me wrong, it's still palatable; HOWEVER, you can tell the quality has diminished drastically.  I ordered the Mediterranean Olives ($2) in citrus marinade as an appetizer. Must say I really enjoyed those (sodium warning...whew!).  Another ordered the fried calamari appetizer ($9).  This was a disappointment.  While the price was average/reasonable, one expects more than just a few bland, nearly tasteless rings of the stuff.  It was mostly the tentacle ends of the poor lil' squid.  And lots of them.  Odd.  Her lobster ravioli ($18) was yummy according to her (looks a tad skimpy, but said it was quite filling).   My Pasta Milano ($12) was nothing like it used to be.  It's now made with rigatoni instead of bow-tie. In-and-of-itself, that's no big deal, but if you're a 'pasta person' you know how specific types of pasta can make a dish (along with the texture).  Another of us ordered the Chicken Parm ($13).  Nothing special there. Hafta say it kind of looked like something you could prepare at home & was told it tasted pretty much the same.\n\nAll-in-all I have to say they seem to have \"gone cheap\" on their food, ingredients, and preparation.  They seem to have soured along with the economy.  I hate to say it, but MG (at least this location) is pretty much off my radar now.  Their close proximity doesn't win out over quality.", "business_id": "hvhogN-3cMny0Nrqbsjpkg", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-12-12", "type": "review"}

Both times the waitstaff has been professional, helpful, and speedy.  The music is at an appropriate level, the atmosphere is cozy, the decor tasteful.  The wine list is extensive, and many dishes on the menu seem appetizing and imaginative at first glance.  With all of these elements going for it, I have high expectations for the food.  Although some of it is delicious, some significant problems have arisen when I've dined there.\n\nI have had both the bruschetta and the mussels as appetizers.  The bruschetta portion was a bit smaller than I expected, but it packs a large amount of flavor into the bites.  The tomatoes tasted fresh and sweet, and balanced well against the (presumably) homemade pesto.  The fresh bread served at the table is similarly warm, with a crisp crust and toothsome interior.  The mussels are flavorful and delicious, but they don't come with any bread to sop up the flavorful broth that remains after the mussels have been eaten.  Our plate was whisked away before we had a chance to ask for any bread to go with the sauce.\n\nTwo of my companions ordered the Ravioli al Vin Santo; both liked and finished the dish.  It is one of four vegetarian options (the Fettucini alla Putenesca does not list meat, but I've never heard of a putanesca sauce made without anchovies), which was a welcome surprise for the vegetarian with whom I dined.  One companion ordered the Insalata di Caesare (which also has unlisted anchovies in the dressing), and found it flavorful, if unimaginative.  A fourth companion ordered the Lasagna del Giorno (that day it was with roasted chicken), and savored every bite.  A fifth companion ordered the Fettucini alla Putenesca, of which I tried a bite.  The spinach fettucini was fresh and delicious, and the sauce was perfectly salty.  My entree, the Campenelli il Diavolillo, was pretty awful.  The combination of meat and seafood in a dish can be done artfully, but this felt like a clumsy mishmash of shrimp, chicken, and Italian sausage.  The sausage was very sweet and seemed to lack enough oregano, basil, and garlic.  It clashed notably with the rest of the dish.  The shrimp and chicken were both cooked well, and were tender and juicy.  The pasta was fresh and tasty.  It was really a shame that the \"spicy garlic broth\" as described by the menu translated into nearly an inch of oil at the bottom of the dish, making the entire dish almost inedible.  All portions were huge.\n\nThe desserts are delicious.  The tiramisu, which I sampled on my first visit, is fluffy and sweet.  I tried to order it on my return visit, but the waitress told me she had sold the last piece to a table that came in after us.  Since we arrived at 5 p.m., this came as quite a shock.  It seems unlikely that they started the evening's service with more than one piece of tiramisu, and seems like profoundly poor planning.  The bread pudding, while not much to look at, is also delicious, though it is so rich that by the time we finished one portion (between three people) it almost felt like i was eating a stick of butter rolled in cinnamon.\n\nI can't say I'll be back anytime soon.  I have to disagree with Zenide R.'s assertion that it's \"easily the best Italian food in the Madison area.\"  For the price, both Lombardino's and Tutto Pasta make better Italian food, and I shall stick to those restaurants in the future.", "business_id": "q8fD82us6uuGufvI44NoAg", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-12-14", "type": "review"}

I got the bruschetta chicken pasta which sounded really good and looked pretty. However, there was just about nothing on the plate but a huge pile of pasta.  Not well seasoned, no where near enough sauce to coat even half of the pasta.  Two measly pieces of grilled chicken.  I regretted my order almost immediately.\n\nThe sample platter was ridiculously huge.  Seriously enough for 4+ people to get full.  I was unimpressed with everything on the platter, especially the cheese bread.  Not good seasoning, tasted like fake butter with too much cheese left me feeling greasy.  And I LOVE cheese.  \n\nWith leftovers, we had food for 3 days.  The waiter was hard to find and didn't keep our water full.  The unlimited bread was decent with an olive oil herb dipping sauce.

BUTTTT....\n\nYou must not discredit this establishment solely because of this fantastic, ORGASMIC, delicious fried creation they refer to as chicken strips!  Here are some tips for ordering:\n\n- If you're intoxicated in some form, you may be able to order the 5 piece, but if you are sober don't even bother trying more than three.\n- Ordering at night? Do delivery rather than take out.  Delivery is actually relatively good on campus.  Take-out is a nightmare late night due to the fact Geo's seconds as a bar in addition to all the other drunkards that come in off of Green Street .\n- Ask for extra crispy.  Unfortunately delivery can result in a soggy product, and some how even when you take-out from the restaurant the fries still end up being soggy, so again... EXTRA CRISPY\n- For side-sauces I suggest either their ranch or honey mustard...both very good!\n\nI feel like this restaurant would be a lot more efficient if they only did Chicken Strips because they wouldn't have to deal with the other bullshit they make.", "business_id": "iCOvcfVRfi-f05aeqBLpKg", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-12-24", "type": "review"}

The Champaign Olive Garden has declined significantly within the last year.  I believe this is due to a change in management, but I am not 100% certain.  My last meal there was in November and the standards were that of poorly-run fastfood restaurant.  This is what I wrote about it at the time:\n\n\"Remember how Olive Garden used to be a 'nice' place to have a casual meal?  Even though it was a chain restaurant and you knew most of the food was heated up in a microwave, it looked like real food and it almost tasted like it had been cooked.  It seemed a little nicer than your T.G.I. Fridays and your Applebee's.  Well, it's not like that anymore.  Not the one in C-U anyway.  I don't think I will be going back there ever again.  \n\n The first thing I noticed when I walked in was that the entire place reeked like a sour towel.  Someone had obviously wiped all of the tables down with a cheap disinfectant solution that had gotten a bit... ripe.  It was disgusting.  \n\nI proceeded to the bathroom to wash my hands before my meal where I found two employees lounging about and chatting while pretending to clean the restroom.  Since they did not find it prudent to tone down their conversation whilst a guest was in their presence, I got to enjoy a pre-dinner melodrama.  Apparently an employee of the Olive Garden is trying to file a sexual harassment suit and the management had been asking both ladies if they had experienced any inappropriate behavior.  And while the accused sometimes gets a \"wild hair up their ass\" they did not consider themselves harassed.  Speaking of sex, Manuel looked FINE this morning and when he came into work they were like \"oh my GOD!\"  \n\nWhen I got back to my seat, our waiter (who I admit was nice and attentive) served us a sample of white zinfandel that had the distinct vinegary taste of a wine that has been left uncorked for too long.  The food, which tasted decent, no longer looks, tastes or feels like real food.  Both the dinner and dessert had an artificiality to it that resembled an expensive TV dinner.  The textures were waxy and the cheese was lardlike.  While the flavors were bold, they tasted man-made and had a processed mouth-feel.  It was to real food what Velveeta is to real cheese.  The dessert, the chocolate torte, especially had the look of something that had just been plopped out of it's microwavable container.   The vanilla sauce was practically flavorless and the torte was only heated halfway, resulting in a jello-pudding like consistency to the fudge filling.  It is also made with artificial sugar now, which adds to its alien flavor and texture.  In truth, the food quality is comparable to a fast food restaurant.  The only difference is that they offer more variety and a few more low quality ingredients per dish.\n\nI know it's just Olive Garden.  I know it's an evil chain restaurant and a glorified McDonalds.  I guess the thing is that it didn't used to be this way.  I think I've heard that they are under new management.  It used to be satisfying in a guilty pleasure flavor overload sort of way and it made you feel sort of ok about it because it deceived you into thinking it was real food.  But now it's not.  The seams are showing.  Quality of service and presentation has gone way down.  Corners are being cut and it shows.  You can tell it is just a fancier Fazoli's and it's really had to pay $25-$30 bucks a person for some sour wine and some microwaved Italian Velveeta in a place that smells like mildew.", "business_id": "H0D2HYqLd9MRCq68rtbTyQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2007-02-12", "type": "review"}

I always preferred Radio Maria, Escobar or some other place for a nice meal. So before we set out on a Friday night for Bacaro, I decided to Yelp it and I was (and still am) very suspicious of a few of the reviews. \n \nHere was a place with lots of 1 & 2 star reviews and yet a couple of 5 star reviews, written in great length and gushing detail by Yelpers for whom this was their only review.  So who writes their first and only review in great length and never mentions anything they ordered, just summarizing it as an excellent restaurant, then never subsequently reviews any other restaurant?  I may be a cynic, but it raises red flags....\n\nSo, we set off to do our own independent research:  Three people on a Friday night.  The place is full, we get one of a couple of available tables, with no reservations.  The waitress was wonderful.  My first requirement to enjoy a restaurant experience is good service, and she was great.  She knew the menu, she was unequivocal when we asked her what she liked.  She kept her distance and watched us for cues, never interrupting a conversation and never rushing us nor ever making us wait.\n\nThe wine list is huge, the drink list is equally huge, but both are very pricey by Champaign standards. My wife's martini was a very full glass, all the way up to the \"c\" section as we Assembly Hall fans would say.\n\nWe had a risotto special with fish \"for the table\", one mixed green salad, and one fried pork belly starter.  The pork belly was $10 and was the size of a large marshmallow in the center of a 12 inch plate, humorous by its dinkyness. But good, like a chunk of fried bacon fat.\nThen we had three entrees, all were very good.  Mine was the grouper ($28) and frankly I don't recall my companion's meals because we also knocked down one martini and two bottles of Cote D' Rhone between the three of us.  The Cote D' Rhone was $28/bottle and the lowest price wine on the list.  Several other wines could be had in the high $30's, and then the rest of the list was north of $40.\nOne apple pie ala mode later and the three of us were out of there for $192 before tip; and she was worth the $40 tip we left, so by the end of the day it approached $77 per person.\nSo if you start a Yelp review at a three, this place gets one more star for having a great server, one star for being in DT Champaign and being beautiful inside & out, including cloth hand towels in the loo.  Then I'll knock one star off for being too pricey for the market, but if Yelp allowed half-stars I'd give Bacaro 4.5.", "business_id": "h9xdY1NO4GnNijNChTy-8A", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-12-19", "type": "review"}

To be fair, there's a lot to like about it. The quality of the ingredients is high. The ambience is great too. The servers are among the most professional in the C-U area. The food is genuinely sophisticated. However Bacaro's commitment to local, seasonal ingredients, while being one of its strengths, is also one of its greatest weaknesses. The menu at Bacaro is constantly changing based on what ingredients they stock. This tends to result in inconsistent dishes whose preparations are constantly changing. Of three visits I've eaten some bad, ok and great meals.\n\nVisit 1:\n\nHad halibut with some kind of crust in a mint-gazpacho. The fish was fresh and of excellent quality. This was frustrating however because the fish was coated in a greasy crust that became soggy from the fish sitting in the mint gazpacho. The gazpacho was also greasy and was not pleasantly minty. What could have been a complex, herbaceous broth, wound up tasting like greasy mouthwash. Fantastic ingredients but badly executed prep.\n\nVisit 2:\n\nValentine's Day prix-fixe. Three courses all of which were delicious. The appetizer was some kind mediterranean type salad if I recall with olives and I think preserved lemon. Delicious and fresh! My main was halibut again, with some kind of vanilla saffron sauce. The fish was perfectly cooked and the sauce was complex and homey. My girlfriend got the steak and it was of great quality with a strong preparation to match. The dessert was a chocolate torte with blood orange sorbet- good flavors that were well-executed.\n\nVisit 3:\n\nPork loin with mustard spaetzle. The spaetzle were delicious! I could eat that spaetzle every day. The pork however was DRY. Really, really dry. I was trying to conserve the mustard sauce on the plate in order to make sure there was enough to get on each slice of pork. It was that dry. \n\nSo in closing out of three, expensive visits, the food has been good maybe 1.5 times- with me being able to say I enjoyed one complete meal (valentine's day) and the side of one of my mains (the spaetzle). If the food was consistent, Bacaro would be an easy 5-stars. Hopefully they can strike a balance moving forward between rotating fresh, seasonal ingredients and maintaining a consistently-executed menu.", "business_id": "h9xdY1NO4GnNijNChTy-8A", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-02-27", "type": "review"}

On our most recent visit, we ordered a few things from the new menu, all of which seemed fantastic--it was hard to choose. We had greens, octopus salad, gnocchi, and the scallop entree. Each course was just as delicious as the last. \n\nThe scallop entree is so clever and very well executed--it's such a treat to have perfectly cooked, high quality seafood in the middle of Illinois. Chef Drew worked his magic with this dish. There are \"scallop potatoes\" on the plate, which blend in and look just like the actual scallop next to it. Biting into the potato is an experience, especially if you're expecting a scallop! They are divine. I could eat a whole plate of just the potatoes, I swear.\n\nWe were too full to order dessert, but everything I've had in the past from the dessert menu has been phenomenal--creative, elegant and fun at the same time. Their pastry chef Lindsey is awesome! \n\nAs for wine, I didn't have anything beyond Prosecco on my last visit, but I usually just allow the staff to select something for me. It's always on the money.\n\nThe service is always impeccable as well--smooth, engaging when it needs to be and with a huge attention to detail. Connor took care of us on our most recent visit. He's a truce service professional--knowledgable, eager to offer suggestions and advice with the menu, but allows the experience to flow naturally. We had such a nice time with him! Plus, Julie is always there to make sure everyone is having a perfect experience.\n\nI highly recommend bacaro to anyone who is visiting CU who is looking for a polished, smooth, fine-dining experience.

If you put the restaurant together as a whole package including the ambiance, the uniqueness of the food, and culinary innovation you would get a 3 star restaurant, however the flip side is that the culinary flavors do not resemble anything like the gastronomic experience you get when you dine at Next in Chicago or Charlie Trotters when it was still open. You pay quite a premium for the dish that are notably small. Our dinner meeting was held at this location. There is plenty of meter parking, just remember to not go over or you will likely be ticketed. I started my meal with the wagyu beef stew which had smoked potato and a bone marrow crostini. I can honestly say the crostini was amazing with bone marrow that offered an amazing umami flavoring, however the actual stew was salty, the beef was not tender by any means sort of tasting like a dinty moore stew. This cost 13 dollars and the portion size was very small. My main entree for 33 dollars was the grilled lobster tail with kale, crispy black truffle polenta, and additional lobster claw and pieces of lobster on the side with a acidic lemon tasting sauce. Once again the portion size was quite small as you see from my picture. I don't believe you get the whole lobster tail as it looked like 1/2 of a lobster tail. There was a piece of claw meat on the side and the other side was shredded lobster meat. The lobster was cooked well, tender and well flavored with the black truffle polenta balancing the seafood, however the attempt at the different texture from the arugula/kale along with the soft polenta and the lobster did not work. Our meal ended with a flourless chocolate cake with blood orange champagne foam and pomegranate jelly. The grapefruit foam hit the spot, but again the cake was a sliver and for that cost you would think the portion would be bigger. Due to the long wait for the waiter to bring the dessert menu, I ended up getting my first parking ticket in Champaign. So I agree the flavors and small portion size at this price do not make this a place that I will frequent. As another yelper said, if you want to impress your date this maybe an interesting place to try, however I am going to try to find another culinary gem elsewhere.\n\nPros: local sustained food, changing menu\n\nCons: VERY expensive, small portion size- I left hungry, taste and texture just does not work for some dishes\n\nHidden deals:\nIf you really want to impress your date, try the 7 course tasting menu at 85 dollars.

I remember coming here as a kid when it was called \"The Spaghetti Company\" and regarding it as a major treat. The restaurant is housed in what looks like somebody's house on the corner of Central and McDowell, (and I always thought it was.) The interior is cavernous and museum-like, with old Victorian-era photographs, bookshelves, hidden rooms, chandeliers, and antiques on the walls. There's even a trolley cable car in the middle of the place where you can sit in and eat. As a child, I thought this was the coolest place ever. My brother and I would even go off and \"explore\" the restaurant when we finished our meals.\n\nSo, this place definitely has nostalgia for me. I always thought it was a unique, special place and that the people that were in the photographs lived in there at one point and now probably haunted the restaurant from the hidden upstairs level (how do you get up there?! There must be a hidden staircase somewhere...)\n\nBut then my young, naive little mind discovered the existence of a little thing called a \"chain restaurant.\" \"Wait, so you mean there's ANOTHER Spaghetti Factory? In Fresno?! I thought this was the only one? I thought it was a Phoenix thing?\" I wasn't sure what to make of that fact. I felt a little bit betrayed, as a matter of fact. Maybe it wasn't as magical and old as I thought. Regardless, the building it has occupied for the past twenty (thirty?) years has real charm and history, and I'm glad it's home to the Spaghetti Factory, and not a Cricket phone paycenter. \n\nThe food isn't really anything special. Honestly, it's rather forgettable. But then again, I was always more focused on finding the secret book that would open the trapdoor than on my lasagna. I haven't ever had a terrible experience with service or the food, but it's certainly nothing to rave about. I came here the other weekend with some friends and we had a good time; had nothing to complain about. The portions are rather small, however. \n\nNow that it's directly across from the lightrail maybe I will stop by if I'm in the area. It will always have a sort of nostalgic status in my mind, but I have to say, I love the OSF of 1991the best.", "business_id": "DlCtdbceo4YNSI53cCL2lg", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-02-20", "type": "review"}

I was downtown for the Herberger Theater and passed by the Old Spaghetti Factory. I used to visit the OSF in Atlanta and when I lived in Ohio. I remember always enjoying the experience...\n\nNostalgia is better than reality.\n\nMy friend ordered the fettuccini alfredo and I went with the garlic mizithra...which is a twist on the standard mizithra cheese & spaghetti plate I typically order. This added garlic, mushrooms and bacon. The food was good, but fairly average. The portions were smaller than I remembered. \n\nThe sourdough bread was good - still warm. The restaurant opened in 1972 and I think they have been making salads the same way since Day 1. It was an iceberg lettuce classic and although I ordered blue cheese, it arrived with vinaigrette. Rather than send it back I kept the salad. \n\nPerhaps I arrived close to a shift change, but there appeared to be 2 managers on duty, both stopping by the table multiple times to ask \"is everything fantastic?\" - the waiter stopped by several times as well and said \"Is everything excellent?\" I like to be checked on occasionally, but too much is annoying.  \n\nAnother annoying aspect was the food had been on the table about 10 minutes and still was 3/4 full, the waiter came back and asked if we needed boxes or were we still working on it? Um...yes, still working.  Maybe it was because it was 5:30 and the lobby was crowded with others waiting, but I hadn't been there that long - and three minutes later when he popped back over and asked again if we were finished, well you just earned yourself a small tip and a long guest because my show didn't start for another 90 minutes and I didn't have anything to do. Deal with it. \n\nFinally I allowed him to take the plates away and we were brought complementary spumoni - I have to say that was the best part of the entire meal. Afterwards I swung by the restroom and that was a charming experience.  Big open urinals - at least it wasn't like the old pee troughs some places used to have - but there it was - a full restroom of guys looking like a locker room. I didn't know my spaghetti came with sausage. Yuck.\n\nOverall - $31 for a hopefully soon forgettable dining experience.  The service from the waiter and the manager(s) was annoying and the meal average at best.  Some memories are best kept as that.

Numerous trips to the library or art museum in Phoenix, followed by a trip to the this location.   In the early to mid 1980's I remember the Tempe location serving hungry college students 2 for 1 meal  specials on  Sunday afternoons.\n\nIn more recent years, this Phoenix location has been a family favorite, suitable for get-togethers, child friendly, centrally located.  \n\nA few years ago, I would be giving a 4 star rating. My most recent visits have Spaghetti Factory at a solid 3.  Why, you ask?  Well, I'm happy to share!\n\nKeep in mind the name of this restaurant:  SPAGHETTI Factory.  \n\nThe menu:  what was once an easy to navigate document is now overloaded with too many options.  Spaghetti is buried in the middle of the book.  \n\nLet's face it folks, spaghetti is cheap. Keep the menu simple, with its namesake food easy to find.  \n\nMore frustrating is the lunch structure.  For years one could get their favorite spaghetti and sauce combos in a smaller quantities, with drink and spumoni inclusive, for a reduced rate.  Now, lunch options are salads or sandwiches, with a pasta option offered as a note at the top.  No drink or spumoni option, unless you buy the dinner size.  Why???  \n\nThank goodness they've kept their pasta sauces the same.  You can't go wrong with any of them- one of my favorites is the spaghetti with half meat sauce and half brown butter mizithra cheese.  Sublime!  The mushroom sauce is another tempting choice.  My husband loves the clam sauce, and my kids are all over the board.  \n\nI like the addition of the option for steamed broccoli in large quantity- an excellent option for a large family gathering.

First I ordered a diet coke that was watered down. Cheap. The garlic cheese bread came back tasting like plastic, and left an after taste where possibly the oven they use gives that taste off.... we immediately told them about it they replaced it with another one (this one was garnished as opposed to the first one) and it tasted the same. Probably store bought.... my fiancee ordered the chicken paramagiana and I ordered spaghetti with meatballs and Italian sausage. His plate came back with this small piece of chicken to the side of his spaghetti. Flavorless and not worth the cost. Mine came back a mess. The meatballs, are definitely either not homemade and store bought or they over cooked it, and left it sitting for a while. When I cut into the meatball it was so hard to cut through, when I tasted it it was cold and again flavorless. A note worthy to the Head Chef: use seasoning on everything or change careers. The spaghetti was hard, not smooth tasting like they should be. The marinara sauce on everything we ordered was bland. It tasted like a can of tomatoes and that's it. No garnishes anywhere. The Italian sausage I was afraid to even bite into. When I did, it was cold and spit it right out. From the moment we got there, our host walked us to our table mentioning how they were \"surprisingly busy.\" I'm sure this may have been the case for the night, and the kitchen dropped the ball because they may have been overwhelmed or understaffed... Either way no excuse to serve what they served. I went and nicely told our server it was not her, we were actually pleased with her, but for our first time, it was horrible and we wouldn't return. Adam the manager then came out told us his apologies, went back to the kitchen, and found out they did overcook and let the food sit, so apparently from Adam's words he said they were afraid of being in trouble, which now they were all \"in trouble.\" Any ways, they only got a 2 star only because Adam and the server were nice and they ended up comping the entire bill except for $2 for the iced tea my fiancee ordered (which also sucked). We tipped her $10. Although he tried getting us to come back. I will never. First impressions are everything and YUCK. I would have preferred Burger King food over this place.

I had been wanting to try this place but never really felt the need to go out of my way to make it happen. Needless to say I was invited for a group dinner and graciously obliged.  \n\nPresentation C: They are renovating right now, there were no signs coming into the parking lot indicating the entrance. We (of course) attempted to enter through the main entrance, only to be stop by a small piece of paper that said the entrance was the other end of the building. Ugh. Who likes to walk on gravel in 4'' heels? \n\nThe overall feel of the restaurant is very warm, the furniture and decor is all antique, resembles broken down shipping crates, antique lighting, but  still very well lit. Our group sat in a group dinning area behind the hostess stand so we got to see everyone that walked in, which was a little distracting. People were standing by our entrance waiting for their table, poor design.  \n\nStaff D+: \nHostess did not greet upon walking into the restuarant, after arriving to her stand we saw our group seated directly behind her and we sat ourselves.\n\nOur group had been seated for 15 minutes prior to our arrival, granted we were still waiting for others, 15 minutes in and no one at the table had drinks. Really? The waiter wasn't very friendly, his service was very poor. He would disappear for 10-15 between each action. Drink order.... 15 minutes till drink delivery. Drinks are delivered he disappeared again for another 10-15 minutes. He finally returns to take our food order food takes 20 minutes... we eat. We're done. He doesn't check on us at all during the process... 10 minutes after we are done eating he returns to take our ice cream order.... I think you get the point. I'm sure you're probably asking yourself,.... were they busy? No. At least it didn't look busy to me.\n\nFood C-: This part will be short and sweet. The food is mediocre at best, I can make it at home. I got the Chicken Parmigiana with Fettuccine Alfredo. The portion of food in comparison to the price, is small. It is not a lot of food at all.The taste was very bland for Italian I found myself adding salt. \n\nBest thing about the restaurant is the building and decor,i'm curious about the renovations. The staff needs to be more friendly and welcoming and they need to deliver a better experience for the customer. The food portions need to be increased by 20%. I've never eaten Italian food and not had to have a to go box. Especially for the price we paid.\n\nI would only return if I was invited and accompanied by a group and everyone else wanted it.", "business_id": "DlCtdbceo4YNSI53cCL2lg", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-02-24", "type": "review"}

He was making great conversation with every table and attended to us like royalty. \n\nWe ordered the fried zucchini & mushroom plate and a medium pepperoni pizza. The friend zucchini and shrooms were very tasty and we were provided plenty of ranch for dipping. \nOur pizza was delivered to our table still bubbling and with a warning from Alberto, \"Now you two take it easy, this pizza is Super HOT and I can tell you from experience because I no longer have the roof of my mouth, Enjoy\".

Upon walking in, it was obvious this place has been here forever. It's a relic, and it probably hasn't been remodeled since, well... ever. They still have the light up signs for hte order numbers, and the entire restaurant feels like a cave. It's reminiscent of all those old school Mexican restaurants you find scattered around town with no windows, etc. We were friendily greeted twice upon entry and seated almost instantaneously. The crowd was mixed, but one thing everyone had in common is it was almost an entirely blue collar lunch break crowd. There were some people from Honeywell, and some contractors, as well as some teachers. \n\nThe appetizer spinach and artichoke dip was very tasty... if not a bit overly greasy but with the right amount of fat, salt, and other artery clogging goodness. I ordered the lunch special small cheese pizza, and at the table was also a small white pizza. The red sauce pizza was average, with a very sweet sauce, a tough crust as if it had been made earlier in the day but overall a \"it's low quality but oh so tasty\" kind of taste to it. The white pizza had no olive oil, no garlic, no anything outside of breat and cheese. It was cheesy bread, make no mistake. \n\nOverall, I thought the food was average if not slightly below average, but there is something about Red Devil that made me feel comfortable here and welcome. The staff was friendly, there was no sense that you were being judged... it was just a good happy experience... with sub standard but still acceptable food. I walked out the door under $30 including tip for an appetizer, two pies, and two iced teas.

I much prefer this location over the one in Tempe. (The Tempe locale just seems to \"not care\" anymore about customers or quality, in my opinion.) Anyway, met a friend here for dinner last night, as we wanted Italian but not too pricey and not too \"chain\". We settled on RD. We got there about 5:30 ish and the parking lot was already full and had to park in the overflow lot on the west side of the restaurant. [Tip to newcomers to this restaurant: Red Devil shares their parking lot with the bar next door and their take-out window is very busy with pizza orders. Get there early or settle for having to park in overflow lot or on the street.]\n\nWe were seated quickly and our server took our drink orders right away. It was busy already so we didn't mind the wait to take our food order, but when he did, he was polite and got it right the first time. He was attentive to our needs and my wine refill, and all around very pleasant. I ordered Spaghetti and meatballs. It was good, but the sauce was a tad bitter from what I remember. It almost had a \"vinegar\" taste to it. However, it was still edible (I was famished) and so I ate it. My friend who had the linguine with marinara said the same thing about the red sauce.  a bit on the bitter side, but \"okay\". \n\nAll in all the meal was fairly good, and our server was as attentive as he could be on such a busy night. My only complaint besides the marinara being somewhat bitter, is our server's demeanor once we paid the check. I opted to treat my friend if she would agree to leave the cash tip. (she did). She left 20% of the bill's total, and our server, after taking the final check, seemed upset. He took several opportunities to walk past our table and either ignore us (to see if we would like more water) or to glare at us. I found that unprofessional and odd. I guess he was expecting more? Either way, we will probably come back another time to try the pizza again (which I remember is terrific).

Move on.  \n\nThe pizza - decent crust, but totally lacking flavor.  The cheese, sauce and toppings amounted to nothing.  Better than domino's (what isn't?), but lots of better options for checkered tablecloth style pizza.\n\nEntrees were huge.  Chicken Parm was crisp and moist but again had no flavor.  The red sauce was also just plain and the side of pasta was overcooked.  Another guest got the Chicken Marsala and there was agreement it was better than the Parm.\n\nThe room is barely decorated and unmemorable.  We got there at 5 on a Sunday and the place was packed full.  My party of 8 was squished uncomfortably into a table against the wall.  It must be noted our server was extremely nice, prompt and thorough.", "business_id": "PEHJjxdw11TGFma9Zhz3ng", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-01-14", "type": "review"}

No. I'd say more of a 6.50 w/ tax. Some points:\n\n- Yes, the tuna is tasty.

Don't think I didn't catch that the tuna is all in the middle so it looks like there is a lot but really there isn't. \n\nI'm sure that tons and tons of people love this place because it's slightly better than most places in Phoenix.

My primary interest here is getting Bianco pizzas to go.  The menu has 4 of the 6 pizzas that are featured at Pizzeria Bianco plus a market pizza.  In my previous review I had expressed severe displeasure with the fact that although they do carryout orders they will not take orders over the phone.  I think that is a flaw, and should at least be better communicated.  \n\nAnyway, this time I called in advance and found out what the market pizza was (smoked mozzarella and sopresata), and asked them what the typical wait time was.  I was told about 10 minutes, which seems very reasonable.  I drove over there (it is only about 2.5 miles from my house) and put in my order for a Magherita and a Rosa.  There was some in-door seating available (it was a bit too cold to wait at the outside tables) so I sat and waited.  Chris Bianco came by and we had a nice chat.  My pizzas were indeed ready in less than 10 minutes.  I actually lost a couple of minutes when they failed to notice that they were to-go orders and put them out for table delivery.  They were a little colder than they should have been because of this, but the new setup (with seating in the part where Lux once was) was only in its first week, so I ave them the benefit of the doubt.  The pizza was wonderful, I had just partaken of a Rosa at Pizzeria Bianco about 3 weeks earlier and could not see any difference.\n\nI am withholding one star due to the phone order issue and the screwup on the to-go order, but this is the deal:\n\nPizzeria Bianco has what the NY Times claimed to be among the best pizzas in the country.  You have to wait an hour or two for a table.\n\nPane Bianco has the same pizza, and you can have one, either to eat in or take out, in about 10 minutes.", "business_id": "-AAig9FG0s8gYE4f8GfowQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-12-07", "type": "review"}

What's not to love about fresh baked bread, great ingredients prepared in the typical Italian way-simple, fresh, uncluttered.\nWe were excited to try the newly expanded dine in Pane Bianco and were quite frankly disappointed. \nFirst off, the interior and ambiance are great-no problems there.\nBut, it was only 7pm and they were out of 3 of their dishes-so we went with a pizza-3 cheese and arugula and a special-pasta fagioli-a very popular peasant fare that when made well is sublime.\nThe pizza was okay- a little dry, actually, and I have to admit the pasta was also just okay. I expected a slightly tomato broth with lots of garlic and firm beans with small pasta-more like a soup-what I got was a bland plate of rigatoni with mashed beans. No parmesan even to round out the dish.\nI think Pane Bianco has some growing pains before it reaches a stellar status and I am confident it will.

When I was attending college in Tucson, Oreganos was just opening up. In fact my roommate and I attended a group interview in an attempt to snag a job, but unfortunately they did not find our request to wear diner outfits and call ourselves Dot and Myrtle amusing. Perhaps we were just too excited to serve pizza. \n\nI enjoy the pizza (I am not above thin crust), pasta, and atmosphere- in fact it is my in laws favorite place to go when they are in town. The pesto pasta with chicken added is my go to on the menu. The chicken is thin, almost shaved, strips and they absorb all the yummy pesto goodness. The one thing that keeps me from making the drive to Oreganos more often is the wait. No reservations, first come first served type of place and despite them having plenty of seating options, and on occasions open tables, I never seem to get out of there with less than a 30-45 minute wait. Regardless of the time of day, day of week, season, etc. there is always a wait. Once you get past the wait for the table, then you wait a little more for your server, then your food and when it is all said and done my dinner has stretched out to 1 1/2 -3 hours (depending on how many of us) and sometimes there is not enough goodness on a plate that can make up for that amount of time for pizza. \n\nWhile some people complain that it is a chain, it is a local start chain, which keeps it out of the axis of evil for me.

As it is made with mustard--I hate mustard--I would've never thought to order it, but she told me they were her fave and we had a wing night and I agreed! I've even made a noodle dish with the sauce--it is THAT good! My fave prior were the Wong's Wings, but alas, they have since deleted it off their menu. I can heartily say, even if they were still on the menu, the Italian Golds still win the Gold!\n\nAnother thing I miss off their menu are the waffle fries. They recently changed their fry option to Bistro sweet po's... but couldn't they have both? I know Sweet potatoes are better for you, but I LOVED the crispness of their waffle fries paired with an order of wings to share. Now I have to go to Ticoz for the Crisp Waffle Fry fix--the only alternative is Chick Fil-A... but theirs are mushier.\n\nAnd as the sweet ending? The Triple Vanilla Scooped Chocolate Chip Pizza Cookie, of course!\n\nI've had other things off the menu through the years... The Frisco, Pesto Pizza, Original Salad with that Raspberry Dressing... but they are just okay.\n\nMy only complaint is the wait... when this place gets busy, it gets SO busy--Even for to go orders!

However... this location is my least favorite.  \n\nWe show up with a party of 6 at about 6PM and of course there's about a 45minute wait if you want to sit inside.  The only time Oregano's doesnt have a wait is on Sat afternoon about 1PM.  Literally the only time..   So they tell us that we can sit outside with the heat lamps and be seated right away.  We opt for the lamps and are seated.   Our waiter comes over and takes our drink orders and quickly returns with almost all the drinks.. he forgets our friends drink and when we mention it.. he scatters away and returns about 4min later with the drink.  By this time we order some wings and salads and the pizzas.  \n\nWhile waiting for our food, we notice our heat lamp above us is not on, and ask to have it turned on.  they come over and do it.  For some reason I notice that our waiter is no where to be found.  I start seeing other people filling our drinks, giving napkins, cheese, etc.  Oh well.. multi-tasking I guess.\n\nSo our food arrives via our waiter and he begins serving with an apology.. he put the olives that were supposed to be on the side.. ON the pizza.  One of our bunch is allergic to olives.. yeah..  So he brings out the stuffed pizza and we begin to work on that and the few start eating the olive pizza.  They keep saying sorry and will be bringing out the cheese pizza with olives on the side.  I swear it seemed like 30 more minutes before we saw someone with the pizza.  Within those minutes, our waiter vanished again, only to be seen in small  blips across the back of our minds.  Finally.. the pizza arrives and while we're all mostly done, our friend gets to start eating.   The manager is very kind to take to not charge for the extra pizza of course, but to make things even better, he throws in a pizza cookie.  it was our friends birthday, so that's two cookies we get.. yummy.\n\nSo we're all finished, and it's time to wait for our bill.  (checks watch). Oh there he is finally..  he drops the bill off and I ask him for change for a $100 bill..  he leaves.  (checks watch).  \"Wow, did he just leave??\"  At one point I see him come back about 10 minutes later and serve another table a drink and I notice the 100 in his hand.. lol . Wow.. Finally he goes back to get me change.  \n\nBy now we're all ready to leave and we start to split the bill up.. here's the best part.  Our bill came out to around $77 and change and a friend throws in the tip, another throws in $20.. What do I do because Im not paying attention and my mind is all over?  I shell out 77 in cash (along with everyone elses money) and say \"20 on the card and the rest is yours.\"  \n\n... I wonder why he was so nice when he came back with the card.    I guess I would be to if I got a $32.00 tip...    You would think he would have caught that.  \n\nI think this is the most of said on any of my reviews.  Will I go here again? Of course I will.

I order cherry and it seems to be a club soda with grenadiene (sp?) - mistake.\n\nOrders arrive - daughter shocks me by ordering Pad Thai which was quite good. I get winter special of Ishikari - Salmon, cabbage, tofu and rice noodles rather cleverly cooked in a miso based soup in industrial type mini-bucket with oak sealing lid and apparently brought to table from oven. The salmon infusion into the miso was an incredibly delightful broth. The salmon appeared to be generous, good quality but a bit undercooked and I didn't have the time window to do anything about it. The rest...the tofu / cabbage / etc. seemed to derive no benefit from the delightful miso broth.\n\nSo in the end...I probably could have given them 4 stars because there is nothing inherently wrong with CherryBlossom Noodle Cafe. The waiter wasn't all that helpful but he was available at the most important times and we managed to get orders, served and check paid in time for movie which by other reviews worried me because of our narrow time window and the fact that this place is indeed busy.\n\nI would definitely return a much wiser person and next time, I go with my gut instinct and order the Champon as I had intended to the first time.", "business_id": "AkOruz5CrCxUmXe1p_WoRg", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-01-31", "type": "review"}

I finished my salad before the sushi and noodle soup arrived and simply could not finish my meal.  A quick word about the sushi here, have reasonable expectations.  It's not their forte and it's far below the quality of the rest of the meal.\nI'd give CBNC three and half stars but I think dining is about more than just the food.  The decor here is a mish-mash of western, asian, coffee house garb.  It really doesn't work and kept me a bit uncomfortable, in large part due to the abundance of nick-nacks on the table (little lamp [non-working], metal cactus sculpture and the assorted condiments).  It's a good thing the service is friendly and helpful because the menu is extensive.

I can get clam linguine in a white wine sauce, along with spicy Korean bbq beef in soba noodles, which is exactly what we did one night.  The flavors were excellent, although a little muted, and the amount of clams were amazing. There was a little bit of sand in some of the clams, but to me, that shows the dedication to having a fresh piece of seafood on the plate. \nI also thought that my wife's clams were swimming in the sauce, as there was a TON of it on her plate. Conversely, while my plate was cooked well, I felt that 1) the beef needed to be spicy, and 2) there needed to be more of it. I really felt like I was eating more noodle than anything else. \n\nAnd that's what keeps this place from getting a 5. The little things, like a lack of spice, too much sauce, the absolutely dreadful & schizophrenic decor, and, well, on our night, the single server handling the entire restaurant.  \n\nThere are some nice little touches though. They serve you some of the best banana bread that I have had in a long while, their green tea is tasty, and the menu selection is above and beyond what I was expecting.

It's like the guy or girl you are super attracted to but they have a shitty attitude. I wholeheartedly agree with the previous reviews that the food is great but service is inconsistent and mostly bad. I was being generous with the 3 stars for this experience but have had higher star experiences in the past. Just not this weekend. We went on Saturday night against my husband's better judgment and at my insistence. Sorry, babe, I take the blame for this one. We go in and the hostess seats us (two adults and a 2 year old). Five minutes go by and it is apparent that no one is bringing us a high chair. My husband had to go ask for one and the hostess (who sat us) was like, Oh you need a highchair? I suppose my daughter COULD sit in a regular chair but I envision her falling out, dropping food everywhere, etc. This hostess/server has been there FOREVER and as a matter of fact, we have bad experiences when she has waited on us in the past. Anyways, we order our food: side of steamed rice, crispy calamari as an appetizer and for dinner, the sushi combo for me, the miso sea bass for my husband. We also ordered a large Asahi and small, hot sake. The drinks came promptly. I remember thinking that the calamari app was taking a little while to come out and sure enough, it comes out with my sushi combo and side of rice. Okay, whatever. This doesn't bother me TOO much even though the calamari looked and tasted like it had been sitting under a lamp too long. Maybe the server forgot it. The main issue was that 10 minutes after we got that, we are still waiting on my husband's dinner. Seriously? I'll be honest in that I prefer that the whole dinner be brought out at once so that the table can eat their meals together but hey, I am flexible. But 10-15 minutes later, I am almost done with my meal which my husband has been helping me eat since he hadn't gotten his. The Miso Sea Bass was a special of the night so maybe the restaraunt had alot of orders for it. That's fine but if the kitchen is backed up, it is the server's responsibility to let us know. But, no, the server disappeared after dropping off the food and never came back. He only came back after my husband walked up to the front to cancel the entree to apologize and see if we wanted dessert. Um, no, not having anything else. About 5 minutes after that, the hostess dropped off our check and again, we waited awhile and still no server came to get the check. So, my husband went up to the front to drop off the card. Then the manager dropped off the receipt, not the server. Terrible, terrible, service. It is SUCH a shame, because I love going to CherryBlossom. The sushi combo (choice of two rolls, with miso soup and salad for $11) is a great deal and mostly everything I have gotten there is very good. I also love the mixed bread basket with dinner rolls, cinnamon toast and banana bread. But it isn't worth the crappy service. Beware, too, if you do take-out, they try to avoid giving the you the soup, salad, and bread that would normally come with your meal. They tried telling my husband that they don't give that for take-out. Um, unless they are discounting the take-out food (which they are not), they should be giving everything that would normally come with the meal.

I start to head east and Cherry Blossom suddenly popped into my view.  I've certainly read about them over the years, never made it by so now's my chance!\nI am so glad I ended up here for lunch, especially this ccccooollllddd week (hey, at least for Phoenix).  Nothing goes down better on a cold day than soup, for me at least particularly Asian noodle soups.  Like Gabi mentions Phoenix is definitely lagging behind San Jose, Honolulu, Chicago, name your place-they all got mindblowingly good ramen/noodle house type restaurants.\nMy opinion is that the Valley has more Southeast Asians (Thai, Vietnamese, Cambodian) than Japanese so pho or tom yum gai isn't as hard to find as good ramen.  Cherry Blossom's version is not like any I've had before-I usually simply order the cha su ramen in whatever size is not the gigantic bucket full.  Cherry Blossom's was not a clear broth, rather it was almost a creamy white laden with seaweed and pork and those wonderful noodles....I could eat a WHOLE lot of this...coupled with eight pieces of California roll, salad with some pretty solid ginger dressing, and bread (??) with a tropical iced tea set me back $11.  \nVery good food and good value I'd say too!  I see you again soon Cherry Blossom!!", "business_id": "AkOruz5CrCxUmXe1p_WoRg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-02-05", "type": "review"}

I took a look around while I got my food and it looks like it's Japanese owned(+most are not) because I heard some of the sushi chefs and possibly the owner conversing in Japanese. It was fairly populated for it being 8:30PM. The place settings included a plate and a black cloth napkin rolled up with utensils inside. This is unusual for a Japanese place because most Japanese places will give you a paper napkin and a wooden chopstick that you throw away afterwards.

I fell in love with ramen at Santouka Ramen in San Diego and Los Angeles.  When I heard about Cherry Blossom I was hoping to finally have a place to go to in Phoenix that would give me my ramen fix without having to drive to California.  My wife and I visited Cherry Blossom and I was disappointed in their lack of selection for ramen.  Cherry Blossom serves asian dishes of all sorts and even Italian dishes.  It is a very odd concept to me but it all revolves around noodles.  They have five choices for ramen.  I'm used to getting pork miso ramen at other ramen houses.  Cherry Blossom didn't exactly have that. They had miso ramen with salmon slices.  I relented and got the miso ramen with salmon slices.  When I was served I was immediately encouraged by the color of the broth which was a light brown and not transparent, just as it should be.  I could tell there was less oil in this ramen broth than at Santouka.  The broth was pretty good, but a hair on the salty side.  Don't get me wrong, I expect the broth to be very high in sodium and cause me to gain several pounds of water weight, but this was saltier than I am used to.  The fish was done properly but I hadn't looked forward to that as much as the noodles.  The noodles weren't bad.  The noodles were good but not quite the quality as places I visited in California and Las Vegas.  I expected to have more vegetables and/or seaweed in the dish.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed my dish and it was priced appropriately at $8.60 plus tax, but it didn't wow me.  If you compare Cherry Blossom to Republic Ramen in Tempe, AZ, Cherry Blossom wins hands down.  The noodles and broth have so much going on and is far superior to Republic Ramen. \n      Cherry Blossom has Japanese beer on tap and good house saki.  Both were reasonably priced.  The cocktail recipes didn't appeal to me at all.  I have been to Japanese bars before and they had some complex recipes that showed allot of thought and passion for bar tending at those other places but these Cherry Blossom recipes looked uninspired and like they were written by someone that wasn't used to making cocktails professionally.  \n       All in all, I would go to Cherry Blossom if it is near you or if you are just dying to get your ramen fix and you don't have a lot of options living in Phoenix but I prefer other ramen houses I have been to in Vegas and California much more than Cherry Blossom.", "business_id": "AkOruz5CrCxUmXe1p_WoRg", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-12-18", "type": "review"}

There was not wait to be seated but the wait and kitchen staff are like chickens with their heads cut off.\n\nWe sat for 15 minutes before we were able to order drinks and the waiter quickly ran off before we could get our appetizers order placed... He showed up 10 minutes later with our wine and then it took another 20 minutes to get the appetizers without one (Pan Shrimp) with the excuse that the fryer is all backed up (remember it's only 5 PM on Fri). \n\nThe Salmon Sashimi was NOT good. While there was a huge amount It was not Sashimi quality ... in fact, it was almost white in color, bland and hard to describe texture.... more Wasabi helped hide it so I could choke it down. If I want the kind of raw salmon, I can get it at the super market.  \n\nThe fried calamari was tough as was the calamari in the Iron Pot Nabeyaki Udon seafood (as usual, the last time we though it was the exception but apparently, its the rule here). I can't remember when I have ever left fried calamari on my plate. I simply couldn't continue to chew this stuff. \n\nIron Pot Nabeyaki Udon seafood was tasty but the amount of actual seafood was dramatically smaller then past visits. They claim shrimp, scallops, calamari, clams fish and vegetables but no shrimp, fish or vegetables were present. One piece of calamari was so big, tough and chewy that I couldn't eat it... not sure what part of the squid that was from.  When I commented to the waiter asking what the deal was with the calmari that is was like shoe leather, he said he didn't know and ran off (with the 1/2 eaten plate of Calamari.\n\nThe panko shrimp was very good as was the chicken parm my dinner companion ordered (what a contrast to Asian menu items). Perhaps he was onto something.\n\nI have eaten here a number of times and the same problems seem to be on going.

Get there early as we did (5 p.m) or risk waiting a long while. By 6 p.m, there was a line out the door!\n\nThe variety on the menu is downright staggering. There is everything from salads, sushi, noodle, rice, even Italian dishes.\n\nMy friend Michelle and I shared a total of three dishes and it was plenty of food. We ordered a ramen noodle dish with barbecue pork, a chicken katsu curry over rice, and a spicy Korean noodle dish.

Despite the bustling kitchen and the somewhat hurried staff, everyone was so incredibly pleasant. and service was warm and efficient.

The Extremely Spicy Gyoza Hot Pot sold me on this place the first time I went and I return over and over again just to have it. That said, I've tried relatively few things. \n\nThe sushi is fine, not amazing. I like it enough to order it most times I go but I wouldn't go there just for sushi. The lettuce wraps with shrimp and vegetables are good but messy to eat since they are served with thinnish romaine leaves rather than the round butter lettuce leaves most places use.  My husband gets the pasta every once in a while and loves it.  I've tried his plates a couple times and I think it's good, not great, but that could be because he drowns it in shredded parmesan and I can't taste the real flavor it came out of the kitchen with. \n\nNext time I will get Tan Tan Men. Other Yelpers have raved about the Ramen and, although I've never tried it, I expect it to be delicious because it's made with the same soup as the Extremely Gyoza Hot Pot which, as I already mentioned, I LOVE. \n\nNow for the not so good...(but not so bad either)...\nThe last time we went we sat at the bar for the first time. Like other reviewers, I definitely recommend sitting at the bar if you can for two reasons: 1) when the place is busy, which it often is, the food takes a while to make it to your table and being able to watch the cooks provides a bit of entertainment to make the time pass quicker; 2) there's more space at the bar than at the 2-person tables. We usually feel pretty cramped at the 2-tops once we have drinks and an appetizer on the table but there's a little more elbow room and room for plates and drinks at the bar. \n\nHowever, sitting at the bar has a downside also...when you can see the cooks putting all the plates together, though it's entertaining, you can also see all the things they touch without wearing gloves.  I've never been sick after eating here and I will continue to eat here frequently despite having seen all this, but it does make me pause to think a bit when I watch a cook dip his bare hand into some seafood (which he throws into a pan presumably hot enough to cook off any germs) and then wipe his hand on a repeatedly-used wet towel as he grabs a bunch of lettuce leaves for a salad plate (without any heat to cook off germs) that goes directly out to the customer. Admittedly, I don't know much about proper food handling and what's ok and what's not, but bare handed food touching always weirds me out a little.  \n\nThat said, the food is delicious. It does take a while to get from ordering to eating but the cooks are hustling so I can't complain. Try the Gyoza Hot Pot. It's awesome. 5 stars without the wait and bare (but potentially clean-ish??) hands on food.", "business_id": "AkOruz5CrCxUmXe1p_WoRg", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-02-15", "type": "review"}

It comes with stick straight ramen, green onion, char-shu, wood-ear mushroom (ki- kurage) and my side order of egg- poached. The broth is Hakata style, made with pork bones and appears creamy, fatty and white in color. Though it is Hakata style, the flavors aren't complex as other ramen I've had and as I've stated was apparent they use a soup base mix/powder. The noodles were okay- though not always a fan of stick straight noodles, but the portion was just right. The char-shu was on the thicker side, but seasoned well. The egg, I wish was soft boiled instead of poached and lacked seasoning/flavor.

I was told the strawberry shortcake was the most popular, so I went with that. Everyone at the table loved it - and the birthday girl was sufficiently surprised and got to bring half of it home. The cake wasn't cheap - but while I didn't check the dessert prices for individual slices - I am guessing it would have been close to the same to order six separate desserts. So - if you have a decent size group - it's well worth it to buy the cake in advance!", "business_id": "AkOruz5CrCxUmXe1p_WoRg", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-01-11", "type": "review"}

Once walking in one of the servers seated me and I sat up at the counter that they have by the cooking area. I enjoyed sitting there because I got to see all the many different dishes. As I am sitting down my server (Kenny - I asked another waiter his name) asked me what I would like to drink and I just said a water. I sit down and start looking over the menu and as I am doing this Kenny is waiting on a young lady RIGHT behind me. She is asking some questions about the menu and he rudely cuts her off and rattles off some options on the bento box and she asked another question (as you could tell it was her first time there and wasn't familiar with the menu) and he rudely states \"Like I just said, I told you the options.\" She then was trying to speak to him and he states that same sentence not once, not twice but four times in less than a minute. I was so shocked I actually turned around in my seat and looked at him! I have NEVER heard a waiter with such attitude! Maybe he was having a bad day...who knows...he proceeds to come to me to take my order and I try ordering and he CUTS ME OFF mid-order!!!! I would have like to have asked a question but I knew better!! Two more people were sat in his section and he proceeded to run to the back (as I can see from where I am sitting) and yells right in a female co-workers face about why people are sitting in his section! Why would you treat someone like this!!! I mean he was RIGHT in her face. I was so embarrassed for her even though she didn't see me noticing this. I was in utter shock at this point and one of the chefs could see this and asked me what was wrong. I told him that I have never seen a ruder employee than that and pointed to Kenny. He apologized and tried to make it better. I could tell the chef was very embarrassed as he took pride in his workstation, the customers and his service and this one employee was ruining it for everyone working around him. I tried not to let this A-hole of a waiter ruin my lunch. My soup came and that was very, very good! then about 10 minutes after my soup came he said my california roll will be ready soon. As I am done with my meal I am waiting for Kenny to come back to get me some to go containers. He walks over to get them and I noticed that two bowls stuck together when he went to get one and he threw the other one on the lower counter like he was VERY annoyed! I just was speechless at this point. Again, I talked to the chef who was amazing and made my lunch as he was very sorry for his co-workers actions. \n\nI eat out a lot and I have never experienced this kind of service EVER! I will be actually calling and filing a formal complaint as this was unacceptable. \n\nI will be back but refuse to sit in his section...EVER!", "business_id": "AkOruz5CrCxUmXe1p_WoRg", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-01-16", "type": "review"}

Pizza Heaven is another one of those hole-in-the-wall eateries that you hear about via word-of-mouth. Oh sure, I can sit here and spout out multi-hyphenated phrases all day, but in the end, Pizza Heaven is a great little place to get a slice or two.\n\nYou can do just that. Their menu offers pizza by the slice. Or if you're in a mood to share, you can order a whole conventional pie. Each slice is individually baked, so you should allay those fears of eating something that's been sitting under a heat lamp for who-knows-how-long. They come out of the oven piping hot and delicious. The ongoing daily special is Two Cheese Slices and a fountain drink for $4.00. Toppings are 50 cents extra, per slice, which is still not a bad deal if you want to add pepperoni and still not break the bank.\n\nI first heard about Pizza Heaven when some of my coworkers, during their several-times-a-week (I'm trying to stop with the hyphenates, honestly) ritual of ordering take out, started to pass a menu around. Now, I may not be accustomed to traditional Italian calzones, but something that caught me off guard was the fact that the calzone came with ricotta cheese as opposed to mozzarella. On recent visits, I've specified mozzarella be used rather than their default of ricotta. Other items ordered by my colleagues included Angel Bread Sticks, Meatball Parmigiana Stuffed Sandwich and the Insalata Caprese. There wasn't one item that they delivered that didn't look good. The menu also offers a whole wheat crust option and you can order your pizza with soy cheese if you feel the need. Other items on the menu I have yet to try include various pasta dishes, chicken wings (your choice of Mild, Medium, Hot or the painful-sounding \"Suicide\" variety) and desserts which include Cheesecake and Tiramisu.\n\nI had actually eaten Pizza Heaven's dishes several times before actually setting foot in the restaurant thanks to their quick delivery service to my place of business. When I ultimately made it there in the flesh, the first thing I noticed was how clean it was inside. The menu touts that Channel 3 News gave them the distinction of  \"Cleanest Kitchen in the Valley\". I would have to agree that if the kitchen looks anything like the rest of the interior, then they keep things in excellent and sanitary condition. The restaurant has also been awarded New Times \"Best of Phoenix\" award and although I haven't tried too many other local pizza places, I would have to agree that the award was well-deserved.\n\nFor those of you who don't want to pull yourself away from the comfort of your couch and your precious XBox, you can have your food delivered for a minimum of a $15 order. Whether or not the driver will be gracious enough to feed it to you so you won't have to pause your gameplay is entirely at his or her discretion, and I'm sure will require a larger tip.", "business_id": "auorqdHiATGZHVd-sd79ZQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-01-09", "type": "review"}

I am ALWAYS on the hunt for decent pizza wherever I go. I have traveled extensively and am a big fan of \"New York Style\" pizza and even better, Northern Italian and \"Neapolitan\" style pizza.\nSo I like to think that I know pizza.\nThere are certain things that can make or break a pizza: Sauce being the biggest. Followed closely by cheese and dough. And then the freshness and variety of ingredients. Of course if you are a diner, the atmosphere and service and also make or destroy a meal.\nI don't give 5 stars lightly!\n\nSauce: the dude that slammed the sauce here must be out of his mind. PH's sauce has the perfect \"marinara\" flavor with just the right amount of \"zing\". One of the best anywhere.\n\nDough: Brick-oven baked to a prefect golden brown...not too crisp, not too doughy...and clearly fresh. We tried the whole wheat as well. Nice flavor...\n\nCheese: We tried both the regular and soy cheeses in the many times we have eaten there. I always order the soy cheese now for health reasons. But even the regular mozzerella is not just some \"lets-get-the-lowest-priced-mozz-we-can-find-cheese\". You know what I am talking about: more grease and no milkfat. The cheese they are using may not be the best from Italy, but it is certainly a flavorful \"creamy\" mozz.\n\nIngredients: Pizza heaven does not lack fresh ingredients. They make their own sausage (my fav). While the pepperoni isn't the best I have ever had, it is certainly flavorful and not too greasy. I often like a pizza with a load of toppings... The Works! (With anchovies of course) But I typically try to eat healthy. So it is usually a White pizza on whole wheat crust with fresh spinach, tomatoes, red onion and artichoke hearts.\n\nI have watched this family-owned restaurant grow from a whole in the wall to a service restaurant with live entertainment, WiFi, and fast delivery. I can't get it delivered any more, but still enjoy dining in. I have never experienced \"bad\" service. But I would imagine any restaurant is going to have some of that now and again. I have always been treated well, with a smile, and gotten fast hot food. This is no suit-and-tie establishment. But for a great pizza, some great wings with a coupla beers, you can't miss.

If you want a GREAT PIZZA in a WARM, QUAINT environment then this is the place for you.  One of the first things I noticed at Pizza Heaven was that it is family run.  It was such a pleasure to see the whole family chipping in to make such a great place, down to the son of the owner playing music for all to enjoy!  I came to Pizza Heaven specifically to try their VEGAN pizza.  I have had Vegan Cheese before and I was a little apprehensive to try it, but to my amazement it was AMAZING!  This was the first time since I have been vegan that I have had a pizza that actually tasted like a traditional pizza.  I was blown away!  The next day while I was in town I did go to Z Pizza and tried their Vegan Cheese.  Though I did also enjoy Z Pizza's establishment, hands down PIZZA HEAVEN blew their pizza away!\n\nSincerely,\n\nRick D.", "business_id": "auorqdHiATGZHVd-sd79ZQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-12-24", "type": "review"}

Having said that, I am proud to say I can't possibly give Pizza Heaven anything less then 5 stars now. This is why:\n\nTwo days after posting my last review, I was contacted through Yelp by the owner. She had even found my phone number and email address and contacted me there as well, after I didn't respond promptly she tried me again......it was evident she wanted to make things right and talk about my experience at Pizza Heaven. Over the next two weeks we discussed the issue and she apologized more then once and explained what had happened. We talked a bit about the compromises and challenges to running your own business and I found out all about where she sourced her Vegan cheese from, how to order other items Vegan at the restaurant, and about a new vegan sausage she was trying. Suffice to say that the owner cares immensely about her business and her customers. If all owners cared this much we might have a real dining dilemma (does Yelp exist in a society if every place warrants 5 stars??).\n\nI am happy to say that the owner made things right to my satisfaction (and then some) and I am also eager to let veg heads know about the new Vegan sausage - its pretty damn good. I have gotten two pies since my last review (sausage and green pepper) and they have been much better.\n\nI am glad that Pizza Heaven is now back on my pizza rotation. I am even more thrilled that we have owners like we have at Pizza Heaven here in Phoenix.", "business_id": "auorqdHiATGZHVd-sd79ZQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-01-06", "type": "review"}

I'm from Chicago so I'm picky about my pizza as nothing is ever as good as my home town staple.  But I enjoy this place.  The crust is good, not too dry and airy.  The only thing I don't like is that their thin crust is not a true thin crust in my eyes.  I like crispy thin crust but it is still a good crust.  The pizza was not oily or greasy at all.  We've had pepperoni,  sausage, and ham and pineapple on our pizza.  My boyfriend has had the wings and they smelled good to me and appeared to taste good as he polished them off.\n\nWe've had their pizza dine in and carry out and really have no complaints.

CARBS!!! I decided to finally give Pizza Heaven a try. I was hesitant at first & I asked the waitress too many questions. My diet is vegan so I am always used to fresh quality food & as of a couple of months ago, I dropped sugar out of my diet as well. I was hesitant on the vegan cheese, because it stated that it was soy so I wasn't sure if it was non-gmo or if it contained sugar. The waitress was amazing, she brought me out a folder that had all the ingredients of the foods that they use. The vegan cheese brand is Follow Your Heart & it did not have any added sugar nor genetically modified ingredients. I started to be more opened to this menu & decided to order a vegan calzone w/ mushrooms, onions, & spinach. \n\nOh my gosh, DELICIOUS! And, it's also huge so I will have lunch for a few days too. The calzone bread was amazing & it only contained four ingredients, sugar not being one of them. It was topped off with EVOO, not butter, so it was just as vegan as it could be. The sauce was amazing, it complimented the calzone perfectly.\n\nI talked to the owner for quite a bit, who is wonderful. She informed me that her French fries are not fried in the same frier where wings or other meat products are fried. That is beyond amazing because not many restaurants will invest in a separate frier to accommodate to their vegan population, not even big cooperate restaurants, & I know this for a fact. She also uses purified water when she cooks & not tap, she is very passionate about her business & the quality of her ingredients.\n\nI cannot wait to go back.

Sub sandwiches at $7 or $8 also a pleasure. The ones I've tried include the Meatball Parmigiano, the Heaven's Ham, and I think the Italian Stuffer, well-filled with salami, pepperoni, mozzarella, lettuce, tomato and mayo.  A bonus for the gluten impaired, brown rice pasta available as a substitute on most pasta dishes, at no discernible loss of taste or texture.\n  Service is always friendly if not exactly spot-on.  The young wait staff may not ask if you want wine, dessert, or a refill on your tea or soft drink, but it otherwise so affable and everything so affordable, you can overlook it - and just look forward to that cheesecake or tiramisu on a return visit.

We explained the situation to the front desk who called Patricia who was unfortunately not in at this time, and verified our story to her. It really says something about a company who goes the extra mile not only to write an apology letter about unpleasant service, but also give your next meal on the house. Despite having to take out, our meal was still warm once we got all the way to Chandler again, and was absolutely beautiful in flavor and quality. While we were originally disappointed in what must have been a bad night for our server, this night and the owners respect and consideration really blew me away. We are definitely going to be visiting many more times to come, especially because it's hard to find a delicious, classic pizza taste that is vegan, (and it's much better to support local businesses anyway!)

I've found that a lot of places are stingy with that delicious condiment, but not here. I asked for extra, and by golly, I got extra. One unique thing about the giardiniera was that it seemed fresh, like really fresh, and there were jalapenos in it! Yes! This little touch took that beef over the top. I put that sammich down and didn't leave a trace.\n\nLuke's has won me over for when I'm craving some delicious guilt-full Chicago staples. It's not as good as a plane ticket back home to dine, but it's not bad at all.\n\nPRO TIP: I understand the complaint with soggy sandwiches, so if you don't want it like that (dipped), ask for it dry, and ask for any peppers on the side. That should help keep your sandwich intact.", "business_id": "Tk2dSL0TwQeI_zNJmb442A", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-01-03", "type": "review"}

The sandwiches come dipped (wet), so it's a sloppy ordeal but that's how it's supposed to be. If you don't want to get a little messy with your dinner, then ask for it \"dry\". \n\nI'll definitely be back, but I'm gonna have to limit my visits as this ain't exactly healthy eats...however, I'm ok with that for food that tastes this good.", "business_id": "Tk2dSL0TwQeI_zNJmb442A", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-02-28", "type": "review"}

The service is somewhat inconsistent, sometimes it is fast and friendly and sometimes it is slow for no apparent reason. The last time I went it was the latter.

It's just around the corner from where I live so from time to time, usually during football season for mnf, is what I love coming here for if it's just me to lay low and watch the game minus the company you find in a typical sports bar crowd. The food is exceptional and reasonably priced. I'm mostly a beer guy, but here I actually will spring for some wine once in a while. I'm also normally a pizza guy. I mean I really, really like pizza, but here I've gotten pretty much everything else but that, simply because I already know the pizza is good, but so are the other pastas or sandwiches they have, which are slightly cheaper. My favorite so far is their roast beef sandwich. I've always found the waiters to be good and accommodating and I even like the patrons that will come in, which are either families in the dining area or people just sitting at the bar drinking a glass of wine while they wait for their take out order. Never found it to be too crowded, or too loud, or otherwise obnoxious. All of which is why I really like the place. Usually during the course of a game I'll order a pasta or sandwich and a couple beers and the bill will be less than $20 so that's pretty good.", "business_id": "TqHTtjPANCBKGsjGBjDoQQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-02-19", "type": "review"}

Someone called it that once while in LA and it made me laugh. Anyone that's enjoyed a slice in the tri-state area understands how important pizza is to New Yorkers. (Sorry New Jersey and surrounding states. I'm from New York!)\n\nYou can walk into almost any pizza joint, ask for a slice and be happy with your two buck piece of cheesy gooey heaven on (slightly) crunchy dough. No need for production value to enjoy good pizza. Moving to the west side of the U.S. I don't miss the cold weather, but I do miss pizza.\n\nCHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS WOULD BE PROUD\nI've found good pizza last night. No, GREAT pizza.\n(Well, technically I did nothing. My date did. But he did well! Thank you Yelp!)\n\nORDER | PICKUP\nOur pie had pepperoni, sausage and basil. \"We\" ordered online and the pie was ready for pick-up at the scheduled time. The staff was delightfully polite and cheerful. Cute place inside, filled with booths and tables. I like that there is plenty of bar space to cozy up to as well. We had no time to enjoy a drink as our pie was ready to go!\n\nTRAVELS WELL\nI can't begin to tell you the dismay of traveling with something that smells so heavenly in a car. (\"Will it be ok?\" \"Can I scarf a slice before we get there?\" and so on. But we had to hit BevMo. Priorities!)\n\nWith glee I can report NYPD Pizza travels well. My palate was BFF with the two slices I scarfed down.

It was our first time being there,  I had a slice of the the Buffalo Chicken and one of the Pepperoni and Jalapeno,  He had 2 slices of the Spinach.  First off, these slices are Huge!! I would have been better off only having one slice, but they were so delicious!  They had 80's music playing while we were there and I looved it!! So far, great place, great food, great atmosphere... however, the only reason for not giving it another star, is because upon ordering and paying, they gave me a number to put on the table.  You'd think that would  be so they knew which table to bring the food to, but this wasn't the case.  The lady who brought our pizza out, just stood there, confused, she looked over the dining room, turned back around and went back into the kitchen... then she came back out, looked at all the tables and diners again, then went back to the kitchen still holding our plates.  I could see that she asked someone which table the order belonged to, twice! and when she came back out the third time, she started asking random tables if it was their order, I called to her and asked if they were with the toppings we'd ordered, and she said yes.  The place was busy, but not crazy busy.\nPerhaps it was just an off day for the server or maybe she was new, but what was the point of giving me the number if they weren't even going to use it?", "business_id": "TqHTtjPANCBKGsjGBjDoQQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-01-18", "type": "review"}

We hadn't been since the remodel and we were very shocked at how nice the dining area looks now. We had rarely eaten at the restaurant previously because it felt too cramped, but now it's definitely a lot more open and inviting. Since it was a nice day, we sat outside which was also very nice. Our table wobbled quite a bit but our served fixed that quickly. The only negative about sitting outside was there was a man who kept comimg outside to smoke, even though it cleary says no smoking all throughout the patio. We were not affected since we were far enough away, but other tables asked to be moved inside due to his smoking. I was surprised that none of the employees said something to him. Makes me wonder if he was also an employee. \n\nWhen we order take-out we normally get the Brooklyn, which is our favorite.  A 16\" is normally a good size for the three of us. This night we decided to order our own 8\" pizzas. My husband did the brooklyn, I got the chicken pesto, and my son got the cheese.  If you're hungry get a larger pizza. The singe pizzas are very small. For me, it was perfect, but my husband was still pretty hungry at the end of the night. If you have a bigger appetite I definitely reccomend ordering a larger size. Overall the flavor was very good on all three.\n\nDrinks, I ordered their locally brewed Phoenix St. ale and it was very good! my husband had a mojito which was too sweet. We had a coupon for two free cannolis. They were less than impressive and I was very happy they were free.\n\nOverall NYPD is one of our go to restaurants for pizza and if you stay away from the mojitos and cannolis, you will not be dissapointed.", "business_id": "TqHTtjPANCBKGsjGBjDoQQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-02-17", "type": "review"}
