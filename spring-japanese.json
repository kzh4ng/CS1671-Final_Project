My favorite makisushi is the spicy salmon tempura roll, they fry the outer shell of the sushi so it's crispy & it's lightly topped with sauce. The Shadyside Roll which is smoked salmon, cream cheese & avocado, any of the vegetable tempura rolls which is a choice of yam, broccoli, asparagus or zucchini & the fresh salmon roll are all great choices. \nYou can't go wrong with Sushi Three.

Horrible service! Took 15 mins to even take a drink order...then when I had a question about a speciality wine the waiter says he didn't know so ok no big deal, could he go find.. NO! Told me to go the bar and ask the bartender. Really?!? Then the chef came out and was pretty good although cooked everything separate starting  with only onions and zucchini, where's the veggies?? From start to finish it was about half an hour! If we ate the dinner as a whole it would've been cold.. So we ate as we went. Also drink refills were a tough task too.. the chef had to keep asking other servers to assist. few and far between!! We had 3 birthdays at our table.. Not one song , which I didn't care, not one complimentary picture, no dessert was offered until another customer said something. Then the bill.. Oh the bill... That took another 15 mins!! At this point I told my family to go ahead home and I will wait considering this overall experience was almost a 2 hour ordeal. I was double charged on two items. At this point I was DONE dealing with this incompetent and appethetic waiter!!! Went to settle my bill with the manager who was nice and accommodating. Rectified the errors. And was generous with a $20 refund! I told him about the experience and all he said was \"I can take picture now for you\" UM... I was by myself!!! No thanks! One last thing, the male greeter needs some drug intervention..

It was my granddaughter's 4th birthday and thought she'd get a kick out of a hibachi chef. Fist we wait 45 mins or so to be seated. The restaurant wasn't even half full. We chose the dinner portion instead of the lunch because by this time we were very hungry and the waitress said we would get larger portions. She lied. Our hibachi chef was absolutely horrible! He spoke so softly that you couldn't hear anything he said. He barely spoke and didn't put on any kind of show at all! Our 4 year old was so bored that she wanted to leave. The other party that was seated with us all ordered the lunch versions and they got more food! The chef mixed everything together so no one got a larger portion than anyone else. The only thing that we got instead of them was a half a slice of zuccini and a little bit of onions. None of us even like onions. My \"steak\" was at least 1/4 fat which the chef cut off and disposed of which didn't even leave enough for a small sandwich. By the time our main course was served our vegetables and rice were ice cold. We asked to speak to the manager who told us that they weigh the portions in the back before they bring them out to cook them. However like I said the chicken was all mixed together and at least 1/4 of my steak was complete fat and thrown out. The manager didn't seem to care at all about our situation. We paid almost $10 a meal extra for the \"dinner\" portion. He could have easily knocked it down to the \"lunch\" price, but he refused. After all this, we over heard another chef complaining that the place had new owners and everyone quit.  I for one will never, EVER, go back there and would suggest everyone who reads this to stay away.

The furnishings, carpet, set up hasn't changed in years and the staff/food isn't always up to par. I can eat Paleo here though, which was a new discovery. I've always appreciated sushi, but I never ordered it raw without the fun additions of tempura, sesame seeds, soy sauce, cream cheese, and everything else that makes sushi AWESOME, so this was a new experience. I ordered the Tuna Tatiki, which was 10 chunks of raw tuna. I ordered it without sauce or seeds. It was a little tough to get down because there were so many pieces and after a couple raw pieces, I needed some extra searing, which they did for me no problem! The server was wonderful- she was helpful and had no problem going to extra mile for someone with diet restrictions! I was very happy about this because the last time we sat in the bar, our waiter was really odd. He didn't explain the foods and extra charges (our waiter last night did) and he seemed like we were bothering him. I was happy to have a better experience last night, but I do think that Benihana needs to monitor their staff better. I had negative experiences twice related to incompetent staff, which really made my overall feeling of Benihana go from positive to neutral. Not to mention, the last time I was there, perhaps because we got hibachi at the bar, but it was not very good at all, and I got the most expensive dinner on the menu: \"Ocean's Treasure.\" More recently when I visited Benihana though (the same time I got the raw tuna), I had a better experience- I ordered salmon and yellowtail sashimi. I was very nervous to bite into a raw cut of fish by itself, but was pleasantly surprised at how good the cuts of fish were. The yellowtail had a sweeter taste and the salmon was less sweet, but more flavorful. It was a great to jump outside of my comfort zone and appreciate the rawest of the raw food! I would definitely recommend Benihana due to its location- I love that it is on a hill all to itself, and it's unique mark in Pittsburgh, but I would choose other hibachi restaurants before I would choose this one.", "business_id": "1vQLTKwmcmZXtNzfKEvMmA", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-03-23", "type": "review"}

Honestly, the only time I have ever been to Benihana has been for birthdays. As many yelpers noted- their parking lot is VERY odd. Be prepared.\n\nI wanted to try some items that I never had at Benihana before, so I decided I would be adventurous and try some sushi....vegetable sushi that is (I am not a seafood lover). The vegetable roll consisted of: green leaf, avocado, cucumber, tomato, red cabbage and yamagobo. I dipped it in some soy sauce and added a small dab of wasabi to each bite. I didn't love it- I think sushi just all around is not something that I enjoy the taste of. \n\nFor my meal, I ordered the hibachi chicken. My boyfriend ordered the spicy hibachi chicken. The first course was soup. It was a light, chicken broth based mushroom and green onion soup and it was decent, nothing crazy or packed with flavor. The salad came shortly after- ice berg lettuce, cherry tomatoes, thinly sliced radishes and ginger dressing. I loved the dressing! I wasn't a fan of the mediocre choice of greens and vegetables though. \n\nThe main portion of the Benihana/hibachi experience, is the show. Our chef was very nice and very talented. He recognized the birthday girl at our table and gave her a special chef's hat, haha. He prepared our vegetables, shrimp appetizer and main entrees in front of us. The vegetables consisted of zucchini and onions. I agree with other yelpers- the vegetables could be improved. The portion isn't very large and more variety could be added. Having said that, they were delicious. The shrimp was also very tasty. \n\nMy entire table ordered the fried rice with their meal and I HIGHLY recommend doing so, rather than ordering the white rice. The fried rice is made fresh right in front of you and is very good! The yum-yum sauce, of course, is the icing on the cake... SO GOOD. It went perfectly with the rice, chicken, veggies and shrimp. My whole table asked for additional sauce to go and the staff was very friendly and super accommodating! The hibachi chicken was very good and came with saut\u00e9ed mushrooms. I really enjoyed my boyfriend's spicy hibachi chicken- the sauce was wonderful.  \n\nAt the end of the meal, everyone had a choice of sorbet. I had the rainbow sorbet- it was the perfect ending to a delicious meal. The staff also took our picture and printed a copy for the birthday girl.\n\nBenihana is not my favorite place to eat at all, but they are a great place to go for a birthday. The staff was wonderful, the food was good and we all had a great time.

Of the multiple courses, my favorites are the tuna tartar and the kobe steak.  If I have to point to a weakness, it is that Mr. Shu's range is relatively narrow.  A bit more variety could really bring the meal to a whole new level.", "business_id": "Cy9XgM3ZG2jZ1ganvolb6Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-03-05", "type": "review"}

BUT, the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is the portion size. I was perfectly happy with the portion size but my boyfriend was not. I think the disappointment came more from his expectation of 7 courses of an American meal. I, however, was expecting portions smaller than the typical American meal. \n\nThe restaurant is pricey, but if you love sushi you have to go. The sauces perfectly complement the fish.

But it just seemed like I didn't have a reason since this is such a \"special occassion\" type of place. So I was super excited when Sheryl T. organized a UYE here. I wanted to let the dinner marinate in my head a bit before writing the review (well actually, I've just been really lazy and terrible at writing reviews lately), and I'm not exactly sure what to say about it other than it was outstanding.\n\nMost of us did the 8-course omakase. The portions are interesting, it starts out with a couple very small plates (tartare, sashimi) and you're thinking like, \"oh my god, I'm going to be so hungry after this.\" But they get more substantial with some nigiri and a couple warm plates, and finally a gigantic dessert and at this point you're like, \"oh my god, that was way too much food.\" Overall, the tasting menu played out nicely. My faves were the nigiri (creative, but in a way that pays homage to sushi rather than bastardizing it...not that I don't like spicy-tuna-fried-scallop-topped-with-tuna-tataki etc etc...but this is not the place for that), the miso black cod (simple, but done well), and the rock shrimp tempura (the sauce was a little heavy for me, but the shrimp itself was light and succulent in a way that I didn't know deep-fried food could possibly be).\n\nThe desserts are the same ones found on Soba's menu and as I said, they are pretty rich and ridiculous. Actually, if I had any one thing i'd change, it would be that I would prefer a lighter dessert to complement the type of food here, but that could be because I'm just not a big dessert person. But it was pretty awesome to get to try every dessert on the menu! (I guess that's what happens when six ladies go out to dinner together...haha)\n\nI would definitely come back again, although it is very pricey so it's not so much a place to come and stuff your face with maki, and more of a birthday/anniversary/graduation/other major life event celebration spot. So, I guess I just need to find an excuse to come back. Thanks again for organizing, Sheryl!!", "business_id": "Cy9XgM3ZG2jZ1ganvolb6Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-04-14", "type": "review"}

Yes - this beats out the likes of Casbah, Eleven, Nine on Nine, and Tamari.\n\nFOOD:\nExcellent. Having heard enough good things, we opted for the Omakase (chef's choice). Course after course of sensationally prepared sashimi and nigiri-sushi, with sauces that were flavorful enough to set off the fish, yet delicate enough not to overpower it. \n\nMr. Shu presented us with Maguro (Tuna), Hamachi (Yellowtail), Hirame (Fluke), Kanpachi (young Yellowtail), Saba (Mackerel) and a few others. Miso soup, of course. There was one cooked course - a buttery soft fillet of cod that simply melted in the mouth.\n\nThe culinary delights continued with desserts. I got the chocolate maki, which was rich and delicious. Thankfully, it was also the only time that maki made any sort of an appearance at the table. Truth be told, I was a little apprehensive that the Omakase would include a few courses of maki, especially since the table next to us seemed to be busy wolfing down California rolls.\n\nAll in all, an excellent tasting menu. Portion sizes were just right, with enough food to leave you happily sated, but not stuffed. I was surprised to see reviews complaining about the small portion sizes - sushi is not something that you traditionally expect to find in Cheesecake Factory size portions!\n\nSERVICE:\nService was about average. Servers were friendly, helpful and knowledgeable, but a little on the slow side. We had a reservation and we were seated within a few minutes. It took us a little while after we were seated for them to get our drink order and there were a few other times when we were looking for a server but couldn't find one. \n\nAMBIANCE:\nThis is really the only thing I'd knock about Umi. I feel like they had the potential to really go for an upscale Japanese look and didn't. Instead, it feels a bit haphazard, with a mish-mash of a traditional and contemporary that doesn't quite mesh. It's by no means bad though - it was comfortable and enjoyable - just not up to its potential.\n\nFINAL VERDICT:\nThis is a place you can take your friends who are visiting from NYC or Philly and have it more than hold its own. Do yourself a favor and skip the grocery store rolls and go for the Omakase.", "business_id": "Cy9XgM3ZG2jZ1ganvolb6Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-03-07", "type": "review"}

It was the freshest snapper I've had since moving to the 'burgh and it was complimented perfectly by the truffle oil. I could have eaten just this for dinner and been satisfied. We also tried one of the assorted sushi plates which came with salmon, fluke, tuna, and a few others - they were all great.

I see they're trying to be authentic in their food (I lived in Japan, and I can tell). \n\nAnyway, the ramen I tried, I guess you just can't make it as good as you'd get in Japan. It is pretty ordinary ramen (stuff you could make with the material you gather from an asian market without much efforts), but pricey, (not as meh and pricy as the ones I tried in St. Mark's Place in NYC though, those were absolute rip-offs and were literally cup-noodles in bowls!). \n\nThe lunch sushi plate I didn't try but I saw a sample display at the entrance --- the usual cheapie American style sushi, i.e. a bunch of makis (easy to make a bunch, easier to cheat the flavor of lower quality sashimi, not accidentally never ever seen served in restaurants in japan), fake crab meats (seriously, why would any supposedly \"authentic\" japanese restaurant serve this crap? Why not skip the crab anything altogether if the real thing is so expensive?), etc.\n\nOK food. Really, not much better (but certainly not worse) than any other japanese or sushi restaurants in Charlotte, and the prices were OK. The Japanese regulars seems to frequent the place because they know it cannot get any better in Charlotte as far as Japanese cuisine goes (not because the food there is as good as they'd get back home).

This restaurant is family-owned (the owner is a sweet little lady) and has been around for a while. Musashi has and will always be my go-to place for simple, fresh and authentic. No sizzing grill, no fancy chefs or crazy tricks, just the core of Japanese cuisine. \n\nSome friends and I decided to go to Musashi for dinner last Saturday. I've been craving their sashimi for weeks! They use the most high quality and best part of the fish so every single bite keeps you wanting more. Salmon is my favorite. Trust me, I kept yearning for a chance to go back. If you're more adventurous, I recommend the beef tongue! If you've never had beef tongue, it is soft yet slightly chewy. The pieces are sliced and the flavors just melt in your mouth! I don't think it's on the menu, but you can always ask the friendly staff. Sadly, they ran out on this occasion. We've also tried the Fukahire Salad (marinated shark fin/jelly fish salad), grilled sardines and a few other appetizers, but the sashimi and beef tongue are my favorites as far as appetizers. What can I say, we're some adventurous eaters!\n\nNow.. for the main course! My absolute favorite is the Katsu-jyu, which is fried breaded pork cutlet with egg and onions, served over a bed of rice. A jyu box is actually the Japanese's traditional method of presenting food (how cool!). If you're not much of a pork fan, I would go with the Chicken-katsu. If you're in the mood for some soup or traditional ramen, the Tonkatsu ramen is also delicious! It is cooked in a pork bone base and served with Japanese egg noodle, roasted pork slices, bamboo shoot and green onions. Yummm.. this is definitely not where you want to stroll in and ask for a hibachi grill and shrimp sauce!\n\nBefore I talk about dessert, I have to say that a meal at Musashi is more of an experience. There are so many varieties that keeps you wanting more. Many Japanese restaurants are Americanized and that special authenticity of the cuisine is lost. I'm glad to say that Musashi still holds its roots close to the traditional culture. Ready for the end of this food adventure? Green tea or red bean ice cream is the only way to end this perfect meal!", "business_id": "Y_OeiGhTm6ZEfZ1UQgM_wA", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-04-25", "type": "review"}

We had the vegetable tempura, tonkotsu ramen, and chicken katsu cutlet.  I will update this review as necessary after trying the sushi side of their menu.\n\nPros:\n\n- The food here is authentic.  I am not Japanese, but this restaurant's dishes taste identical to those I tasted when visiting Osaka/Tokyo.  As far as I know, this place is the only restaurant in the Charlotte area with authentic ramen noodle soups.\n-It seems they make their own tonkatsu sauce.  It was not as sweet as the bottled version that is available from Asian grocery stores.  The perfectly balanced tonkatsu sauce was a pleasant surprise. \n-Service was good, and food came out very quickly.  The entrees came out before we were finished with the tempura appetizer.\n-Price is reasonable, perhaps a touch high.\n\n\nCons:\n\n\n-The restaurant space is cramped.  Musashi crams as many 2 and 4 person tables into the space that they can.  There is a large area dedicated for tatami room style dining.  That area was not in use and made the restaurant seem like a suboptimal arrangement/floorplan.\n-The restrooms are single person restrooms.  They are located behind the kitchen and when I checked the floors leading to the restrooms were sticky, presumably from spilled food/drink.\n-The portion sizes are not consistent.  The tempura appetizer(notably no onion rings) was about 7-8 small vegetables, which I consider to be small.  The chicken cutlet portion was gigantic, containing two chicken breasts along with two generous portions of sides.  My ramen was just the right size.", "business_id": "Y_OeiGhTm6ZEfZ1UQgM_wA", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-03-28", "type": "review"}

Its accessible bento boxes and katsu dishes earn it plaudits, but the more rarefied fish (both grilled and rare) are what attract me.  \n\nThe staff is Japanese and the walls are covered in Japanese baseball regalia near the sushi bar.  They take some time to warm up, but the servers and sushi chefs will eventually crack a smile.  The crowd is fairly brutal ordering a motley assortment of spicy rolls and fried dishes, but I suppose that's unsurprising.\n\nMusashi is very casual, and so one needs to excuse the floppy menus, powdered wasabi and pink ginger.   Where they spend their money is carrying an assortment of fish.  Here's a rundown on what I had:\n\n- Sashimi platter - I ordered a la cart a large sampling, but you can do one piece each so everything's very small portion wise.   As I said...authentic!\n- Anago - delicious, buttery\n- ika - squid was a highlight, very light and with a touch of crunch\n- surf clam - also delicious, I was feeling their bivalves.   They cater to the Japanese palette\n- tako - fresh and delicately flavorful.  I chomped on it with some shiso leaf and lemon which added zest  \n- ebi - slightly more flavorful than usual\n- saba - marinated and tasty\n- hamachi, sake, hirame, maguro - fairly standard although the salmon was better than expected\n- ikura - I got this sushi style and was delighted by the freshness and the sushi rice is great here.  A good touch of mirin and served slightly above room temperature.  \n\nI thought the knife work could have been prettier with the sashimi, however, the selection and relative freshness were both very good.  They didn't have any special fish such as toro - they said that specials come in during the weekends.   They were out of uni too but sea urchin is not in season apparently.  \n\n- hamachi Kama - very fresh, not previously frozen, cooked with some interesting spices \n- mackerel - grilled and salted to perfection.  Inside secret they get very good mackerel and cook it perfectly so fatty, juicy interior with a crisp skin\n- sanma - a little bit of a pain to eat, since I don't do the guts, however, some lemon brings to life and a simply flavorful light fish", "business_id": "Y_OeiGhTm6ZEfZ1UQgM_wA", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-03-02", "type": "review"}

They close at 2pm and as mom and I walked in at 1:15, the hostess assumed we would have the express. We told her we were having the regular hibachi. Little did we know, she would sit us down with a group that had already ordered their food and the chef was just starting to cook! There were plenty of empty seats on the other grill, and not to mention, since it was only 1:15 of course there were more patrons coming in! The chef had to stop what he was doing several times to ask the waitress if she could take our orders, and help out like she's suppose to. That is not cool. Also, if it's 1:50p and you have patrons coming to your restaurant, you shouldn't have to hurry them out of the door either. I don't like being rushed through my lunch so that you can have 2 or 3 hours to clean or do whatever you do before dinner. When 2:00p rolls around, just lock the door and as patrons leave, just escort them out and lock the door as they leave. It's that simple. We do it all the time in retail. I would give Kabuto at least a 4 rating, but I would highly recommend that they work on their customer service first. Hopefully, when I see better results from other patrons on here, I'll be back.", "business_id": "P0aKJw8rb0DKLaGottHEAw", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-05-09", "type": "review"}

I thought it was odd being so full on a weeknight, but fine with the time. It seemed like they were really busy because it was hard to talk to the hostess, who seemed in a rush to get off the phone. \n\nWe arrived around 10 til 7 and were immediately seated. We were sat (very close to) a group that was already there at another grilling station.

The restaurant (including bathrooms) is ALWAYS spotlessly clean and an appropriate temperature (might feel chilly at first, until they turn that tabletop grill on). The chefs are ALWAYS humorous and entertaining. The food is ALWAYS delicious, not oily or heavy. Their house ginger dressing is unbelievable. This is what sets Nakato apart from other hibachi chains for me. \n\nThere are other things on the menu and none of it is bad but honestly just order the hibachi. Choose chicken, steak, shrimp, or a combination and enjoy! It comes with soup, salad, white or fried rice, and vegetables, enough food that you will likely have leftovers for lunch the next day, for around $22 or less per person. Lunch is cheaper, but you don't get soup (boo). \n\nIf you are celebrating a birthday or other special event they will bring you complimentary dessert for your entire table as well as taking a group photo. Back in the day this consisted of a polaroid but at some point they have upgraded to digital photos so you get a nice 5x7\" print of your entire party in a paper \"Nakato\" frame, pretty sweet.\n\nWords of caution: It can be difficult to tell if they are open during the day. There are no windows, so you have to check the electronic \"open\" sign out front because they do close briefly between lunch and dinner. More than once I have driven by and thought they were closed when they were really open because I was just judging by number of cars in the parking lot or whatever! \n\nAlso, if you are going with a group, they WILL NOT seat you until all members of your party have arrived. If you have a small party, they also WILL NOT put you at a partially-full table if the people at that table have already ordered. I asked once and got a vague explanation somewhere along the lines of \"we really want it to be a family-like shared experience/don't want the chef cooking for latecomers while other are already eating\". So if you really mind being a party of 2-3 and sitting at a table designed for 8, that might bug you.", "business_id": "1PSnPPFVfp03iPfJRPWWQw", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-04-12", "type": "review"}

You can get the same thing with steak or shrimp instead of chicken.  For dinner the same meal also comes with a few grilled shrimp regardless of what meat you order.

A hibachi chef (admittedly of varying talents) arrives with a cart of food, and he confirms your orders.\n\nMost of the hibachi chefs are pretty good.  They twirl the spatula a bit, serve the sauce, cut up some shrimp and set the table on fire (in an onion ring chimney).  Pretty fun.  The good chefs can do some pretty cool things with eggs and shrimp tails.  You wonder how they keep their fingers considering how quickly they throw their knives around, but last time I checked, they all had 10 fingers.\n\nThen they start cooking the food en masse, and I'm always impressed with how quickly they serve an entire table of 14 within 20 minutes.

The noodles are by far my favorite part of the meal, I just love them! I've had the chicken, shrimp, steak, scallops  over the years many times and they've all been delicious. Fried rice is super yummy too but is an up charge - $2 I think? (outside of lunch hours) which I think is crazy. Other places in the area don't do this and I think it's just a way for them to make an extra buck. I do pay it though bc I really like the fried rice. Unless you really want an alcoholic beverage save your $$, the beer on tap is often flat and mixed drinks are expensive and nothing that great. I'm not a huge sake fan but it's your average sake.

Despite living in the University area for almost 5 years now, I had never been to Nakato. \n\nNakato offers Teppsn Yaki (hibachi) and Sushi. My friend and I were both in the mood for sushi so we did not sit at a hibachi table. The sushi/non-hibachi section is a decent size. It has a full bar with seating and then probably about 6 table/booths with seating for 4 at each. \n\nObviously hibachi is this restaurants main selling point which is always a cause for concern when you order the sushi whether or not it will be any good. I've been to other hibachi places that also offer sushi but it seems more like an after thought and isn't that great. However the items we ordered from the sushi menu were great! \n\nOff the sushi appetizer menu I got the Hawaiian poke salad with tuna and the tuna carpaccio. I visited Hawaii last May and fell in love with poke. While it is definitely better in Hawaii this salad had a a good flavor. The tuna carpaccio was also delicious.  I also ordered a sushi roll. The rolls here aren't that special or creative - again I think it has to do with the fact that hibachi is its main attraction and the sushi is more of a secondary menu item. My friend ordered  the sashimi Omakase and the sea urchin. He was excited that they actually had the sea urchin. He told me other restaurants that list it on their menus often tell him they do not have it in stock.\n\nThe parking lot is a little strange, especially if you get brought in the back. The outside decor is pretty stark and bare for the most part. You might drive right past it. The inside is very nice and clean. While the sushi was nothing special it was fresh and delicious. If you don't want anything fancy or into sashimi and nigiri Nakato is a great option. \n\nI am glad that I finally found this gem in the University area.", "business_id": "1PSnPPFVfp03iPfJRPWWQw", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-03-27", "type": "review"}

The Gyoza could either be pan fried or deep fried. The waiter didn't ask which my husband wanted and they just brought deep fried which he thought were \"ok\". We ordered the baked mussels which were good, but my husband didn't care much for the mayo topping. \n\nNext, they brought our sashimi plate and a spider roll. The mackerel, eel, hamichi and salmon were fresh and we were quite pleased. The sashimi was the highlight of the evening. However, the spider roll was smaller than we expected.

This is the type of place where the wait staff will judge you by your potential to tip, and then ignore you if you obviously fall into the category of \"poor college student.\"  If you come here, regardless of your background, at least dress like you own money so that you'll get your drinks refilled. \n\nOn a particularly busy weekend night, I showed up with a friend and expected to wait for for a table.  Good news: we were seated immediately.  Bad news: we were seated at a teppenyaki table...when we had no intention of eating teppenyaki...and we had to share the table with a large family who we obviously did not know.  Don't get me wrong, I am not offended by cafeteria-style dining (I'm a college student, after all), but this should not be the seating arrangement at a place that presents itself as some kind of fine restaurant.  Throughout the meal, I had to whisper to my dinner companion to avoid disrupting a stranger's family dinner (awkward?).  Be careful about bringing a date here, or at least make a reservation in advance.\n\nThe food?  Blegh.  Let me be clear on this--I've tasted sushi on both the east coast and west coast, and I am in no way prejudiced against eating sushi in the Midwest.  I even think there's some decent sushi in Champaign (at other restaurants), so my standards are not impossible to meet.\n\nAgain, I've always eaten at Kamakura on busy nights, because I naively assumed that most sushi restaurants will bring out the best fish when serving crowds of customers.  Instead, I received garbage that smelled and tasted like rotting fish.  Maybe by the time they got to my order, they had to use the smelly leftovers at the bottom of the barrel?  When I got home, I tried to purge my mouth with Listerine.  Even with it's advertised \"deep-cleaning action,\" I couldn't get the taste of putrid fish out of my mouth.  I drank some coffee, chewed gum, etc., but there was no redemption from the haunting taste of old fish.  My suggestion?  Stick to the cooked dishes at Kamakura: tempura, teriyaki, udon, etc.\n\nWith so many better sushi restaurants in the area, I don't see how Kamakura hangs onto customers.  I can forgive bad service, but food that ruins your breath for an entire day is not acceptable.

What pushes Blue Fin over the top is the ownership. The little old Japanese lady who owns and runs the restaurant during lunch time is one of the absolute nicest people I've ever encountered. She welcomes every customer, and speaks to you in a genuine family like manner. She does not come across as fake or ass-kissish. I just get a calm, warm, and welcome feeling from this woman when I come in here.  It's not even just her either. Her staff always looks happy, and has run of the soda fountain, water, lemonade, etc. Everyone just seems to be happy.

Simple, sweet, and not gooey or gloopy.  \n\nOne of the owners (a wonderfully pleasant aging Japanese woman) came to my table and offered me chopsticks and hot mustard -- we had a delightful conversation wherein she explained that the chicken is hormone-free and char-grilled over pumice stones, and their sauces are home-made from family recipes.  They also offer many healthy options, including brown rice and vegetarian dishes, and NO MSG IS ADDED!!  She was a fantastic host.  \n\nEveryone seemed to be hurrying around, but they were all doing a great job keeping the customers happy by refilling drinks, delivering orders and making conversation with the people inside and outside the shop.\n\nAll in all, a great experience.

I have eaten at every single lunch food place surrounding this office at least once. My favorite is Ichi Ban.  I just can't afford it as often as I want.\n\nI have also eaten sushi at several valley locations and I return to Ichi Ban every time. Why? Becuase they make the rolls very tight. The rice is perfect and the flavor is fresh. I can't stand it when rolls are sloppy and the rice falls apart or the fish slides right off. The portions of fish per piece is just right and the flavors blend so nicely. The presentations look good, especially that Dec. 29th roll. I have never had the fish smell I've encountered in other joints. Even the octopus is fresh and the wasabi is hot. \n\nTheir tempura is perfect, the gyoza make it possible to bring my child who isn't as adventurous. I have never gotten sick there. I have frequently gotten full. I agree they are too attentive on the drink orders and seem to be in a hurry to take away your miso bowl, which is partly why they lose a star. Let a person eat!  The other reason was when I ordered my daughter some lemonade I got Endamame. I realize they may sound similar, but it was a drink order. They had good endamame though so I was ok. The third reason is that they close between late lunch and early dinner and it makes it less likely for me to go across the street to eat for dinner when I have to wait an hour.\n\nWhen I first visited the place was so dark and narrow, but I liked sitting up at the sushi bar and the owner remembers you. Well he always remembers me and even what we like and asks about my daughter when we don't bring her. I don't like their green tea ice cream, it tastes like what I expect Cyndi Lauper's lipstick might taste like. Maybe it's supposed to taste that way and I don't like anyone's green tea ice cream. I haven't tried others since that experience. I'd rather spend my money on another roll. I have tried to get my co-workers to come over, but no one I work with cares for sushi. I told them they could get a rice bowl with teriyaki chicken or something, but they pass. Maybe they don't want to go to lunch with me... hmm. \n\nMy partner told me that not all Ichi Ban's are created equal. I'm just lucky this one is so close.  I just wish I could afford more of it. I'd eat there every day.", "business_id": "oSKT5oZX1NWYaHwOWL5lag", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-05-22", "type": "review"}

Our waitress helped guide us to the meals we would like.  She also brought us the cool appetizer bread basket...banana bread, little cinnamon toasts, and rolls.

Lots of good, bad, and unusual circumstances.\n\nThe pros: Food was delicious! I ordered the chicken katsu curry with miso and salad. The chicken portions were very large, crisp, and moist. The curry sauce had some mustard in it which gave a kick of flavor, and the miso soup and salad were good compliments to the meal. Also the menu was almost too much to read over - Italian, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean were all offered as available dishes. Very impressive. (+4.5 star)\n\nThe cons: Getting the food took a long time to order. We had to ask the waiter several times how long it would take our food to get there, and one person in our group didn't have to pay for his meal because they look so long bringing out his yakitori. We'd all finished by the time he was served. Also it took a ridiculous time to get our change for food, almost waited half an hour for another friend to get his $11 change. (-3 star)\n\nFactoring out the bias: Our original group was approximately 25+ people, so much so that our smaller group had to be seated in a different room. I'm not sure how many cooks were working, but I'm sure serving 30+ hungry people put a hell of a strain on the serving and cooking staff. (+1 star)\n\nIn terms of settling the bill, there was a line of bills that were bring processed at only one cash register, so even getting money out took a long time. Also, many out-of-state credit cards from California were being rejected for simple charges, so ringing these up took a while only to have them not be processed. It wasn't the restaurant's fault - its an added security that many major credit card institutions provide so to protect from fraud. They require the card holder to contact the credit card company to confirm their identity; being a a restaurant wanting to leave after almost three hours wasn't the best place for this to happen. (+1 star)\n\nSo as long as you don't invade the restaurant with a starving army, I'm sure if you visit this place under normal conditions, the food and service will be fine.

With the works of Chagall adorning the walls right next to the iconic Japanese beckoning cat statue (aka Maneki Neko), the interior decor definitely alludes to the nature of the food served within its walls. Though firmly rooted in traditional Japanese cuisine, Cherryblossom also has select offerings from across Asia and Europe as well. I wouldn't exactly call it fusion cuisine... more like a meeting of traditions (with some exceptions, of course).\n\nAs it's name would suggest, Cherryblossom is first and foremost a noodle house. With a wide range of noodles dishes, Cherryblossom definitely does not disappoint in this category. From Japanese noodle soups to stir-fried noodles to Italian pasta, there are more than enough options to suit an array of different palettes. There's even a tofu noodle option for those trying to keep low carb or gluten-free. In addition to the many noodle dishes available, Cherryblossom also serves a wide range of other choices as well. Sushi, rice dishes, salads and assorted tempura are all on the menu to tempt your taste buds.\n\nOne of my usual go-to favorites is the Vege-Ten noodle soup. Served up in a large bowl, it's a hearty dish featuring either udon (thick wheat) or soba (thin buckwheat) noodles (I'll get either depending on my mood) in a miso soup with an assortment of vegetable tempura placed on top. Although this is usually filling enough for a complete meal unto itself (just because I'm still a big sushi lover even after going vegetarian), I'll also frequently get a vegetable roll (avocado, lettuce, cucumber, carrot, Inari tofu, and kaiware) to accompany my hearty bowl of tastiness... But no matter what you end up ordering, I doubt that you'll be going away unsatisfied.\n\nSo a small confession... While writing this, I totally got an urge to try one of Cherryblossom's desserts. And since I'm always so full from the meals that I get there, I've never had the opportunity to try one of the pretty desserts inside the glass case. So for just you (and my tummy), I swung out to get a piece of their green tea mousse cake (something that I had been admiring the last couple of times that I had been in)... Although you may think that this cake might be something akin to a typical European chocolate mousse cake, it's most definitely an Asian-style dessert. Light with delicate and subtle flavors, this cake features a thick layer of green tea mousse sandwiched between a thin base of white cake and a layer of red bean paste on top and is served with some fresh berries alongside. Like many Asian desserts, it's not what the typical American palette would consider sweet. It's actually very much like the kinds of cakes that I grew up eating from Chinatown in LA... Maybe not everybody's cup of tea, but I found it pretty good.\n\nSo long story short... If you find yourself hungry (or even just a little peckish) in the Central Phoenix area, I would highly suggest stopping into Cherryblossom Noodle Cafe. I don't think you'll be disappointed.", "business_id": "AkOruz5CrCxUmXe1p_WoRg", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-05-29", "type": "review"}

The menu had noodles from all varieties of cultures and even some rice dishes and sushi, while their decor was Italian more than anything else. Oh yeah, not to mention that their restroom was French...\n\nIt was a drizzly day in Phoenix. The storm from California was heading east so I was in a ramen mood. Although Cherry Blossom was a little out of the way from where I was staying, I still went the distance to get my fix. They had about 5 different kinds of ramen and I was about to get the Harata Ramen until I saw the word \"spicy\" next to Tan-Tan-Men. I love me some spice so I went with Tan-Tan. My appetite also pushed me to get a Tootsie Roll. My boyfriend decided to go with the Gomoku Yaki Udon. \n\nThe server brought out a complimentary salad and not too long later came our Tootsie Roll and noodle dishes. The Tootsie Roll was good, but it definitely wasn't the best quality. As for my Tan-Tan_Men, the bowl and its contents were huge. I was so excited to eat even though I knew I wouldn't finish it. As for the taste of the broth, it was spicy, even for me. I usually pride myself on being able to take on a lot of spice, but the fact that it was spicy mixed with the heat of the boiling broth made it even more intense. I even choked on it at one point, but as I kept eating it got more tolerable. It was tasty, but if I were to ever try their ramen again, I'd probably go with another one. The Gomoku Yaki Udon was very bland. It had a generous amount of seafood, but not worth getting. \n\nThe dishes may be hit or miss, but for under $7, my ramen was huge. I've been to places that give me less than half of the portion size for double the price. It wasn't the best I've had, but it was good enough to satisfy my ramen fix.

It was not the best combination to say the least. Miso?? There was hardly any miso in the soup. It was so diluted, I almost had to imagine the taste of miso. BTW, the cha-shu was like left-over and an after-thought added to the ramen. I am guessing the owner is trying to pull a fast one.  \n\n2. Agedashi Tofu. This is a freaking joke. An insult to the patron of the restaurant. Really!! How lazy can this restaurant get! Essentially a silken tofu deep fried with some dashi-based sauce. What did I get? A re-fried chinese firm tofu which was probably microwaved with a bunch of undercook or recooked vegetable tempura. The sauce? Dilluted straight from the bottle tempura sauce!\n\n3. Iced Green Tea. This one is not as bad as some other Asian fusion restaurant. They actually used a decent roasted green tea with a hint of roast barley.  Unfortunately, it is so very dilluted.

We were in love with this place.\n\nThe first time I brought him though, the waiter took our order, got our tea and coffee to us ten minutes later, then disappeared for 15 more minutes. We'd just gotten cake and tea, and the cake is pre-cut on shelves for display. There were only two other tables being served too. We thought it was a fluke and we were in no hurry, so we thought we'd try it again.\n\nSince then we frequented the place weekly/biweekly. There is only one server who promptly served us, made us feel wanted, and kept us coming back. He'd refill our drinks and was on the ball. Sadly, any other waiter/waitress at this place doesn't seem to care and will leave you with empty drinks and plates for long spans of time. They will disappear (in the back?) and not return or look at you when they finally emerge. We're pretty patient and forgiving too, hence our re-visitation so many times (2+ months, at least once a week).\n\nOur last visit the waiter didn't refill our glasses once for 25 minutes, then proceeded to sit at the sushi bar and eat dinner. He's the second best waiter there. We were asked by another waitress if we'd like refills as she brought us our check, 15 minutes after our waiter sat down to eat.\n\nLove the place like mad, but we are not going back this time. :(\nThe atmosphere is great. The food, delicious. But the employee culture is greatly lacking.\nGo only if you have a lot of time and don't mind not getting refills on your drinks (or sometimes not at all for your whole meal).", "business_id": "AkOruz5CrCxUmXe1p_WoRg", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-03-20", "type": "review"}

I'm long, long overdue to write something on Cherry Blossom, (and could have sworn I had at some point) perhaps my single favorite restaurant in the area.  In dozens of visits, determinedly working my way up and down the noodles from pan-Asian to Italian, I have never been disappointed with a meal at Cherry Blossom, with the exception of a single mackerel dish which I found not as tasty as other dishes and which also left me hungry - something never done before or since at CBNC.  \n   Last meal was Yakiniku, a \"Korean style thin sliced beef dish with vegetables served on an iron skillet.\"  Moderately spicy hot, delicious, and $11.  It's billed as a rice dish - if only the brown rice had come out before the end of the meal.  Friend Norm ordered an appetizer with his meal - which he reported was really good - if only it had come out before end of the meal - They were apologetic and didn't charge for the late arrival, but still . . . it's the kind of thing that happens frequently enough to keep me from giving that 5th star that the food itself has generally consistently deserved over the several years I've been enthusiastically dining there.\n\nOther great dishes: the thin sliced NY Steak with shitake mushroom sauce - tongue-burning sodium overload but the meat is a thing of beauty. Perhaps next time I'll try it with the sesame mustard sauce instead.  Don't think you like eel? Try theirs' - After a long ago year in China with a lot of rubbery eel and sea cukes that we referred to as \"bicycle handgrips\", I never thought I'd have a taste for eel (and I'm still not too confident about the sea cukes), but this is wonderfully prepared and absolutely delicious. Mark the Ika Yakisoba with calamari and vegetables on your list to try as well as the Korean Spicy beef and all the Asian noodle dishes. My housemate loves the Mixed Tempura dinner, though I find it a tad bland compared to my favorites.  Want something a little lighter but still filling, delicious, and out of the ordinary, try the Unagi salad with grilled freshwater eel and ginger dressing and most definitely the shrimp salad, a generous quantity of mixed greens with mango chutney  dressing on a large plate completely ringed by broiled (or fried?) shrimp with a mayonnaise dressing - It's a salad you'll want to remember to order again.  \nSkip to the Italian side of the noodle kingdom for a dozen (+1) delicious dishes ranging from the satisfying Marsala Chicken with Spinach Pasta in a rich, but not nauseatingly so, white cream sauce, to the Cajun Shrimp with Smoked Mozzarella, to a simple and also delicious Spaghetti Bolognese.  I can equally vouch for the Little Neck Clam in white wine  or marinara, among many other excellent offerings.  \n\nIt's a small restaurant, frequently with waiting line for seating on weekend evenings, but the wait has rarely been long - and it's well worth it.  Go when you have time to relax and perhaps be a little patient.  Your drink glass may be dry for a while before anyone notices, or has time to, and the service, always courteous, can otherwise be a little erratic, but the food is so worth it!.  Most entrees range from $9-12 and there's few among the extensive offerings above $14. \n\nNote that weekday lunchtime can be packed and hectic, and though the staff is literally running, it can take a while to get one's check and change.

She left with such haste while in the middle of our conversation we assumed she had pressing, urgent matters that demanded immediate attention. Nope, not the case at all! Extremely rude!\n2) QUESTIONABLE calculation of bill- CHECK YOUR TOTAL people (especially if you come for happy hour). They attempted to charge us for full price for some of the items. When pointed out incorrect calculation of total, the same lady gave us the BS excuse that since we opted for no avocado in our roll (due to food allergy), they charged us $1.50 more for IMITATION crab meat. They conveniently added this \"extra cost\" without informing us. Dishonesty at its finest, ladies and gentleman.\n3) Same lady gave us a $1.13 \"discount\" off the total bill begrudgingly. Um.. Really now.. It doesn't make any sense at all.\n\n\nFood- Definitely nothing to write home about. I've been here 5 times according to my Yelp check-ins in the last 4 years and definitely it hasn't been by my own accord but rather by friends' requests. My latest dining experience here was due to another restaurant that I wanted to dine in being closed, so we opted for this restaurant due to its proximity.\n\nAppetizers: \n- Panko shrimp: 3/5, nothing spectacular dipping sauce is Worcester-like sauce (weird)\n- Calamari: 2/5, definitely a boring choice as non-Asian restaurants can do a better job in my opinion\n- Karage chicken: 2/5, so boring as it lacks flavor and crunchiness\n- Agadeshi tofu: 1/5, not authentic at all and very bland (definitely a regretful choice)\n- Spicy gyoza hotpot: 2/5, tastes like \"Costco gyoza\" states my friend\n\n\nEntrees:\n- Hiyashi chuka: 2/5, not authentic tasting at all as my friend comments it literally tastes like ramen and sesame dressing you can buy at Asian grocery stores\n- Nabayeki udon: 2/5, broth is so unremarkable even instant udon has more flavor \n- Ramen: 2/5, broth definitely lacks complexity and depth and pork portion is pathetic\n- Rainbow roll: 2/5, questionable freshness and quality of the fish as the fish was lacking the vibrancy of colors and texture that would indicate freshness\n\n\nNote:\nThis is my first Yelp review ever. It's rather unfortunate it had to be a negative one. Yet poor service and mediocrity of food has prompted me to advise my fellow Yelpers to definitely reconsider dining at this restaurant. I feel that the quality of food and lack of taste makes this restaurant makes it a 2.5/5. However, due to poor service and dishonesty, I have given an overall rating of 1/5.\n \nOn another note:\nIf you want ramen, try Hana Japanese Eatery or Fujiya market (limited availability- check online for announcements).\n\nIf you want sushi rolls, try Sushi J, Sushi Catcher, Hiro Sushi, or Bei.\n\nIf you want nigiri sushi or sashimi, try Hiro Sushi.\n\nIf you want omakase, try Shinbay ($$$$).", "business_id": "AkOruz5CrCxUmXe1p_WoRg", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-03-12", "type": "review"}

The other thing is that it can take awhile for the sushi to get done. I have no problem with this most days as for the amount of food I and my friends orders it takes awhile to make but on occasion it can be excessive.\n\nDespite the fact that there are other all you can eats closer to me I willingly drive the 20-30min to come here on Saturdays.

Quite spicy, but not over the top....and amazing flavor sauteed into the breaded shrimp, chicken and fresh vegetables, all over white or brown rice.

My folks wanted to order sushi, so I let them, and sure enough the rolls they ordered, as well as my sashimi selections were just not very good. Everyone at the table ordered entrees and we were all very happy. The build your own noodle bowls are great.

Decided to try Piestewa Peak (or Squaw Peak depending on who you ask) but was going to meet up with a friend for lunch beforehand and we found Moto not too far away.  I got there first, a little before 11 which is when they open.  There were a couple people waiting but nothing outrageous.  I walk in and get acknowledged right away by the bartender who lets me know that someone will be right up to seat me and sure enough, as he was finishing that statement the waitress came over and took me to a table.  She also brought me water right away which always makes me happy.\n\nWhile I was waiting for my friend to show up I read over the menu and was super excited to find out that not only do they have All You Can Eat Sushi, but that it was happening RIGHT AT THAT MOMENT!!  Apparently it's on Saturdays from 11-2:30 and there's 10 different rolls you can choose from for $18.99 (there are some nigiri options too but I don't remember how many there were to choose from for those).  Once my friend showed up I quickly told him about the All You Can Eat special so then he perused the menu to see which ones he wanted.  Our waitress kind of went MIA at this point so that was a little annoying but she seemed to be the only server there so I can't fault her for that but seriously you would think that the management there would keep the place a little bit better staffed on a weekend day during an all you can eat special.\n\nOnce our waitress came by for our order my friend got the Tootsi Roll, the Vegas Roll and the Alaska Roll.  I decided that I probably didn't want to binge on sushi right before a hike so I stuck with a single Rainbow Roll.  They took a little bit of time to come out but then again sushi typically does and I'm sure everyone who was in the restaurant was ordering tons of different rolls.  I was happy with the size, the rolls were larger than most places but not so huge that you had a hard time eating a piece.  My Rainbow Roll was delicious!  All the ingredients were fresh and beautiful.  I'll admit I did share one piece of my friend's Vegas Roll (sharing is against the rules according to the menu...oops!) and it was pretty good.  Not the best Vegas Roll I've had but still good.\n\nI'll definitely be coming back here again on another Saturday when I don't plan on hiking so that I can actually partake in the All You Can Eat!", "business_id": "c0RSs2KYK5Y-ZlSrNq9LyA", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-04-01", "type": "review"}

Be warned that Saturday afternoons are busy, they offer an all you can eat sushi deal.  We were not impressed by the sushi last time we were here, so that wasn't an objective.  Instead, we had crispy fried gyozo and tacos, both shrimp and BBQ pork.  The fried dumplings were excellent, I think they were deep-fried as they were crispy all around, I'm not sure you can do that with a skillet, and I have no problem with that.  The dipping sauce was decent but not exceptional.  The tacos were great, I loved my BBQ beef and my wife liked the shrimp.  Two tacos per plate made an excellent late lunch, very good portion size to be full but not stuffed.\n\nI do have to take exception to their guacamole.  I fully understand that they're going for an Asian, not Mexican, vibe for their guac, but it needed seasoning.  I'm not sure what, but I found the flavor kind of flat.  My wife thought it had enough salt, it just needed something to kick up the flavor a little.  Also, the wonton chips for scooping it?  Their strength is not up to the weight of the guac.\n\nWe had the Mojo's for dessert, basically it's an ice cream sushi roll.  The ice cream flavor can vary day-to-day, today it was strawberry.  The two pieces that we got were an excellent cap to good food.\n\nService was not good.  We had to flag down our server for refills for our tea, for a box for the fries to take home for our poodle, for the check.  They were kinda busy, still, it's what they're paid and tipped for.\n\nAnd finally, and sadly, whatever it was that I was smelling six months ago was still there.  I'm still not sure whether it's cleaning products or sushi, but it was something that really didn't sit well with my nose.\n\nStill, we liked the food and will definitely consider them for future eats.", "business_id": "c0RSs2KYK5Y-ZlSrNq9LyA", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-05-04", "type": "review"}

Or at least we WERE excited. Having just had one of the most disappointing dining experiences of my life, I have two words for you: Steer. Clear. Especially if you're an awful human being like me.\n\nThe evening started off fine--at first. Moto's ambience is a nice combination of modern architecture adorned with traditional art, a touch of rustic in a classy nightspot. But things began to go downhill VERY quickly when I asked if they could please turn the music down. Our host, who obviously spoke English as a second language, seemed surprised by the request, so I repeated it again, slowly and condescendingly. I mean, seriously, I'm a guest in your restaurant--why would I do something like that?\n\nWe started with a round of IPAs. Because it was served in a snifter, it was far too easy for me to lose track of how many I drank on an empty stomach. It's like, \"Hello! You're supposed to be a business! Couldn't you tell immediately that alcohol would only fuel the seething, unrelated frustrations I brought in the door with me?\"\n\nThere's a diverse menu of tapas-style appetizers--too many to try in one visit! If you're anything like me, you'll want to go off-menu and demand a split order of the steamed gyoza and Moto wings, then berate the nearest server within earshot when this turns out to be something the restaurant does not offer.\n\nOn to the main course. This was maybe the biggest disappointment. Rather than pick any number of options available to me, I went item by item through different entrees, asking them to cobble together an off-menu Frankenstein of Japanese ingredients. You'd think that would be enough, but I also requested that a manager come to our table and assure us that the rice was gluten-free, even though I can eat gluten safely and regularly do.\n\nI wish I could say our Moto experience was a fluke, but honestly, it's just one in a string of totally unacceptable situations I've created lately, at everywhere from Babbo Italian Eatery to my brother's wedding.\n\nMoto might be some people's cup of tea, but if you're me?

( Is that as opposed to a box?)   I just ordered it anyway and low and behold it was not very good.   We then ordered our food.  My two friends ordered sushi.  They were just starting to eat when a server came by and asked for the soy sauce.  My friends asked if she was going to replace it, and she said no - she needed to clean it for the night.  She forced my friends to load up on the soy sauce so she could take it.  The rest of the night the staff proceeded to hound us and ask us if they could take our plates - even when we were still eating.  This was not much past 9.  I know we were running a bit late, but there were still other people in the restaurant.  And finally, we were sitting outside and one of the staff members came out and loudly cleared his sinuses and spit on ground near us.  It was just gross.  Food is good - not great.  Definitely not worth the terrible service.", "business_id": "c0RSs2KYK5Y-ZlSrNq9LyA", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-05-06", "type": "review"}

Sometime's this place can be hit or miss depending on who the chef is. I really miss the one they had on Dynamite it was alt larger but this one used to be tiny they have expanded and it's nice. Mainly we go there because we usually know atleast one person that still works there and their roll portions to me seem larger than most other places. You must order their specialty called the Surfer when I started going there ages ago it was not on their menu you had to ask for it, it is huge like aitleast 12 peices and tons of chunked up shrimp piled on top very yum! I like their octopus salad, salmon roe is always good there, and the tuna titaki has asways been a fav of mine as well. I have not been there in awhile but it's always a safe place I stop by if I am near. Its always clean from what I could see and I like their patio w the fire its cozy.

Even though this place was very busy (~12:30pm with lots of business lunch patrons), you could watch as some servers stood around not doing anything. Rolls came out at a reasonable pace but we weren't even given a small plate to eat each piece off of and had to eat over our roll plates. We were only checked on once (not by our original server) and that was because she was resting her elbow on the booth section divider and casually asked us if everything was good.

We had to flag someone down to get our check. Unacceptable level of service from start to finish.\n\nFood: You could tell how they could offer such good deals on their lunch special rolls when they overload the rolls with rice and fake crab/mayo (I have no problem with either ingredient, but they pack the rolls with it to the point where many different rolls tasted very similar because they were so dominant with the fake crab mix). Each piece was extremely large and cumbersome to eat, often falling apart before you can find a way to fit it in your mouth. The rolls weren't even in the shape of a circle, but more like a rounded triangle. The sushi chefs were either rushed, new, or incompetent.

The site where it was listed offered no reviews or information besides a few pictures and location. I decided, being the risk taker that I am, to give it a whirl. We arrived at a little hole-in-the-wall place tucked into a small strip mall. Outside we found a packed parking lot and a line at the door... on a tuesday.\n  Sakana was just opening for dinner service and despite the tuesday dinner rush(still makes me chuckle) we were seated swiftly and with choice as to where we sat. Once nestled comfortably at the sushi bar we were greeted by Ramon, not my idea of a sushi chef, but boy was i wrong. \n  Itamae doesnt quite describe the skill level Ramon was on, he was masterful, and strangely I was not put off by him at all when he engaged me in conversation(I am not a public people person). Ramon you are great at what you do!\n  Now we are at the most important part of the journey, the food, which was delicious. We ordered sever different types of sushi: Eel, Blue Fin, Egg and Octopus. Lets start with the bad first, Octopus... I personally hate it, always chewy, tough and so citrusy i cant bear it. So thats the bad, now for the good. Blue Fin melted in your mouth with the consistency of firm butter and was excellent. The Egg was great aswell, sweet with a back end of head dizzying sake(not over bearing but noticable if you dont drink.)\n  Now for my favorite part of the meal, Eel, saying that I am an eel lover is an understatment, I dream of good eel, all I can say is that I was impressed and thats the highest compliment I could ever give to eel because I've never had bad eel. Also had a crunchy eel roll that was superb.\n  My wife ordered Calimari and Ramen both of which were delicous aswell, the sauce for the calimari was my favorite part of the plate. As for the ramen, if you want good authentic ramen with a smell that will cause people to come up to you and ask you what that is that you ordered, look no further.\n  All that for under $40 WHAT?! ive paid over a hundred for far worse!\n  After years of searching I have finally found my sushi destination. Thank you Ramon for the many wonderful times you have provided us with we will be back soon!\n\nP.S. I have never left that place with out atleast one thing gratis(fish ribs were great but im too lazy to eat them...)", "business_id": "0vzZ_Bcb02rJljeMU9XkBw", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-04-26", "type": "review"}

We got there for happy hour, and obviously that means it's going to be busy, I get it. We walk up to the hostess and let her know there will be 2 of us. She responds, \"It's going to be at least 30 minutes until there's going to be a table, so...\" This is normally where said hostess would put your name on the list and tell you to have a seat, but this girl just blankly stared at us like they didn't use the crazy advanced technology known as a waiting list, which requires crazy things like a computer, or even paper and a pen. We awkwardly looked at each other for a few seconds, until I finally said, \"That's fine...can you put my name on the list?\" She actually responded, \"Oh, you want to wait?\", as if no one in their life ever waits for a meal at a restaurant. ...Darling, what is the purpose of the chairs in that little area in the front of the restaurant if not for waiting? I've never had a strong urge to eat my dinner there while people waltz in and out from dinner. She then asked us if we wanted to sit down immediately at a \"shared table\", which I thought might be something similar to the tables at Benihana - but no, it was literally a table we would have to share with two people already sitting having their dinner. Nothing says romantic date like 2 randos coming over with the hostess and sitting down to eat dinner with ya! We declined and waited however long it took, then went back to our own table.

I had high hopes, mostly because the reviews were good. However, in a nutshell, service is shoddy.\n\nI was in a group of four in total - my boyfriend, myself, and his two roommates. We arrived at a particularly busy time (7:30 PM on Sunday Night, which doesn't sound like a busy time). There was a bit of a wait as they cleaned up a booth for us - however they left some things on the floor, a napkin and some crumbs on the seat - so it wasn't really as clean as I would have liked. That's just me being critical though.\n\nAnyway, on to the actual food and service.\n\nThe menu was strange, and was pretty barren. There were only two ramen options, two udon options, and four miso soup options. Entrees were mostly tempura too. There wasn't a lot to choose from if you didn't want an appetizer or sushi. \n\nI ordered a bowl of miso, a cucumber roll, an avocado roll, and a rainbow roll. My boyfriend ordered the chicken teriyaki. One roommate ordered the udon, while the other ordered the ramen.\n\nMy miso came out first, and fairly speedily. It was absolutely delicious, although I was disappointed there wasn't any tofu - however that's silly of me considering I didn't order the tofu miso. It was delicious regardless. I loved it.\n\nThen was the waiting. The udon came out second, after around 15 or 20 minutes. Then came the chicken teriyaki, which was another 5 or so minutes - the udon was already half gone at that point.\n\nThen, ten minutes later, came the ramen. The udon was nearly gone. The chicken teriyaki would have been too, but my boyfriend was eating slowly and very little as a sort of respect thing for me, since I had been waiting for my sushi for what seemed like forever.\n\nFinally, after what felt like forever, my cucumber and avocado rolls came out. I will admit that they were to die for, although a little tiny bit salty. I don't mind saltiness though! I ate most of those before my rainbow roll came out. The rainbow roll wasn't actually that great - the crab mix inside tasted too sweet, and they used way too much.\n\nThe rolls themselves were fairly big and hefty, and I got full from the cucumber and avocado, and half the rainbow roll. I was really pleased with the first two, but that rainbow roll was a little \"bleh.\" I was actually really surprised at how the avocado tasted - it was firm, creamy, cool and very, very yummy.\n\nThroughout the night, there was in total of 4 waitresses waiting on us. It was very busy, which I completely understand, but I would have expected food to come out together rather than all separate. I had also heard complaints from my group on how dim the lighting was. \"We aren't vampires\" was a good comment.\n\nAll in all, the food itself was very good (aside from that crab salad filling, but it might be good for other people), but the service was spotty and spread out, and it was noisy, busy, dim and not as clean as I would have liked. Me and my boyfriend's check came out to be around $40, which sounds a little steep to me, but drinks weren't included.\n\nI don't recommend this place, and I don't plan on going back, but I do commend them for their cucumber rolls.", "business_id": "0vzZ_Bcb02rJljeMU9XkBw", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-03-09", "type": "review"}

I made sure to make reservations for the teppanyaki because it was on a Saturday and I didn't want to wait very long.  However, when we got there, we were seated right away.  Never having had sushi before I relied on my friend that we do our monthly dinners with, to help me pick out something that I would like.  There are so many sushi rolls to choose from, it was very hard to make a choice for just one or two.  Considering that I was still going to have something from the teppan grill I hoped I chose wisely.  \n\nMy friend ordered 2 of the spicy/hot sushi rolls, I had the Alaskan and Philadelphia rolls, along with the chicken from the teppan.  My daughter and her friend had the chicken as well.  We also ordered spring rolls for my daughter since she really didn't want sushi.  Of course, we made her try it; but her opinion doesn't matter in this review, lol, since she rarely likes anything.  Suffice it to say, that although she thought it was okay, she will never go to out for sushi.  As for my friend, he thought his sushi was excellent; it had a nice bite to it, and the heat was just right.  My sushi was actually quite good, considering I hate fish.  I couldn't taste the salmon (which is a good thing) in the Philadelphia roll and the cream cheese was a little on the heavy side, but still quite tasty.  The tuna was yummy; normally a hater of canned tuna, this is NOTHING like that swill.  \n\nNow here's where the 3 stars come in.  I wasn't impressed with our teppan chef.  He did his utensil tricks while the grill got hot and the oil heated up, but other than that, I wasn't impressed.  The fried rice was great (for an added $3 you can get rice and veggies with the chicken); the veggies were great, but the chicken was not only bland but dry.  \n\nI've read in other reviews how the service was slow; that was not the case for us.  Granted, we were not on the sushi side, and we were there at 5 when it was basically bare (when we left though, there was a line waiting to be seated).  I would say, give the place a try.  I had a great time with my daughter and friend, and it was fun trying something new, that tasted nothing like I expected it to.  The atmosphere is the same as any restaurant you find in a strip mall, but don't let that deter you.  I do believe if I go there again, I will just order off the menu and not get teppan.  I'll definitely try more sushi though.\n\n**Side note: in order to get a chef for the teppan grill, you must order 2 items from the teppan menu.  I believe it starts at $11.99 just for the meat/seafood.", "business_id": "0vzZ_Bcb02rJljeMU9XkBw", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-03-18", "type": "review"}

My family has been eating here for well over 10 years. I have lucky-cat polaroids from almost every birthday. Plus, I can't even begin to guess the number of out-of-towners I've brought in or locals I've referred here. Sadly, since about ten months ago, I have had something negative occur with EVERY visit. This is not an exaggeration. In the 6-8 times I've gone in or ordered out in the past 10 months I have NOT ONCE been satisfied with my experience. Whether it was forgetting soy sauce and chopsticks in the to-go bag, messing up the order, or--my personal favorite--FORGETTING TO EVEN PUT MY ORDER IN until I arrived to pick it up, I've been consistently more irritated with the \"service\". To top it off, no one ever seems concerned when I ask for things to be fixed. Today my handroll was made incorrectly even though I repeated my order several times over the phone and the waitress REPEATED IT BACK to me. The best part was, when I drove back to have it remade no one apologized for the inconvenience, and I even saw the sushi chef chuckle and roll his eyes over the request. Rude and unprofessional. Then, the new roll sat on the bar for way too long before the waitress brought it back to me, letting the rest of my order get warm in the car. Even now as I write this and eat, I'm noticing that my salad lettuce is turning BROWN. Pretty gross. It breaks my heart that after so many loyal years I'm going to have to look for a new sushi joint.

I don't know what magical ingredients or witchcraft Ra uses to make that sauce, but it is off the chain delicious.

Of course I said yes because why would i pay if i wasn't enjoying the food and she offered so why not. but as soon as i said yes she abruptly picked up my plate of food that i was still eating, i mean the chopsticks were still in my hand hovering over the plate, then walked off. Everyone at my table looked at each other in shock. WTF? seriously? when she came back I asked if she was coming back with the food and she said no because i wanted it off the bill she took it, but she never explained to me or asked me if it was ok to take the plate that i was still eating off of. She was so rude about it. So finally i just decided to have them remake the food and it was ok. But after that experience I don't think I could ever go back.

I believe she also stole my husband's chinese donut and loved it too. \n\nBy the way, this 5-star rating may just be the first one I've handed out to date so congrats to you Hong Kong Gourmet! And thank you for the awesome food!!!", "business_id": "-Ogv7rpcgUHkFaSy3vD8Sw", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-03-28", "type": "review"}

Yelp pointed us in the direction of this restaurant, much to our delight. I could definitely see what people meant about it being hot in summer, as it was a tad warm when we visited in March! (About 80 degrees) The decor is very simple, if a tiny bit dated. It felt like walking into my grandma's house, with its bamboo mat covered walls and rice paper wall furnishings. That's probably the best way to describe the overall experience: homey. \n\nThe menu was not fancy by any means, but had a large assortment of rice dishes, and one could either order the entree by itself, or, for a few sheckles more, turn it into a combination plate with white rice, miso soup, a salad, a piece of gyoza, and a chicken skewer. They also had noodle dishes (hot and cold, though cold is only served in the summer), and a few, select styles of really simple sushi (not Westernized!) like shrimp tempura and tuna. They do have a note that in the summer months, they do not make sushi for carry out (taking the Arizona heat into consideration) so that it won't spoil.\n\nMy whole group ordered from the entree+rice menu and all got the combos. We also ordered hot tea (excellent), honey lemonade (refreshing), and a Coke (syrup and carbonated water seemed slightly out of balance). \n\nI had unagi-don (eel), my brother ordered katsu-don (chicken fried in egg) and my friend had teriyaki beef. All were cooked well and were tasty. I think the only thing I wasn't crazy about was the salad, which was very vinegary and had onions (blech).\n\nThe only server there was, I assume, the owner, who other people have mentioned.

This isn't any yuppie's vision of Japanese cuisine located in a cookie-cutter strip mall next to a Rubio's Fresh Mexican grill; this place was cut directly out of the landscape of Shinjuku-ku, circa 1985, and pasted in a rather unfortunate part of Mesa.\n\nSome people might gripe or balk on the atmosphere, but I say it really adds to the experience. My server, I'm guessing the daughter of the owners, was very courteous and I found the inattention by the mother and father and the mother's talking on the phone to a relative in Japanese quaint.\n\nSO YEAH, THE FOOD. It was great. I had an unagi (eel) roll with some kind of egg/chicken entree. Everything was tasty, and the fact the lights were off (presumably to save money) and everything around me was in Japanese made my white arse feel like Steven Seagal being a badass eating udon or whatever in silence in one of his 80s flicks.\n\nAnyway, this isn't the place to go if you're looking for an upbeat atmosphere with tons of people and all that. I was the only customer, and there isn't a TV or anything. I guess I'd say bring reading material if you're eating alone. \n\nThe only con I have is that they don't serve alcohol. I'm not a fan of sake, but this place is perfect for it. I really wanted to have a Kirin in a \"real\" Japanese place, but oh well.

Not just sushi, but different types of ramen and udon, as well as bento boxes. I think this is my place to go in the valley! \n\nI really wish Yelp would let you give half stars. There are places that are better than 3 stars, but aren't quite at a 4 star level... that's where I'd put Nagasaki Grill Toh Zan. \n\nMy partner and I took our kids, which is always an experience because they generally don't like anything that isn't processed and full of sugar and crap. It's always a crap shoot when we take them out to eat. We lucked out!\n\nThe place totally looks closed from the outside, but inside it's clean, albeit a little plain Jane. I'm thinking that they didn't put a lot of money into remodeling the place, but it's ok. We sat in a small booth, while a larger group came in and took up a big table by the wall. \n\nThe gentleman sat us, handed us menus and suggested that we hurry up and order before the group did, so we weren't sitting around waiting for their orders to be completed. When it comes to bedside manner, no, he wasn't the sweetest, softest guy around, but considering it's only him and his wife running the place I could cut him some slack. Besides, having lived in Asia most of my life, i'm used to the more brusque manner. It didn't bother me, especially if the food was good. \n\nThe boys both ordered ramen; one got the miso broth, the other got a different broth (I don't remember which). I got the Ka-ri (curry) udon, and my partner got the teriaki chicken don. All the noodles came with inari sushi, which the boys loved... go figure! Decent sized bowls, piping hot, fresh. I think both of them were lifting the bowls up to make sure they got every last bit of broth. My curry udon was great, flavourful and filling. My biggest issue with it is that it really had no protein in it. I would love it if they could do a seafood curry udon, which is my go-to when I'm in Tucson. I would pay a few bucks more for a larger bowl, with a protein of some sort. \n\nMy partner's teriyaki chicken was ok, but not the best I've had. The potstickers that came with it were excellent, however. The chicken was a little dry and the sauce was a little sweet for my taste. But I'm not writing the bento boxes off completely. I plan on going back and trying some of the others, including the Unagi bento. \n\nThe honey lemonade was just sweet enough and refreshing, but the highlight as far as the drinks go were the strawberry boba milk tea. Soooo good! It was like actual strawberry puree in smoothie form, poured over ice and topped with milk. A little unconventional as far as boba teas go, but it was so incredibly yummy! \n\nSo, in a nutshell, I'll be going back, especially since the boys really liked it, and that's a huge plus. There were a few missteps, but honestly, for a restaurant that has a staff of 2, you can't always expect perfection. It's obvious that they put their blood, sweat and tears into this venture, and I'm happy to support a local business like this.", "business_id": "BBPkwpj9kSeDuy0uOwWHJA", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-03-25", "type": "review"}

I recommend his udon, dipped in the perfection, with sprinkles of seaweed and scallions. His green tea is actually matcha which is ceromony grade Japanese tea. For the last ten years he has brought us a quality from Japan no one else can compare. He is even the featured culinary contributor to the Masturi (spring festival).

I have tried many of their menu items  (except for really spicy ones, but they are awesome about adjusting the heat if you just ask) and have never had a complaint. Love their beef and shrimp yakisoba, as well as teriyaki items. Crab Angels always in our order, and the Gyoza is nicely done, too. Their sushi selection is basic, but tasty, prepared to order and always packaged separately; I like the care and concern given each time. You will never go hungry with an order of anything from Yoko!!! My only caution would be that white rice comes with everything, unless you specify none.

I was a bit disappointed then I took a bite.  It totally made up for it the baked Halibut and crab and avocado exploded goodness in my mouth and I was happy this was my finale.  \n\nSo overall it's not bad but totally not in my top 5 best sushi places in Phoenix and surrounding areas.

We went here on the recommendations we got from Mesa Yelpers who said that it was one of the best sushi joints in Mesa...\n\nWe were in town to visit with our daughter.  She had wanted to go to a sushi restaurant but didn't know where to go.  Thanks to fellow Yelpers we got some suggestions.  We chose Sekai out of all the suggestions for two reasons: 1) It gets good reviews here; and 2) For us anyway, it was very easy to find and to get to.\n\nWe went on a weekday about 5:30 p.m. and when we got there, we were the only customers.  We were warmly greeted and the service was excellent---very attentive!  The waitress brought training chopsticks to the table for the preschoolers and even suggested a dish for them for dinner.  She suggested chicken donburi and split an order between the two.  The kids liked their meal and loved using the training chopsticks.\n\nMy daughter and I ordered the deluxe sushi dinner.  My husband, who loves tuna sushi, was very disappointed to see that there was no tuna sushi/sashimi dinner.  The only way to get an all-tuna meal was to order a la carte.  In fact, we only saw 4 sushi dinners on the entire menu!\n\nSo..my husband ordered the tempura dinner and my son-in-law ordered chicken teriyaki.  The tempura was well cooked and came with a side dish that looked like cole slaw but had a sesame oil flavor to it.  The chicken teriyaki looked nothing like teriyaki.  Chicken teriyaki normally comes as a chicken breast that is grilled and cut into strips.  At Sekai, it was small chunks of chicken coated in a thin sauce.\n\nAs for the sushi --- it was okay --- not the worst I ever had but far from the best.  I rate it better than the sushi found in all you can eat buffets such as Todai and I rate it better than downscale supermarket sushi.  That said, I have had far better quality sushi elsewhere.  The deluxe sushi dinner came with 4 tuna rolls which were very wide pieces with tuna that was *meh* both in taste and quality.  Also included in the dinner---some nigiri pieces---shrimp, fake crabmeat, clam and eel.  Of all the pieces, I rate the clam to be the most interesting as I never had it before.\n\nSo...in conclusion...I was impressed with the friendly and attentive service.  In fact, I did notice that as the place got busier, many of the customers were regulars who were warmly greeted by the staff.  That, IMO, is one of the best ways to build a loyal customer base.\n\nAs for the sushi...perhaps it is as good as it gets in Mesa---that's why I was torn as to how many stars to give my review.

As a young student, this place fits my wallet and my appetite.\nNow, their other food really is quite good and also affordable, but I don't know for the price sushi just tempts me more.

It's been on the map for as long as I can remember and it's been the same icky, weird staff and \"just okay\" Japanese food for just as long. \n\nIn any case, it makes a compelling case as as nicer than average restaurant. It's a large building and has all the hallmarks of a great Japanese eatery. Sushi bar, live seafood you can choose yourself, and management that hires native Japanese to serve you.

I took my girlfriend of a year as a treat for both of us. Why did I go here? You ask a good question and I have no acceptable answer other than I may have subconsiously wanted to break it off with Sandie (I now have nick-named her \"The Sand Demon\" - say it out loud. It makes sense... seriously. Sand Demon... Sandie... but I digress) and this was a perfect way to do it. \n\nThe food was once again quite bad and to add insult to injury, after delivering our food our waiter began his assault. \n\nUpon finding out I speak fluent Japanese, he switched entirely over to speaking Japanese. Leaving me to translate everything into English for the Sand Demon. As if that weren't bad enough, he began asking me if she was \"a dirty girl\" because she sure looked like one to him. \n\nI couldn't believe what he was asking me and definitely wasn't going to translate it for Sand Demon, but just in case I misunderstood him, I asked him to explain what he meant. He went on about how she had a nice rack and long legs and that she just looks like a good time in the sack. \n\nSome people might view this as a compliment in some way, but I usually don't have kind words for a guy who tells me my girlfriend looks whorish and a good lay. I told him in my most polite Japanese that he'd never get the chance to find out since he most likely couldn't get laid in a brothel and we left. \n\nAt the time it wasn't funny, but it's pretty funny now. Sure, he was being rude but in retrospect she was kind of a whore.

After I found out My niece's Birthday dinner was going to be here I checked it out with the Yelpers and found a lot of disappointing to downright awful reviews about this little corner strip mall Japanese restaurant. \nI hemmed and hawed a lot! I must say it was not half bad. We had the Teppanyaki which, it appears, most reviewers did not experience. \nTo begin with, there were 9 of us filling up our Teppan table to the max. The room was clean with some typical Asian style decor strewn about. \nIt was 5pm and the dining room was quiet still. A very nice woman took our drink order. She was very friendly and recognized my brother and a couple of other diners from our group. That was very nice of her. She made small chat with them and made them feel welcome. Very cool. She admitted that she did not make very good margaritas and just left it at that. She did not offer, really, that someone else could make them. Not so cool. I mean my grandma wanted to get her margarita on and she just said, \"Margarita-very-I make.\" Luckily for Grams, the other woman who brought my iced tea and my brother's Kieran's said she made excellent Margaritas. \nThe menu was a little challenging for Grandma and I. Neither of us had done Teppanyaki before. With help we made our choices. I had safe terriyaki chicken and she ordered chow mien. The rest of the group ordered more adventurous fare even some sushi rolls. The edamame was very nice. My iced tea was refilled in a timely manner. \nthe restaurant quickly became busy. Our dinner arrived promptly as well beginning with the soup. It definitely needed spicing up. Not my favorite. The salad came next, and while it looked like a cafeteria salad with it's iceberg lettuce and faux wood bowl, it was very flavorful. This was solely due to the powerful ginger dressing making even iceberg lettuce delicious. \nThen the real fun began. Our Teppan chef was great! he showed amazing skill and organization combined with artistry and showmanship. It was his flair and the taste of his works that truly made this dinner memorable- oh yeah then my grandma said, \"You need to lose some weight! You're getting FAT!\" I will not soon forget that! \nThanks Grandma, have another Margie! \nOverall, Ninja was unexpectedly good. The service was genuine and friendly. The prices seemed fair and the Teppan show was truly amazing.", "business_id": "5vgmIwBB48fwo_WC8vGiXA", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-04-04", "type": "review"}

After reading Yelp with some mixed reviews, I went on and bought a Groupon $25 for $50 deal and thought it was a good deal. It was my bf and I first time at Ninja's. The place was empty, we were greeted by a very sweet waitress. The first thing I noticed was the chefs. I thought, well it's ok, not all Sushi restaurants have to have Japanese chefs to make it good. Does that make me a Sushi snob? : / The first thing our waitress ask if we have a Groupon. Why? Does that matter, I thought. I said yes and she gave us the menu. We look at it but nothing sounds appetizing. Is it a different menu cause we have a Groupon? We decided to order a lot just in case... I think I've ordered about 10 rolls, sushi, and sashimi, But when our food arrived, it didn't seem enough. Our waiter didn't tell us what was on the first plate. Then the second round, he just drop it off on our table and we have no idea what we'd got. The rolls were just medico, nothing fancy or tasty. I thought they were all bland. Felt like the foods were made from Sushi 101 cookbook. My bf loves sushi and can sit forever eating them, but by the third plate, he said he was done and wanted to get the rest home. I was very surprised when the bill came, it was over $100 without drinks. I gave our waiter our Groupon and it came down to $65. I felt like we were gypped cause I don't think we recieved all the food we've ordered. I look at the order sheet and some wasn't cross off. And we weren't even stuffed ( it doesn't take a lot for me ) Also, we have very little leftover. I would have check with our waiter but my bf didn't care for the rest of the food. He didn't enjoy them anyway. So when I thought about it all, I spent way more than I wanted too, just to try a new place and leftover I don't think neither of us would eat again. This is one reason why my bf don't like to sway away from our favorite place. With that, the amount  we spent we could have gone to our favorite place twice, that's what he said! :)\nNeedless to say, I won't be coming back.

If you live around Chandler/Mesa area, you know how hard it is to find a descent sushi place unlike areas around north Scottsdale.  \n\nWe ordered few appetizers, multiple sushi and few rolls.  The appetizers and the sushi were pretty good for the most part.  But I do have to mention that the rice for one of the sushi was horrifying.  I've never had rice fall apart on me when I tried to pick it up.  It was soggy and all I could taste was sugar.  Honestly, I'm amazed that the rice kept its nigiri shape on the plate.  I don't know what happened on that particular sushi but yeah, that was unappetizing.  The rolls were ok but nothing special at all.  The portions were tiny and the flavor was barely there.  \n\nSo, from our point of view, this restaurant is pretty much on the same level as Kabuki in Old Town Pasadena, CA with an authentic Japanese sushi restaurant feel b/c of the presence of Japanese staff and the decor.  That being said, it was really interesting to us because usually, a non-authentic sushi restaurants try to cover their lack of skill by serving pretty good rolls (which is basically an Americanized sushi.)

I am certainly not a sushi or Japanese food expert but I thought that the descriptions of their rolls sounded kind of boring and unoriginal. So, I went with the sushi sampler instead which is 8 pieces of nigiri and a plain tuna roll for $19. Clearly not exciting stuff but it ended up that I loved all of it! The strength of this place definitely is the freshness of their fish. All of it tasted like the very highest quality. One of them was a fish I had never tried before (already forgot the name, ugh) and I really loved, one was mackerel which I usually can't stand but this one was very mild and tasty, and once was octopus which was the best I have ever had.\n\nAnother plus was that they do offer many other Japanese entrees besides sushi so the hubby was able to get some teriyaki spare ribs and that put a big smile on his face. Their prices were a little higher than our favorite sushi place but still reasonable. The service was good but nothing out of the ordinary. The ambiance was not as nice as I was expecting but again that was based on the rave reviews... really for a mom and pop joint in a suburban shopping strip it is pretty nice. I was a little surprised at how small it was - this is for sure a date night place, it wouldn't really work for a big group or family meal.\n\nSo, even though it probably won't replace Mido as our go-to sushi place (seriously they are so cheap!)  I would definitely return to Shimogamo just for the quality of the fish. If you like sashimi or nigiri this is the place for you. If you prefer places like Ra with all the crazy rolls with a bunch of stuff in them and sauces drizzled on them or ayce type sushi places then this may not be your best bet.", "business_id": "un3KC2gyMrSG6yqjVRctXg", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-04-23", "type": "review"}

So.. pretty legit. \n\nOn the way out, Yoshi told my friend, \"Your life is wrong!\" then burst into laughter. This was hilarious to me.

Spicy garlic brown sauce and beef with mushrooms? Heaven.  Simple and delicious.\n\nAnd I haven't even mentioned their coup de grace yet.

The fish is flown in several times per week.  I'm a little bummed when I read negative reviews on Saki and his staff and their food. I guess I just feel a bit protective since I love these guys and their food. That being said, I suppose your experience really depends on what you prefer and what you order. I have a set of rolls and sashimi that I get almost every time and they are huge winners for my guests (this being my go to place for my AZ visitors).  If you order these items and you think they are no good then I suppose you and I are just at an impasse... But to each his own. But trust me. If you can only eat a few items then go with the Poke Tune and the Primo roll. \n\nHere they are:\n\nPoke Tuna 5 ( it's rated 1-10 in spice. Most of my friends like mild so I go for a 5. I get this as the appetizer. I crave it daily. So so so good)\nSumo\nTucson\nPretty in pink (kinda of a dessert roll. We usually eat it last)\nPrimo (favorite. This turns out to be everyone's favorite. Order 2)\nGreen apple (next favorite. no wasabi)\nPhoenix suns\nSunkist (very citrusy. If you don't like Lemmon zest you won't like this) \nHawaii 5-0 (one if my best friends helped saki name this one. It's great and has a nice mango Hawaiian flare).\n\nI don't like wasabi sauce so i have Saki hold it from all the rolls. \n\nI brought in a Russian the other day who worked in Tokyo for a while. She was blown away in how good it was and she remarked that it was the best she ever tasted... Albeit it's not exactly the same type of sushi... We Americans tend to prefer slightly Americanized Japanese food. \n\nMy biggest gripe with sushi at other places is the fish smells like... Well... Fish. A good sushi place should NEVER smell like fish. Fresh sushi fish should smell mild and fresh. Also, OLD fish will often have a iridescence cast to it in certain lights. Let these two things be a benchmark for your sushi eating. Saki uses very fresh fish... Perhaps the most fresh you can have in AZ.", "business_id": "Er20nsiOS6TFHmAE717iTA", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-05-27", "type": "review"}

First time a restaurant didn't want to make me food. I ordered the calamari and I think they made it in the microwave! I sent it back wanted to get sushi instead and the chef told me no I can't just try food and send back. Because I sent that back wouldn't make me anything else.  I'm not a person that just sends food back trying to get free food.  They were just rude to me and my husband. We will NEVER go back!!

Chef Danny and co are super creative with some of their rolls and offerings and always personable. I think they like talking about sushi as much as they like making it! They could easily expand and reach more but stay true to their roots. \n\nThe Primo roll is easily one of my fan favorites. Sushi snobs won't like the plethora of sauce and lack of serious spice but it's the perfect roll for those who enjoy a new bit of flavor in every bite!\n\nAmazingly fresh and well prepared sushi is what you'll always find here. Budget time on the weekends and during peak eating times as they're sure to have a small wait unless you come towards the end of the night.", "business_id": "Er20nsiOS6TFHmAE717iTA", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-03-05", "type": "review"}
