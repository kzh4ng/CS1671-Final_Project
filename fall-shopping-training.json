The consultant brought back whatever she felt like grabbing - some fit the description, but most did not.  If I asked who the designer was, she didn't know and didn't look.

At one point, our consultant stood between my daughter and me and told her to ignore what I thought (and I was NOT being negative) and tell her if that was her dress.  When my daughter said she wanted to go back to another store and re-try a dress, she pushed her into buying the one she had on.  I finally told her to change clothes - we actually had a lighting appointment scheduled - and because I was not going to write a check to that store that day or any other day for that matter.  My daughter did get her dress - at the other store where they treated us like we were special - like we were doing them a favor rather than the way we were treated here.  From the time we walked in, theconsultant at BB made us feel like we were a nuisance.  Think twice people before going here.\n\nUPDATE:  I received a very much appreciated phone call from the owner today.  She was upset by the way we were treated and apologized profusely for our experience.  While there's nothing that can be done to change what happened to us, she did speak to the consultant and hopefully, it won't happen to another family.

There's nothing overly positive or negative that stands out about it. I really feel that this store could really step up their game in some areas to become something really stellar.\n\nFirst, I love the massive open play space at the back of the store and frequent CCG, roleplaying, miniature, and board game events. It's a great way to pull the gaming community together. Along the same line, this particular store does not suffer from \"basement gamer smell.\" I am pleasant surprised that the store has a neutral scent, despite the masses of people that hang around the store for the open play space.\n\nThe miniature and CCG selection seems to be full of anything you would really need, but the board game front needs some work. The selection sits between Target and a well stocked game store. Many of the demanded new releases are not in and many box covers are faded from sitting in the sun. I love supporting friendly local game stores (FLGS), but I find it hard to support this one because there isn't much on the shelf that I want to buy. I already own everything on the shelf or I'm disinterested. It would be great to see more stock options and  new releases. Additionally, carrying component upgrades for board games would be a welcome introduction.\n\nIt appears that all of the prices here are MSRP, which is fairly expected for a game store. Unfortunately, they do not have a loyalty program for customers. While I LOVE supporting FLGS the lack of loyalty program makes it a difficult choice for me to either spend significantly more money compared to Amazon or Cool Stuff Inc or to support local business. For example, Terra Mystica is $51.99 on Amazon, but the store is selling at the full price of $80. I really want to support you, Misty Mountain, but you make it so hard with these massive price differences and no loyalty program. If you do have a loyalty program not a single employee has told me about it after multiple purchases.", "business_id": "u5p8rf79qxDkXX129qZInQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-11-11", "type": "review"}

Living in a vintage building and flush with cash, I felt it was the best prospect for furnishing my apartment. \n\nHowever after spending a few minutes in the store I felt cold, alienated and stupid,\nFor starters I was never greeted, my presence acknowledged, or even asked how my day was. The store was empty upon my arrival, and it was not until I dared to touch an item that my presence was acknowledged....albeit with a condescending and rude outburst by the stores owner. \n\nI thought the furniture was vintage and original....apparently they refinish and refurbish furniture and pass it off as found vintage. I was told by the owner that most of e furniture was recently shellacked....and was not in display condition. \n\nI also had the unfortunate experience of asking the staff about several pieces I was interested in. Between eye rolls and deep sighs I was told of the inaccuracies in my question, yet never told if I could purchase the items or not. After being deemed too dumb to engage in a conversation by the woman minding the store I was handed over to the stores owner with a sigh, an eye roll, and a rather condescending \"do you want to handle this?\". The stores owner than continued to alienate and insult me, making me feel dumb and rather small. \n\nIt seems as though the storefront is a showroom for their online sales, as most items are not for sale...and anything that is worthwhile is plastered with \"do not touch\" signage. Very unhospitable for a furniture store, as I usually like to sit in something before I purchase it. \n\nI'm not going to even go into the prices, which seem as alienated from reality as the stores owner or his assistant; two ageing hipsters locked in a battle for who could be snootier or more pretentious. \n\nAside from the nasty staff, the lack of  hospitality and the god-awfull smell inside the store I would say the store was acceptable. \n\nI'm sure this store will survive, as most online customers probably don't know that they are getting refurbished furniture stored in a putrid cat-urine smelling environment and sold by condescending belittling better-than-thou hipsters. \n\n......avoid this store, check out the wonderful vintage stores elsewhere in town.", "business_id": "xWcTt1L4vQC_QkPfPBVlCw", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-10-24", "type": "review"}

Sometimes when you see that thing that you just gotta have, but cannot really afford it?  Well, you better bite, because it may not be there the next time.  Prices are great, but you have to buy in bulk.  This is okay for things that will keep, but stuff like bread and pastries- you better really like because you are either gonna get tired of them or they spoil.

We had specifics and yes our taste comes into play which is why I was hesitant about going to Copenhagen. I really had in mind that Copenhagen was going to be overly priced and way too modern for my taste.  I was wrong.  It definitely is modern but they offer pieces that have a great balance with modern and semi traditional.  Their leather choices are fantastic from color to grade.  On top of that, the service was phenomenal.  The sales people were not pushy at all and when we were ready to work with someone she was extremely knowledgeable and patient with all our questions and concerns.  I would most certainly recommend this place for their selection, service and quality.  One warning:  some pieces can take up to 4 months to get!  UGH!

I've collected coins since I was 8 years old and had a pretty good idea of what the market would be for this particular collection.  After a quick phone call to C&C to determine their level of interest, I was invited to the shop to let them examine my coins and price them out.  We set up a time and day that was mutually acceptable.  The shop was closed on this day of the week to allow staff to work up their inventory and other duties, so we had complete privacy during the transaction\n\nI dealt mostly with one of the owners, Ken Moon.  Ken was very open about pricing and grading and we had a pleasant morning discussing a broad range of topics, some of which was actually about the value of the collection I was wanting to sell.  Subject to examining the sets, Ken made me an offer that I felt was more than fair, and we closed the deal on a handshake.  They examined the items, confirmed grading, and there was no backtracking on price. He cut me a check and the transaction was concluded.  Simple as that.\n\nTo be honest, when I walked into the shop, I expected the usual \"beat down\" on price that dealers usually try to get the price down.  That didn't happen.  Ken showed me the spot prices, made adjustments for the numismatic value, and quoted me an offering price.  It was fair and there was no haggling.  \n\nI highly recommend C&C Coin and Stamp.  I don't usually bother to write up these kind of reviews.  But due to the high level of professionalism and unexpected transparency of the process, I wanted others to know they can deal with these guys in confidence.  \n\nDoug L\n11-19-15", "business_id": "_yPLHvbeRcFazrUusCNHKA", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-11-19", "type": "review"}

We were greeted immediately upon entrance and helped by Monique Perez (who I actually saw mentioned in an earlier comment as Vania - both names are on her card). Monique was, for lack of better words, AMAZING! She was personable, knowledgeable, and very helpful every step of the way. She explained to me all of my options, gave me breakdowns of prices, and suggested the best steps for me to take to get the best deal on my upgrade. They were out of the GB size phone I wanted, so she gave me her card and told me to call her the next day and she would check for any shipments that came in. I followed her instructions and was happy to hear that the store did receive stock the very next day. Monique informed me she would be working that evening - so I stopped back in again.\nShe was warm and friendly from the very beginning until the very end, even staying with me past closing time to finish everything and walked me out the door.\nI was very impressed by her professionalism and patience with my account and questions (as I mentioned, I am still a skeptic, so I threw a lot of questions her way!).\nNot only would I recommend this Sprint location - but I give my absolute highest recommendation for Monique!!! \nThank you, Monique, for easing my nerves and making my experience painless, fun, and rewarding!!!", "business_id": "N6ff0yyo9Cv_7XPz-YDoow", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-10-22", "type": "review"}
