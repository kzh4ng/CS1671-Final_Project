I was seated right away, no wait. Was given a good beer selection of some PA Craft beers. Ordered the traditional deep dish pizza, but with no onions. Now after we ordered, it just went downhill from there. Was never asked if I wanted another beer, the waitress just gave me more water. My pizza still had onions in it. Which I stated right off the bat, that I didn't blame the girl who took my order. I know cooks can't read. I was one for many years. Mistakes happen, and the manger took care of it and took the item off my bill. NO complaints, still ate the food and it was good. Just not a fan of onions on my pizza. \n\nNow onto the bill, the server continues to tell me that she was sorry for the mistake and declares she told the cooks not to add onions. I already said it was taking care of and there's no worries. She goes on to say that the next day was her birthday, and if I felt like leaving all my money as a tip, it wouldn't go unnoticed. I took this as a joke as I had told her earlier I worked in the industry. When I hand over the gift card I had on hand, she comes back and again repeats herself, tells me that cash as a tip is preferred as she doesn't have to claim it at the end of the night. And again if I felt like leaving her all my money, she would just be so freaking happy. Let me explain one thing and hopefully I am very clear on it. No server, and I mean NO server anywhere, should ever ask a guest or customer for a tip, yet alone, do it twice! So out of kindness, which I shouldn't have left anything by this point. I left a nice tip for the cost of what food I did  have to pay for.\n\nBottom line, the food was good for the price, but the service from this one person as I don't know how the rest of the servers are.

Dining here brought back memories of an excellent meal I enjoyed in Chicago last month at Uno subsidiary, Pizzeria Due.\n\nThe restaurant is attractive and comfortable, and the outdoor seating by the river a delight.  The tables outside, though, are too close and if all are occupied, one can hear every word of what is said at neighboring tables.\n\nThe spinach and chicken pizza, appetizers of zucchini chips and spinach and artichoke dip were all delicious, but the zucchini was extremely salty.\n\nOur server was pleasant and attentive, performing many quality checks.  $20.99 is a lot to pay for a pizza, but the deep dish pies are hearty and plenty for two people. $7.75 for a small glass of house wine is excessive.  The $4.99 tariff for the single serving appetizers was fair for the quality and the portion sizes.\n\nThe weak link was the young lady who seated us.  She was glum, unfriendly, and without a smile.  Instead of saying \"Enjoy your meal\" when seating customers, she says, \"There you are.\"  How a customer is greeted can set the tone for a meal and this is an important facet of the front of the house operation. At The Cheesecake Factory, the host staff is trained to engage the customer in pleasant conversation while leading the guest to the table. The individual at Uno got us off to a poor start.

Additionally there are phrases like; side action, and a hoagie you can't refuse. While the menu is good, it isn't the star of the show. My experience with Wiseguys is that their food is a GREAT meal for a GREAT price. Their salads A#1, their wings not too greasy, fatty, OR dry. To quote my friend Goldilocks,  these wings are JUST RIGHT. Now earlier in this review I spoke of stars. The star of Friday nights show was the cheese steak hoagie. Brimming w/meat FRESH I say again fresh vegetables, and (a pgh thing) fries. Me, and my two growing carnivores left our dinner table quite sated.  Have I eaten there before yes will I eat there again oh heck yes. They are a good bang for your buck with several specials everyday. I end my reviews with this statement and my review of Wiseguys pizza will be no different. I vote with my money and feet, and rest assured that both will be making many more trips to this eatery.

The crust, sauce, and cheese illustrate unique qualities of Pittsburgh pizza.  Crust tends to be thin like New York pizza, but chewy rather than crunchy.  Pizzerias often use a blend of provolone and mozzarella or straight provolone, and if it's a pizzeria worth anything, the cheese will snap when melted (think of how stringy the cheese gets on cheap delivery pizza).  Pittsburgh pizza sauce will taste distinctly of red wine and not oregano (thank God).   Beto's parbakes the pizza and then finishes it for a few minutes before topping it with the cold cheese (by the way, they'll melt it if you tell them).

I had been here once before but it had been a number of years prior.  Man was this place packed!  I had trouble finding a parking spot and upon entering the restaurant there were no open tables and about 10 people waiting for their orders.  Since I was due elsewhere later in the evening I decided to order four cuts of pepperoni to go.  After that I sat down on a chair to wait.  It was at this point that I heard one of the employees telling another that they should tell everyone it would be about a 30 minute wait.  Thankfully it only ended up being a 15 minute wait before I was out the door and into my car.\n\nSo how did the pizza taste?  Sorry Beto's and the South Hills but I just don't get cold cheese and toppings on top of a baked crust.  This is now two times that I have tried it and this time I was prepared for it and more than willing to give it a better chance.  However it just does not work for me.  The positives for the pizza are that the crust is super crispy, almost cracker like, which I really liked.  I don't know that I have had another pizza crust that was this crispy before.  There was also a ridiculous amount of cheese on my four slices which I consider to be a good thing.  As to the negatives of the pizza, the main one is the cold toppings.  To me it doesn't really feel right and I am not a fan of it.  This also causes a secondary issue of the pizza being extremely messy to eat.  Since the cheese hasn't melted together and also hasn't melted the toppings on, it goes everywhere.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I probably will not be back again in the future.

For me, my fallback, can't miss restaurant is Bado's. First off, the menu is huge- pizza, hoagies, pasta, sandwiches, big burgers, Boarshead hotdogs, and huge apps. Everything I have tried there so far has been above average, except maybe their lasagna which I found to be watery and tasteless. If you get a salad, make sure you try their house dressing. It's their own vinaigrette that comes in a Grolsh bottle and is by far one of the best dressings I've ever had. Make sure you try it on the giant antipasti salad (which you should split with someone), and pair that with one of their calzones (my favorite is the reuben calzone, but the meatball is excellent as well). Their pizza buffet is also good if you want to try a lot of different toppings. \nIf you're looking for a good beer, Bado's has a great selection of craft and microbrews on their huge board, and the choices are always changing.\nYou will also want to come to Bado's on weekend mornings for their breakfast. The omelets are huge and they have tons of toppings to choose from, and the rest of their breakfast choices are above average. Even the coffee is good!\nThe drawbacks to Bado's are that they're almost always busy, and tables are a little cramped. Expect to wait a few minutes when you get there, and don't expect stellar service. The wait staff is good but they're always busy, so you'll probably be waiting for a refill. Also, I like to have fries with my sandwich or burger, and while their fries are pretty good, they don't have them as a side. You have to order off their appetizer menu, and the order is too big for one person and pricey.", "business_id": "qemCNgjeYGcFsRwxW9x4xw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-03-08", "type": "review"}

The waitress's working weekends are pretty fantastic. The guys that work during the work are so-so. I don't have any experience with the bartenders, as we always sit at a table and eat.\nThe one drawback for me is how it's a bit \"too\" family friendly for me. I love children (work with them everyday!) but it seems that families here feel comfortable letting their children do whatever they want. Maybe it's because the environment already seems loud, parents feel they can let their children misbehave and it will go unnoticed.

My wife and I added a dozen Guinness/ Honey Mustard wings and split a Reuben.\n\nThe wings came out in record time and were pretty good. Although, I still don't think the Guinness aspect did anything for the flavor. They sure tasted like any other honey mustard wing I've ever had.\n\nThe Reuben was average, but very large. It came with potato chips and a pickle spear. For the $9 price tag, you'd think they could do fries over chips.\n\nThe pizza was good; not great. Based on reviews, I thought the pizza would be even better. Maybe I'm being a bit picky, but there are enough great pizza joints in the city that you can afford to be.\n\nAll in all, Bado's is a nice place to have a casual dinner.

Inside, it is your typical neighborhood pizza place/bar. Clean, well maintained but nothing shiny or fancy here. Looking over the menu, I noticed some classics and some distinct choices. Sandwiches, soups, salads, pizzas and calzones. Some with toppings/fillings you would not expect. Feeling unadventurous, we decided to order their (famous) wedding soup, a cheese pizza and a sausage calzone to be able to try a few of the classics. The soup came out first. The meatballs were tasty but otherwise, I'm not sure why it would be famous. It definitely did not stand out to me. Another item that did not stand out, the pizza. I was looking for something more. The pizza sauce was a bit tart for me. The real winner of the meal was the sausage calzone (which we added ricotta to). The sausage had a great spice to it. The heat was nicely complimented by the creamy cheese and crisp crust.

Hummm, for $7.95, how could I resist?\n\nThe salad came out quickly with what you would expect on a salad: lettuce, tomato, spinach, cucumber, onion mushrooms and croutons. They also had my favorite dressing, raspberry vinaigrette, which always scores points with me. But what struck me most was the sheer size of the salad. For a side salad this was huge; not a meal in itself but definitely bigger than I've gotten at most places.\n\nIt didn't take to long afterwards for the Lasagna to come out. In following suit with the salad, it was a huge slice covered in a tasty, tomatoey, tomato sauce. A slice of garlic bread accompanied it. Like I said, it was a cheese lasagna and there was no shortage of ricotta between pasta layers. A layer of sausage or ground beef would have done wonders for this lasagna but it stood well on its own just fine. I enjoyed half of it (how much carbs does one man need?) and put the rest in a take home container for lunch tomorrow.

So that being said I thought that I would probably think it was pretty typical, however I was definitely wrong.  I can't say this is the best pie I have had locally but it is up there in the top 5.  Even with all the toppings the pizza stood nice and firm.  The crust was delightful and I don't typically like a thicker crust.  I would say their crust is probably traditional, I prefer thin, but this was so light and airy that the texture was about perfect.  I am not sure about the steak they use.  Couldn't tell with the array of toppings if it was more of a steakum type of meat or not, but together it all tasted delightful.    Between the two of us we finished the medium pie no problem.  \n\nMy only suggestion to people coming here for lunch is it is busy and you will wait.

Founded in 1978, when Bobby quit the plumbing business (though he continued to do a little plumbing work here and there for years after) eventually he and his business partner went separate ways.  Bobby ran the shop through the 90s and finally he retired and sold it to the current owners, the Lombardi family.  \n\nBobby, whose family hailed from Calabria, made a signature Calabrese white pizza, which is still offered there today: olive oil, spinach, feta and artichoke.\n\nCasa's new owners were loyal to Bobby's vision and experience.  They used chefs at the neighboring tavern who dissected and then managed to recreate Bobby's unique take on classic Italian Dressing, which has impressed my friends as far away as the Big Apple.

While the people running the shop were lovely, it was not worth the $17 or so we paid.\n\nI had small cheese steak sub - asking only for mayo and lettuce. you would think that might be a nice time to let me know that they use some sort of house garlic-herb mayo instead of actual mayo. but no. So after a good bit of waiting my sub comes out with this weird speckly dressing on top of the lettuce... yes, this is that mayo - which is disgusting. I thought it was ranch and that is when he lady, with a smile, explained it was their house mayo... no, they don't use regular mayo here. \n\nso, let me tell you about this mayo:\n\n1. it is heavily flavored with garlic powder - which tastes seriously like chemicals on a good day and just should not be considered food in any way shape or form. Mixed in with this were some dried herbs - maybe an italian mix? who knows. all I could taste was the overwhelming chemical, fake garlic flavor. Hey, I love garlic and cook with it daily - mind you I actually use the real stuff. \n\n2. it is really thin... I mean thin like salad dressing, runny, thin. Um, isn't mayo supposed to be thick and spreadable? even the stuff you see at subway is thicker. this stuff tasted like really cheap, bad, ranch dressing.\n\nSo, after giving it a good effort to try to eat this \"sub\" - I gave up and picked off the bread on the top of the sub - the bread was pretty stellar though. still hungry I decided to try to scrap off the mayo/lettuce disaster and go for the meat and cheese. um... salt? the meat, which suspiciously looked like those thin sheets of steak-um had zero flavor. one bite and I rejected it. While we are talking about the meat - why use this garbage? I am paying almost 6 bucks for this sub. I want to see yummy chopped up steak bits like you see at even a mall sub shop. not this grey, disgusting 1980s looking flavorless \"meat\".  At least the bottom of the sub roll was salvageable... I ate the bread. \n\nOn to the pizza. My husband had two slices of pepperoni and my daughter had a slice of plain cheese. \n\nOk, pizza. well, this too was a massive disappointment. since I was still hungry after dumping the majority of my sub I tried both of their pizza slices. it reminded me of a nice store-bought frozen pizza. yes, bland. bad sauce with flavorless cheese. \n\nMy husband is a freak for pepperoni pizza and of the two slices he almost finished one of them. yes, more for the garbage. My daughter? she is three.. she isn't really a foodie (yet) but she got thru some of her cheese pizza... she actually spit some of it out but to be fair - she is three. I tried her pizza and honestly, all I could manage to somewhat enjoy was the crust which was nothing to rave about but it was tolerable. \n\nTo provide a baseline - we typically order from Rialto's and while they are not terrible they decent enough for a sub shop - pizza place.  this place... ugh. never. again. ever. We ended up throwing out about 80% of what we paid for.

The thinking behind that is, if the place looks that bad but is still in busines, then there is a reason they're still in business. And in my experiences, it's almost always true.\n\nFiori's is a dive (in a good way)- the inside looks like it was put together in the '70's, and the staff isn't always the friendliest. Forget about parking- there are three spots on the side of the building and perilious street parking on the hill. The later in the evening you go, the busier the dining room. My suggestion is don't eat here- you're only asking for drama.\n\nBut then you get home with that steaming pie, and all the parking nonsense, questionable customer service, and wait in line vanishes as you're enveloped in cheesey, meaty goodness. The pizzas are big, there are a ton of toppings, and the sauce is sweet in a good way. My suggestion is try their white pizza, which I think rivals the ones I've had in New York. I get mine with ricotta cheese, mushrooms, and meatballs- I'm drooling just thinking about it.

We arrived shortly after 7 PM to find this place absolutely packed.  That meant that there wasn't any good parking spots available and so we had to park halfway up Capital Ave which if you don't know is a very steep cobblestone road.  The good news for us upon entering is that we were able to snag a table which was great as it seemed like people were waiting for tables the whole time that we were there.  The inside of Fiori's is somewhat small and I think they have 4 booths and 3 tables for seating as well as a pinball machine in one of the corners.\n\nOn this night our party decided to be simple and we ordered two large cheese pizzas for our table.  After taking a seat we probably waited around 20 minutes or so before our pizzas were ready for us.  The pizza ended up being pretty good and I can see why people in the South Hills always rave about Fioris.  My favorite part of it ended up being the crust which I thought had a really good crisp and a somewhat sweet flavor to it.  The cheese was also really good and there was a ton of it. Last but not least was the sauce whose flavor seemed to get lost with the cheese and crust.  So overall it was a pretty good pizza with my only complaint being that I could not for the life of me get the cheese to stay on the pizza while I was eating it.  Every time I took a bite or tried to cut it all of the cheese seemed to come off the rest of the slice.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  I really enjoyed both the sweetness and crispiness of the crust and thought that there cheese was good as well.  Now if they can only do something about the parking situation outside.", "business_id": "r8jeeS3k_diihMDSu9IjlA", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-04-14", "type": "review"}

Lebanon, I went to il Pizzaiolo years ago, but haven't been back in recent memory. I don't remember much about it before, and after my experience there last night, I will remember not to go there again.\n\nWe were celebrating my friend's birthday. We got there about 7:45 with a party of 5, and there were a few tables open. The only table that was large enough to accommodate us, a table for 8, was available in the back. The brunette hostess starts to take us back there, but then the blond hostess says \"we have a large party coming in and they're going to be eating and drinking for a while.\" She points to a small table for 4 and says \"You'll sit there.\" Confused because the restaurant allegedly doesn't take reservations, we offered to wait until one of the 6-person tables opens up. The blond hostess refused. \n\nParagraph in which I rant about the blond hostess: This girl can't be older than 17. The whole time she interacted with us, she was rude, dismissive, and acted like it was a bother for her to be doing her job. She gave us so much attitude, like she was doing us a favor by seating us at all. No wonder people always comment on how bad the service is at this place - if your first impression is with a condescending high schooler who needs an attitude adjustment, it would take a lot to negate that first impression. Also, someone needs to tell this girl that tights are not pants. If I wanted to see someone's a$$ while I ate, I'd go to a strip club. /end rant\n\nWe were seated at the tiny 4-person table, two people on one side of the table (who wants to eat with a corner of the table sticking into their chest, as the hostess arranged the seats?). The 8-person table sat vacant for the first hour we were in the restaurant, and we were almost done with our meal when the allegedly expected party came. Funny how they don't take reservations, yet they would not sit us at the only table available that would accommodate our party.\n\nOur server, Ryan, was great and attentive. I think he realized how pissed off we were at the hostess and put in some extra effort.\n\nAs for the food and drink, it was just fine. Severely overpriced, but fine. Piccolo Forno is much cheaper (and is BYOB) and has much better food. \n\nThere are so many options in downtown Mt.

I would say \"snappy casual\" would have appropriate. We were not looking quite that snappy.\n\nAnyway, we ordered an antipasta platter with cured meat, cheese, olives, fava bean spread, and some roasted veggies. Pair that with an excellent bottle of red wine. It was amazing! Surely enough food there for both of us to eat for dinner but we wanted to try the pizza.\n\nUnfortunately, less than 10 min after our huge appetizer came out our server delivered the pizza to our tiny table where there wasn't any more room and we were clearly not ready for the next part of our meal. So, we let the pizza sit there.\n\nWhen we got ready to eat the pizza it was cold and the crust was rubbery. When our server returned we explained the trouble with the pizza and he promptly got us a fresh one. This was a very nice gesture and promptly rectified the fact he never should have delivered the first one when he did.\n\nThe crust on the second pizza was still rubbery.

I have had days where the host/hostess has seated my party promptly and had the most efficient waitress/waiter during my stay.  Then there have been times where I've felt like a nuisance for my presence.  That said, the food is so divine that I really don't care, it's worth the chance!  As Kat M. stated in a previous review, the ingredients are all authentic and high quality and it is a stand out amongst many restaurants in the area.  The crust is chewy, with that  Neapolitan type char to the bread.  The Mozzarella is creamy and floats on top of the sauce in a gooey little pockets. The sauce, goodness the sauce, it's bright and delectably simple.  In fact, it makes my mouth water to think of it.  Their pasta choices are always on par as well.  I order the Penne Alla Vodka, no fail, every time.  I actually had to learn how to make my own because I had to cut corners on my budget at one time!   They always have nice drink selections, but I love that they serve the small Coca-Cola bottles with a glass of ice, it gives the experience that European touch!  It's affordable and delicious, definitely a no-brainer for a great, casual night out with friends.  I no longer live in the area and I still crave a weekend in the Pittsburgh area just so I can get a pie!  My friend from L.A. consistently gushes about her pizza and pasta that she had whilst she visited me almost four years ago!  \"Oh, what I wouldn't do for some Il Pizzaiolo!\"  I couldn't agree more.\n\nIt makes me want to check Kayak for some cheap tickets to PIT!", "business_id": "6-rJjW6ITl5o_FliiNgZRA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-04-22", "type": "review"}

We arrived at around 7 PM and were quoted for a 35 minute wait upon which the hostess suggested that we go to the wine bar in the back.  The wine bar is not exactly in the same building but is a few feet out of the back door of Il Pizzaiolo.  The wine bar was bursting at its seams for the first five minutes that we were there we could not move much past the door.  Eventually the crowd quieted down and I was able to see a beautiful bar, a fireplace with chairs, bookcases full of books on wine and Italy and some trendy paintings.  After about an hour wait we were finally seated in the main dining room.\n\nThe main dining dining room was nothing special in my opinion as there was nothing that I can remember that really stuck out.  Our waiter came to our table quickly and our group ordered the Arancini since we were hungry.  It came out six balls to the plate on a bed of marinara sauce and tasted pretty good.  For dinner I was having a hard time deciding on whether I should have a handmade pasta or the pizza and eventually decided to get both.  My pasta entree was the Paglia E Fieno which consisted of handmade tagliatelle with prosciutto in a cream sauce.  The tagliatelle was made with either spinach or eggs and the alternating green and beige color combined with the color of the meat gave a nice visual presentation to the backdrop of the cream sauce.  It also tasted wonderful and none was left on my plate whenever I was done.  My pizza was the Diavola since I like spicy things and consisted of spicy salami, chile pepper, basil and different cheese.  Once again the colors were nice and I absolutely loved the pizza, especially some of the pieces where I got what seemed to be larger than normal gobs of cheese.  My dining companions all also complimented their meals and we were more than happy with the service.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would definitely come back here in the future.

The restaurant is nice and cozy inside, if a bit loud.  My friends were already dining on the fried cheese balls, which were described by the waiter as \"an explosion in your mouth of cheesy goodness.\"  cheesy goodness explosion?  sign me up.  I'm not even going to try to act like a refined foodie I will do damn near anything for cheese and brother, we had CHEESE.\n\nthey brought bread out, and it was pretty good but not interesting bc it did not contain cheese.  I ordered the chicken piccatta, one friend had chicken cacciatore, another had the lasagna, and then my healthy vegetarian friend had some dish of marinated vegetables.\n\nwho the hell cares about marinated vegetables?  that was the one dish I did not sample as it did not contain cheese.  \n\nThe wine list was also very good and the waiter knew what he was talking about and I did not find the upcharge outrageous.\n\nThe chicken cacciatore was pretty good.  Here's the thing:  my friend who got it alwyas plays it cool so she was all, \"It's alright.\"  I tasted it, and it was good as hell!  Its hard to mix sausage and chicken in one dish but this was pretty good.  \n\nMy friend has the lasagna and it was so good as soon as I took a bite I was so overwhelmed by how good it was I smacked him in the shoulder.  It was AMAZING.  I dont know how it is sooo good, I think it is layered with alternating layers of cocaine, love, and cheese.  \n\nIn a lame attempt to be healthy, I ordered the chicken piccatta.  When a waiter says, \"you know, its good but here's what I recommend...\"  I need to learn to recognize that for the \"get something else!\" that statement is.\n\nFor some reason my entree came out 10 min after everyone elses. I ordered it bc I thought it would be healthier than heavy pasta but it was swimming in a lemon butter sauce that was not healthy but very good.  There were capers in the dish too and they were the only thing interesting about it.  This dish was pleasant but unremarkable and underwhelming.  Get something else.  Ask the waiter what to get and then trust his judgement.\n\nI will def be back, and the next time I am back I think I'll try the pizza that they are so famous for.

Made reservations for our Anniversary and showed up on time.  Early evening on a Friday night. We ordered the ravioli and a personal pizza.......it took 47 MINUTES for our food to come out !!!    I was counting. Because it was rediculous. The restaraunt was half empty, and we sat there for 47 minutes with a little bread and oil--wich they refilled twice because the food was taking so long.  AND NEVER refilled our empty water glasses.  I decided at 50 minutes we were leaving.  Lo and behold at 47 minutes it comes out. Bland and soggy as we've ever tasted.  Opposite of what we expected from such an \"upscale\" Italian dining experience.    They never apologized for the long wait for our food and pretended everything was normal and fine.  We scarfed it down in a hurry to leave and asked for the bill. The waitress put it on the table and then took almost 10 minutes more to return to charge it when we were obviously packed up and ready to go.  We just walked up to the register and had someone else nearby handle it for us.  My husband went to pull the car around while I finished up with the bill.\n\n  Look, I know these are first world problems, and truthfully, my husband and I always enjoy each others company so much that we hardly notice a long wait for our food... PLUS... we were there on a gift card....     But we were trying to make it to a show that night and ended up arriving late and all for a meal that kinda sucked.\n\nEven worse, when my husband and I got up to leave, a table of 2 next to us received their food---- they had only been seated 15 minutes earlier!!!!\n\nI never complain about waitstaff mostly because I used to be a waitress, but what pushed me so far as to get on yelp about it is what I witnessed on the way out the door.  While I was standing by the door waiting for them to charge our card, A very elderly woman whom I had noticed was standing there a long time, asked the hostess...\"how much longer for a table?\"  and the hostess said...\"About 20 more minutes\".  The elderly woman replied..\"Thats what you said 20 minutes ago, and I see 5 empty tables.\"  The hostess got very rude with her and retorted \"Ma'am, some people plan ahead and make reservations, and its impossible to tell you the exact amount of time you will need to wait because we dont know how much longer people will be staying. They might order dessert, or more drinks. You can go to another establishment.\"\n\nSeeing this old woman as I would my own grandmother, I stuck my neck out and spoke up to the hostess.   I said...\"Listen, I've noticed this woman standing here a very long time.  You don't have any chairs for people up here to sit in and wait, so shes just been standing here. If you told her the wait was going to be 20 minutes, you need to seat her after 20 minutes.  If you were'nt sure exactly how long the wait would be, you should have told her that in the first place instead of getting angry at her for going by what YOU SAID.  Also, it would'nt hurt to show a little more respect to your elders.\"  \n\nThe hostess looked at her friend and rolled her eyes sarcasticly as to say...\"who is this bi***?\"  hahahaha.  VERY RUDE. VERY.   WORST SERVICE IN YEARS. SORRY.   Dishonorable staff.  Unimpressive food.", "business_id": "6-rJjW6ITl5o_FliiNgZRA", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-03-10", "type": "review"}

I went with Turkish Engineer (TE) on a snowy weekend evening. We dined rather early, so there was no wait. Unfortunately throughout the meal, I noticed almost the same (if not more) problems with service and food. \n\nOur drink (two sodas) and appetizer orders were taken almost immediately (great!). But we were not given silverware or napkins and for some reason could not possibly distract our waitress to obtain any. We snagged some from a nearby empty table instead. My soup and TE's frittatine arrived a short time later. The wedding soup was delicious, with savory meatballs, spinach, and orzo. I did ask for some parmesan cheese to put in the soup, and our waitress shook exactly half a teaspoon over the bowl and quickly departed. Since when is parmesan cheese a limited commodity? The way the servers at Il Pizzaiolo protect the freshly grated parm, you'd think it was made of gold flakes. But I digress. The frittatine (fried pasta with bechamel sauce and cheese) was quite bland. After a few bites, we had it wrapped to add tomatoes and herbs at home. \n\nThen our pizzas arrived; I ordered the margherita doc (mozzarella, basil, and tomato sauce)  and TE chose the funghi (mushroom). My pizza, (despite it being short on the basil), was very tasty. TE was upset to find he was served not a pizza with mushrooms, but one with sausage instead. He asked if he had ordered correctly, and I said that he had. Even the patron next to us said that TE had indeed ordered the mushrooms. The waitress seemed a little unnerved but quickly had the kitchen make a new pizza. \n\nOverall, a disappointing dining experience. It took forever to get water and any other items we needed for our meal.  We tried to be patient, as we only saw two servers working. However, there were three hostesses at the bar chatting and seemingly doing nothing. The restaurant was by no means crowded (this was a Sunday). Moreover, what is the point of having three hostesses and two overworked servers? It doesn't make sense. \n\nI will speak up for the quality and freshness of the ingredients. Everything is freshly made, especially the pizzas. That is great.

They did send me a $15 gift card, which I thought was nice even though that a $15 gift card is the middle finger of gift cards, so I decided to try them once more.\n\nOK, so that was just a fluke, they gave me a gift card, time to put on my optimistic pants and try again.  So I took one of my long time friends out for lunch.\n\nWe walked in, and we were given the new option to sit in the \"Wine Bar\".  \n\nOOOooo, color me intrigued.  \n\nSo they took us outside, up some stairs, and into what I'm guessing was a middle aged Persian's studio apartment above a garage that they converted into a dining room.  We then waited for service for an inhuman amount of time before we were given waters.  I ordered a dry red wine, and my friend ordered a cocktail.  We waited, and eventually got those, and they were actually very nice.  \n\nWe ordered mussels again (cringe) and the meat and cheese plate.  First thing I knew was iffy was the meat and cheese plate.  They replaced the normal wooden board, and replaced it with a plate.  A white, boring, incredibly small plate.  On top of it all, it was more of a plate of lunch meat than a charcuterie!  Blah.  The mussels were good though, and my bowels remained intact, though we asked for bread when it was dropped, and had to ask for it a second time.  What a waste, the broth was actually good, but cold by the time we actually got our bread.\n\nSo I'm sorry Il Pizzaiolo, I really tried to like you, but until the quality returns, I won't be.\n\nTL;DR  Don't go here, there are a ton of cheaper, better Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh", "business_id": "6-rJjW6ITl5o_FliiNgZRA", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-04-04", "type": "review"}

On the one hand, they use very fresh ingredients, and they bring some obvious skill to the kitchen. The salads are excellent, and the toppings for the pizzas are of very good quality. These pies leave something to be desired, however, and I think it's that they're not cooking the tops of the pizzas enough. The bottom of the pies have the requisite dark char and uneven black spots that we've come to expect from a wood fired hearth oven, but the tops of the pies aren't cooked enough. I know at some places they lift the pies to the top heat source of the oven before pulling them out, and this gives them that final bubbly cheesy goodness that we all love. They don't do that here, and the pizzas lack a certain unctuous and gooey quality that I like. The dough is also a bit thick and not crispy enough. \n\nAs I mentioned, the salads are great. I especially like their Caesar, which has just the rich acid/oil balance, super fresh romaine, a bit of garlic, anchovies that aren't too fishy, and good quality cheese to top it off. I was unaware until my most recent visit that they have a patio and wine bar in the back. The patio is a courtyard, so no street traffic to bum you out on nice warm days, and the wine bar has table seating and a more adult, relaxed atmosphere than the seating in the front. It's also dark and cozy, so perfect for a cold winter night.

A large cheese pizza (which is 16', or 12 slices for those of you who think that makes a difference) costs a rich neighborhoodly $17.50 (plus the $20 parking ticket which I will take half the blame for...bringing the pizzas total to $27.50).  The kid making the pizza was exactly 12 years old and was a spitting image of Ernie from Billy Madison, I was half expecting him to pee his pants mid pie.  Ernie has a lot to learn about making a pizza and the fact that it was 2 in the afternoon on a Thursday and no one in the kitchen was over the age of 20 makes sense as to why the pizza is so sloppy.  \n\nMineos is making their pizza the traditional way, directly on the brick with no screens.  Ernie smothered the dough in flour to the point that the dough was all white and a bit powdery and it left a residue on your hands.  I can't say that I blame him for that thought because if he didn't use the giant hand full of flour to slide the pie in the oven than he wouldn't have been able to put the 9 pounds of cheese on the pie that Mr. Mineo requires for a pizza to be deemed edible.  The pie still didn't quite make its way into the oven without turning into a wonky oval shape.  The pizza was way too thin in the middle and the gelatinous wad of cheese that enveloped the pie made it pretty much impossible to pull the slices apart from each other.  This is the kind of pizza that you need to eat with a spoon.  You really can't eat it like pizza, you just kind of have to pick the cheese curd off and eat it by itself and then you can eat the crust afterwards.  The pizza was relatively well cooked, it lacked color but probably just because of the excessive flour.  The sauce was spread on fairly well but the cheese was just wadded on with absolutely no regard for my butt hole.\n\nThe dough has that typical bad salty cracker Pittsburgh type taste to it.  The crust has a pretty low hydration rate and is quite dry but you probably won't notice because you will be too busy choking on the grease from the cheese.  The middle of the pie was way too thin and the crust was pretty puffy.  The flavor of the dough is generic and salty.  The dough was also fairly dense.  \n\nThe sauce wasn't bad, I would be curious to try this sauce on a pie that had a sensible amount of cheese.  The flavor is mostly derived from basil, oregano and sugar.  They are definitely using a lot of water in the sauce and adding sugar to offset it.  Its not the worst sugar water sauce I have had in the city but it certainly isn't great.  The tomatoes seem to be decent quality, no real chunks though just a thin even consistency.  \n\nThe cheese ruined this pie.  It tastes like a mix of mozzarella and provolone, quite possibly some cheap stuff blended in with some good stuff.  I don't understand why any pizza shop would want to put so much damn cheese on their pizza when it is by far the most expensive part.  I can't even think of a joke, I just want to take a nap.\n\n\nAll in all this pizza just sucks.  Its sad to me that places like this are the standard for pizza in this city, its just breeding more fat oblivious ranch dressing dunkers.  People don't eat pizza like this because it tastes good, they eat it because it gets you high as fuck and releases all your happy lazy brain molecules so that you can just lard there and continue watching the latest scripted reality tv show.  I am feeling pretty defeated by this pizza, both in brain and bung.  \n\n4/10", "business_id": "sa3xqElJEv97MazozLeszw", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-05-14", "type": "review"}

Not only that, but she completely ignored me as if I wasn't sitting right there. \n\nTo make matters worse...much worse, our yummy carbonara had a hair in it. A nice long blonde hair. I was done. I pulled it out and showed my date, he looked at it and told me to just get rid of it. Ok, I did, and I stopped eating. He kept eating lol, until...I found another hair!!!!!!!! Yuck!!!! There is nothing worse than someone else's hair in your food. The night was ruined for me, and we both stopped eating, I never speak up when I am unhappy about something. I am just naturally a friendly, non-confrontational girl, but I felt like I had to say something! No one should have to eat food with hair in it, and have to pay $19 for it. \n\nAlas, my date didn't want to make things more awkward since  out server seemed to be on the verge of an emotional breakdown. So, I kept quiet against my better judgement. She later returned with the check, which was wrong, and claimed that she would have to pay the difference out of her pocket if she tried to change it. Confused! Then she asked us to do the survey and give her 5 stars. Ha! I just started laughing, I was sure this entire night was a joke. \n\nShe literally said, as she knelt down to our table and clasped her hands as if in prayer (I couldn't make this up guys) I'm new here, could you please give me 5 stars, for the good of humanity, and for all those people without jobs in the world.) This was entertaining. Then, she proceeded to take my dates credit card and flirt with him some more! She touched his chest and asked if he had any brothers. Holy...cannoli... get me out of here!

This use to be a family favorite for many years.  After doing a little shopping at the mall we would stop here to eat and gather our thoughts.  So here we go let me first say we have visited this restaurant on multiple  occasions and this is the worst time in the history for us. We were greeted upon entering but waited 4 minutes before being asked if we were dining in our picking up and order.  Why are we waiting to seated when no other family or patrons are waiting. Now off to our table the place was empty no more that 8 table in use. Yet we were cramped at a table and not a booth.  Humm now I am taking notes as this is not the kind of service I remember. So now I am ready to leave but the family wants to stay cause they enjoy eating. We order chicken alfredo and baked ziti and of course the short people requested ol favorite mac n cheese. Well long story short the waitress was the best thing at this restaurant.  My children's food had to be returned as it was cold as ice in the middle. My chicken alfredo was soupy/liquid sauce (you gotta be kidding me) must be a practice run on my order.  My husband baked ziti was drowning in marainera sauce which is a no no for those of us that know real Italian food. So to avoid being a meanie I will end this review like this.  The waitress was pleasant so I tipped her service but after being billed 100+ for food we didn't bother to take with us.  We will not be returning for any reason I could have feed my family twice and McCalisters for the cost of this on the run dinner.

As for the salad, the onions were brown, and I mean bad brown, plus the lettuce was brown and wilted as well.  So, I slid all the toppings off the pizza, ate the dough and ate the garlic knots, after having tried to pick through the lettuce and onions for something fresh, NO.\nI should have known this would have been a bad experience when the guy at the counter was rude and things moved very slowly with only three people in the restaurant.

I was brand new to the area and my Realtor took me there one day after looking at apartments.  Maybe I was too focused on apartment hunting to remember it clearly, but I remember liking my salad from Birkdale.\n\nI've eaten at the uptown place twice.  Both on Saturday nights while partaking in the free trivia they offer.  Four stars for trivia, but I digress.  The first time I had a salad and bread sticks.  The bread sticks were weird.  Not a fan and I love anything vaguely resembling dough!  The salad was unremarkable.  Not good, not bad, just kinda average.  I've had better salads at Panera.  Anywho, I tried a pizza the 2nd time.  Again it was just meh, I've had some frozen pizzas that were better.  But in the same vein I've had way worse experiences.    \n\nWill I return to Brixx in uptown....sure, I love me some trivia.  But I may just drink (responsibly of course!)....don't know that I'll try the food b/c it just doesn't blow me away and both times I came away sightly disappointed.\n\nShout out to my server from the last time - wish I could remember her name.  Well, Brixx validates parking and somehow I lost my ticket. I went back to the garage and attempted to pull a ticket on foot, but damn garage ticket dispensers are smart.  They won't dispense a ticket w/o sensing a car is present.  Anyway I asked my server what Brixx could do b/c I was genuinely afraid of how I'd get my car out past the gates. My server gave me her ticket, validated and everything.  That was beyond.  Maybe she was conning me to get a bigger tip, but I don't care...I made sure she was taken care of.  I think my bill was $13 or so for my pizza, but I tipped her an extra $5.  She was the bomb.\n\nETA - Ok I changed my review from 2 stars to 3 b/c my server was awesome.  She went above and beyond.  It appears as if management reads these reviews so I really wish I remembered her name b/c she deserves kudos.

The kids were hungry, and we weren't into the whole St. Patrick's Day mood. \n\nWe hadn't had Italian food in a while, so I navigated to this place via Yelp on the iPhone. It's in a professional building, underneath a dentist's office, adjacent to a bunch of strip malls on Gold Hill Road. \n\nWe found it odd that it was cold in the restaurant, on what was otherwise a very warm March 17.  The waitress offered to let us sit outside, and so we did. Never mind the bird poop on the wrought iron table... Or the fact that the patio hadn't been swept in a while. \n\nWe were promptly served the highlight of the meal, a basket of probably the best garlic knots I've ever tasted, complete with herbed butter. My boys demanded we get a second basket with our meal. \n\nI'm always suspicious of Italian restaurants that don't have some decent coffee available. When asked, the waitress didn't even know if they did. \"That's okay, I'll drink water...\" \n\nOddly, some folks behind us were served great-smelling coffee about 20 minutes later. I wasn't offered, so I resisted ordering it.\n\nMy universal complaint about most mom and pop Italian restaurants from NY to FLA to CA  is that they don't seem to do salads much justice, and they charge too much for them when they're ordered a' la carte. This place was no exception. \n\nWe found it interesting that the salad Twin B received as an accompaniment to his meal had a nice array of romaine and other lettuces on it, along with croutons, while my wife and I had to endure the non-nutritional value of iceberg and a sparse sampling of veggies. Twin A had ordered a special salad to go with his pizza. It came with great olives and just a few more veggies. \n\nI ordered a crab-stuffed sole, which came with broccoli and mashed potatoes. Twin A ordered a pizza. Twin B ordered a pasta dish with a heavy, herbed cream sauce and some tomatoes. My wife had grilled salmon and broccoli. \n\nThe first thing I noticed about my plate was that the fish and broccoli seemed to be drenched in butter. Now, I like a little butter now and then, but dammit, it's 2012, and most people now know that it's not a a healthy fat to coat a whole meal in. A big draw of Mediterranean food is its heart-healthy reliance on lean meats, fresh veggies, whole grains, and olive oil. So where did all that butter come from? I'm not used to Italian fish dishes or veggies being drenched in butter.\n\nAnyway, the sole was okay. The crab stuffing was greasy and bland, The broccoli had no flavor beyond the butter, and the mashed, skin-on red potatoes were very, very good. Oddly, they were served with little or no added butter! I just dipped them in the ooze from the rest of the food.\n\nTwin A loved his pizza, saying the cheese and olives were awesome, despite a limp, wet crust.\n\nTwin B did not like the heavy, herbed cream sauce that came on his penne. I tried it and found it to have an odd, chemical taste, and to be so heavily laden with fat that I could see why he was disappointed He could probably feel his arteries seizing up after just a few bites.\n\nMy wife said the Salmon was just okay. There was nothing special about it. Her broccoli did look like it had less butter on it than mine.\n\nThe damage was $69 and change with tip, no alcohol. Entrees are generally in the $13 to $18 range, with pastas not far behind. Pizzas are a little less.\n\nOverall, the experience was \"Meh\" for the salads and entrees, \"Yay!\" for the garlic knots, pizza, and mashed potatoes. We have definitely had better Italian food for less money in many other places. I'd probably take my son's advice and order the pizza if I were you.", "business_id": "LwSNsn2k6v_Nb2dbhP3qsQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-03-18", "type": "review"}

That evening our meal at a family restaurant took 2 hours.

The brewery, located a few minutes away by car, allows you to bring in your own food and it was a good excuse for us to revisit one of my childhood favorites.\n\nOriginally opened in Madison in the mid 70's, the chain has a mascot who's a reference to a character from the Firesign Theatre, a Los Angeles-based comedy troupe know for surrealistic humor on live radio programs and recorded albums.  The chain used to have restaurants all over the midwest, but now they're almost exclusively found in Wisconsin. The pizzerias really focus on their eccentric mascot, who looks like a Panamanian tailor in a fedora or a WWII propaganda piece against Italians. \n\nStepping into Rocky's is a 1990s time capsule. Little has changed with Rocky's pizza in the past couple decades. They still have posters of Signor Rococo all over the place, they still sell square-shaped, pan style pizza with their signature Italian-spiced, meatball-sized sausage (among other possible options, although I prefer their sausage pizza), and they still offer butter-lathered breadsticks served in paper cups.  It's greasier than your average pizza and I don't understand why they throw a sheet of plastic over it inside the box, but it tastes and smells just as I remember it from birthday parties and school events.\n\nI wouldn't go as far as saying Rocky's pizza is extraordinary, but it's definitely fun to revisit it and reenter an unchanged scene with all the same sights, smells and decor from 20 years ago.", "business_id": "brkJrGv2Eaj9NTl9g2RMgA", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-03-22", "type": "review"}

Even from down the road you can smell the aroma of garlic and freshly baked pizza and I lamented the fact that there was nothing on the menu that was within my diet. Fast forward 5 years and they now have a gluten free pizza menu as well as several appetizers available for those with Celiac of gluten sensitivity.\n\nFor starters, they offer a gluten free version of bruschetta as well as a spinach and artichoke dip that will nearly have you licking the plate. The spin-dip was by far my favorite, boasting just enough vegetables to make you think you're eating health food, but with a hearty helping of cheese to remind you that you're actually indulging. We also ordered up a batch of their gluten free honey BBQ wings and my 3 year old couldn't get enough of those, shrieking excitedly every time she licked the sweet sauce. Be sure to specify when you order wings that you need them prepared gluten free; they have a separate preparation process for gluten free wings to help reduce any possibility of cross contamination.\n\nLet's talk pizza: I've been eating a lot of it the last few years since more and more restaurants are now serving it. My main concern with many pizza places that sell gluten free is that they serve the crust, but don't know squat about proper preparation techniques. Jimmy, the General Manager at the Camelback and 3rd St. location, gave me a tour of the kitchen on my recent visit. He showed me their gluten free preparation area, the separate tray and utensil storage area, and their cooler to show me that they follow recommended techniques to reduce the risk of cross contamination. Additionally, they use separate ingredients, racks, plates, gloves, and utensils to do their best to serve the Celiac and gluten free community. All locations have been trained on safe handling methods by Lynn Rae Ries of Gluten Free Creations, who also supplies their gluten free products.\n\nWe ordered 2 pizzas, both were 10 inch \"personal\" pizzas, but you could easily split one with a friend if you started with an appetizer. All ingredients tasted very fresh and the crust had a great texture, which is one of the hardest things to get right in the gluten free world. I personally like a combo of black olives, salami, and spinach, which won't break the bank at around $15. My husband opted for a garlic chicken, peppers, and mushroom pizza, which was tasty as well. They will even deliver and offer catering of their gluten free items for the big game or an office party.\n\nThe atmosphere reminds me a lot of a pizza place in Boston my mom used to take me - the kind of place that you would go celebrate winning a soccer match with your team, go on a casual first date, or take the family out for Sunday lunch. After dark, the lights go down and the candles come out while their patio lights up with fairy lights.\n\nThe only thing I could suggest for Streets of New York is to add some gluten free offerings to the dessert menu (I'm a sucker for chocolate) and to add a gluten free beer or cider option to the drink menu. Overall, it was a great dining experience and I'm sure that my family will be back soon!\n\nCheck out my gluten free blog too: www.GlutenFreeAZ.com", "business_id": "JN2qXIuDXnV2d8WnSqd28A", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-03-18", "type": "review"}

We had to repeatedly ask her for refills. Repeatedly ask for dressing. She brought our food out at different times. My food, \"hot pastrami\", was so cold it turned into one big ball of a gross mess. A party of 2 came in after us and she spent the entire time SITTING at their table chatting. She must have knew them because she greeted them both with kisses. Thank God the other waitress was helpful or I would have left. If I went back and she was there I would ask for another section (wish I got her name, but I know her face) dreaded giving her a tip too. We tip well, not that night. \nWe went back today for lunch. One waitress around 12pm and she was awesome!!!! 1 large pizza, suicide wings, hot pastrami, order of fries and 3 drinks. $55! Say what! GREAT DEAL! she was great and we tipped accordingly.

I expected to bite into my sandwich and be wowed. While I really enjoyed the mozzarella and soppressata sandwiches we split and certainly found them both more enjoyable than many sandwiches I have had in the Phoenix area, I just don't think this place is deserving of the Salvation Army of fans that seems to be willing to fight a holy war for that mozzarella sandwich. \n\nIn my eyes, what makes Pane Bianco's sandwiches good (and still worthy of 3 stars) is the fact that they are simple. Unlike some yuppy establishments where Arcadia ladies \"lunch\" (think Wildflower, Acacia Cafe or Chelsea's Kitchen), Pane Bianco (and by the transitive property, Chris Bianco) clearly has the European sensibility of \"less is more.\" A sandwich doesn't need to be piled high with garlic aioli, carmelized onions, and herb goat cheese to be good. If the ingredients are high enough quality, the bread and a few fillings should be able to stand alone and make for a great sandwich. \n\nI guess that's where my problem with Pane Bianco comes in. The individual ingredients of the sandwiches just weren't that great. Certainly, the mozzarella is good but I have had better mozzarella from nice local grocery stores and of course, at countless Italian places. I also agree with Kristin S that the soppressata was overly salty, which obscured the flavor. Finally, I didn't think the bread was as delicious as I had pictured it would be many times before actually coming. It certainly tasted fresh but I thought it could have a bit more flavor complexity (as it was, it tasted very white-bread and didn't have the slightly sour kick that housmade bread often does. \n\nI've got to be honest that after trying Pane Bianco, I am convinced that I would be a bit disappointed if I waited in line to eat at PIzzeria Bianco. While I can definitely appreciate a simple but delicious Pizza Margherita in a world where buffalo chicken pizza is somehow an appealing dish, the individual pizza ingredients would have to be better than the ones at Pane Bianco for me to truly feel like the wait was worth it.", "business_id": "-AAig9FG0s8gYE4f8GfowQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-03-03", "type": "review"}

The shop is a tiny little spot on a pretty desolate strip, but the throng of people eating their sandwiches at the (generously shaded) outdoor tables were a clear indication that we had found our spot.\n\nWe ordered the fresh mozzarella, tomato, and basil sandwich and the market special (slow roasted lamb) sandwich to share.  The sandwiches are served on thin foccacia rounds fresh from the wood-burning oven -- light and crunchy on the outside without being greasy or spongy (ick!) like the foccacia we've sampled at lesser places.  At the same time, the foccacia at Bianco has enough heft to keep from getting soggy if you save the sandwiches for later.  The lamb sandwich was phenomenal - tender, well-seasoned, fork-tender shredded meat with just the right amount of greens.

This tiny sandwich shop is like nothing I've experienced before in Phoenix. They specialize in a very limited menu of artisanal sandwiches, served on house-made bread, as well as a few salads. I've had all of the sandwiches and have narrowed the top two down to the soppressata and the tuna.  The soppressata is like an Italian sandwich on gourmet steroids. The roasted red peppers bring out the rich flavors of the Italian meats and provide the perfect acidic balance to the fattier density of the meats and cheese. A perfect foil to the soppressata, the tuna is light and delicate with a strong lemon flavor - this isn't you mom's canned tuna and Miracle Whip on white bread. The tuna, made with red onion, lemon and olives, is topped with wild arugula, which provides a bitter bite and counters the fishiness. My suggestion - go with a friend and order one of each. The sandwiches are large, and I love to order one tuna and one soppressata and split half-and-half. \n\nI've heard nothing but great reviews for the salads, too, but I confess that I'm never in the mood the healthy salad alternative when I can smell freshly baked bread and know that a fabulous Pane Bianco sandwich creation is in my immediate future.", "business_id": "-AAig9FG0s8gYE4f8GfowQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-04-20", "type": "review"}

This all comes on what I believe is ciabatta bread, but I'm not sure. I asked the lady behind the counter if I could sub out the olives for the roasted peppers. Her answer was simply \"No\".... In my mind my first thought was \"okay, maybe a place like this doesn't do substitutions\", which I understood. She told me that they won't put the peppers on the tuna because it wouldn't work with the sandwich. I was shocked... so I asked her nicely to please ask someone if they could do it. After waiting around for awhile, I went to pay for my meal. As my sandwich was being wrapped, she said yes they could do it, but for some large fee (I believe 2.50 or 3 dollars, remind you this is an 8 dollar sandwich). By this time I was pretty worn out of the whole experience of Pane Bianco that I just said no thanks and went to eat my sandwich. Thanks, but a little too late.\n\nGranted the sandwich was pretty good, and the tuna was very fresh. I just couldn't believe that someone would tell me that I couldn't get something on the menu put on my sandwich... for the reason that she didn't believe they went together. \n\nI spent much of my childhood in South Philadelphia living on homestyle Italian... and tuna and peppers definitely do go together...\n\nIn summary, I will try Pane Bianco again, and will most likely update my review based off of the service I receive.

I went to pizzeria bianco this past week and bar bianco, so when we headed out to try Lux this morning, I figured, why not wait around and try Pane Bianco too. So that's what the BF and I did. Right when the restaurant opened I went in intending to only order one sandwich for the BF and I to share, but once inside, I saw they had a special focaccia and decided to get that too so we could have a more broad idea of what the food is like at this place. Both the sandwich and focaccia had mozz, basil, and tomato. So I went up and ordered and the man taking the orders was less than super friendly, but I can understand that for a place trying to be fast that is also super busy. Then I stepped to the side to pay with some other guy, who was actually pretty nice. After that, you have to sit around and wait for your food.... this is kind of awkward because the space is very small and warm and there are products all around so no matter where I stood I felt like I was in someone's way. Finally, they called my name and I got a little paper bag with my food in it and went to sit outside. The BF and I started by splitting the sandwich. Ok, so the sandwich was alright, I liked how the ingredients tasted fresh and the bread was very good, but it really could use something to make it a little more interesting. If they were to drizzle a little bit of aged balsamic on the sandwich, it would be delicious and I would want to come back for it all the time. As is.... I thought it was a little boring and would be kind of easy to make at home, so why would I come here for it? So after we finished that, we moved on to the focaccia. \n\nNow this was a different story. The focaccia was really good. It's like a corner slice of a square pizza almost. It had the same ingredients as the sandwich, but somehow tasted way better. I guess it's the melted cheese, the type of bread, and the fact that there was clearly olive oil on it that helped it be so much more flavorful. This was close to as good as the pizza was that we got at pizzeria bianco the other day. So, that made me happy and it only cost $4.50, so that made me even happier. I would be much more likely to come here than to wait three hours for the other. \n\nSo why does this place get 3 stars and the other get 4? I thought the selection here was very limited, which is fine if it helps them put out more quality food, but man, there's not a lot of choice. Also, the service was much better at the pizzeria. Finally, the appetizers at the pizzeria were freakin amazing and nothing I got today was amazing. HOWEVER I would probably come here again before going back to the pizzeria due to wait time.\n\nPS I didn't get a sweet!

This is the freakin' sushi bar of the sandwich world.\n\nWhile I'll agree that the ingredients are fresh, you get so few of them it would be difficult to know otherwise. I've been several times now and pretty much always get the tomato/mozz sandwich as I don't eat tuna salad or have a taste for sopressatta. The other day however I got the market sandwich and I was so excited to be able to try something new because it had turkey in it. 2 whole super thin supermarket looking slices of turkey. Mmmmmm. Delicious giant pieces of bread with two super thin slices of turkey in the middle. How could I say anything nasty about paying $10 for you? How dare I be hungry an hour later when you made me so full with all of that bread? You get the picture. Stick the the tomato/mozz sandwich if you're heading this way.

It is that good.  It is also (for me) large enough to have half for lunch and half as an afternoon snack around 3:30 pm.\n\nI have tried the tuna salad.

His simple honest to goodness approach to food is not only inspiring but down right delicious. If you're one of his fans who don't mind waiting 4 hours for one of his amazing pies at Pizzeria Bianco, then you're in for a real treat. While they don't serve pizza, one of my all time favorites, Pane Bianco is now serving dinner and no serious wait either! In addition to ordering one of their famous sandwiches, you can expect an ever changing menu of rustic Italian inspired plates.\n\nIf you've been to Pane you know the drill, go in, order at the counter then either decide to take your score home, or eat there on one of the communal outdoor tables. No wine or beer is served at this time but there is talk of Pane expanding into the Lux Coffee space next door which will eventually offer inside seating and hopefully wine by the glass. If all of this goes down, Lux will simply move to the adjacent building also getting a larger space. For me Bianco's food just screams for a glassed of red wine.\n\nOrdering the Crespelle ($12) had me really excited due to the unique nature of the dish itself. Basically an Italian crepe made the garbanzo bean flour; it's filled with luscious ricotta cheese, hints of spinach then bathed in a slightly sweet tomato sauce. It was clear that after the first bite I was in love with this dish, I simply couldn't stop though glares from my dining companions made me to relinquish the plate. \n\nI can't sing enough praises for Biancos Housemade Mozzarella ($8), thick slabs of hand pulled cheese is paired with fresh tomatoes, a few leaves of basil, olive oil and a sprinkling of salt, that's it. The resulting texture and flavor is so toothsome and fresh that I've yet to have another as good. The salad comes with bread which I put to good use soaking up every drop of the salads milky elixir. \n\nServed on house made flat bread, the Soppressata with Aged Provolone ($8) which also comes topped with a healthy shave of Parmesan cheese and slices of roasted onion. The pungency from the provolone is a nice compliment to the pork-tastic slices of soppressata. \n\nBianco is dedicated to local purveyors and for good reason, they make some of the best Phoenix has to offer. Take the Sausage with beluga lentils and polenta ($10) for instance. The sausage comes from our very own Schreiner's Fine Sausages over on 7th Street and let me just say, this plump link had just the right amount of meaty well seasoned punch to compliment the hearty lentils and super moist polenta cake.\n\nIf you're more of a lighter eater, I'd suggest the highly flavorful Roasted Seasonal Vegetables ($5). On my last visit the pan was filled with long thick spears of asparagus, sweet potato, cabbage, radishes, broccolini and cloves of garlic. Grab a loaf of their chewy bread ($3) and you have yourself a vegetarian option even a meat eater like me would love.\n\nNow if they added pizza to the menu, my life would be complete.", "business_id": "-AAig9FG0s8gYE4f8GfowQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-04-24", "type": "review"}

They have a sister restaurant across town that serves EXACTLY the same pizza?  And we can essentially stroll in there with no problems?  Sign us up.  I'm also guessing this is reasonably new development because a lot of these reviews below me don't seem to even acknowledge the pizza's existence.  \n\nRight now they've got four options for pizza - the Marinara, Margherita, Rosa, and Biancoverde.  Our group of 7 tried all but the Marinara (no hard feelings, cheese-less pizza).  I was impressed with all three with the Biancoverde taking the crown as the best of the night.  One of the chefs there really took care to explain all of the fresh and locally-grown ingredients that they used, and you can tell that the entire staff really takes pride in the food they serve.\n\nWhy only four stars?  Fair or not, I'm afraid it just couldn't overcome the hype.  My buddy from New York INSISTED that he could find a handful of pizza places that could outdo this in NY (although talk about hype...).

So I suggested it for lunch today and off we went.  We were very pleased all around.  The ambiance is great- kind of rustic Italian chic with low and high tables, a bar, and a takeout area next door.  The service was fantastic.  It took maybe 3 minutes to get our food, although sandwiches and salads aren't too taxing to make, and it wasn't crowded.  Still, it was noted and much appreciated.  I got the Caprese salad.  I debated between that and the sandwich, but finally decided on the salad because it did come with bread (which I definitely wanted to try, it being PANE Bianco, but sometimes sandwiches are just too bready).  I spent 2 weeks a couple of years ago literally eating my way through Italy on Caprese salads, and this was as good as many and better than some.  The tomatoes were red ripe and tasty.  The mozzarella was fresh, and it had just the right amount of basil, olive oil, and salt and pepper.  Yum- thinking about it now makes me hungry all over again.  The bread was as expected, fresh and crusty.  I also got the pickled vegetables, which were good and interesting.  It was a plate of baby carrots, onions, cauliflower, and peas pickled in what seemed to be apple cider vinegar, so they were sweet and sour at the same time.  Sweet Pea got the Soppresata sandwich, which came with the chile Soppreseta today (which was great, as we are both notorious spicy hounds), and he really enjoyed it.  It also came with sort of a saucy cold bean salad, I think they were lima or fava beans, which he didn't like but I LOVED.  I ate all of his too.  They serve Mexican sodas but aren't too precious about it- always appreciated.  We will definitely be going back, and I will go by the takeout for a loaf of bread when I'm having a party.

In the end, I settled on three though its probably closer to 3.5 stars.  There's plenty to like about this spot, though I wouldn't say it has the wow factor.  Though in the interest of full disclosure you should know that Pizzeria Bianco doesn't have a wow factor for me either.  If you're a big Pizzeria Bianco fan, you'll probably love this place.  If you're sorta meh about Pizzeria Bianco as I am, you'll probably have some of the same gripes as I do about Pane.\n\nI've been to Pizzeria Bianco a number of times, but I've never tried Pane despite driving past it thousands of times over the years.  Finally on a Wednesday mid afternoon I made the journey here.  My timing was perfect as I arrived right in between the end of the lunch rush and prior to the dinner brigade.  However despite my good timing, finding a parking spot was still a chore as I had to park about two blocks away.  I couldn't even imagine how brutal parking would be when its busy (especially since Lux, another wildly popular establishment, is right next door).  I got a little confused walking inside as you've got two entrances.  The left door gets you into the restaurant while the right door gets you to the take out counter.  You guessed it, walked into the wrong door.  No matter, as I detoured straight to the bar area.\n\nThe aesthetics here are somewhat hard to describe, though the numerous Yelp photos of the interior pretty much paint an accurate picture.  A small place with a hipster vibe, though perhaps with a hint of elegance in the decor.  Not unlike the setup you'd find at Chris Bianco's other establishments, though I'd say this one is a little more laid back.  The bar area is pretty small, though they had a decent number of craft beers and wines to choose from.  They also feature a number of daily dish specials in addition to the regular menu they advertise (including a number of dessert options).\n\nFor starters I went with the Four Peaks Sunbru for my beverage of choice as it was on tap for the day.  For my main dish, it seemed like the Sopressata sandwich with provolone and red peppers is a huge hit based on Yelper reviews so I went with that.  The sandwich comes with what I suppose is a side salad, though its so small it could basically be a garnish.  First off, no complaints about the foccacia bread.  Cooked perfectly for the right amount of crunch while soft on the inside.  But the sandwich itself was a little disappointing to be honest.  The seasoning of the red peppers was such that it basically overpowered the texture of the meat and the cheese, to the point where the red pepper was pretty much all I could taste.  Perhaps swapping provolone for mozzarella would've mellowed out the red peppers just enough to balance it out.  The portion size was about right and the side salad (what little there was) was good so the dish wasn't a total disappointment.  For dessert, I asked for a piece of their tres leches cake, but they had just run out.  So instead I went with their flourless chocolate cake (which I've had before at Pizzeria Bianco).  Just as I expected, it was outstanding.  Super moist and decadent with a light vanilla creme sauce as an accompaniment.  Every bit as good as the one they serve at Pizzeria Bianco and a perfect cap on any meal.\n\nTotal cost for the beer, sandwich, cake, tax and tip came to about $28.  Pretty pricey (especially the sandwich), though to Chris Bianco's credit he and his staff do take great pains to source their ingredients locally which I appreciate.  Still, the markup seems a little steep.  Much like Sam Fox, Chris Bianco's strong brand identity probably drives the prices higher.  So like I said, if you think everything Chris Bianco touches turns to gold, you'll love this place.  And better still, they also serve Chris's famous pizzas at Pane as well.  I'd come back if asked by a friend or family member, but overall I feel like Chris Bianco's original pizzeria in Heritage Square is still a preferable experience to his CenPho concept.", "business_id": "-AAig9FG0s8gYE4f8GfowQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-04-01", "type": "review"}

Perhaps it's the overall indifference, and everyday-ness quality to this place that explains.   \n\nFOOD --- 3 stars\nSERVICE --- 3.5 stars\nATMOSPHERE --- 4 stars\nPARKING --- 1 star\n\nOregano's isn't bad nor terribly good --- but it falls in the middle as an average lunch or dinner option.  Portions here are big, but quanity does not equal quality.  I find it to be infinitely better than most other Italian chains (the BARFY Olive Garden, Macaroni Grill and Carrabba's), but not quite at the level of Maggiano's or Il Fornaio.  \n\nThe food here is OK, although there are a few standouts. \n* Alfredo the Dark pasta with the poblano peppers.  \n* Lady is a Scampi pasta\n* Pizza Cookie (or whatever it's called)\n* Italian Fried Potatoes\n\nBtw, that last item is their cutesy name for waffle fries.  Being the waffle fry whore that I am, I have to say these are quite good. \n\nThe baked sandwiches are OK --- the beefstro and stuffed turkey being one of my usual orders.  The pizza is OK as well.  Being a thin crust lover, I find the crust at Pizza Heaven and Pizzeria Bianco to have a better-tasting texture.  It's almost a little too thin (read: cheap) here.  Kind of like notebook paper.  How do I know?  Because I've tried it.  The salads here are big, so be warned.  Can't comment on the taste though because I haven't had them.\n\nThe 1950s swing/jazz motif, tomato sauce cans, and loud t-shirts can be charming in a campy kind of way. But what I like most about this location is how they preserved the \"Damen/Herren\" bathroom signs from when it used to be some kind of Bavarian wonderland.  \n\nAmong the cons here are the parking NIGHTMARE and sometimes hellish 1 hour-plus waits (on Mondays even!).  This place is ALWAYS packed.  I do not understand why there are only 15 parking spots here for a restaurant that easily seats over 100.  They must expect all their customers to carpool together in mini-vans.  But even so, they should know that NO ONE in Central Phoenix would be caught dead in a mini-van.\n\nThe parking shortage has caused nearby businesses to post bitchy signage warning Oregano's patrons not to park there - resulting in the traffic BOOBYTRAP that is 10th St.  Drivers must dodge slowly moving cars and waddling Oregano's customers weave in and out as the tiny parking lot leaks out onto 10th.  \n\nStaff here is always quick and freakishly friendly and cheery -- kind of like the drones at Jamba Juice and Cold Stone Creamery.  It's kind of cute, but borderline annoying that it seems trite.  But there are plenty of a-holes at other restaurants so I'm not complaining.\n\nSo there you have it.  Not exactly great, but I will be back soon.  Visit 4,763 is coming up next week.\n\nP.S.  For stalkers who care, Phoenix Fire Department DOES eat here often.  In fact when Melinda sees a fire engine parked outside she always requests a table close to the firefighters.  She thinks those guys are \"en fuego.\"", "business_id": "ML1RJdeZ7bbfMrHvJ7m99A", "stars": 3, "date": "2007-04-10", "type": "review"}

She cards us.. I show her my id and he shows his. She explains she needs to see and card the person he is buying the drink for. Okay that's a pain.. but fine. So what does she do. She leaves me at the bar while she goes with Carlos out to the crowded patio to card his wife.. really? How about you take care of me since I have met all the requirements? okay? so while she is gone..another bartender comes up and takes my order.

The sausage was overpowered by the sauce, but it was good.  \n\nPomo is my favorite pizza place here, but, if you're in the mood for for a good 3000 calorie pizza that will feel like a load in your tummy, look no further.

I can see how parking would be a challenge but we found a spot in the main lot behind the restaurant. They were quite busy.  But we waited on the shady patio and had a drink at the bar.  There were 6 of us and we were easily seated at one of their large booths inside. \nWe were hungry and looking back we admittedly had eyes bigger than our belly's.  We ordered the Bruschetta Authentico and the Lawrence's Stuffed 'Shrooms to start.  The fresh onions on the Bruschetta really added quite a bit of flavor, I didn't find the addition of the marinara provided necessary.  \nThe Stuffed mushrooms were 2 large portabella mushrooms stuffed full of sausage marinara and melted cheese.  It took a little effort to cut them up and share, but they were quite good. In fact they would make a great  main dish to share with a salad. \n\nTwo in our party put in Lasagna orders for one of each variety at the same time as the app orders as it takes 30-45 min for Lasagna.  The rest of us took a while to decide on what we wanted.  The other 4 of us ordered the Aunt Margherita Pizza, 2 ordered the Alfredo The Dark and added broccoli and I ordered the Zainy Ziti and added sausage.  \n\nAll plates were extremely generous servings.  I personally made 3 meals out of my Ziti dish.  It was simple yet tasty and served in a baked thin crust bowl.  I sampled the Margherita pizza which I found to be lack luster.  The Alfredo dish was not as flavorful as I would have expected and was slightly rescued by the seasoning on the southwest bread that is served with the dish.

That said the experience here was pretty awkward and uncomfortable. \n\nUpon arriving and not seeing a huge crowd, we were told that it would be an hour and fifteen minute wait.

Really not cool. Really bad for business. \n\nAnywho... seeing as my fiance wasn't back I guessed correctly that he scored us some bar seats. And there were two more down a ways. Full my ass. It was like she was trying to turn away business so she could leave early. It was only 8pm too!\n\nEnter bartender... or ID Nazi. My fiance is 33 and rarely, if ever carded. No biggie, but the guy was kind of abrupt and not friendly. He then had a really awkward interaction with a girl that worked there. He was reprimanding her but did it in a very rude way. Not what I want to see. \n\nIt took forever for us to put in our order and after we got our food and another employee came to sit down next to us we got the full brunt of bad juju at the restaurant.

Honestly though I think I can rate them higher on their wings than on the pizza, not many places can get just the right amount of crispy and just the right amount of meaty when it comes to chicken wings and for my taste these guys nail it. I give the wings 5 stars hands down I will put Oregano's up against anyone in town for chicken wings. I have tried multiple locations and they are consistent at all three that I have tried. The only thing that is frustrating is that they are always busy and the situation to get a table can be a bit irritating when you have been waiting all week for cheat day...and speaking of cheat day the pizzookie or whatever it is called is super good as well if you are in the mood to pack on about 2500 calories in one meal these guys are one of the best places to blow a clean eating streak.", "business_id": "ML1RJdeZ7bbfMrHvJ7m99A", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-03-17", "type": "review"}

Shortly there after we received our  Bruschetta Authentico (hmmm... reverse order)...  these was a huge plate of bread and the bruschetta mix. It was bland & tasteless and way too oily.  I live for bruschetta when I go to Italian Restaurants but skip this in the future - we even reread the descriptions a number of times trying to figure out why it was so horrible..... tomatoes were not rip for starters but the spices were just not right.  \n\nNow enter what they call Italian Flag Lasagna. It was simply the worst Lasagna we ever had. My dinner companion loves Lasagna and rarely complains about anything. He stopped eating it and pushed it aside as well and I had to ask him if his was as bad as mine was.  We both got it and neither of us could literally \"choke it down.\" The noodles were mush and the entire Lasagna had been obviously pre-cooked and microwaved. Costco frozen lasagna is better than this sorry excuse for an entree.  We basically asked the \"manager\" if anyone was looking at the items coming out of the kitchen because it simply shouldn't have been served. While they did not charge us for these items it is a sad state of affairs when an Italian place can't figure out lasagna.\n\nWe decided to strike Oregano's from our dinner list....", "business_id": "ML1RJdeZ7bbfMrHvJ7m99A", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-04-25", "type": "review"}

Before I could stop myself I climbed on top of the table and drenched them with my ice water. \"Can I enjoy my dinner please? Either cool it, or get a room. I came to review the food, not your french kissing.\"\n\nI came back to reality just as appetizers arrived. I would never do that or say that to friends...or would I?  \n\nAnyway, just like Donald Trump, Oregano's does everything real BIG so we honestly didn't need to order all this food, but none of us counts calories. That's so 90's.\n\nHere are my thoughts:  Four stars for the overly friendly staff and thin crust pizza. \n\npizza\nNot a fan of pan pizza or stuffed pizza. Oregano's really does 'em up, but looks aren't everything. I choose thin crust every time. Yummy.  Simple. Easy to eat. The thicker pies turn into cheesy messes and turn me off.  I get reminded of strings of spittle when the cheese pulls apart. I realize how this can be a turn on for some \nfood whores, but not me.  \n \nbruschetta \nPlease tell me what the big deal is. Anyone? It's bread, with stuff on top - but it's not pizza. If that's your thing, fine, but why do you think you fancy, huh? Oregano's bruschetta just looked sloppy. Big and sloppy. It literally looked like a mound of tomatoes with cheese and basil and some bread sticking out.\n\nguaca-tony\nHow do you say delicious, d-lovely, D-lectable, d-vine? How do you say D-gorgeous? D-lite? Guacamole was seasoned with basil, garlic, onions, and tomatoes. It was good, but I wish folks would stop putting tomatoes in guac.  The flavor gets watered down. What helped kick up the mildness were the accompanied cheesy salty pizza pie crust dipping slices. Good combination.\n\nyam fries/sweet po's\nYum yum piggy! Comes with aioli and sweet seasoning sprinkled on - which I could totally do without. Leave the natural sweetest alone. \n\nsalad \nOn a good day, crispy romaine lettuce is usually a sign of a good salad. But my first bite of Oregano's salad left me with the taste of bag/packaging in my mouth. It wasn't overpowering enough to stop eating, but a disappointment is just that. I regretted not requesting spinach in place of romaine.\n\nBEGIN SIDE NOTE\nBest salad at Oregano's: the delicious spinach salad with red onions, marinated portobello shrooms, roasted red bell pepper, and avocado dressing. But that's just a memory now. This salad was removed from the menu. Whose dumb \nidea was that?\nEND SIDE NOTE\n\nVeggie Wedgie sandwich.  \nSkip it. The foccacia bread is way too thick to even enjoy the flavor of the eggplant, portobellos, spinach, and tomatoes. It's served with red pepper aioli and for some reason I had the idea in my brain this should be spicy. It was not and fell flat.\n\nscampi\nThe love birdies thought the scampi was delicious. I can only give their opinions because I won't eat pasta, or paste noodles as I call them. Lady is a Scampi is shrimp with corkscrew pasta in chipotle sauce, tomatoes, cilantro, cheese, and garlic. The spicier version called El Diablo Shrimp Pasta is in chipotle cream sauce with fettuccine, cheese, and pico de gallo.\n\npizza cookie\nThe only dessert they serve. It's warm and topped with ice cream, but way sweet and a little raw. If that's how you go down on your cookies, go 'head playa!

I love it here. the vibe here is pretty upbeat, the crew's T-shirts are great. \"Legalize Marinara.\"  I love it. Both times I've been in I was served by Anissa. Once co-served by John. The experience couldn't be better. The food was served piping hot, the service was absolutely wonderful. The servers seem genuine in their charisma, charm and joy of serving. \n\nMy first trip, I had the Rig-a Tony. absolutely fabulous. The rigatoni was cooked al dente, the sauce was phenomenal, and the cheese melted and browned on top. Mmmm..mmm!\n\nMy second trip in, I had the angel hair pasta with meat sauce and a gigantic meatball. Again, the sauce was phenomenal. The pasta was cooked just right and the Meatball was crazy good. \n\nI love the display of old paintings and other old knick-knacks, it really reminds me of Grandma's house. I love that the recipes are the families own instead of a manufactured replica of a family tradition.\n\nAnd finally, I love the management here. Cynthia has a smile that lights up the room. Her professionalism is unmatched, as I've seen her in action with an unsavory guest. Handling the situation with vigor and resolve, yet still hitting the floor, if you will, unscathed. \n\n I would serious recommend anyone wanting GREAT Italian food and attentive, joyful service to come here.

They had the basketball game on TV in the background, and even have a live band on Friday and Saturday night - not sure on the type of music.  Give them a call to find out.   They serve the normal selection of pizza, pasta, subs and salads and even have a limited offering of beer and wine for the tipplers out there...\n\nBTW: The location is new - having relocated up the road to bigger digs (now at 5150 N 7th St. betw.

So, today I stopped on it. (Please note there is limited parking) So I walk in, pleasantly surprised to see a really nice establishment. Nice waiting area for To Go orders with 2 high top tables and a lunch counter. The menu is displayed really largely above the entrance to the dining room, so easy to read. They have take away menus to look at too. The guy at the counter was really pleasant as well. Now on to the food!\n\nThere was so much to choose from, including homemade lasagna, pizza, pasta, ravioli, sandwichs etc.  Very appealing menu options, I could hardly decide! Please note, they have gluten free and wheat options for crust and vegan and organic items too!! Great for ANYONE!\nI decided on the meal deal: 1 slice of pizza (1 topping), side salad, and 1 pop (or soda as AZ people say). All for $5.50 ($6.01 total) Great deal. So it only took around 5 mins and my order was ready. The pizza looked great! Not greasy and it had quality cheese and toppings and a good size slice! I got the mushroom as my topping (so good). The crust was crisp and delish. And the side salad was a nice healthy size as well. It has carrots, tomatoes, carrots, and cabbage slices on it. And the dressing, I chose was ranch. In fact, the dressing was that \"restaurant ranch\" that only true ranch dressing lovers will truely understand. :o) Great flavor  (not a glue-type quality like some places serve)\n\nOverall, great staff, nice setting, and good food!

There is really no waiter during lunch hours, and I'm not familiar with their dinner service, so I can't speak to this. You walk in, order at the counter, get your drinks, and find a table to sit. Once the food is ready, it is brought to your table along with plates & forks. \n\nThe wait time: Medium to Long. Depending on what you order, it can be on the long side. The longest we waited was 30 minutes to get 2 veggie and 2 meatball hot stuffed sandwiches, and 1 pizza (which we requested upon ordering to have it packed as 'to go'). If you are in a hurry or have a larger group, I suggest calling ahead and placing your order for eat-in.\n\nThe food: Dedicated Vegan Menu? Yes, please. Large portion Sizes? Absolutely. Tasty, flavorful comfort food? Right on target. This place was a hit with both my carnivore family members and co-workers, and my vegan preferences! Portion sizes are in fact very large, the hot stuffed sandwiches can easily feed 2 people, and if you order the calzone make sure you are going to share! \n\nVegan Menu: High ratings to the vegan veggieballs - they are flavorful and full of veggies! I was expecting them to have a consistency of seitan or soy, but that is not the case (as alluded to by the name...). Must try in their hot stuffed sandwich. \n\nCarnivore Menu: \"The Works\" pizza has an admirable # of toppings - these slices are packed with cheese, meat, and vegetables--definitely a winner. Also make sure to check out their Meatball Parmigiana hot stuffed sandwich - hefty portion of meat, sauce, and cheese - it's impressive.", "business_id": "auorqdHiATGZHVd-sd79ZQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-05-15", "type": "review"}

I was told it would be ready in 15 minutes, to which I thought was pretty fast.  As the gentleman who was taking my order was ready to hang up, I said \"Don't you need my name and number?\".

I let them know I'm here to pick up my pizza that I ordered via phone and go on to describe it to them.  One guy tells the other what I ordered, conveniently ducks out as the other guy THEN begins to make it. REALLY?\n\nSo I stop him and tell him why did I order over the phone if they had no intention of making it until I got there?  He looks at me and all of a sudden can't seem to understand English and goes back to making the pizza.\n\nNice try JERKS.  I tell him to forget it as I will take my business elsewhere.\n\nApparently this is done because they do not trust the customer to show up and pay.

That is Wednesay for those of you with kids and it's a good deal.  I will eventually put together a list of Kids Eat Free places in the area.  For now let me tell you about NYPD.....\n\nThe pizza is a winner!  Nice crust, great topppings!  They use paper thin slices of sausage instead of hunks of sausage.  The flavore is great too.  My daughter had a slice of black olive pizza and they were very generous with the olives....she loved it!  I have had the ceaser and the house salads and both were good and fresh.  \n\nSo for the Kids Eat Free night adults need to order an entree (I think this includes a whole pizza too, not sure though) There were several things to choose from including cheese ravioli, baked ziti, and  lasagne.  I chose the lasagne and it was delish!  Piping hot with melted mozeralla over the top, I could not stop eating it!!  The flavors melded together nicely and it reminded me of my Mom's lasagne.  And did I mention the bread......OMG!!  The little ibites of heaven are sooooo good!!  I could have eaten ten of them!!  They are homemade, the real deal, yeasty goodness!!  Warm and just a little chewy, the flavor was amazing!!  \nOh and the Desert Flower Ice Tea.....so refreshing!!!  I keep thinking about it, that's how good it is!!\n\nTry the canollis.....you won't be disappointned.  Kids get an ice cream sundae with their meal.

Long-story-short, we ordered the Thai Chicken Pizza without cilantro. The pizza arrived with cilantro. I had one bite after my partner had one piece. After the bite, I notified the server that there was cilantro.

He did not offer his name, but immediately apologized for the inconvenience which we appreciated. He, however, continued with informing us that there was no cilantro on the pizza. Then asked us, \"Did you not want scallions on there, because it was scallions on the pizza, not cilantro.\" I informed him that I tasted and saw cilantro, which I had pointed out to the server. He replied with, \"No, they did not put any cilantro on the pizza!\" To which I replied, \"Well I don't know...I didn't put cilantro on the pizza.\" To which he replied, \"Well, the new pizza will be here shortly,\" as he walked away.\n\nI have a few serious issues with this managerial approach. First, it is unprofessional to insinuate that any guest is lying.

I've driven by the center literally hundreds of times over the years, and have never noticed the pizza shop.  It was only just recently that I noticed them, based on their sign on the street advertising the lunch special of two slices and a soda for $3.99.  Fast forward to a few weeks later when I was sitting at my desk pondering where to go, but being unable to decide.  My memory bank finally remembered Frank's and away I went.\n\nI gotta admit, I was extremely nervous going in.  Here it was, right in prime lunch hour and there was nary a soul to be seen, other than the guy working there who was in the back (maybe it was Frank!).  Anywho, takes me order, and goes back to make the pie and I sat down and waited.  And waited a little bit more.  Then a guy came in and 'Frank' came out and chatted with him as they appeared to know each other.  Then a little more waiting happened.  I thought it was taking way too long as this point, seems at any other 'slice' joint I go to (Ray's/NYPD/etc.), it's just a few minutes.  Finally, 'Frank' brings my slices out and apologies to me that they were in the oven too long and would I like him to make new ones.  Well...I looked at that pizza, and all I saw was golden brown delicious cheese staring at me.  Which to me, is great when you have nice golden brown cheese.  So I told him no need, it looked great to me, and I started to chow down.\n\nWhile the temperature was hot, and I kind of burned my mouth a bit (stupid lack of self control to wait for it to cool), the pizza was terrific.  I mentioned the cheese before, but the crust was also very good, being nice and crispy on the bottom.  And then, when I got to the thick part, not only was the crust nice and chewy, the bottom was still crispy.  \n\nOverall, a good couple slices of pie.

It's filled with so much charm and romance we both were simply glowing with post dinner elation. The place, Vincent's Market Bistro is the scaled down version of the fine dining classic Vincent's of Camelback. It's funny that a place like this is so well hidden without even a hint of signage beyond a sandwich board on the street. Just look for the main Vincent's sign and follow it around back to the Market Bistro entrance, they're housed in the same building. \n\nChef and owner Vincent Guerithault keeps the menu decidedly French with hints of Southwestern flare that he's so famous for. You should look this guy up; he's got some accolades including a James Beard award under his belt. Does kudos translate to good cookery, you bet!\n \nFor one of my favorites, be sure to look for the Curly Endive Salad ($9) with mustard dressing, bacon, and a poached egg. I saw it, I ordered it, I swooned over it. A well balanced ratio of salty, sweet and sour then fresh cracked pepper completes the equation. \n\nPizza offerings are done well with a tender pale crust that seemed more akin to pastry then to your typical chewy crispy offering. Tarte Flamb\u00e9e ($8) was topped with a light cream sauce, bacon, onion and thyme. Another pork laden pizza was the Caprese ($8) topped with pesto, arugula, mozzarella and prosciutto. I just wished that the greens were put on after cooking instead of before.\n\nFor dinner you'll find classics including the cooked in its own fat Crispy Duck Confit ($16) with lentils and bacon, sensing a porky theme here? The tender mallard leg was succulent and intense in flavor while the lentils performed well by countering the richness of the meat. For something a little bit lighter, I use that word loosely, order up the Coq au Vin ($10). Red wine braised chicken served atop gratin potatoes were hearty and comforting. \n\nVincent's Market Bistro also offers a $20, 3 course Prix Fixe menu. On my last visit delights were abound with the likes of creamy Butternut Squash Ravioli, Rainbow Trout and a scrumptiously sour Lemon Tart. This has to be one of the best deals in town that I know of. I mean really, food from a James Beard award winning chef at these prices is unheard of. \n\nGreat food, good prices and excellent service all set in a romantic atmosphere, well; there is one caveat, the hours. Vincent's Market Bistro closes at 8pm, so plan on eating early. We arrived around 6pm on a Saturday night and by 7pm the place was completely filled.

The staff were well trained and didn't falter even when there were a lot of demands on them from hungry customers.\nThe croisants that were served rather quickly were warm, buttery and very hard to resist.\nWe both chose the Prix Fixe dinner.  My husband had the mushroom raviolis which were served in a rich sauce and were very flavorful.  I had the caesar salad which was a little larger than I expected, but it could have used a little more dressing.  The lamb dinner consisted of four perfectly prepared chops, along with potatoes  dauphinois and snap peas.  For our dessert course I chose the Profiterole which is a tower of small, ice cream filled puff pastries.  This was good.  My husband ordered the peach tart and was somewhat disappointed.  The peaches were not as tender as they could have been.  This may have been due to re-heating the pastry.\nMy husband and several of the \"regulars\" we spoke to agreed that Vincent Market Bistro serves some of the best lamb served in the valley.\nOn our next visit, we will arrive around 5:30 instead of 6:30 to avoid the crowd.  The regulars park just to the west of the Bistro when the free parking spots are filled.  The wine can be a bit pricey so check the price before ordering.

Scottsdale friend here for her Birthday Dinner based on reviews from some friends on Yelp and were blown away with every aspect of this Beautiful Market Bistro. Once you find the entrance and park your car you walk up to a colorful patio decorated like you would see in a French painting by Claude Monet. You notice everyone there enjoying themselves with a glass of fine wine and a table full of tasty goodies. The inside is interestingly charming and colorfully decorated in the same eloquent fashion. Nice.\n\nWe got there early to avoid the crowds and it was perfect. We were also greeted instantly and told to sit wherever we wanted. The server showed up faster than if I had a magic wand. He informed us of the specials while he got our drink orders going as well as bringing us a complementary plate of some of the best tasting buttery croissants I have ever had before. We asked a few questions and he happily answered us with no hesitation and was most informative.\n\nWe started with the Smoked Salmon Quesadilla with Dill & Horseradish Cream for $10 and it was delicious. For entr\u00e9es, the ladies ordered Saut\u00e9ed Salmon with Herb Rice and Basil Beurre Blanc for $12.50 and Beef Bourguignon with Mashed Potatoes for $14. I selected the Seafood Skewer with Pesto Sauce and Scalloped Potatoes for $13 off the specials menu. We were all amazed at how nicely the vegetables were cooked just right. The fresh ingredients, textures and flavors were spectacular with all the dishes. Could not help asking for another plate of croissants to sop up all the extra juices and sauces since I was told by the wife not to lick the plate. When we thought we were done the server brings each of us a small plate of flourless chocolate cake topped with a mini scoop of vanilla ice cream and a drizzle of chocolate syrup. Yummo!\n\nWe had such a great time there and the bill was very reasonable for the quality of the food and the friendly service we received. We will definitely be coming back again sooner than later.

As a way of getting more customers in the door, they are offering smaller menus consisting of more economical dishes almost as an introduction to their unique cuisine.  Binkley's now has numerous Cafe Bink locations that offer this experience and others are following suit.  Including, apparently, Vincent Guerithault.\n\nI have to give HUGE props to my date for discovering this spot that I never knew even existed until tonight.  I've been to Vincent On Camelback more than once and was a little nervous when she told me she wanted Vincent for dinner.  I know their food is good, but pretty spendy.  But before I could raise an objection she mentioned they now have a bistro offering a cheaper menu next door.  Wha?\n\nSure enough I met her here after work for dinner and as I traverse the narrow parking lot past Vincent's mothership, there's the bistro.  A small nook tucked in the middle of an already tucked away restaurant.  The bistro has a small outdoor patio with the rest of the dining area opening up to the patio.  On a perfect weather evening like tonight, its a great indoor/outdoor setup.  Altogether the bistro can seat somewhere around 25-30 people tops.  Not big, but not cramped either.  The walls, the paintings, and the music still feel like Vincent, but in a much more relaxed casual setup.\n\nThe menu offers one of three different dining options.  You can order a la carte, a $25 prix fixe menu consisting of three courses (which change everyday), or you can order from their menu of pizzas.  The pizzas seem a little out of place here since the theme is predominantly French, but I didn't order those so that's neither here nor there.  The prix fixe menu had some interesting options that evening, but there was one a la carte dish that immediately caught my attention.  Duck confit.  When done right, duck confit is amazing as I've had a ridiculously good duck confit dish at Zinc Bistro in Scottsdale.  The dish here was served with lentils and bacon.  The duck was tender and the meat fell off the bone with ease.  The savoriness of the duck and the heartiness of the bacon paired tremendously and the portion was just the right size.  Prior to the main event, we split a three cheese tarine.  Essentially a plate of three cheese bruschetta.  The bread slices weren't big, but super rich.  Paired very well with the wines we had.  We actually didn't order dessert, but we each got a chocolate brownie piece with vanilla bean ice cream on the house.  A tasty way to top off the night and oh yeah it was complimentary!  Our server was extremely polite and soft spoken and the pace of the meals were spot on.  Both of us left full, but not uncomfortably so.\n\nAll totaled, two glasses of wine, the bruschetta appetizer, a pair of main courses, two desserts, and tip was $70.  Far cheaper than Vincent's parent restaurant, while still offering the quality service, ambience, and flavors that Vincent is known for.  I would still recommend Vincent's parent restaurant for the ultimate French cuisine experience as their dishes are even more imaginative.  But for those looking to just dip their toes into Vincent's menu or looking for a cheaper alternative, the Bistro makes for a tremendous plan B.", "business_id": "oc0Wl6ktfMLb5VZ2Uz6M2A", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-04-07", "type": "review"}

Their service is fantastic. It is an expensive restaurant, with the entrees in the mid thirties each, but worth every penny. I hate spending a lot of money and leaving a place underwhelmed, but I'll happily spend it at a place like this!\n\nOn the down side, this is the only restaurant this week, so far, that when I told them I wouldn't be eating dessert, they didn't sub out something else. I forgive them a bit considering of all the places, they are taking the biggest hit in terms of average revenue per table during restaurant week, but let me compare this to two years ago...\n\nTwo years ago a fourth guest spontaneously joined my table of three. Then she said she wasn't eating, she just wanted to hang out... I was a bit embarrassed by this, but said nothing. Then she started to eat off of everyone's plates! During restaurant week, that's completely unacceptable, and they could have been quite justified in charging us a plate sharing fee (which this year is $20).\n\nInstead, Vincent's showed their incredible finesse and taste. They brought her an empty plate to make her food stealing easier! Then, at dessert time, they didn't ask what we wanted, they just bought one of each of the four available desserts! They said, \"well there were four of you, so we just thought you would like one of each.\" Even though she didn't pay a dime. This was a deeply classy way to say we see what you are doing but will not stoop to your level...\n\nI left a large tip (about 33%), and have told countless people about how Vincent's is the number one date place on my list for great food and service above and beyond any I've ever seen.\n\nSo this year (my sixth time going, three during restaurant week, three regular visits), it was really disappointing that they didn't even try to be creative with me. And no, it was not busy when we were there. I almost feel like the waitress didn't even ask or something and made the call herself.  I bet a manager would have come to explain if they had made that call. The difference between two years ago was a real disappointment.  But what I did eat was of course fantastic. The lobster roll was perfect on a slightly sweet roll, the ravioli was delicious and delicate. Just what I expected.\n\nSo I am only rating them four stars for this review for their lack of empathy and creativity, and for being less amazing than they used to be. But it really is my favorite date place so maybe next year, I'll give them the star back.", "business_id": "oc0Wl6ktfMLb5VZ2Uz6M2A", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-05-24", "type": "review"}

I want to believe that, I truly do. But what happened needs to be addressed.\n\nFirst off, I've been here before. I came here with my husband, his brother, and the brothers bf. We had an absolute FABULOUS time. Our server was attentive,  kind, and charming. The food was hot and fresh, and our drinks were never empty... That was the first time.\n\nThis time could not have been more opposite. First, no one was a designated host/hostess. So, servers would come outside, ask how many people were in a party, then disappear. And this would happen more than once so now there are two or more servers looking for a table. Often for different parties, so you can imagine the confusion. When we were finally seated we were pointed to the general direction of the table and asked to sit. And sit we did for 10 minutes without water or menus. Not even a run by from the server to let us know that he will be right with us. Nada. At the 10 minute mark menus were all but thrown at us by a server. Still no communication. \n\nThen our server, Elijah I believe greeted us about 5 minutes later. He took our drink order and our brunch order, since we had more than enough time to decide, and ran off. Our drinks came 10 minutes later, along with no eye contact and a muttering of \"I'll have your croissants in a minutes\". 30 minutes later, no joke, we got our croissants. They were cold and hard as rocks on the ends and did not come with the preserves they generally come with. Then 5 minutes later came our cheese plate. And then 20 minutes after that my husband got his ham and gruyere omelet and I got a plate of something that was not my order. I had the runner take it back and continued to wait for my plate. Thankfully I only had to wait a couple additional minutes for my Ni\u00e7oise salad. Salad people. \n\nAlso, please keep in mind during that whole time, not once did the server come back. My husband had long since been out if iced tea and my mimosa glass was empty :(. We received not quite refills about 5 minutes after we received our plates. Meaning a carafe of tea was handed to my husband to serve himself and sparkling wine (half of a mimosa) was poured into my glass without a word spoken. \n\nI will conclude with this. It was busy, but I have been a server before. I know what running around like a mad person looks like and what flat out ignoring a table looks like. Our server was chatting up other tables, so he obviously wasn't too rushed, right? We left a nice tip because we are nice people, but we will not be going through that again.

I've been here dozens of times and probably have tried just about everything on the menu. My favorites are the pork loin, beef bourguignon, or any of the daily prix-fixe menus. The plates are a modest size, so I recommend the prix fixe menu or an appetizer salad if you are starved. Before you order, the server brings you a plate of buttery homemade croissants. After every meal you are given a complimentary dessert. Frankly, if you're on a budget, you can order just a main plate (with the free croissants and dessert) and you will leave the Bistro full and satisfied with a $15 ish dent in your wallet. On the other extreme, you can have a decadent 3 or 4 course meal with a bottle of French wine and easily pay upwards of $50 a person. The food is all served on beautiful vintage Villeroy & Boch china with whimsical patterns of flowers or horses. The space of the Bistro is intimate: tightly packed tables, no hostess stand, low ceilings. I love it. The customers here tend to be a bit older and I've never seen kids at the Bistro.", "business_id": "oc0Wl6ktfMLb5VZ2Uz6M2A", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-05-13", "type": "review"}

My toppings included black olives, mushrooms and artichokes.  My boyfriend enjoyed the baked ziti. \n\nWe have been driving past this place forever and always want to stop in. Last night when we were decided what to do for dinner I said, let's have pizza and let's look on Yelp for a recommendation.  We decided that Slice of Sicily would be our choice based on closeness to our apartment and the good reviews it received.    \n\nWe drive up and get a spot right in front!  Hooray for good luck!  There were only two people eating inside so we picked out a table and took a seat.  The tables were all red and white checkered and the walls full of Italian maps and posters.  The west wall was an interesting mural of an Italian landscape with bare trees and sunflowers.  The decor reminded me of how much I missed Italy. \n\nWe took a look at the menu, ordered and looked on the huge map of Italy next to us.  I asked Gary if he knew where I was born... he knew it was up north.  So I showed him, I also showed him the placed I lived in Italy and the place we are going to retire too.  He always laughs when I say that.  He doesn't know how serious I am!\n\nOur waitress was nice and between her and the owner we got everything we needed.  The owner's family is from Sicily, but her mother was born in the states.  \n\nOur food was fantastic.  I no longer need to drive all the way to NYPD for New York Style Pizza, I can drive up the street to Slice of Sicily.\n\nThere was a nice steady stream of people in and out of the restaurant.  They do many to go orders.  They had many regulars.  We will definitely be regulars. \n\nI would have given this place 5 stars but when we ordered two canolli's they went back to grab them and came out empty  handed.  They unfortunately were out of canolli batter.  We were a little disappointed but said we'd be back for more pizza and canolli another time.\n\nI definitely recommend this restaurant if you like family owned pizza places and great New York style pizza. \n\nI hope this review is beyond satisfactory to those who take this site way way way too seriously.

When I first learned of Pat's it was via yelp and the reviews on the joint made me think I was about to be dealing with a pizza nazi. That couldn't be further from the truth. So far I've ordered about 5 times and have yet to have any problems, that includes me making a last minute request for blue cheese instead of the standard ranch for our wings.\n\nI love this joint! I love 30 wings and a large pepperoni for roughly 23 bucks!\n\nTheir pizza is good, darn good. It's not the best I've ever had but it ranks up there. What does that mean to you? I don't know, but it's good pizza. The crust has a good taste and the sauce isn't overly sweet or nasty looking. It's good stuff.\n\nThe wings are fried, as they should be, and the sauce is pretty good. Personally I think it could stand a little more kick but hey, it's still good stuff.\n\nThe only problem I had was a problem that is pretty typical for a neighborhood pizza joint and that was that the cheesecake we ordered was still partially frozen. We all know that nobody is slaving away making cheesecakes at your typical pizza joint so I wasn't upset that it was frozen, but I was disappointed that I had to let it thaw out. That's it, that's my big complaint. You don't go to this joint for atmosphere, it's like the size of a bedroom in an apartment, you go to pick up your pizza and head home. Maybe you stop in for a slice at lunch or something but to demand atmosphere from such a small joint is silly.\n\nAnyways, I love this place!", "business_id": "GvwDppcJLm9lso9iS2hSIw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-03-02", "type": "review"}

Pats was one that we tried once, and will never try again. Let me state my story.\n\nSo one night, I decided that we should try Pat's Pizza Plus. I called ahead, ordered 1 large pepperoni pizza. They said that it would take about thirty minutes, so I waited a while and drove there. I got there thirty minutes from that time, and was told my pizza was not ready yet. So I sat and waited in their tiny lobby. Eventually, my overpriced pizza was ready, and I drove home.\n\nI set the pizza on my counter, opened the box and looked inside. This thing looked terrible. There were literally POOLS of grease. I understand, New york style pizza, But this was ridiculous. So I grabbed a paper towel or 10, patted down both the top and the bottom of the pizza, and made it bearable.\n\nI took a bite of the pizza and literally had to tear at it like a wolf to even get a mouthful off of the slice. It was very similar to trying to eat cardboard. It was ridiculous. Myself, My father, and my Mother didn't even make it through our first slices before throwing the \"pizza\" away and looking elsewhere for food. Apparently the crust is one of Pat's strong suits, but how the heck could you even make it to the crust when it's like that? I wasn't about to go for it. \n\nHonestly, if this happened to me again, I'd definitely take the pizza back to them and demand my money back. I've had pizza from Little Caesars that blew that pizza away. Maybe I just got a bad pizza, but any time I hear the name Pat's Pizza, I want to vomit and I recommend elsewhere. \n\nGood luck with this place..", "business_id": "GvwDppcJLm9lso9iS2hSIw", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-04-01", "type": "review"}

I got an \"everything\" and a plain cheese, got it for delivery, to be paid in cash (I thought that was a good way to go with the other reviews...)\nComplaint - the delivery took a lot longer than expected. Almost an hour. On a week day (not Friday or Saturday). This was kind of irritating, when I was quoted 30 min.\nBut stuff happens. Delivery guy eventually called asking for directions.\n(Nice gesture, they stuck in a few take-out menus on our box for future use!)\n\nI'm from Boston. I'm picky about my pizza. I hate deep-dish doughy crust nonsense. \nIt's just gotta be crispy - it shouldn't be soggy anywhere, and the sauce should be good and tomato-ey without having too much garlic or salt. Semi-sweet. Cheese should be melty and gooey without being glue-y. Pat's hit the mark.\nPizzas come in small or large. The crust was lightly floured and crisp all the way through - something that lead me off the bandwagon of Spinato's (Square slices are also just somewhat... odd) \nWhile I am begrudged to give a good review for New York pizza, Pat's just made themselves a new customer. \nJust don't expect me to cheer on the Yankees.", "business_id": "GvwDppcJLm9lso9iS2hSIw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-03-06", "type": "review"}

I'm sensing a lot more exercise in my future to offset the caloric intake (and yes, I did have them add a cannoli to my order)... anyway... back to the pizza!\n\nIt's probably good that I drive a stick-shift car because it was all that I could do to not grab a piece and start munching on my ride back home. After seeing all the other pizzas at the restaurant and imagining how they tasted, the smells permeating my car were like an intoxicating siren's call. After an extremely long, ten minute drive back to my house, I was finally able to open up the box that contained my treasure: a Greek pizza... Kalmata olives, banana peppers, red onion, artichoke hearts, feta & mozzarella cheeses piled on top of a crust that I would call just about perfect.", "business_id": "kxDGexkbP30fBvxVI0CzFQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-05-14", "type": "review"}

They even roll out the dough for each individual order. And like everyone else mentioned, they staff there was really polite and friendly. All said and done I spent $10, and felt like it was worth it. I'll be back, and next time I'll try their pizza.\n\nUPDATED 5/22/12 - Had the meatball sub a 2nd time, and the bread was not soggy even with the extra cheese.

Seriously, Ray's is the gold standard by which we judge all pizza joints that we visit --- in AZ and beyond.\n\nStaff can be grumpy (also NY style! ;-)), but they warm up to the many regulars that frequent this place.  To us, when it comes to pizza, taste trumps service and ambience any day of the week!\n\nWalls are decorated with NY and AZ sports memorabilia, and behind the counter you'll see photos of the main proprietor as a young teenager working at a pie shop in Brooklyn with (presumably) his dad.  Yep, pizza runs in the family here...and you'll appreciate it at first bite!\n\nTIP: Free pitcher of soda with a whole pizza, which I think is unadvertised, so ask about it when you order.   UPDATE: Not sure this is still valid, but there is usually a Yelp special in place.\n\nThey do deliver, but only on orders of (I think) $100 or more...\n\nIncidentally, there are several Ray's Pizza shops in the Valley.  We haven't visited them all, but this one trumps (bad pun) all of the ones that we've visited in terms of awesome tasting pies.  \n\nRay's at 3rd St and Bell Rd can't be beat!", "business_id": "V3lQtk1LgwAEcF9j-BzchA", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-05-01", "type": "review"}

So my last review about this place I was upset a little not because the food was bad or anything it was actually good but I am  always getting teased about being hispanic and not able to even eat the mild sauce from taco bell without sweating and panting with my tongue for a drink. Lol\nBut I had ordered mild and received hot last time and wasn't pleased because I honestly at 4 wings and the rest sat in the fridge for a week before I threw them out. I had called and someone offered me 12 wings and I thought it was fair but I am not the type to really complain or go running to get free food like some people would do but needless to say I was contacted by vinnie and offered to replace my whole order and even a pizza. I offered to pay for the pizza because again I am not a free food person. I know nothing in this world is free unless it's your birthday then there is an exception. Ha ha ha\nWell I met with vinnie and he was awesome and very friendly and approachable I got the pizza and wings and able to eat the wings this time it was amazing. Best wings I have had in years they were juicy and crunchy and not small. I have been to some places where the wings are so small you get like one and a half bite of it but these wings are huge and the pizza that I was able to try for the first time was amazing as well. The cheese was flowing and piping hot and the sauce has to be a secret recipe past down from a family genius because it was perfect and not too over spiced or sweet. I am so glad he contacted me to try it out again and I know that our family Friday night pizza will be ordered from this place going forward in the future.  My kids even ate the crust and not sure about other people's kids but for mine to eat the crust it's nothing short of a miracle. Awesome food and great people and I will continue to be a repeat customer and I think that if you are reading reviews to figure which pizza place to try then look no further because this place is not expensive, delicious and will feed the whole family for under 25 bucks.

I passed by this pizza joint on my way to and from a Chinese restaurant nearby.  One day, I asked someone leaving with a takeout box, whom I'd seen before, if the food was any good.  She raved about \"East coast pizza\".  So, the next day I stopped at Ray's instead of my normal Chinese.   I'm hooked!  I'm working my way through the menu; to date I've had pizzas, calzone, stromboli (!!!!), wings, lasagna, and Italian subs.   Spectacular food, great taste experiences, and always enough to take home.  Authentic East coast experience that I've not had since leaving college in PA; my roommate was from NYC and I visited weekends, often.\n\nThis is not a place for the budget conscious, although they do offer two giant slices and a drink for under $5.00; a meal popular with the students from a nearby beauty school who stream in at lunch hour.  Giant pizzas, with numerous ingredient options, cost $17 - $20 and serve 3-4 people.  Me, I eat two slices of my giant pizza; take six home, and have breakfast and lunch the next day.  Yes, it's that good.\n\nRay's is about 3 blocks away via my powered wheelchair.  Their staff is always ready to move things around to make room for me; but I would not describe the restaurant as particularly mobility accessible.  How good is their food?  The panhandler on the corner at 7th and Bell, asked if I was coming from Ray's, and could he have a piece of pizza, rather than the normal couple of bucks I give him.  Yeah, that good.\n\nHere's the problem - once you start eating their pizza; you'll never be able to stomach chain store pizza again.\n\nBig screen TV in corner always tuned to sports.  This is not a restaurant for ambience, or a lingering date night; but a great place for an authentic East coast pizzeria experience.\n\nHighly recommended; I'm the guy in the wheelchair, eating at Ray's, 2-3 times per week.", "business_id": "V3lQtk1LgwAEcF9j-BzchA", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-04-01", "type": "review"}

We arrived right around 6:00pm and the wait was 30-35 minutes for a table  (Note:  This was odd as they have a patio with 5-10 tables, yet it didn't appear that they were seating anyone out there...not sure if it was because it was so windy?).  We decided to put in a order to-go instead.  Twenty five minutes later, our order was ready.\n\nWe ordered the Mamma's Signature pizza, which comes with baby spinach, diced tomatoes and garlic.  On the way back, I  was worried that the pizza wasn't going to be as good as I remembered and that I had built it up too much in my mind.  Nope, it was still delicious.  The nice sweet sauce and the crispy crust on the outside, it was great.  (The middle pieces seemed to get a little soggy, but I blame that on the drive home, rather than anything Spinato's did...).  Even the wife said it was better than she remembered, so it looks like there may be more Spinato's in my future!  The only downside was that we did not order any of their delicious garlic bread (one battle at a time!).  \n\nI give Spinato's four stars due to the deliciousness of the pizza and the fact that I'll likely make return visits.

When I called to let them know I couldn't make it they were more concerned for my personal safety then a pizza that didn't get picked up.  About 30 minutes later, I got a phone call from Spinatos asking if I still wanted my pizza because they were going to deliver it for free.  While I was already upset with the accident, their kindness overwhelmed me.  They had known I had a rough night and wanted to make it better.  This may sound dramatic, but in a fast paced city these guys restored my faith in humanity.

The pizza is pretty high quality and made with very fresh ingredients.  The sauce (a little too sweet for me) has a very unique taste and certainly did not come from out the the can that most places use.  The website is easy to navigate and awesome for online orders.  The girl at the pickup counter was as friendly as could be.\n\nSo why only three stars?\n\nIt's probably for the same reason I only gave the Tempe location three stars a couple years back when I lived down there.  Spinato's is one of those places that is so close, but feels so far.  I live just over four miles away, so they don't deliver to my house.  Not having the time to dine out, but able to spear a few minutes to drive over, my fianc\u00e9 and I  decided to give the place a try.  During that drive I passed more pizza places than I could count which left me begging the question is it worth it?  To be honest, I didn't think so.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it's a good pizza.  I did like the Mamma Spinato's signature fresh spinach.  We also had the traditional vegetarian, which was an enjoyable pie.  Perhaps if I had dined-in, I would have enjoyed my meal a whole lot more.

Uncle Sam's has what is arguably the cheapest Happy Hour drinks in all the Valley. Beer is a buck a pint and a half bottle of wine for 5 bucks! It goes until 7, so we usually squeak in just under the gun. The \"Bail Out Plan\" menu is also incredibly varied and cheap. They do lots of mailings and coupons as well. The food is good (not great), but always seems to satisfy! Service varies, but is generally quite speedy and good. The servers look somewhat hustled and overworked. \nI wish I could give the place a quick update of style and maybe some new floors, tables, and a different layout. It seems too crowded with tables and can get really loud. Word of advice: sit in the \"front half\". The back seems even more conducive to a panic attack from sitting literally right next to another table. They need a re-brand and some new plates and silverware. There is a small patio out front with some concrete tables. You can tell they keep the place clean, it just needs a makeover. We unfortunately have sat by some fellow patrons lately who seem to fight, forget they are adults in public and really seem to bring the place down. For these negatives, I give 3 stars. Uncle Sam's sure tries, but there is unfortunately some work to be done! \nHowever, if you like cheaply priced beer, wine and food, this place is for you!

Any business that is willing to lose a customer over a few cents doesn't deserve to be in business.

In the meantime, a waitress was bussing the table behind us and was extremely loud talking to another employee. And when I say loud, I mean LOUD. But that's not what bothered me. What bothered me is what she said... \"WOW! I didn't think they were going to tip me that much because they were black!\" Referring to the family at the table that had just left.  This is absolutely unacceptable, and I don't care what age, race, or what establishment you work in. Advice to the owners/managers- don't hire ignorant staff! Aside from that the food was just okay. Pizza was comparable to something that comes out of a frozen-food box, mozzarella sticks came out luke-warm (meaning the cheese was hard) and french fries were comparable to what you get in a grade-school cafeteria. \n\nSecond time we were here we came for what we thought would be a quick lunch. Serivce was so absolutely slow an incompetent. I ordered a garden salad (or whatever version of that is the small version) and the lettuce came out soggy and there was water at the bottom of the salad bowl. Talk about unappetizing. The whole meal service took nearly an hour and twenty minutes. So much for a quick lunch.. '\n\nThe third and last time I came here, I came with the idea that maybe \"the third time's a charm.\" Boy was I wrong. I ordered the dinner Ceasar salad, boyfriend ordered a small 7\" pizza with buffalo sauce instead of marinara, and we shared a side of fries. \nMy salad came out with the most unappetizing lettuce I have ever eaten in my life. The lettuce was wilted and nearly rotten, and seemed as if the romaine was cut in half (referencing the large pieces of lettuce). His pizza came out with barbeque sauce instead of buffalo. The waitress took it back, but when she did she took the tray and poked and prodded her fingers around the pizza to ensure that it was barbecue and not buffalo. Regardless of the fact that we didn't eat it that's still disgusting. \n\nAside from the terrible food and service, this place is dirty (and by dirty that's a compliment) and dingy and is nothing impressive to look at.

The key to making pizza with crispy crust is to have ovens that great sufficiently hot.  That is why I like places with brick over pizza's. They don't use Brick Ovens at Red Devil but  I have been told that Red Devil has some really old pizza ovens that are not available any longer or hard to get.  I can't verify that, I don't even remember who told me that, maybe I read it some where.  Don't know if it is true or not. What I do know is that Red Devil is one of my favorite pizza place in the Valley.  Their pizza is consistently good.  Thin-Crisp and delicious.  I have had pasta's and salads there as well. They are fine, nothing to get excited about. But the Pizza at Red Devil is something I will stake my reputation on.  Actually I don't really have a reputation, but if I did I would lay it on the line for Red Devil Pizza. The long and short of it is, I am very passionate about their Pizza.

Save some of that Italian dressing (presented on the side) to use as a dipping sauce for your pizza crust.  Instant breadsticks!  Speaking of pizza, Red Devil's graces a thin yet doughy crust with tangy sauce and generous evenly-distributed toppings.

If they are hurting for money to where they need your charge for extra ranch, when a small portion is given to start with, perhaps they should bake the cost of the $ .50 ranch in the price of their pizza/wings. \n\nAnother issue is that were were not told that there was a charge for the extra ranch. If we would have been told, were would have just laughed at the fact that they were being cheap, and still ordered it. But we only discovered the charge when we were given the bill. When I asked the waitress about the charge she said, \"Yea we charge here, we make it homemade\". I told her that she did not provide us with that information when we asked for it, nor was the extra charge stated on the menu.

We couldn't decide whether we wanted pasta or pizza so we settled on sharing both pasta and pizza. The waiter suggested that we try to the bolognese pasta and that came out first. The sauce was so tasty and the pasta with the cheese inside was cooked so perfectly. It was really awesome. \n\nWhen the pizza came out we were a little weary because it didn't look like anything special but we were so wrong! It was sooooo good. We got whole pepperoni and half sausage and half black olives. The pizza was hands down the best thing we have had in this city. We recommend it to anyone who enjoys pizza.

Didn't want to eat at their food court.  (Even though I really like the PHO at their Ginger Star food court stand).  No.  I wanted a sit down dinner with really good italian food. After all, it was Saturday night.  I gave them a call before I headed out.  These days you never know who has gone out of business the day before. Things are just that volatile in the restaurant business.  They answered and I asked if I needed reservations.  The man said, to be safe, reserve.  OK, reservations for two it is.  \nWhen we got there all the tables were empty minus two.  There was one with an acrylic sign on it that read \"RESERVED\" at one of the tables.  Before I could open my mouth to tell them that I had reservations, a young lady pointed to a table in the back corner and brusquely told us to \"sit there\".  The table with the \"RESERVED\"sign on it was a better situated table, but I didn't want any conflict so I sat where I was told to sit. \nWe were served a mix of olive oil, herbs and balsamic vinegar with some fresh bread by yet another server.  A tall, young, attractive african american woman who seemed to glide as she walked. Very graceful.  The bread was fresh enough but nothing to get excited about. Reminded me of hot dogs rolls split in half, but they were not.  The dipping sauce was not very tasty and as usual I added a few flecks of salt to amp up the flavors.  Needed something, but as I was here to eat and not to cook, I didn't bother trying to figure out what was lacking.  I got it!!!  A few fresh garlic cloves and some freshly chopped basil would have done it!   \nWe ordered the Chicken Marsala & Chicken Piccata which came with a salad and a side of pasta for $17 each.  The internet indicated the price as $16 but we all know it takes time to update a website so we accepted the up charge.  The salad was iceberg lettuce, a few pieces of tomato, two black olives, two slivers of red cabbage, two slivers of carrots and mozzarella cheese.  It was ok for what it was-- a side salad.  Hubby kept counting the ingredients in it as he had visions of the salad I make him nightly one hour before his dinner.  It has many, many ingredients: mixed greens,  Kale, red cabbage, broccoli crowns, radishes, walnuts, grape tomatoes, red onion, cranberries-- sometimes feta cheese or blue cheese depending ..in a tangerine or apple cider vinegar vinaigrette . They are indeed hearty, healthy delicious salads.  I think he is spoiled to the core, don't you?  So what I was thinking as he counted the ingredients?  \"Shut up, you're not home.  Eat it and smile\".  \nOur entrees arrived, one marsala, one piccata.  Each has two slices of chicken breast in their respective sauces.  The slices were very, very, very thin.  I would say that they were about 1/4 in thickness.  No kidding. No fooling.  Both dishes had sliced mushrooms on them.  Mine had two pieces of artichokes (I think from a can) and a minor sprinkling of mini-capers.  I could have done without the artichokes--added nothing to the dish.  I could have used more capers.  I love capers.  I think that's why I order the dish.  I like the lemony, caperish taste on the meat and sauce.  The sauce was not lemony enough or \"caperish\" enough.  And the sauce was runny--on both dishes.  Hubby's marsala was just ok.  Not enough of that Marsala wine taste.  \nAfter eating 3/4 of one MY \"weight watchers sized\" cutlets, I passed my entire plate for hubby to finish.  After all, it was in my best interest.  If he didn't eat beyond what was on his plate, I would have to cook when I got home after the show.  He would never force me to, but after he starts rummaging through the fridge you know I feel guilty enough to make him at least an omelette--a smoked salmon omelette.  That's one of his favorites.  Getting back to the rest of the meal--\nSo after giving away my chicken to \"the other side\",  I concentrated on eating the side of pasta I was given.  Angel hair with marinara sauce; he had the ziti with the sauce.  The sauce was OK, but was nothing special.  Average.   Yes, I ate it.  Had to.  Nothing left for me to eat.  What was interesting was that hubby had asked for the sauce on his ziti to be FRA DIAVOLO.  It is a spicy marinara sauce.  So the waiter had said to this request, \"No problem.\"  I was so impressed that he knew about this sauce that I said to him, \"Do you know that some restaurants don't know what FRA DIAVOLO sauce is ?\" He smiled and said, \"We know.\"  So low and behold (what exactly does low and behold mean? Does anyone know?) his FRA DIAVOLO SAUCE was nothing more than the sauce I got, but with red pepper flakes on it!  Like the flakes you put on your pizza!  Wow, what a let down. \nService by the waiter- very welcoming, cordial and polite.

Booth and silverware was clean....food was great, as usual.\n\nWe ordered a trio of salads---Miso, BBQ chicken, and Chinese Chicken Salad. Generous portions--I swear that half is almost the same size as the full! Our drinks never saw the bottom of the glasses---attentive waitress.\n\nBummer #2--I KNEW I had left my cell phone/case at the booth as soon as I drove away, and I went to check and they took my name and number and said they'd call if they found it. I KNOW I left it there, so after an hour I called back. Whoever I spoke with was kinda testy and rude--that pissed me off.\n\nAll ready to boycott this place for the rest of my being, at 904pm I got a phone call from a much-nicer manager, telling me they had scoured our booth finally and, voila, there appeared my belongings!

I recall eating at a CPK at The Mirage in Las Vegas over 18 years ago and I remember it being good and kinda the latest trend. We were promptly greeted and seated. The host was great. HOWEVER, It was at least 15 mins. before any waiters acknowledged us. When one did, she wasn't our waiter but said she would give our drink order to our waiter. Probably 2 mins later our waiter came with our drinks FINALLY. We placed our order immediately in hopes of eating sometime in this decade. Since it had been so long since I'd eaten at a CPK, I asked the waiter if one pizza was enough for 2 people and he said no. So we ordered two, one kinda traditional pizza with pep, sausage etc and one chicken tostada pizza. I'd guess 10 mins passed by the time our food came, with which we were pleased. When I saw how big they were, I was kinda surprised. We would have been more than full on one pizza. But I can't fault the waiter for that. He had no way of knowing if we are big eaters or not. We dug in. I first had a slice of the chicken tostada. My son, the meat pizza. Mine was \"okay\" not a whole lot of flavor even with the salsa. My son's however was really yummy. I ended up having a slice of his since he was raving about it. He then had a slice of mine and he said the same thing, kinda boring and no taste. We ended up leaving with 2 half pizzas. I'm sure I would have given them a better score had it not been for the slowness of the waiter checking on us. Would I go back, yes, but I'd ask to be seated in the large dining room, not off to the side where we were seated, I'm sure that is why we were ignored for so long.", "business_id": "UpYva_zhJ6pRGfdTruIYIg", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-05-20", "type": "review"}

Here is the kicker, from about 820pm (FRIDAY NIGHT) they turned away 3 groups of people because \"they had NOTHING left in the kitchen\" Really? you put out a groupon not preparing for the influx of customers?!?!??! Those people will NEVER come back when a pizza place is OUT OF FOOD at 845. such an embarressment.

We literally had to roll down the car windows on the way home because our clothes were permeated with the stench. Secondly, we made the mistake of ordering the calamari to start, which was obviously old, freezer burned and exceedingly inedible. So, we sent it back and they replaced it with another appetizer that was almost as bad. Then, the large Big Guido pizza we ordered arrived shortly afterward, featuring big chunks of mystery meat swimming in a pool of grease.

I wasn't in a hurry to use it even tho it had an expiration date because I called, spoke to somebody & they ensured me it wouldn't expire. \n\nWalked into this place and had a hard time choosing the least dirty booth/table but finally made my choice and wiped off the left overs crumbs left on the table and seats. I guess with only 1 waitress it's hard to take care of a couple tables so we had to wait a good 15-20 for a greeting. No big deal..... It just meant we had plenty of time to second guess our ordering decisions. Which was a good thing because they were out of this & out of that on an early Saturday night. Really?? We ordered a simple pepperoni pizza and it took over an hour for them to prepare and deliver it to our table. There was enough grease on this pizza to save the govt millions in vehicle maintenance but since I'm not in the habit of bailing out the fat cats I quickly used an entire trees worth of napkins to solve the issue. A little grated cheese, stale crushed peppers, garlic salt and voialla & edible pizza. The pizza actually has good flavor and I enjoyed the crust which normally I don't. I didn't want to chance my luck with letting down my taste buds so we opted out on the potentially fake Italian desert. \n\nSo here's where Bouno's helped establish their excellent one star review with me. The waitress brought the bill & I gave here my groupon. She quickly made an excuse on not taking the groupon because it was expired & I showed her on the groupon where it says it NEVER EXPIRES so she took it to her boss. A $12 dollar groupon discount turned into a $6 discount. Nothing makes me more sadder than a business not living up to their offer. Don't put it out there if you have no honor. Well, to wrap this up I'm gonna say good by to Bouno's & wish them luck cuz they're gonna need it if they plan on staying in business with such awesomeness.", "business_id": "m3O2EFVs3eo8s40MGGzmsA", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-04-12", "type": "review"}

It's just that when she did, she was in such a hurry that all we could eek out before she was rushing away was that we wanted two waters. We were there for an hour and a half for spagetti. I will just make this at home from now on.\n\nThird, the way the restaurant is laid out, it's VERY loud. There was a party of about 10 people next to us, and my fiancee and I couldn't even hear each other talk. So we say in silence. Now, this is not the restaurants fault, but these people were OBNOXIOUS. The management should have said something. \n\nAnd finally, the food is terrible. It reminded me of food made at summer camp - you know what I'm talking about - the mass produced kind with standard pasta and sauce. My fiancee also noted that his chicken parmigiana was terrible and that it's better at Olive Garden. A restaurant I will be sticking with from here on out :)", "business_id": "sllZXXYijYUs-n80uSa96w", "stars": 1, "date": "2009-03-26", "type": "review"}

I am not a big fan of chains, but there is something about Buca di Beppo that makes me come back for more.  Typically, you want to go with a big group because the portion sizes are huge.  Buca di Beppo has done a good job creating smaller entrees for even a serving size of 2 people.\n\nMy favorite dish is the eggplant parmigiana, but they had a recent scare of Salmonella in the Eggplants.  I wish I knew this earlier because I was really excited for it.  This is why I am not giving my experience a 5 star, lol.  \n\nWe ended up getting a lemon chicken dish, baked ziti, and green beans.  The lemon chicken had a light butter, olive oil, and capers.  It went well with the green beans that was cooked in olive oil.  The baked ziti is a new item, and we got it for free because March was a trial run to see how people liked the item.  The baked ziti kind of made up for the lack of the eggplant dish I crave for.\n\nI am surprised by the lower ratings for this restaurant, but it may be due to the several Italian options in Scottsdale and Mesa.", "business_id": "sllZXXYijYUs-n80uSa96w", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-04-03", "type": "review"}

Our hostess seated us at a booth in the bar, and it was actually really nice. The music wasn't super loud, and we were actually able to hear each other. The decor is very eclectic, with everything kind of everywhere, but it works. The only negative I could say is that we waited for about 10 minutes before anyone came over to get our drink order, and the table was slightly sticky. \nOur server was really nice and very knowledgeable about the wines and what each entree came with. We ended up getting the artichoke spinach dip, cheese manicotti, and baked ziti. She also got a pizza to take home to her husband. Our actual server was less than impressive, only coming by once or twice. However, the bartender was more attentive, making sure we had plenty of refills and bread. \nThe prices are higher, each plate costing around $20. However, the portions are monstrous, and served as \"family style\", so you get plenty for your money (two days later and I STILL have left over baked ziti).\nThe highlight of our meal was the double dark chocolate cake... holy moly... absolutely delicious. \nAll in all, I would recommend this location. It is a super fun, relaxed environment and the food is really good.", "business_id": "sllZXXYijYUs-n80uSa96w", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-03-02", "type": "review"}
