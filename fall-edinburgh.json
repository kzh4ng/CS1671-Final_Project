I was quite looking forward to visiting this bar as i'd never been before but always thought the place had some of sort old worldy type charm....\n\non arrival, the place was fairly empty, but to be fair it was Wednesday night at 5pm.  I shed my rain soaked coat, hat, and gloves dropped my brolly on the floor and picked up a drinks menu.  I was tempted by the offer of champange or prosecco by the glass, but felt the weather dictated better to a red wine sort of drink.  i had been wanting to get a glass of pinot noir, which i'd seen available on their drinks menu on the website, but when looking at the menu last night this was only available by the bottle.  thinking a whole bottle of pinot noir was a bit excessive for a weekyday evening i opted for a glass of malbec instead.\n\nafter getting my drink, i secured a table just under one of the big windows looking up the stairs to Charlotte Square and sat down just as my wine drinking companion arrived.  We had a lovely, although brief chat, in which i drank my malbec and enjoyed the ambience of Whighams. i also enjoyed the free nibbles we got at 6pm, very nice touch :)\n\nnow this was a perfectly lovely catch up in a nice location, but there was something missing about Whighams.  first off, i felt their prices were a wee bit on the expensive side.  I paid over \u00a35 for a small glass of malbec and while it was nice, i can get a whole bottle of malbec for not much more from the co-op at the top of my road.  second, when i sent the bartender away so i could look at the menu, it took ages for him to notice me again when i was ready to order.  and lastly, while i enjoyed the bar and though the little alcoves very appealing for a romantic glass of wine, i didn't get a feeling of the character of this place.... it just sort of fell flat.  maybe it was the lack of patrons or maybe this wine bar just lacks a certain je ne sais quoi...  either way, while i'd be happy to go back, i don't think i'll be in a rush to do so.", "business_id": "QXUzUvUp8_sCDzp7f4_ToQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-10-18", "type": "review"}

The bread was delivered while we considered the menu, and I'm afraid it was somewhat dull and lacking in flavour. Slightly disappointing, but the fairly reasonable prices for wine were encouraging us to a more positive view. \n\nS had the fish pie, which was scrumptious, with lots of fish and accompanied by a good serving of mash and peas. Hot plates too, which is a particular obsession of mine. \n\nI had the special of Coley with a herb crust and velout\u00e9 sauce. The fish was delicious, almost but not quite under-cooked and very fresh tasting. The sauce was nice enough, but I would have preferred it on the side as it diminished the crunchy texture of the crust. The veg was green beans, and I don't think they could have been better cooked (assuming that you don't like them blanched and soggy the way your mother used to make them). \n\nS finished with the cheese, and an excellent chutney. Not a huge portion, but decent enough. I had the sticky toffee pudding; lots of sauce, nice and hot, and a very creamy ice cream (if that's not a tautology). \n\nAll in all, very impressive, and certainly more than enough to justify a return visit.

First thing you think about with a name like smoke stack is steaks and an almost southern USA BBQ style food. Check with the steaks, not so much in the way of BBQ smokiness! I would have loved to have gone for one of their steaks but I felt for a Sunday casual lunch they were a bit over priced (in fact over priced any time of the day or week!). I decided to go for their rump steak salad with a soy and ginger dressing ordered medium-rare. The presentation was top notch and the steak was cooked to perfection! I really enjoyed the quality of the meat and the salad but I felt that there was far too much dressing which kind of over powered it and left everything drenched. It was definitely tasty but if I was ordering again I would ask them to go easy on the dressing. There is also a great selection of drinks, smooties and milkshakes.

So please, bear with me and read the below.\n\nRight. I went here on a Thursday night with a group of people from what is called the cocktail society. Surprisingly I did not have a cocktail, which apparently is what the bar is known for, because I figured if I did, I'd end up falling off my chair instead of sitting neatly upright on it. \n\nNow me and my friend both decided to have a glass of wine and get this, they made the ultimate wine faux pas. Firstly, my glass of wine suddenly went from 3.75 on the menu to 4.20 in person. I asked several times if they'd given me the correct one, even pointing out the different price in the menu, but to no avail, the price was 4.20. Okay, well, that can happen.\n\nBut guess what happened next? They use cocktail measuring cups to measure out the wine for a small or medium sized glass. I guess it's fairer that way, but it sure looks a little .. sleazy. Yes, I said it. I don't want my wine in a metal cocktail measuring cup before drinking it. I'm sure that doesn't help the flavour.\n\nThey measured mine (a red) out first, and then .. oh then, the ultimate, deadly faux pas of winery: they poured my friend's white into the exact same measuring cup used to measure the red, without washing it first. That's right, no washing, nothing. We just looked at each other and sighed. This was going to be a special night.\n\nAfter that I asked for a jug of water, the waiter confirmed by asking if we'd like a jug -yes we would please- and brought us two glasses instead.\n\nThree strikes and you're out. Come on, you can't measure out wine in cocktail measuring cups that are unwashed. Gross.\n\nI'd give this a miss.  \n\nP.s. Of course it is entirely possible that the person behind the bar was new, and made some mistakes because of it. However, if that's the case he should've been supervised to make sure the quality of the drinks was not affected!", "business_id": "QPsNlmETw14k-_RqX-RULw", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-10-12", "type": "review"}

The BF and I originally planned to just have a late night drink here while on holiday in Edinburgh, but after not being able to get in at a restaurant across the street on a Saturday night, we decided to eat dinner here as well. The space is very attractive inside and lit by candlelight at night. One half is primarily just a bar and open space, and the other half has tables and chairs for dining, with free w-fi available throughout (just ask the bartender for the code). It's set up like a traditional British Pub where you order your food at the bar and give them the table number you're sitting at, but service is still timely and friendly.\n\nMuch of the menu looked appetizing, and the prices seemed more than reasonable. We decided to get a couple different pasta dishes to share: Their menu has changed a bit from the menu currently listed on their website, but one was a chicken pesto pasta and the other a spicy andouille sausage pasta with peppers. Both were good, but the sausage one was one of the best dishes I ate during our entire holiday. It was so full of flavor because the meat was extremely plentiful. If you're not much of a pasta lover, they do offer a good selection of burgers (including chicken, lamb and veggie varieties), and all burgers and main dishes are 2-for-1 Sunday thru Thursday!!  \n\nNow on to the drinks...\nBar Kohl is the original vodka bar of Edinburgh. They have over 50 different flavors as they've gotten quite creative with their Absolut infusions. We opted to get a pitcher of FAB, which is one of their specialty mixes consisting of strawberry infused Absolut, Stoli Razberi, Havana Club rum, Blue Cura\u00e7ao, Midori, grenadine, blackcurrant and milk. It was AMAZING!! If we didn't have late night plans, I could've stayed at Bar Kohl all night trying different concoctions from their flavorful well!", "business_id": "QPsNlmETw14k-_RqX-RULw", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-10-12", "type": "review"}

We were given discount cards for half price food and reduced cocktails, which have been used a lot!\n\nI've always had good experiences here, but I'm going to review my dinner there last night. I was just out of work and totally goosed so my fianc\u00e9 and I decided it would be a good (and lazy option) to pop in for a burger on the way home. We hadn't been since July since the discount card was not valid during August, but fortunately it works again now. We would still pay the full prices but we certainly wouldn't go as often. Paying only \u00a34 for a burger and less that \u00a35 for cocktails are just too good deals to miss.\n\nI opted for the New Jersey burger which had delicious fried chicken, mozzarella, salad and sauces. It was so delicious. The chicken was just good old fashioned fried chicken in a lovely batter. My fianc\u00e9 had a Chicago with beef, pickles, salad and sauces. It was tasty and moist, but not quite as good as my chicken burger. Both came in a seeded bun that was fresh and toasted on the inside, just how I like them. We got them with a portion of handcut chips and a portion of sweet potato chips which has a yummy cajun seasoning on them, very scrummy. Our complaint last time was that the coleslaw appeared to be not homemade, but this time it appeared to be. It was much nicer and had more to it that just carrot, cabbage and mayo.\n\nMy cocktail (Edinburgh Collins) was amazing. Not too alcoholic, not watered down and with lots and lots of raspberries. His pint of Estrella was a standard pint of Estrella, not much to say about it really!\n\nOverall, we had a lovely cheap dinner. The reasons I give this place 4 stars instead of 5 are that, for one, the decor is okay but it can be really dark and the tables and chairs have all seen better days, you have to be careful not to nudge them the wrong way and send your cocktails flying. And, as I've said, the food is good but not everything I've had has been as delicious as the New Jersey so not all deserve 5. But I would definitely say go and give it a try.

The kicker? It wasn't my drink. I had ONE sip of another person's beverage and felt it deserved the $20 in international text charges it has now accrued.\n\nIt's a damn fine cocktail.\n\nNow i'm not going to beat around the bush - I didn't try the food, I didn't stay longer than one drink and I didn't pay much attention to the place as a whole, beyond my delicious, delicious cocktail. But if exorbitant cell phone charges aren't worth a five star, well then, the world has gone crazy. I DID however, note the very funky ceiling and impeccable chalk penmanship of their menus - i'm a dork like that.\n\nHigh fives and shimmy hugs to Nathan (which i'm hoping is the correct name... there had been a few cocktails previous to this one). Lucky for us, we happened to be sitting next to this fine gent, who not only works at the place but is the wizard of all off menu ordering. If he's any indication of the rest of the staff, get ready Bar Kohl - i'm moving in. He was so personable and so knowledgable that it was an absolutely delightful stop in on our rather mischievous Saturday.\n\nI'm also intrigued by the group cocktails, which sound yummy and occasionally seem to arrive in tea pots. Anything that makes drinking a whimsical occasion deserves bonus points in my book, though i'm not i'd be a good sharer.\n\nThe one and only drink I had was a flip on a manhattan. I could not tell you the name, as it was suggested by Nathan and after knowing him for all of 45 seconds, there was inherent trust. Good thing too, cause it was delightful and boozy - just as it should be.  But the real beauty of the night was the tiny sip I had from my new buddy's glass - the reverse walnut manhattan. Flip the usual bourbon/vermouth ratios on ear, make that vermouth walnut infused (... i think) and watch while Canadians wax poetic over it for days...\n\nAnd sure, it was a little pricer then other cocktails we would take on that night but i'm willing to spend a little more when it's something i'm excited about.\n\nNeedless to say, i'll be back and I'll try more, I promise.

As I said, the hours are restrictive. It closes at 3.30pm on a Sunday which is quite early.  However, the food lived up to expectation and wasn't overly pricey. I had the Polish Ham, cheese and mushroom foccacia: mm, mm, mmmm. Coupled with fresh-squeezed orange juice and real-leaf tea. Wonderful.\n\nOnly down-side is the decor of the cafe is a little uninspired. It's a big area, but the tables and decor is very circa. mid-90s British cafe.

Having vigorously tested all options, several times each over the years, I am satisfied that the best venue is also coincidentally the closest to my work. \n\nHaving been a patron of this establishment for many a year now I really can't talk highly enough of it...but i shall give it a darn good go!\n\nFirstly, the setting. Situated five minutes walk from the city centre it is within walking distance to everything a man could need. From a run at the local gym in the omni or a bite to eat at one of Leith Walk's plethora of restaurants to being a stones throw away from St Mary's Cathedral if ever you fancy a beer to rinse off your freshly cleansed soul. The Theatre Royal is perfectly positioned. (As also briefly mentioned it is also the closest pub to my work!)\n\nThe interior itself is a haven for the theatre lover, with the walls adorned with signed posters from the various acts that have tread the famous boards of the Playhouse. \nThere is plentiful seating around the grand looking island bar, through the back there are large tables where groups of friends can relax after a hard days work. \nThe grand looking island bar, however, can cause a bit of consternation amongst patrons with slight difficulties in being always being seen on a busy night, this can lead to a bit of a wait to get served...but rest assured served you will be!\n\nWhich leads me nicely on to my second point, the staff. These are some of the nicest bar staff I have encountered in Edinburgh - and I have encountered several. They are all very friendly and chatty and ever attentive. There is very low turnover of staff which I think indicates it is also not a bad place to work. The staff at the theatre are one of it's biggest assets.\n\nThirdly, the drink. Like in most city centre venues the cost of drinks has steadily increased over the last few years. It no longer offers the obligatory bottle of wine for \u00a35 or \u00a31 a bottle of beer. You are paying for the location and atmosphere. \n\nAfter another seamless segue we arrive at my fourth area, the atmosphere. On any given day you can experience several different atmospheres in the Theatre royal, each giving it it's own life and personality. In the afternoon you can slip in and relax on one of the big seating areas in the back and have a quite drink or lovely meal. on a show night there will be a steady rise in numbers up until it reaches it's crescendo at 6:30 - 7 prior to the house opening next door. At 7:30 an exodus and you're left with a few locals and the bar staff starting to get set for the post show barrage. \n\nFinally, the food. The menu here caters for all. From the stunningly cook Steak via the de rigueur Fish and Chips to a personal favourite of mine - a vegeburger with cheese and bacon (just you try it before scoffing). The value for money for the food here is exceptional, the quality of food is of a very high standard and the portions are generous without being foreboding.\n\nMy overall opinion of the Theatre Royal bar is that if they had rooms to rent I'd never leave! I would very much recommend you try it out and soon. \n\nAnd when you do...I'll be standing at the bar and mines a pint of tennant's...see you soon!", "business_id": "8uMP4kv2Je6rM9ZNz0apGw", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-11-09", "type": "review"}

Little bit stodgy (did I use that right?). Old fashioned, but quite classy. Friendly greeting for Jenny and the rest of us, but still I felt a bit out of sorts (like a kid in my mom's heels). \n\nZARA atmosphere: Freaky loud. Drunken stag do-ers. Crowded and messy, and just as you'd expect it to be. \n\nStockbridge prices: Went on Yelp Eats! so it wasn't so expensive as it would have been, but a pretty penny for teeny tiny little portions. \n\nZARA prices. 5 pounds for maybe the best pizza in town. Fed 2 happily. \n\nNow the food. I'm going to wax on a bit about Stockbridge:\n\nTHE BREAD: Now I love a little taste of the upper class, but I have to admit that the weird herbed breads were my favorite thing I had here all night. \n\nThe AMUSE BOUCHE: This was meat, and I don't eat meat.\n\nTHE STARTER: This was phenomenal and I could have eaten it all. night. long. Crab meat and some other stuff... so delicious. \n\nTHE MEAL: Coley and chips which tasted so healthy that I HAD to get dessert because the Coley was just not bad enough for me. \n\nTHE DESSERT: Sorry, I'm American and while this was delicious and full of some weird caramelly pieces and nuts it was not really a brownie, was it? \n\n\nZARA\n\nTHE PIZZA: Cheesy, amazing deliciousness where the fat ran right onto the carton. No skimping on the toppings, chockablock full of mushrooms. The crust is the kind that NO ONE throws away, crispy and light and maybe tastes better than the pizza itself.\n\nRESULT - ZARA: 5*****/Stockbridge ***\n\nFor the money and deliciousness the unsophisticated in me comes out and says - Pizza over Posh.", "business_id": "r3QvCj1tsgASA90GBU3eVg", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-10-23", "type": "review"}

Meaning a traditional Scottish public house whose usual clientelle is the older generation, for several reasons: it doesn't play loud music, it has the 'local' feel to it where everyone \"knows your name\", it has a great selection of real ales and whisky (amongst other things), the staff are friendly but not overly preppy. It lacks the bells and whistles that is so common in bars nowadays (drinks offers, cocktails, duke boxes, games machines, staff who show their underwear etc.) but this is all to its merit. Instead, it does what public houses were originally meant to do: serve the local people in a homely, familiar environment some damned good drinks, with a genuine smile.\n\nNow, I'm not normally an 'old man pub' type. Despite my previous comments on the bells and whistles bars of today, I admit I'm a sucker for them. Or more specifically, margaritas and 5 types of rum. I like cocktails. I'm not a huge fan of beer. I like a bit of music-atmosphere. And about 90% of old man pubs are sticky, grungy, grimy, dark and one you wouldn't go into as a solo female. Not that they're dangerous, just everyone really *is* an older man who's been drinking since 11am and it smells of cigarette smoke circa 1984.\n\nBut not in The Bow Bar. This is an 'old man pub' in only the best sense of the phrase. It has all the good whiskies (hunners of them!), beers, dark wood, traditional interior, no music, familiarity and friendly staff, locals but without any of the bad bits I've mentioned. It's clean, it's fresh, it's upbeat, it's light (and yet 'moodly' dark at the same time, in a cool way). It's clientelle isn't exclusively of the older generation, and yes there are regulars, but friendly ones.\n\nAND they do feature rotating guest spirits such as the the only gin to be brewed on Islay (where my favourite whisky comes from). The gin was amazing. And they have slim-line tonic. And coke out of a bottle, not a tap. I usually avoid old man pubs as I don't like beer, and anything else comes as diluted syrupy water with a splash of one type of vodka. Not in The Bow Bar.\n\nThis is one of the rare old man pubs I will not only frequent, but go out of my way to visit. I do love whisky (Scotch for any visitors) and they have an epic selection here, some of the best around. Mike, the Manager, and all the staff will be more than happy to tell you about them, ask you your preferences and help you choose one.\n\nFor a real taste of traditional Scotland in the ever-so-picturesque Victoria Street, head to The Bow Bar.

There were some pretty terrible and mediocre level of service here. It's not bad service, it's more like a holiday inn attitude rather than an expected hilton attitude that you get from the staff. To me the majority of the staff just feels 'lazy' and doesnt really love their job. All in all, i enjoyed staying here. There are 2 buildings for this hotel, the Hilton building and the grosvenor biulding across the street, all belongning to the hotel and combine to 180+ rooms. The grosvenor is alot more run down and old thus a cheaper rate. The Hilton side is more up to date with modern decor and renovations. The rooms are nice and clean and offer and classy modern look. They're spacious and comfortable. The lobby and lounge also boast a great feel and atmosphere. The restaurant looks fantastic with the same new age touch in interior design but the food is lacking a bit. First night i had the chef recommended Pollack with capers sauce, although the fish was near perfeclty grilled, the sauce ruined it for me. The way they made the capers and cream sauce was not a good combination for the taste buds. It added a bitter and almost starchy taste to otherwise good fish. The next night i had the 8oz sirloin, what a steak. poor quality meat with horrible cooking technique. It seemed to be microwaved and then thrown on the grill for 10 seconds to put some marks on the outside. It was bland, dry, and unfresh. Then along came the desert sorbet, although i'd say it was more a ball of shaved ice than sorbet icecream, it seems the kitchen staff let it sit in the freezer for a few months over the expiry date and crystalized. Comfortable stay, but stay away from the food here.

The mains looked great as they went by to others, and I remember a whole cooked fish of some sort that looked fantastic, but we couldn't decide on starters as they all sounded too good... luckily the waitress was quite nice and happy to oblige us with our mini on request buffet... to be honest I was a bit worried about it because the place seems \"fancy\" to a commoner like me, but the worry was unfounded. \n\nThe standout starter for me was the \"Hand Dived Scallop with Garlic & Pernod Butter, Toasted Almonds\"... come to think of it, I have no idea what a \"pernod\" is... but the dang thing was delicious!  I made a note to order a scallop anytime it's on the menu here.  I also really like the \"Parma Ham with Salami served with Homemade Russian Salad\"... think parma ham and salami on top of potato salad and you'll get the idea, odd sounding, but tasty.  Their \"Gazpacho topped with Parma Ham & Olive Oil\" was a treat as well, a bit different than I have had elsewhere, but that seems to be the norm with restaurant made gazpacho... I certainly wouldn't hesitate to order it again.\n\nThe only starter I didn't really love was the \"Salmon Carpaccio with Soya & Sesame Dressing, Chilli, Spring Onions, & Coriander\"... but, to be fair, I'm not a huge fan of most types of salmon, gravlax being the exception.  It's not that I wouldn't recommend it to someone that liked the sound of it, don't get me wrong, it was just such a good showing for the other starters on this particular night.\n\nThe hidden joy about having a bunch of starters between two people is that there's room for dessert!  Well, at most places... I guess that highlights that the starter portions weren't huge here, but definitely starter appropriate.  For desert we split a \"Frangipane Tart\", and as someone new to such a dessert was pleasantly surprised... it had a great texture and just the right level of sweetness.  \n\nUnfortunately I can't remember the cost of our little adventure, but I know it wasn't bad despite all of the dishes ordered.\n\nAll in all this is one of the places that I would like to take friends visiting Edinburgh, assuming they have had enough time to try some local stuff of course, and I'm personally hoping to get back soon... I might even try I main if I'm daring enough, but I certainly wouldn't be mad at myself if I went all starters again. ;-)", "business_id": "WN2QUFWxIiTtUgW-oczrQg", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-10-08", "type": "review"}

I am French so hopefully that will reinforce the previous statement but may I had I used to work there and am totally unbiased about this place. Yes I might not have agreed with the employers on many different aspect, one thing I would never argue is the quality of the food served. The meat, vegetables and fishes are all freshly delivered daily which explains why the menus are always hand written and changes regularly. The prices are reasonable and they have desserts to die for. Go for the baked honey and vanilla cheesecake for pure decadence or their unbeatable sticky toffee pudding. The place is small but it is adding to the rustic look, my advice would be to book well in advance and don't book table of more than 5 people to avoid being crammed in. One negative from me, the chef has limited options for vegetarians so if you don't eat fish or meat you may want to avoid as you may get a boring risotto as an alternative.", "business_id": "WN2QUFWxIiTtUgW-oczrQg", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-11-30", "type": "review"}

First visit was a little underwhelming but I was willing to give it a second chance. Wrong. They were busy enough and they have many 'regular' visitors that are being treated as family.

The prosciutto was very good. Main course was Spag Carbonara - to which I added mushrooms and that was made very well and good and creamy - I really enjoyed that!

Until one of our group requested a dessert menu from a flyby waiter. no no no .. we should be offered not asked for! - I ordered a banasplit (as you don't get that very often these days) in my experience a banana split is vanilla ice cream, nuts, banana and chocolate sauce. - or if you will a dame blanche with banana. Anyhow.. we were served a very colourful plate of 3 different flavoured ice-creams (vanilla, strawberry, chocolate) - some green colouring and a variety of fruits that DO NOT BELONG in a banana split. I did not ask for figs, kiwis, pineapple nor green apple. This is NOT a fruit punch cocktail. Coffee was served but no cookie or chocolates.

Soup was Tomato and Basil with a lovely thick slice of bloomer type bread and butter, followed by lasagne with garlic bread.

Then, a weird thing happened. Our waitress was incredibly friendly, but the manager clearly thought we were not her preferred customer. (I was going to call for a clean up on aisle floor since the disdain was dripping from her face, but thought the better of it.) Now, we were really not shoddily attired, quite fashionably actually, but it was as if she could smell the \"student\" on us. (Even though one of us is not, that's the look she gave us).\n\nIt was such a mixed experience that I don't know what to think. I'm sure that if I came here on a date with someone, there'd be no problem. But somehow the manager really was incredibly bitchy. \nWe also had to ask for our bill twice.\n\nI like it here, but the place doesn't seem to like me back if you catch my drift.", "business_id": "RTKYidJ6nmw0chY3K3zh2g", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-09-25", "type": "review"}

I rated this hotel #2 in the list, just behind the W in Washington, DC. The W only beat out this hotel because of its location, roof top bar, and general posh-ness of the hotel. The W DC is a place to be seen where this hotel is a place to go have a spa day and relax.\n\nThis hotel is incredible.  The service was incredible. The location is very good. The hotel was under a full renovation when we stayed and never once did we hear any construction noise. Sure, it was a mild annoyance to have to use specific elevators and pathways to get to our room as a portion of the hotel was closed for renovations but that minor annoyance was nothing in the big picture.\n\nWe had a king room with a view of the castle. The room was gigantic. The bathroom was swanky and modern. Everything was new. The rooms have wood floors which I thought was a very nice change from the standard. \n\nThe club lounge on the 7th floor was very nice as well. They could have done with a fireplace, better juices to mix with alcohol (ask the attendant and she can pretty much hook you up with anything you don't see on the counter), and better seating arrangements (more sitting tables instead of low side tables). The food in the lounge was a bit lacking as compared to the food at Hyatt or Hilton lounges but still sufficed.\n\nWe asked a member of staff when the renovations were expected to be complete (we knew that it should be end of 2011) and she said that they were hoping to be done early 2012. Again, I wouldn't let the construction woes put you off.\n\nThe hotel is located within walking distance to both train stations, Edinburgh castle, Edinburgh High Street, Starbucks, New Town, Old Town, George Street, Thistle Street, and all the other popular places in Edinburgh. We were in Edinburgh for 3 days and walked everywhere - never once took a taxi.\n\nWould definitely stay here again and would highly recommend.

The boy chose the reasonably priced (\u00a315.95) 2 course prix fixe lunch with the pea and ham soup and the venison burger, and I deviated at the last minute and went with the pricer smoked grilled Scottish salmon on the normal menu (because really, if you're a fish eater and don't have salmon while in Scotland, you are definitely missing out). I was in heaven with my own meal, that salmon was soooo fresh and flavorful, with a nice smokey flavor and grilled perfectly, accompanied by delightful sweet potatoes and green beans. Totally worth the \u00a321 splurge.

Thus this review will have a somewhat negative tone even though this was a very nice meal. Here are the two chief reasons I find it impossible to award them five stars: 1. The bread. It was nowhere close to the quality of bread I have had at much less reputable institutions. Is this what their mainstream clientele wants? I hope not, and thus they need to up the level of the bread significantly and it wouldn't even be difficult. 2. My daughter's scallops were served with a very nice tarragon sauce and nearly cold, unimpressive mashed potatoes. I have no problems with mashed potatoes, but even I can make better mashed potatoes, and serve it warm. (If this was truly the intention by the chef, then I guess we will just have to disagree on it being a good idea.) 3. This is a bit whiney but here we go: They were out of the vintage port wine by the glass and instead of corking up something else, they would only suggest that I go with the LBV instead. Nope. Not happening. But a true five star establishment would have opened some other bottle (or just make sure they don't run out).\nHaving said this, here are some things they get right: 1. Very impressive wine list. 2. Very nice interior. We were in the \"Secret Garden\", so if there is a next time, we will try the original dining room. 3. Great (though not perfect) service. 4. My main dish of monkfish was delicious, as was the cheese plate, and the chocolate tart.\nSo, if there is a second time, and I hope there will be, I expect them to have perfected their glitches and be a true five star experience.", "business_id": "4dIzmqGAhFIcuHfI8CySig", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-11-03", "type": "review"}

Maybe I came in with incredibly high expectations but I found that the hype of this place far outweighs what you get. I was not particularly impressed with any dish I received, to be completely honest. While the restaurant is not \"bad\" by any means, it seems as though it's coasting on a name, rather than the quality of the food. The Witchery seems to do food that is very classic, which is great if that's what you're looking for. However, I was expecting the classic food to have something which set it apart from other restaurants like it. In short, I saw nothing like that and was served a few fancy looking dishes that were not nearly the calibre of food I would expect from a place this \"legendary\" or in such a price point. I have eaten at several world class restaurants and have experienced better dishes at a fraction of the price in more cosmopolitan hubs (Vegas, NYC, etc). \n\nNot only that, but I found the service to be dismal overall. The servers were very kind but not attentive enough. I recognize that there can be a cultural divide between American (which I find far too hands on) and British service but this didn't even begin to straddle the line. We were left to our own devices with only a check in every half hour (if that). The last straw, which I'm not sure was intentional or not, was that I wasn't asked if i wanted my credit card charge to be in dollars or pounds. For most people this isn't a big deal, but I travel enough to know that establishments make extra money if one pays in foreign currency...I would think a place of this calibre would know exactly what they are doing when hey run something like that, which I find dishonest. \n\nThe Witchery gets extra points for acknowledging and doing something sweet for my birthday but overall, I'd recommend people look to other places in Edinburgh for great food. This place seems like a tourist trap that's lazy bc of their legacy. Personally, I felt it was a waste of money.", "business_id": "4dIzmqGAhFIcuHfI8CySig", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-09-06", "type": "review"}

The restaurant has two sections, each with separate entrances and no connecting spaces (completely independent dining rooms with independent staff). One is the new section and the other is the historical section; make sure to request the historical side (much more beautiful). If the entire review were to be about ambience, then this would have been 4 stars, but it's not just about ambience.\n\nThe food portions were so small that we were both still hungry for dinner after we ate dinner. As a starter I ordered \"Scallops and Mussels with broad beans and chorizo\", what I received was roughly a dozen beans, 1 small scallop, 1 very small mussel (sans shell), and a single small slice of chorizo which was then cut into quarters (when I say \"slice\" I mean it was a single slice from a sausage. It was 2.5 centimeters (1 inch) in diameter,  1/2 centimeter (1/4 of an inch?) thick, and then reduced to 4 rounded triangles once quartered). It was a ridiculously small starter.\n\nFor the main course I ordered a white fish, but received salmon instead; not what I wanted. I would have sent the dish back, but by this time I was quite hungry. The fish was a reasonably sized portion, but bland in flavor and completely forgettable; I don't even remember how the bed of white rice was seasoned.\n\nFor desert I ordered a strawberry dish with a wonderful description and I was quite excited to taste the treat; what I received was 3 strawberries cut in half and a single shortbread cookie ... again, completely disappointing and forgettable.\n\nI love Scotch Whiskey and ordered a very nice Lagavulin 1995. I requested a double, neat - what I received was a skimpy singly shot of whiskey in a generic glass and it wasn't even the whiskey I requested. When I inquired, they insisted it was a double shot of the Lagavulin 1995, but as I said, I love good Scotch and this absolutely was NOT what I ordered.\n\nAlmost as soon as we finished our disappointing meal, the maitre d' arrived with the bill and informed us they needed the table to seat others and he encouraged us to pay the bill while he waited ... WHAT?!\n\nNow, add to this evening the near complete absence of service as my water glass sat empty for the entire meal and received no refills. We were also afforded no opportunity to order a second round of drinks.\n\nAll in all, a truly unfortunate experience. Were it not for the beautiful setting, this would have been a 1 star review.  If you're thinking about going to The Witchery for dinner while in Scotland, I would like to encourage you to entertain nearly any alternative restaurant this beautiful city has to offer.", "business_id": "4dIzmqGAhFIcuHfI8CySig", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-10-23", "type": "review"}

There was no signage, so we ended up at the Secret Garden, and so did a couple behind us, when we all wanted the Witchery. So be mindful of the hidden entrance.  Anyway, we make it into Witchery...not a back spot, especially if youre into dark, throwback kind of spots...Dont expect a view as there were no windows down here....I didnt mind the decor, kind of playing off the name and the hotel and all, but just because you have a hades theme, you dont have to keep it as hot in there (it was really really hot)\n\nI think my biggest disappointment with the Witchery was that I frequently order in batches, to slow the service down a bit...nothing I dislike more than having my plate cleared the second I take the last bite of something and then having the next course immediately delivered. As such, I will usually order apps, then soup/salad, then main course....So, there I am, 40 minutes after ordering some oysters for my app, still not enjoying my oysters.

Pretty odd for a \"high class\" restaurant.  I understand about turning tables over and all, but we had an 830 pm seating, so I highly doubted there was another seating after us.  \n\nAnyway....the food.  After waiting 45 mins for the Oysters (to order), I was too hungry and hot to do the whole course dining experience, so I just went straight into the meal.  I had the pork chops.

My buddy had the venison and he said it also was good, but not amazing.\n\nBecause of the heat in the place, the time, and honestly, the lackluster looking dessert menu, we skipped dessert, so no comment there.\n\nOverall, it was certainly an OK restaurant...a bit pricey for mediocrity, in my opinion...If you live here Im sure its worth checking out, maybe for the pre-fixe menus?

For me, the highlight was the mussels that Jurgen D. waxed lyrical about in his review - so succulent and tender, they were an instant win in my book, which is against the norm with me when it comes to mussels. Other highlights that I had the opportunity to try included vegetarian enchiladas and a vegetarian burger - the burger, a little dry, but tasty all the same. \n\nWhen the dessert platter came around, we got to try all the desserts available - cheesecake, dime bar cake, pecan pie and chocolate cake. For me, the chocolate cake was far too rich and needs something to take away from the heaviness, but eh, who needs chocolate cake when you have Dime Bar?

If we pay that much for drinks, we expect them to be good. Yeah, he's no Brad Pitt, but this just felt really unfair and discriminating to me. (And I could tell that he was embarassed as well).\n\nIt's such a shame too since I had a great time on Monday and was thinking of making this one of my more regular fancy-cocktail hang-outs.

The quality of your experience here fluctuates with the quality of the staff.\n\nToday, I had a small  bite at Biblos and, you know what, it wasn't half bad. I expected it to be much worse than it actually was. (A friend of mine suggested giving it another shot). I really was quite surprised.\n\nWe had the fish and chips which was A-ok, not superb not bad, and the waitress had made a small mix-up with our order, but was nice enough to come tell us about it and checked in on us a couple of times. Not in a pushy manner either, but in a friendly \"I'm only here to help\"-way. Very refreshing from the careless manner in which I've been handled (man-handled even) in this bar in the past.\n\nIf this girl continues to work here, I might actually come back. Be warned though, I've seen the waiting staff of 20-year old girls ignore me and my friend for a good 20 minutes, chatting behind the bar, before so much as raising their eyes at us.\n\nAnnoying.", "business_id": "dXPmE2ncXbQTPBVNRODuNw", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-11-04", "type": "review"}

The poor staff had to keep coming back to us as we indecisively looked through the menu over and over again.\n\nThe staff were very friendly. When our professors needed to make some final announcements, the staff were kind enough to temporarily turn down the music until we were done.\n\nThe portions of food is rather large and it tasted great! \n\nI'd say it is a good place for groups!", "business_id": "dXPmE2ncXbQTPBVNRODuNw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-10-22", "type": "review"}

The Royal Yacht is berthed at Ocean Terminal in Leith and is a very beautiful and unique insight into the lives of the royal family.

Alot of money has been spent by the trust to peserve the yacht and the Royal family have let the trust use alot of treasured items in recreating the look and feel of what day to day life was aboard the yacht. What I enjoyed was that visitors could sit in the rooms that the royals used and you could touch and feel most of the items on show. There were also lots of locations to take photos of where the Royal Family posed aboard the yacht. The staff were also very knowledgable with the boats history and the audio guide that you are given as you step aboard had alot of information about each room and those who crewed the ship.", "business_id": "HSYVkG67Juu-G693xz2ViQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-10-29", "type": "review"}
