Often when you are out and about with friends you arrive home with no voice from screaming over all of the background noise.

It's alittle separated from the main bar area so provides for a semi quiet dining area. The bar area gives you a choice of sitting at the surrounding tables with waitress service or hanging out at the bar itself. Complete with a chillie ice strip to keep those yummy brews cold and the ever entertaining company of your favorite bartender. When the weather cooperates the outdoor patio houses about 6 tables for outdoor dining. The view however...not so picturesque, just the entrance to the Improv. Which hey, that could be the perfect seat if you're stocking the local comics! \n\n\nThe bar area contains pools tables and dart boards to try your skills. On any give night sports fans can enjoy the games of the day on one of the 6 big screen TVs surrounding the bar area. \n\nThe menu is pretty decent with burgers that are cooked to order with the choice of either steak , veggie or chicken. They have a number of specialty burgers with different cheeses, toppings and creative themes. The bourbonzolla is a tasty burger with a Bourbon based glaze and Gorgonzola cheese. Appetizers which range from nachos to firecracker shrimp. Steaks, pasta and salads with rotating specials from different areas of the menu. \n\nOn Monday the burgers are half off...I don't think you have to be a member of their mug club to get the special. However, if you are here regularly the mug club is great with free gifts and specials. \n\nhttp://www.rockbottom.com/MC \n\nNeedless to say I have a fun beer glass collection thanks to Rock Bottom...LOL! \n\nNow everyone favorite part about Rock Bottom's Beers! \nThe in house brew master keeps it interesting with a rotating variety of frothy yummy to try along with the consistant favorites of Ale, IPA's, Rotating Darks and Kolsch. \n\nStop by on Thursday nights for a colorful game of trivia where teams battle it out in a game of intelligence and drinking skills!", "business_id": "McikHxxEqZ2X0joaRNKlaw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-04-18", "type": "review"}

They admittedly still aren't my first choice food-wise because, by design, they're a pretty generic eatery for the most part, especially compared to other options in the area. Their local brews are really the only thing that sets them apart from other places in the Waterfront, and Pittsburgh has so many breweries and so forth now that even that isn't the biggest draw anymore.\n\nThat said, their brews ARE usually quite good and worth trying. Plus, they ARE improving in terms of service and quality of food, and that deserves a mention. Sure, I may think their menu of burgers, pizzas and American eats is pretty average, but I also think the quality of the dishes is improving. For example, my burgers are no longer coming to me overcooked, and as a result actually taste like a burger and not like a pile of toppings and a dry meat patty. Some dishes are even more memorable now; I actually really like their veggie burger, which is packed full of flavor that even I, a known carnivore, can appreciate. And their fresh pretzels and dip? Absolutely amazing - exactly what you'd expect from a warm pretzel fresh out of the oven. \n\nI was especially impressed during my last visit by a server named Mark, who was incredibly attentive and came to our table regularly to check on drinks and keep us updated. He never said a negative word and was quick to correct any mistakes or problems that popped up during the night. If Rock Bottom hires more people like him, there will be many more happy people coming and going from the place, I guarantee it.\n\nAdd in the fact that this is one of a small handful of places that accepts reservations in the Waterfront - a MAJOR plus when planning big outings with friends in the area! - and you have a reliable place where a group of people can go after a movie, shopping, etc. for food and drinks.

That being said, the one thing Giant Eagle (GE) has going for it is the quality and selection of items. There is no question that it has everything you could want. That's where the praise ends. Let's just do this numerically...\n\n1. Prices are outrageous. If you walk 100 yards over to the Target next to it, you'll find some of the same items for 30-40% cheaper. A bag of Gevalia coffee is $7.99 at GE, the same coffee at Target is $4.99. And it's not just coffee, and not just Target. Giant Eagle has little other grocer competition in Pittsburgh. This being the case, if you're not near an Aldi's, Target or Walmart, you have to go to GE for stuff. They're banking on this lack of competition. \n\n2. Parking lots are thrashed every day, all the time. Now, maybe you don't care. But when I go in the morning, they've been open maybe 30 minutes and there are shopping carts littering the parking lot and the sidewalk in front of the building. They clearly don't bring them in at the end of the night. They also rarely have any small baskets near the door, you'll need to hunt for one. It's just laziness and a lack of care, on both accounts. They don't care about the appearance of the outside, nor the convenience for the customers. \n\n3. I don't normally mind the self-checkout, but only if I have a limited number of items. If I need a full grocery order, I'm going to have to wait in line for one of the two cashiers working the registers, on a Saturday. The lack of customer service in this regard is atrocious. I'm already paying exorbitant prices, but I also have to ring up and bag my cart full of groceries too? Walmart doesn't even make you do that!\n\nSo that's about it. If you don't mind paying much higher than average grocery prices, ringing and bagging your cart full of groceries and generally being an afterthought as a customer, than Giant Eagle in Waterfront is awesome!", "business_id": "eT5Ck7Gg1dBJobca9VFovw", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-05-14", "type": "review"}

After having them screw up a third time I felt that others should know that this is a pharmacy to avoid. The first time they misread a prescription and gave me the wrong dose of Synthroid, about 1/10th of what I needed. I ended up so sick after 2 weeks of taking too little that I was half dead before the problem was caught. Their response when I told them was to say \"oops\" and \"it won't happen again\". Not even a sorry, and it never did happen again b/c I went to Costco after that. This latest time was classic. I came with a simple scrip. Costco was closed so I went to Giant Eagle. After 45 minutes the finally inform me that they can't fill it b/c the scrip isn't specific enough (it was for a common antibiotic, nothing complicated). They didn't bother to call me earlier or tell me sooner, just made me wait and wait and wait until I pitched a fit to tell me that they couldn't fill it. It was late and I went to Rite Aid in Sq. Hill with the same exact scrip and they had ZERO issues filling it quickly. WTF? How can it be easy peasy at Rite Aid but Giant Eagle can't even muster the effort to tell me that they are too incompetent to fill it out? I wonder if there is even a legit pharmacist working there at all. It seems like they aren't even staffing the pharmacy with trained techs, just random people off of the street. \n\nDon't waste your time, or risk your health.

This, I must add, was in opposition to his mother's strong protests to the effect of, \"There's nothing *in* Pittsburgh, why would anyone go there?\" \n\nTazza D'oro is the answer to that question. Especially if you like coffee. This is easily one of the best coffee shops east of the Mississippi, and I've been to a lot of them. So, what's so good about it?\n\nLet's go in order of importance:\n\nCoffee - It is really, really good. They use Batdorf and Bronson beans, where an ex-gf of mine used to work in Olympia. Believe me when I tell you that B&B is good. It's not amazingly great, but it's very solid and they take roasting seriously. When I go to a new coffee place I suspect might be good I always get a latte. Why? This one has a high upside if done well and the lowest downside (lots of milk) if done poorly. I got a latte. They have a few sizes, 12oz was the first one I got. It was fantastic. They did a nice little rosetta in it too (look up latte art on google if you have no idea what this is). The baristo really knew what he was doing and pulled a some good shots with excellent crema. \n\nThe coffee was so good (coffee is supposed to taste bold, smooth and rich, which it almost never does and this place had it down) I had to go back for an 8oz, which is another level of trust. It has the same amount of coffee but less milk to hide poor coffee quality. It was always superior. \n\nThis is a coffee place that is truly top notch based on the coffee alone, but there was more. \n\nPastries - They all looked amazing. I had a plain donut while I waited in line. Normally I don't eat plain donuts, because life is too short for plain donuts, but it was really, very good. Everyone was commenting on how nice the pastries were.\n\nAtmosphere - This place has it exactly right. It's a mom & pop feel, nothing forced. Some tables, outdoor seating, maybe some local art, but not in a goofy sort of way. Very friendly employees. Just a complete home run. \n\nObviously I loved it. Behind me in line for my re-up, I heard a girl behind me in line complain, \"we could just go to Starbucks, it's cheaper!\" then proceeded to order with sugar free syrups and skim milk. That's fine. Everyone has to do what they like... and with the proliferation of bad coffee (Starbucks only being guilty of mediocre, though a little bit interesting coffee) over the past 10 years, I don't blame people for being set that way. But the beautiful thing about Tazza D'Oro (cup of gold in Italian) is that--if you let it--it will remind you that you don't need to make your coffee up like a drag queen on Halloween.\n\nTazza D'Oro stands as a reminder that coffee can be enjoyed in all its naked glory in an awesome setting on a beautiful street and give you a good f'ing reason to go to Pittsburgh.", "business_id": "83_p9vIqOq1TUIf3_GD7bA", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-05-26", "type": "review"}

I've been brushed on the leg and knee multiple times by cut-throat drivers in that parking lot.  I believe they would park INSIDE the store if they could).\nI don't complain about the prices, because the food, and health benefits, are worth it in the long-term.  Not so long ago, I was forking out hundreds of dollars a month in prescription medications because my diet was HORRIBLE.  Since making the decision over two years ago to be more active and eat solely organic and Non-GMO, I'm off all of my medications, and the price of organic food is NOTHING compared to medications and prescriptions.  I'm actually saving money.  And No, I don't even make $20K a year - so it's all about choices.  I'm not \"rich\" at all, like most people assume, since I regularly shop there.  In fact, I'm usually dead broke.  But to me, eating whole and healthy and protecting my body is not a luxury, it's a necessity.\nI also like that there is no pharmacy in Whole Foods.  That should say something.\nMy love for Whole Foods resides in the Organic Salad Bar, and Prepared Foods section.  Their salad bar is so fresh and so delicious, that eating salads anywhere else becomes TASTELESS.  Organic makes all the difference.\nMy favorite Prepared Foods is their Vegan General Tso's \"chicken\".  Little popcorn nuggets of Seitan, drenched in the best General Tso's sauce I've ever tasted, with steamed broccoli.  Molly's Sesame Noodles on the salad bar is our favorite side dish to this prepared foods treat.  I swear we eat it at least once a week.\nWe also love their Bulk Section where we can get bulk quinoa, granola, lentils, and all kinds of things for a really decent price.  \nThe secret to shopping at Whole Foods?   BUY WHAT YOU NEED TO EAT THAT DAY.  It's not smart to bulk shop organic produce, because it goes bad faster.  Buy what you KNOW you're going to eat.  You won't see 10/$10 deals, because the food isn't crap, and you're not supposed to stockpile fresh foods.  You're supposed to eat it when it's fresh.  And buy your dry stock at Trader Joe's or the East End Food Co-Op.\nI love Whole Foods.

I have never seen such expensive rice! Here is the bro-down...\n\nThe food: Plentiful and too expensive to even think of buying. The freshest fish that isn't in the Strip...but you need to take a second mortgage to buy fish for a family. I bought sushi rice, a piece of fish and a salad, my bill: $25! The salad with lettuce, carrots, chick peas, onions and about 5 pieces of chicken was $11+\n\nThe employees: Hipsters with thick-rimmed glasses, tattoos and facial piercings that slack like I have never seen \"workers\" slack before. In fact there was a sign above some fresh fish stating \"We will prepare you fish any way you want, just ask\" HA...HA! When I asked to have a tiny fish to be filleted (something that would take me about 10 seconds at home) I was scoffed at by the so called fish monger who was obviously not a trained fish monger, but got his job because of his Progressive music of the soviet era bachelors degree . It took him the better part of 20 minutes to fillet a f-ing fish! All I got was a chopped up piece of crap that was useless. And scoffing is what these people are good at.

If you're not pulling in a good $60K a year you are dirt to these people. I was at the salad bar (it is a good salad bar, but expensive) an older woman in a mink coat bumped, no, pushed into me then stared at me and turned her nose up at me, can you believe it? She actually turned her nose up at me! Others in the aisles will grunt like cantankerous old people if they can't get through.

I had high hopes for the tofu scramble, especially after seeing positive reviews about it. But honestly... It tasted like nothing. I thought it'd be moister with a creamy consistency that might come from silken tofu, but it was hard, dry, and chewy. Hubby got a country burrito that was much better in comparison to my plate... But that might have been due to the fact that his whole plate was doused in gravy. Anything will taste better drenched in gravy. We think the gravy tastes like the powdered packet kind where you just add water. On top of all this service wasn't the greatest. I had to fish around for my own ketchup and they didn't even bother to ask me what kind of toast (3 options on the menu)I wanted when I ordered the toast option for my meal. Then they didn't bother to ask hubby if he wanted anything to drink after he had picked one of the $12 entrees that come with coffee or juice. We had to tell someone else to get it for us. Also they don't really wash their cups. There are 2 sink basins at the front where they just dunk the cups in one soapy basin then dunk the cups in a second water basin and then stack them next to the sink. It made me not want to drink my water even though I was thirsty. Good idea, but poorly executed food. I've had good vegan and vegetarian food before that's consisted of a lot of fresh greens, avocados, and more. For a vegetarian place, there was nothing green on our plates. This experience sadly fell enormously short of our expectations...

I have the excitement of the little girl on Despicable Me \"It's So FLUFFYYYY!\" \n\nMy excitement aside, the menu was pretty large for all veg food. They have breakfast all day, which is always ok with me. Prices were average (~8.50), and portions were large enough to provide lunch for the next day. (Although I have heard that the Cuban Sandwich is on the small side).\n\nI had the Banh Mi, which was fabulous. The bread was fresh, aioli was nice, vegs were pickled just right, but the tofu was a little on the dry side (on next day lunch reheat it was perfect). I was surprised by the veg seisage. It was really good. \n\nGazpacho was nice, although I am not really a fan of cold soup. It reminded me of a smoother salsa. Good, but just not my thing.\n\nSarah S. had the special, home fries with chili and cheese.  This was on the spicy side (a good thing) and came with tortilla chips. She was happy with it. \n\nLatte's are good too.\n\nAll in all this was a good experience!

I'm all about veg/vegan restaurants, but I have to agree with other reviewers who wish Quiet Storm's food was *slightly* more interesting.  \n\nHusband and I ordered take-out so we could enjoy a late lunch al fresco at Schenley Park overlook.  Folks working were vegan-hipster quirky, but friendly and helpful.  We ended up waiting about 30 minutes for our food, so we decided to partake in an afternoon coffee to pass the time.  I  had an iced Morroccan latt\u00e9 with cardamom and rose,  husband the Mandorla sweet almond milk latt\u00e9.  Both were excellent.\n\nFor my meal I picked the Tahini Bowl with brown rice, spinach, roasted red pepper, tomatoes, pepitas and fried tofu cutlet with a tahini dressing.  I wished there had been less rice and more dressing; the bowl was also screaming for more seasoning.  Husband opted for the Crunch Wrap Extreme: scrambled tofu tossed with celery, carrots, edamame, kale and spinach, dressed with vegan wasabi mayo.  Again, twice as much dressing would have added flavor and moisture to an otherwise fine wrap.\n\nAnd that's just it: the food at Quiet Storm is fine.

The buildings surrounding Quiet Storm are often painted with cute art or have little interesting things about them. I love this neighborhood, but I love Quiet Storm even more! \n\nI've only been here twice, and I always want to go more often but somehow it doesn't happen. I've turned on three of my friends to Quiet Storm too, and they love it just as much. The first time I visited I ordered a tofu hash. It was an amazing blend of seasonal vegetables, including some I would never eat otherwise. The tofu was nice and firm, the seisage was spicy and perfectly chewy. The vegan \"cheese\" sauce was also rich and delicious.  The portion was so huge, I couldn't finish it. Leftovers are rarely as good as when the meal is fresh, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that my leftovers were even BETTER than the fresh meal. I think this is because the spices and vegetables had more time to meld together in a perfect veggie harmony. \n\nThe second time I visited was 4/21/2013. A group of my friends came here for Brunch. Two of us ordered the Vegan Country Burrito, another friend ordered the french toast with pistachio honey topping and my other friend ordered a tofu hash with black beans and salsa. Everything was generously portioned, but some meal choices were sold out. They were a bit disappointed that there was no more falafel. All of us devoured our plates and happily chattered about the complexity of flavor, protein content in vegan food items and how much we loved the atmosphere. \n\nQuiet Storm is a great little place to visit. It's never lacking in interesting things to look at while you eat. Food comes as quickly as possible. There are plenty of options to please everyone, and if you think you don't like vegetables, try one of their plates and you may change your mind. (Seriously, I am one of those vegans who hates veggies, but Quiet Storm food can get me to finish all of mine) \n\nTip: If you want to go for Sunday brunch, go early so your favorites will still be available. \n\nYou may also want to nudge the servers a little more than you usually would, because even though our drinks were bottomless, it was a pain to get them back to give us refills - even for water.", "business_id": "PzG0XmAmtXFs6Fdnubf41g", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-04-22", "type": "review"}

The first time that we stopped was on a Sunday morning when the cart came into view with all of its nice looking breads.  I have walked by the cart and store many times before without really stopping to check it out.  That day we decided to though since I was hungry and did not want a full meal and boy am I glad that we did.  Originally I was just going to get one of the loaves of bread to have a bit then and save for later but then I noticed some true french bread pizza (aka pizza toppings on top of a slice of french bread) which I ended up getting.  While I was ordering that my fiance noticed some Sfogliatelle and she ended up ordering one of those as well.  I think the total cost was $3 and Jimmy told us the story of how the sfogliatelle was created while chomping on his cigar.  Both of our items were good and both my fiance and I were espcially impressed with the sfogliatelle.  It had a lot more filling than we are used to getting as well as a more orangy flavor which made it extra good.  Honeslty she was just happy to find a good Sfogliatelle in Pittsburgh.  She is Italian and is used to getting them with some family members at some Italian bakeries in NYC.  The second time that we came here was once again at the cart on a Sunday when Jimmy enticed us with sfogliatelle that was fresh out of the oven and still warm.  Finally the last time that we came was on a Saturday and so the whole store was open, not just the cart.  It was interesting to look around inside and see everything that I had been missing by walking past it all of these years. There were a number of display cases with a ton of baked goods in each of them and it also looked like they served a bunch of different lunch type items like sandwiches to go.  Jimmy once again waited on us and as always was super friendly and told us some stories that we enjoyed.  We ended up leaving this time with not only sfogliatelle for my fiance but also for her parents.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I will definitely be back here again in the future.

I don't rave about \"good\" food. I rave about amazing food. The type of food that I have dreams about. The type of food that makes me want to bring about a thousand dollars cash and gorge myself untill I need an ambulance.\n\nThe taco stand outside of Reyna Foods makes just that kind of food. Too often when we think of Mexican food, we think of a variety samey tasting, samey textured mixtures of ground beef, yellow cheese, beans, and tomatoes stuffed into a processed flour tortilla covered with a plastic sauce (I'm looking at you Emiliano's). Reyna's doesn't just break the mold, they hurl it at the wall, smash the pieces with a bat and then scatter the dust in a blast furnace. The tacos here are aboslutely amazing. Fresh ingredients cooked right there on an old plancha-style grill that has absorbed the flavors of countless meals and stuffed into fresh corn tortillas are a truly enlightening experience. I mean it. \n\nThe first time I went here was to just grab a quick snack while walking around in the Strip district. I saw they offered tongue as a protein choice and thought to myself \"What the hell, in for a dime in for a dollar right?\" Best. Choice. Ever. The first bite was like reaching the Seventh Level of Enlightenment. The Buddha said I could ask one question. After careful consideration I asked, \"Can I have another taco?\" After that I made a vow that I would forever be a loyal raving fan.\n\nThe tacos are assembled to your liking. I like mine with the works: the perfectly cooked meat on the warm tortilla then covered with queso fresco, tomatoes, lettuce, onion, cilantro, fresh lime juice, and sour cream. The flavors all play well together to strike a classical tune of a Mexican bolero on the pallate. As previously mentioned, I like the tongue. It has a wonderful richness and gameyness to it that I have come to love. My far less adventurous girlfriend stays with the chicken. They have other choices ranging from pork, to steak, to shrimp, to the ever popular ground beef (gotta please everyone I guess).\n\nAfter you order your tacos, try one of the fresh made flavored waters there. The fresh lime water is always my favorite, and is there every day, but they also have hibiscus, watermelon and other flavor selections. My girlfriend got the horchata, a milk based concoction with cinnamon, nutmeg and sugar. Or you could pop inside the Mexican grocery for a Coke hecho en Mexico. My favorite Coke because they use cane sugar, not HFCS.\n\nThe only downside is that they close right around 3:00 PM.\n\nCome to Reyna's. The tacos are amazing.

It's just.....chocolate, as far as you can see.  Gourmet, imported chocolate.  And some other types of candy as well, in old fashioned glass jars, or artfully displayed on a table.  Candy from Asia, candy from Britain.  Chocolate from Europe, South America, Africa.  Some of the bars looked incredible - some were priced at $15 or more, which totally blew my mind.  They had an intriguing section near the front devoted to baking chocolate, with chips, whole bars, and cool things like butterscotch and white chocolate baking pieces.  They also have gelato, and some unwrapped candies that look fresh made, behind a front counter.\n\nWe bought the aforementioned lavender sea salt caramels, and a few other bars.  It's a pretty pricey store, but it was clearly an incredible place that any chocolate fan should explore.  It's hard for me to judge since candy is not my favorite, but I enjoyed what I tried.  The caramels were coated in dark chocolate and did have a really interesting, herbal quality from the lavender.  I also tried an Irish Whiskey truffle bar that my boyfriend got - I don't care much for dark chocolate so it was too rich for me, but i liked the creamy center.\n\nDefinitely for the chocolate fan - especially if you like dark chocolate, they have countless varieties of it.

You're in the Strip District anyway.\n2. You're interested in Pittsburgh history.\n3. You've never experienced an old-time soda fountain before.\n4. You're looking for some hard-to-find penny candy.\n5. You want some damn good ice cream.\n\nI went for all five reasons, and I wasn't disappointed. Wait. That doesn't express the depths of my enthusiasm for Klavon's. KLAVON'S RULES!!!!!!!!! There, that's better.\n\nLet's take it in order. You have lots of dining options in the Strip. Now, Klavon's is a few blocks away from most of the popular places (we were at Salem's, which is also great, but that's another review), but it's easy to walk to and easy to find with all the neon signs.\n\nWhen you walk in to Klavon's, you're taken back in time. Choose a little booth or table, and gaze at the decor. Maybe you'll see an old liniment bottle from back when Klavon's was a drugstore. Maybe you'll notice the high-water mark from the 1936 flood (close to the ceiling!). Maybe you'll see the old penny scale or the phone booths. This is a place where history is celebrated.\n\nThe menu isn't extensive, but you still have lots of choices. Why not try an old-time phosphate, malted, or egg cream? It was good enough for your great-grandpa; it's good enough for you. I treated myself to a root beer float. It was the best I ever had. The reason? Both the root beer and the ice cream were made locally. On the way out, why not browse the penny candy racks? For a quarter, you can try a bunch of hard-to-find treats.\n\nI'd be remiss if I didn't mention that Mr. Klavon, the grandson (I think) of the original owner, still runs the place. A glipse of his epic mustache alone is worth the visit, but he's always willing to give you a tour. Friendly people in friendly Pittsburgh.

Up until recently I would have given them a four or maybe even a five star rating, but I have had several problems with food I purchased there in the last two months. I normally buy grape leaves, spinach pies, feta, and dips. Twice now I have purchased the grape leaves only to find that the rice stuffing is dry and hard and the taste is stale or just not very flavorful. The first time I bought them, I thought maybe it was a one-time problem, so I gave them another chance. I also purchased hummus and baba ganush to serve at a party. When i got them home I noticed that the baba was watery and didn't look normal. I tasted it (and so did a friend) and could not serve it to guests. I then opened the hummus and was surprised that it also did not taste very good. I served it anyways and it was left uneaten by the crowd. I also was surprised that some of the olives I purchased were dried out. I wonder... what is happening to one of my favorite stores?

As good as it gets!\" rating. This place is as good as it gets for Italian grocers and delis in Pittsburgh, but is it not quite as good as my all-time favorite, DiPaolo's Dairy on the corner of Grand and Mott in NYC. Short of making the seven hour drive to Little Italy, this place is truly the best in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe star attraction of Penn Mac is their deli. They have a wide selection of nearly one hundred cheeses from across the US, to imports not only from Italy, but around the world as well. The people working the counters are very nice and helpful no matter how busy they are or how little you know. I remember I was there one busy Saturday afternoon and said \"I am looking for a cheese to go with this sopresatta.\" Rather than roll their eyes and say \"NEXT!\", the lady and gentleman behind the counter broke out the cheese knives and handed me half a dozen slices of different cheeses. I ended up buying a pound of Spanish manchego and a pound of trugole, what they describe as an Italian table cheese.\n\nRight next to the cheese counter is the meat department. Again, while Penn Mac definitely specializes in cured Italian meats, they also have a very wide selection of meats from around the country as well. \"Is the Genoa salame from Genoa priced a little out of your league? Well then try this Wisconsin hard salame.\" Quotes like that fly back and forth across the deli counter so many time it is hard to keep track. To me, that's what customer service is about. The people there get it. They understand that by being nice to me, and helping me, and letting me try what I am buying before they slice it, they may not make a sale of something that sells for thirty dollars a pound, but they might mak a sale of something that is fifteen dollars a pound. Better to make a small sale than no sale. By treating their customers with such hospitalityand respect, not only am I going to come back, but I am going to send all my friends there too.\n\nDon't think that Penn Mac is only good for meat and cheese either. They are a full on Italian grocer. My godmother is a full blooded Italian who spends six months out of the year in her parents' old house in Italy, and she would be impressed with the selection at Penn Mac. They have a pasta and sauce section that has almost every variety and brand of dried pasta fdrom the US and Italy. Right as you come in there is also a fantastic spice selection as well, maybe not as wide a selection as Penzey's but then again that is whay Penzey's specializes in. Penn Mac also stocks a plethora of olive oils and balsamic vinegars. Do yourself a favor, swing by and after you get your cured meats and cheeses, pick up a bottle of really good extra virgin olive oil, a middle of the road balsamic vinegar, and an expensive bottle of balsamic vinegar. I dropped almost a hundred bucks on a bottle of very very good balsamic vinegar (I am not saying which because I want it to still be there when I go back) and let me say, the cheap stuff you gett at Giant Eagle has nothing on this. It is sweet and salty and rich and complex. Sometimes I just drink it. \n\nPenn Mac also has a very good bakery. The downside is that if you go there any time past noon, most of the bread is gone. What I have been able to get has been good rustic bread; soft and chewy on the inside and insanely crusty on the outside. Kind of like me come to think of it. If your cholesterol is making you feel guilty about all the meat, cheese and oil, Penn Mac is also home to a very nice little farm fresh vegetable section.\n\nTo sum it all up, Penn Mac is everrything a good deli should be.

We have a friend from D.C. who makes a point of shopping here when she's in town. I ask: Isn't there anyplace in DC (well, Tacoma Park) like this. The answer is \"no\". \n\nI like that he owners have worked hard to create a destination for food; they keep fiddling with their formula. I have been shopping here for at least 30 years and have seen it get better and better over the years. It used to be a rough-ish semi-wholesale place (e.g. minimum cheese cut was 1lb). The area around there had 5-6 produce stores, and a general feel of a terminal district. But there were changes, Nino broke away, produce stored faded away. Over time the area has turned into something more of a destination for a safely exotic Saturday excursion. As others have pointed out. Penn Mac has kept up.  On Saturdays I try to shop 8-9am, before the place gets crazy.\n\nI go there for cheese (varied, fresh and sometimes cheap) and deli meats (a decent though limited selection; porchetta and smoked pancetta appeared only in the last couple of years; prosciutto salami disappeared), as well as staples (pasta, oil, flour, capers, etc). On Saturdays they stock fresh Breadworks bread (in artisan Italian styles) and fresh pasta (from some place in Ohio: yummy). \n\nSome useful hints: by the end of Saturday, before closing, the bread goes down to an agreeable 1/2 price. They're open Sundays and seem to be way less busy. They are open during the week, and pleasantly uncrowded. They have a nice selection of flours, and dry pastas. Their balsamic selection seems to have mostly slid down to the fancy-looking bottle end of the spectrum. \n\nMore globally, Penn Mac comes across as a local institution. It's very different from a comparable store in Italy, or even in Canada. Those tend to be tidier and more business-like. Penn Mac tries to be a shopping \"experience\". But it works. \n\n(Personal wish: a real Italian butcher shop in Pittsburgh. But the butchers around here are are getting pretty good.)", "business_id": "niW0ggRVPW5fafcfImdK7w", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-05-11", "type": "review"}

Having grown up in New Jersey and being a frequent NYC visitor, I know a good Italian market when I'm in one.  Penn Mac?  Is a GREAT Italian market, and when I walked in and smelled the delectable funk from the cheese counter I knew I was going to be dropping a lot of money and packing those coolers full.\n\nIf you're a cheese lover you need to come here, for it has literally hundreds of different types.  Deli meats?  Got you covered.  Olive oil?  Lots in barrels ready to decant.  If you love pasta you just might lose your mind.  Tomato products?  Everything you want and a few of which you've never heard.  Breads, desserts, olives ... pardon me for a moment.  (discreetly wipes away drool)  Add in a super friendly and helpful staff and surprisingly reasonable prices and you have one of the better shopping experiences.  Yes, it's very crowded on weekends, but it's still easy to negotiate so don't let that put you off.\n\nWhen we got home I called my coworker to come get his stuff.  When I handed him a package of mortadella he immediately opened it and popped a slice into his mouth--and almost wept with joy.  As for us, we rationed everything because everything was just so delicious, and it was a sad evening when we finished the last of the braised beef ravioli.  \n\nIf you visit Pittsburgh, there are two things you absolutely must do:  go to a sporting event and visit the Strip District.  If you're smart, you'll drive in and bring coolers so you can go to Penn Mac for the mother of all Italian food shopping sprees.

Let me start by saying I am a huge flavored coffee fan, with my two favorite places to buy coffee online being http://www.greenmountaincoffee.com and http://www.griggscoffeehouse.com/catalog/index.php\n\nI had previously only been to Fortune's coffee in the strip, and was also impressed with their flavor selection but not with the actual flavors of the coffee.  After telling people this I was told to try Prestogeorge's and that I would be amazed.  So, but trusting their judgements, I purchased 5 - 1/2lb flavors, of which I am finally trying the fifth.  The first 2 you couldnt barely tell that their was flavoring, which is insane for a flavored coffee (vanilla butter nut & pumpking spice ), the next 2 had some flavor, but I wouldnt call them amazing (creme brulee and rain forest crunch) and the last is Blueberry, which from Green mountain coffees is my all time favorite coffee.  I am drinking this while I write this morning and unfortunately there is no flavor here as well.  \n\nI am unsure why the coffees have no flavor, but IT could be that they are very old and have been sitting in the jars for long enough for the flavor to disperse.  Granted, the coffee itself still tastes fine, in fact if you were just going for plain coffee I may even recommend it.\n\nAnyway, my hopes were not to give Prestogeorge a bad rap, but to stop anyone from making the trip in hopes of getting excellent flavored coffee in Pittsburgh.

After checking to ensure that I had cash, I suggested that we stop by for a cool treat, and he assented.  Fortunately, when we pulled up and parked, I saw a sandwich board sign on the sidewalk stating that they were open.  Hooray!\n\nMy original plan was to order a cone of soft serve ice cream and have it dipped in chocolate topping and then in sprinkles.  However, the woman working told me they didn't have chocolate topping (?!?), so I had to change my plans.  CM was intrigued by the water ice (Italian ice), since he'd never had any, and decided to order one.  I decided to do the same, since I'd been looking for an alternative to Rita's (bleh!), but water ice is surprisingly difficult to come by in the Burgh.  I asked the woman what brand it is, and she informed me that it's Hershey's (I wasn't even aware that Hershey's made water ice, but apparently, they do, and it's sold under the Via Venetto label.)\n\nFor our water ices, CM ordered watermelon flavor, and I ordered tie dye, a combination of lemon, lime, and blue raspberry flavors.  The tie dye was a nice combination of tart and sweet flavors, but I wasn't a huge fan of the watermelon, since it tasted rather artificial to me.  The texture was velvety, as is appropriate for water ice, and it was cold enough that it didn't melt quickly.  Best of all, the price was right ($2.14 w/ tax for a small)--a dollar cheaper than Rita's, which is overpriced IMO, and with comparable or better quality.  (I'll have to see if I can get them to make a gelati!)\n\nOddly, despite the claim that they didn't have chocolate topping, I saw a kid with a cone that appeared to be dipped in just that.  I'll have to try ordering that again next time to see if this was a fluke.  Regardless, I'll definitely be stopping back here soon to get another fix of cheap, delicious water ice!", "business_id": "3_3yJMo2dTPeq8woOW69IA", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-05-26", "type": "review"}

Might be fine to serve with coffee,  etc if you are a local,  but definitely not worth the price and shipping.  I doubt this is even the best cake in Pittsburgh,  much less the entire USA.

What's worse is I live five minutes away from this place. I can't feel \"too lazy\" to take a bus here because it is so conveniently close; I can literally just walk over and get what I want. It is so dangerous for me, but I always convince myself it is worth it. \n\nI've tried to make an effort to get something different when I am at Prantl's. So far I've had the burnt almond torte, apple strudel, white chocolate raspberry cup, burnt almond cup, red velvet cup, and coconut cream doughnut. All of these pastries are fantastic, so allow me to get a little more detailed about each of them.\n\nBurnt almond torte: of course, you have to get this. It's what they are famous for, blah blah blah. But, be warned! If you are eating for one, get the travel bar, and do NOT eat it all at once! I am a person that loves sweets. I have always had a really high tolerance for them. But in this case, the almond torte was very sweet even for me. If you do not have much of a sweet tooth, I suggest you eat a little at a time, because you can easily go over the deep end and feel sick, and end up hating this pastry, or something.\n\nWhy is this pastry amazing? Well, first off, the cream is a thick topping that, in my opinion, takes the....cake. The cake is moist, succulent, and isn't too much. You know how there are some cakes that are super dense, like when you take a bite out of it there is just too much cake?? This isn't like that at all. There is a little butter cream frosting --I think-- in the middle of the torte that has a great consistency with the cake and cream. On top of that are the almonds which provide the perfect crunch. It is a fantastic combination in your mouth, and it makes you want all of it. But like I said, enjoy it, and stop before you go overboard.\n\nApple Strudel: My grandma would always make apple strudel when I was at her place, so my expectations were high. Nevertheless, Prantl's exceeded it. I was shocked. The apple strudel definitely is a lot less sweeter than the burnt almond torte. The dough and the apple filling work very well together, and taking a bite out of this is like taking a trip down memory lane. I highly recommend this pastry if you are a fan of apples.\n\nThe three cups: These cups are so cute! The best part of it is you get a deal when you get a dozen of them. The white chocolate raspberry cups are a great treat that has a rich raspberry filling in the middle. It takes away from the super sweet cup, and gives it a more decadent, tart-y flavor. The almond cup is a miniature version of the travel torte, except the butter cream frosting is in the middle of the cup. I actually liked this better, because I feel like the butter cream really brings out the flavor. The red velvet cups were sweet, and my least favorite of all of them. Don't get me wrong, they were great, but seemed boring and not as unique compared to the other cups.\n\nThe coconut cream doughnut was nice! I am not a fan of coconut on pastries, but the flakes provided a nice touch instead of an overpowering flavor. There was a vanilla cream in the doughnut, which is my favorite, but to me tasted like a good doughnut, and, like the red velvet cups, was not that unique. \n\nFor those that are not the most sweets-inclined, I would recommend the apple strudel, or the white-chocolate raspberry cups. The pastries that are baked here are delicious and rich. Go here, you will not regret it!", "business_id": "yWVY1Bq19lDxu3BP7_96EQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-03-11", "type": "review"}

And I wish that I hadn't, because now their goodies are going to haunt my dreams.\n\nI came here to pick up cupcakes for a friend's birthday. They had well-stocked cases considering it was a little later in the day. I bought a few of their regular-sized cupcakes with sprinkles and an assortment of their cake cups (which are smaller cupcakes in different flavors). Then I saw \"it\"....the cake which I'd only heard about in legends...the burnt almond torte. They had a \"travel\" individual-sized torte available, so I figured I needed to see what all of the fuss was about (I mean, hey, if it's good enough for the Huffington Post, it's good enough for me!)\n\nSeeing as I have no self control, I couldn't resist digging into the almond torte as soon as I got home. This confection is everything it's cracked up to be. It's such an interesting contrast of textures -- the buttery vanilla cake itself was light and airy and almost melted in my mouth. It perfectly complemented the crunchy almonds and large flakes of sugar on the outside. The buttercream icing enveloping it all gave it a nice burst of creamy sweetness. It managed to be simultaneously buttery, sweet, and decadent without feeling too rich. The only part of the torte that I didn't get a lot from was the custard layer in the middle. There wasn't much of it present, and it didn't really add anything to the cake. However, this was the \"travel\" version, which I think uses a shelf-stable custard. I read that they have a version that uses another type of filling that requires refrigeration, and I'd be curious to try that to see if it make a difference. Either way, it was freaking delicious. I would say that I agree with HuffPo that this is the best cake in America, but since I haven't tried every cake in America, I'm not yet qualified to make that statement...so...new life goal! ;)\n\nThe other goodies that I picked up were winners as well. The chocolate cupcakes with sprinkles were moist, flavorful and piled high with fluffy frosting. I would classify the frosting here as on the sweeter side (which I prefer), but not sweet to the point that it makes your teeth hurt. The assorted cake cups were equally mouthwatering, each one packed with its own unique flavors. Everyone agreed that I was the hero of the night for having brought such deliciousness to the birthday party ;)\n\nSee you in my dreams, burnt almond torte...", "business_id": "yWVY1Bq19lDxu3BP7_96EQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-03-23", "type": "review"}

Prantl's is something special, and it is my new obsession.\n\nApple Strudel ($2.49):  The best thing they make.  PACKED full of apples and cinnamon.  The pastry crust is flaky and perfect.  This is one of the best apple strudels I have ever eaten, and the slices are huge for the price.\n\nBurnt Almond Torte Bar ($3.99):  I know this is the home-run hitter for most people so I had to try it.  The cups are kind of over priced a $1.50 for a bite or two so definitely get the bar.  I hate nuts in my desserts, but I LOVE this.  This dessert is so unique and delicious.

On my quest to be a refined English lady I've been on a hunt for the cities best high tea service.  Probably not the most popular past time, but you can't knock it until you've tried it!  And... You MUST try this place!\n\nThis is a proper setting for such an event, you almost feel like you need white gloves and a parasol!  And surprise, the Inn is actually an Inn!  Apparently it dates back to the olden days of yore (late 1800's) and is one of those old Shadyside mansions that was converted into an Inn at some point.  But if you have relatives who want something more unique in the heart of a vibrant Burgh neighborhood, I'd suggest here!\n\nLet's get to the tea service though!  It's served from noon to four daily, which is nice for a \"ladies who lunch afternoon\" or a Saturday or Sunday outing for mom.  It's in a parlor, which is small but charming.  There's also an outdoor patio that would be nice if it's not too hot out (drinking hot tea in 80 degrees isn't too appealing).  There's a full High Tea Service for $20 per person, which seems a little steep, but for tea service isn't too bad.  There's also other combo's for around $12, but I'd say go big or go home!\n\nThe tea menu is VERY large and there were tons of choices. They give you the main choices between black, green and herbal, but you can also blend them together too.  I chose the caramel vanilla, which I guess is being taken off the menu sadly.  It was delish though... so maybe they'll bring it back at some point.  There were honestly a lot of different ones I would have been more than happy with too!\n\nThe one thing I think is very cool and very different is that they offer you a different tea selections with the different tiers of food.  I've never heard of them doing that before.  Usually you get one tea choice and that's it.  I love that you can pair the foods together with different teas for no up-charge.  Very unique and a definite perk of coming here.  \n\nI've been to several High Tea Services and this one would definitely be on the light side.  The portions were small, but surprisingly filled me up for the entire afternoon until a later dinner.  I mean, it's tea service, not a five course meal!  There was a chicken and egg salad sandwich and a mushroom and cream cheese on a crisp baguette.  The winner was absolutely the mushroom and cream cheese choice.  It was amazing and I definitely could have eaten ten of those!  \n\nThere were two scone choices of blueberry/peach and lemon/lemon ginger.  Those were actually surprisingly tiny.  I thought they were both moist and fresh, but I would have loved them to be a bit bigger because they were so good and I love to slather clotted cream on them!   Oh, and there was also fresh fruit.  Which is great and all, but more scone please!\n\nThe last tier was the desserts.  Forgive me for not being accurate enough, but there was a delicious chocolate piece, cheesecake with lemon curd and blueberries.  Loved the chocolate, but I like my cheesecake plain.  While it was good it wasn't life changing.  BUT, the coconut macaroon was honestly thee best macaroon I had EVER had.  Again, ten of those in my possession would have been scarfed down in like 5 seconds.  I would buy a batch of those if I could!  Seriously, can I??\n\nI can't wait to bring my mom here, total mom place fo sho!  But I also love it for myself too!  Or for a bridal shower... If I could do another one (since I'm married I don't think that's proper).  But it's a great place, that's what I'm trying to say and I'll for sure be back to get my proper English lady on!", "business_id": "rUQfZOengMpXFkLvJrNJ3g", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-05-16", "type": "review"}

The food was delicious from the cucumber finger sandwiches to the apricot scones.\n\nWhat a lovely spot for afternoon tea and I look forward to returning again to Pittsburgh - may want to stay there next time!", "business_id": "rUQfZOengMpXFkLvJrNJ3g", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-04-17", "type": "review"}

Nestled in Shadyside on Negley Avenue don't drive by too fast as you could easily miss the small sign out front.  The Victorian home is a bed and breakfast and the rooms are beautiful with privates bath. I would love to stay sometime.  I have gone twice for Sunday brunch and both times have been absolutely amazing. While the food is delicious the experience of a eating a 4 course brunch  in a old Victorian home is worth the price. For $23 a person, the brunch includes a starter, pastries, entr\u00e9e, dessert and unlimited tea, coffee or juice. The tea list is extensive and I recommend the mint chocolate-tastes just like the ice cream.  On our last trip we started with a small bowl of fruit followed by the pastry selections-these are always fresh and made in house.  This time it was lemon poppy seed bread and cranberry muffins. They were both absolutely scrumptious and I was wanting more as you only get a small sample.  Next up we got to pick our entr\u00e9e-they don't have a menu and usually have 4 choices and then eggs any style. I went with the goat cheese, asparagus and leek omelet with potatoes and turkey bacon (loved that this was an option).  My date ordered the hash with poached eggs and regular bacon.  The omelet was amazing and had such great flavor.  For dessert we were all given extremely cute lady bug sugar cookies.

There is never any reason to set foot in this Giant Eagle ever again.\n\nI've been a resident of Pittsburgh since 2006 and been shopping at Market District since it opened. Steadily over the past 5 years it has declined in quality. Here are some reasons why:\n\n-The staff and workers surly, unhelpful and downright arrogant. If I have trouble scanning a coupon in self-checkout (which they always manually input and is *always* the machine's fault) it takes me 5 minutes to fla a person down. They're chatting or BS'ing with each other and ignore me. Although there are 20 some checkout lanes, there are never more than a dozen checkout people. This is nonsense. I've shopped early in the morning, lunchtime, 3pm, 7pm and late at night and there is ALWAYS a line for checking out. The lone good employee is Jay, a kindly older man with white hair. Jay is competent and runs circles around others. Jay once loaned me his cell phone to call someone when my wallet and phone were stolen in the parking lot years ago.\n\n-The food is constantly, insanely rearranged. Why do stores rearrange food? So you get distracted and buy more stuff. This is a proven marketing strategy. However, it has gotten to the point in the last 6 months where they move things around SO often and at random that the employees can't keep up. I have to ask for help to find basic vegetables I buy every week (broccoli & cucumbers, for example). In the past 6 months half of the time the poor staffers themselves don't know. I blame Giant Eagle's moronic \"middle management\" types for abusing market research. \n\n-The food is rarely replenished. For awhile I would have to ask a stockperson to get whole wheat tortillas from the back EVERY WEEK and I don't shop on weekends when it's super busy. This went on for 3 weeks until I finally started buying Trader Joe's whole wheat tortillas - which are always in stock. This has happened for the milk I buy, the shredded cheese, cereals, canned goods, etc. \n\n-The selection is getting crappier while prices rise. More and more products are stocked that are low-brow and fewer new products are stocked (or current products kept in stock) that are more expensive. For example, the rows of Kraft mac n' cheese expand while organic Annie's mac 'n cheese decline. Giant Eagle Market District is serving a well off population. If people from Oakland and the Hill are coming in, build another store for them. I don't wish to shop at a store with more Shurfine products. I understand that food prices have gone up 10% this year HOWEVER I don't see prices increasing at other grocery stores.\n\n-The prices on frozen vegetables is insane. Whole Foods has their house brand of vegetables for $1.25-$1.50 whereas retail Birdseye at GE are $2-2.50. Prices on Hagen Dazs and other high end frozen goods are slightly cheaper or the same price at Whole Foods.\n\n-Overall I find the prices on fruits and fresh vegetables as well as frozen vegetables to be lower and more stable at Whole Foods. When canned goods like whole canned tomatoes or organic beans are on sale at Whole Foods, the deals are better than at GE. This was a place that in 2006 was known as \"Whole Paycheck\". I spend more and more at Whole Foods these days. Those mini babybel cheese rounds? $1 cheaper at Whole Foods. \n\nIn short, instead of spending $100/week at Giant Eagle, I am minimizing my budget there as much as possible to $25/week. I shop mostly at Whole Foods and Trader Joe's now and even a bit at Target, which had 1.5 pounds of Wild Alaskan Salmon for $9 the other week. The farmer's market serves my need of fresh vegetables in the summer. \n\nGiant Eagle has really screwed itself lately. Their employees are surly and useless. I find the most helpful employees and clean, well stocked stores to be Whole Foods and Trader Joe's. As it is we spend nearly as much on food as we do on rent. We are a target demographic that is disgusted with Giant Eagle.\n\nAs for the girl who says she has a \"foodie boyfriend\"? Please. If they required specialty ingredients they would be going to Whole Foods and the Strip District.\n\nBad move, Giant Eagle.

Meaning, if you have a cart full of stuff (like I did) and some drinks, you will only be able to purchase the drinks at the cash register near Starbucks. I don't know why I keep saying the plural \"drinks\" because that's not happening either. One case per person. That's it. And they will card you. Be prepared...I saw someone try to buy 2 cases of beer for someone, and neither had their ID. They left empty-handed. \nThe only thing that saved this store were the nice people that worked there.

These are people who make your day and have brought a smile to my face whenever I've had a bad day. I would hire any number of them at any time. I have driven past other locations just because I enjoy the atmosphere and staff at this location. No longer. Their most recent management change has left the place without a soul. It's a change that you can sense  and see ( they did  some lite remodeling)  when you walk in the door. This was the day after her abrupt departure. This individual was always here to fill in for staff or to make sure the place was taken care of. She was here in the snow storm this year. Amazing right? \nI'm a bottomless member and got ten people from work to buy them from here bc I enjoyed this place and it's service. \nI will not be getting one next year and doubt I will frequent as much in the future. It's not the same! As I'm wiping down my own table to sit down, it is quiet and lacks the laughter,  smiles, and business I have always appreciated. \nA lesson  for senior management and owners to take to heart. Take care of your most important assets your staff! \nI hope to see a turn around but in the weeks since the change I have seen only one thing a decrease in the service and quality I've come to expect.

Small, selective section of kitchen implements - not meant to be of use in dire need, but trends - microplanes and zesters, mezzalunas. Spotless shelves in perfect order. Truffled products of every imaginable use - nori salt - the olive bar might be the only thing here leaning towards pedestrian. Chico-and-Nordstrom's-clad ladies abound. Service can be icy, but always well informed. Is the coffee superlative? Not at all, but it's not obscenely priced either.\n\nA quick note on the cheese counter - large and global, and the few times I've bought a hunk, it had obviously been well cared for, but EF's, down the street, is larger and more locally focused.

It was colorless, tasteless, looked like paper the sandwich was wrapped in, the cheapest of the domestic imitations IOWs. \n\nTHIS is what Parma prosciutto  looks like: bright pink : http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Prosciutto_di_Parma_-_affettato2.jpg/640px-Prosciutto_di_Parma_-_affettato2.jpg\n\nI ate the transparent slice of prosciutto on its own and still could not taste any of it, you'd probably need a much thicker slice to get any flavor. \n\nI went back inside and checked the cold cut counter and sure enough not one of their 4 types of prosciutto on display looked anything like it. So what you get in a D&D sub is a thin portion of cheap domestic cold cuts pretending to be imported.\n\nI called the manager, he said he would talk to the chef about it (I smell bull) and refunded me.

The ambiance, especially with the views of the lake and paddle boats, allows you to shift your mind into thinking you're anywhere but a local hangout in the Piedmont of NC. \n\nThe Vault itself has tiny quarters, but stocks some well-treasured and fresh names, both in wine and brews. Snacks are available, with a varied assortment of cheeses, pretzels and party mix. It's very simple to walk in, make your selections, then take to the register for purchase. The only problem you may find are long lines, so I wouldn't wait until the last minute for a drink or the bathroom. \n\nIt's worth a drive from anywhere in the Charlotte area to see what the UCB has been keeping to itself. This place is equally impressive for the intimate conversation of a first date, relaxing with a group of friends after work, or bringing your dog for some appreciative petting from strangers. If you're single, the last one is especially fun.", "business_id": "1wIKHSHPOkywuOkyrXt6dw", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-05-31", "type": "review"}

Shop accordingly.\n\nThe growler filling station needs help. Last time I used it, a dude who I wasn't sure could spell bee-er filled up a growler of (I think) Heavy Seas in a *clear* growler. I asked if he had a towel I could wrap it up in for the trip home. He simply stared at me. I let it go, and made a dash for home with all haste.\n\nBeyond that, the staff there always struck me as sad and apathetic, trudging through the day, one day closer to retirement or eating a bullet, whichever comes first. A few nice smiling faces here and there, but the friendly visages only mask the gray, limp existence that their collective lives seem to have become.", "business_id": "2-M1_ok4NZ-fSF6SbBsp1A", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-05-17", "type": "review"}

Quaint and cozy, lots of comfort foods.  Nothing spectacular, though the homemade breads are quite good.  A bit on the pricey side and can fill-up with people quickly, especially on the weekends.\n\nDetailed review:\nI've lived near C's for about a year now, and have never stopped-in to check it out.  Folks at work gave mixed reviews - some raved about the place, others gave it a \"Meh.\"  I run past it nearly every morning and they always seem to have a good-sized crowd, especially on Saturdays and Sundays, so I figured it had to be somewhat decent... with that, I treated myself to a breakfast this morning.\n\nI wandered in at around 9:30am on Memorial Day and was pleased to find plenty of seating.  The hostess offered me a table outside, which was a nice bonus - the weather was gorgeous, so I happily took the offer.  I also grabbed one of their complimentary/shared newspapers to read.\n\nA waitress stopped by to ask for my drink order - I went with coffee - and to drop off a menu.  She came back a few minutes later with an acrylic coffee cup and a stainless coffee carafe.  She left to tend to another table; I needed some cream for the coffee... oh well, it was nice and I was happy to continue browsing the menu, sans cream for my coffee.\n\nBreakfast offerings were ordinary: eggs, hashbrowns, pancakes, omelets, skillets, and a couple of extras, like eggs benedict, belgian waffles, and some homemade pastries (turnovers, donuts, muffins, cookies, etc).\n\nThe waitress stopped by to ask if I was ready to order - told her I decided on the \"Hen's Nest\" which consisted of 2 eggs, hashbrowns, and toast.  I also ordered a pancake, and requested some cream for the coffee.  She apologized and immediately brought some half-n-half containers.  We were in business.  \n\nBefore leaving to take my order to the kitchen, she asked if I'd like anything in the hashbrowns.  I was pleased!  C's has some specialty hashbrown items on the menu, but I didn't want to order a huge plate of them... so, when the offer surfaced to add onions, peppers, tomatoes, etc to my potatoes, I jumped at the chance.\n\nFood came about 20 minutes later and looked tasty.  The pancake was a lot thinner than I had pictured, but it was quite tasty.  I found myself wishing I had ordered 2.  \n\nThe Hen's Nest was just \"OK\" - the hashbrowns weren't greasy and featured a nice, crispy char,  but the onions and peppers didn't do much for flavor, oddly enough... I found the entire dish to be largely flavorless.  :-(  \n\nThe multigrain toast was very good - and was probably the star of the entire meal.  The waitress only stopped by once more - to drop off the check, which was a bit of a shocker as well... $12 for my modest breakfast - $5.99 for the Hen's Nest, $0.89 for adding extras to the hashbrowns, $2.99 for one (1) pancake (!!!), $1.89 for coffee.\n\nService = 2 stars (nothing great)\nFood = 3 stars (average breakfast fare)\nValue = 1.5 stars (quite pricey for what it was)\nMISC = 3 stars (bakery items looked stellar, nice outdoor patio, very relaxing)\n\nI'd really like to give C's 2.5 stars, but I'm feeling a bit generous so, it's a 3-star \"gift\" rating.  Had I been in a crankier mood, it would've gone 2-stars... :-)\n\nFor what it's worth, I think the Hubbard Avenue Diner has a better overall breakfast, and it's about 1/2 the price.  It'll probably be a while before I visit C's again.", "business_id": "B0Vuwn6Hugc-0U5n31YBfg", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-05-31", "type": "review"}

It was a bright but bitterly cold day, and the event was held outside. I assumed there would be those outdoor space heater things, but I didn't see any, if there were.

So allow me to begin again.\n\nThis Walmart location is one of the teeny tiny, original designs.  The parking lot has so many huge dips and holes I sometimes think I am being forced to go spelunking in my car.  \n\nThe old lady greeters at the front door are my favorite part of the experience because they remind me of grandma.  But they would probably mace me if I tried to run up and give them a hug.  \n\nThey have a fabric department, which seems to be a feature that the newer, super walmarts are missing.  Unfortunately, the store is usually running a skeleton crew most of the time, so it's hard to find an employee in that section of the store who knows how to cut some fabric.  \n\nMost of the employees here are like most of the employees at any Walmart, underpaid, and overworked.  So it doesn't bother me too much when they frown at me.  I've been on the other side of the register before, so I know how soul crushing it can be.  Though, they may not be frowning at me because of that reason, they probably just know I'm an incredible dufus.  \n\nHowever, there is one employee there who is usually cashiering, and has this wonderful Russian accent.  She's also very friendly and cheery.  The other day she was telling me about growing her own basil, freezing it in ice cube trays with chicken stock, and then plopping the cubes in rice later on for flavoring.  Tricky, tricky!  \n\nAnyway, I guess I am more impressed by the larger Walmart in Monona that has the shopping cart escalators.  I could stand there all day and launch carts down that thing, it really revs up the dork in me.  \n\nBut in the meantime, if I don't feel like heading over that way I could just stop at this Walmart to get maced by the grannies and listen to cooking recipes from Nina.", "business_id": "tZbKiggbDGeBpGnOYk0Syw", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-05-22", "type": "review"}

It kept telling me I had unauthorized items in bagging area (uh, it was the item I'd just slid over the laser) and then it said I had a restricted item and needed cashier approval to finish up and pay. I didn't have any alcohol, bullets, weapons, or cigarettes. I had a 2-pack of lighters, which was probably it, but why?

The wireless internet was fast and reliable, which was a welcome benefit.\n\nShortly after noon I went up to the front to order lunch and selected the Sir Isaac Turkey. Lately I've been on a kick of fruit in savory dishes and the strawberry mayo and apple slices paired with turkey and cheddar sounded tasty and unique (I've never, ever heard of strawberry mayo - you're crazy, Cool Beans). \n\nI was glad I chose what I did - it was a really good flavor profile that hit the spot. I went with fruit for my side choice (the others were chips and salad) and was pumped when it was strawberries, pineapple, and grapes.

She explained it as being more of an earthy kind of taste and if I wanted it a bit sweeter then I should add a shot of Vanilla.  So I decided on that and figured why not try it. I was so in love with it after the first sip. It definitely has an earthy flavor but that shot of vanilla sweetens it up a bit, and it really pairs well with the earthyness. \n\nNow every morning I stop in, it's the same barista almost always, and she is the sweetest. She did have to break the news to me last week that they ran out of the green coffee for the latte, but would be getting another shipment later in the week, which was a sad morning, but I opted out for the sweetheart latte, which is great.

No they keep them out all night, available for anyone with a late night sweet tooth.

For years, Corkscrew was my favorite haunt and I could be found there for wine tastings each Friday and Saturday, occasionally for Sunday beer tastings, and sometimes just to stop by on off nights and sample some wines.  It was like a home away from home.  There was an ever-increasing group of regulars that lingered after the formal tastings to open bottles of wine and share with one another and with newcomers.  I met so many nice people there.  People shared wine and conversation and food.  It was a feeling of camaraderie, of family, and it extended even to the staff.  Wine tastings were held in the back corner of the store and people milled about in that close little area, lending itself to conversations and introductions and socializing in general.  That was in the days before \"Buvons\" and all the other frills.  Things have changed.  I returned to Corkscrew recently after a six month absence.  I paid $20 for a platter of three pieces of cheese, a few slices of bread, and a few apricots that cost me a mere $8 last Fall.  I was also surprised to see a charge of $2 for a glass from which to drink my wine purchase: another new fee.  Glasses were always free.  Many of the staff from my \"era\" left and management has changed.  The new manager, Todd Fusco, is a knowledgeable and personable guy who previously managed another favorite place of mine, Farren's.   He has inherited the current concept there.  He will do well because he has the savvy and personality to succeed.  Corkscrew still has their impressive selection of fine wine, craft beer, and other spirits.  It still has its weekly tastings and many new events, but people take their glass of wine and wander about the larger expanses of \"Buvons\" without the interaction of the old days.  I would hope that its staff would be as knowledgeable as those who have left.  Live music has been added, not something I particularly enjoy in some settings, like when I'm trying to enjoy a nice glass of wine and good conversation.  I am not necessarily resistant to change and I did make an effort when some of these changes were initiated last summer, but in my opinion the intimacy, the camaraderie has lost something in the redesign and restructure of the place.  The new Corkscrew appears successful which is nice because the people behind Corkscrew are nice people and were always good to me in the past. It's great to hear that so many people attend events there.  For me, however, it's  just not the same.  I shall always miss the old days, the little perks, the gathering of people, and the sense of belonging.  I give a rating of three stars because it still is the best wine emporium in C-U but withhold two stars for the loss of something unique and personal that it once offered.  If you were a part of that, you would understand.\n\nOn second thought . . Meh, I've experienced better.  Sadly, the \"better\" I experienced was the old Corkscrew, before this \"Buvons\" nonsense started.  I've given the new concept several tries and always come away disappointed.  It has become a cold, impersonal business.  Corkscrew has lost its soul, its heart, its spirit.  I mourn its passing.\n\nUPDATE:  Recently went to a \"wine tasting.\"  What a joke. Those participating were denied entry into the hallowed halls of \"Buvons\" and consigned to a small area near the cash registers.  I was then told that they were phasing out their weekly tastings, once the hallmark of the place and a draw for those new to wine as well as connoisseurs.  Prominently placed on the entry to said \"Buvons\" was a large, hand-drawn sign asking for a $6 cover fee.  Our group was granted a table in those hallowed halls and some bought bottles of wine to share.  I was one.  They were charging a $5 corkage fee for each bottle.  WHAT?!?!?  A corkage fee by definition is charged by a restaurant to patrons bringing their own wines.  We were buying our wines there.  When did this nonsense start?  In discussing the policy with some former regulars, I was regaled with stories of apathy by staff when asked if Corkscrew could get certain wines (which Binney's did get) as well as other costly and ludicrous changes in policy.  A pleasant wine experience has taken a back seat to live music.  In the poor acoustics of \"Buvons\" the music is loud enough yet musicians still use amps.  Conversations are impossible once the music starts, as is any enjoyment of wine and the overpriced cheese plates.  One would think staff would wear masks as they rob you blind but they feel no such need to hide their identity.  This demise of a once customer friendly, intimate wine emporium was difficult to see.  I recall my concerns when the owners planned to expand.  I said I hoped it wouldn't alter the conviviality of the place and was assured things would be the same.  Not a chance.  I read the reviews here and am astonished.  Then again, it sounds like the reviewers never knew what Corkscrew was like before greed took over.", "business_id": "7ICHhzV20NHITwLwaVWsQg", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-04-26", "type": "review"}

That's the feeling I had yesterday afternoon when I foolishly decided to try La Tolteca for the first time...\n\nWhy was this a foolish decision? Because I got sick. Super duper sick. Which I should have known was going to happen because the Fish Burro I ordered tasted terrible. And now, here I am, 24 hours later, still trying to keep fluids in my body in between trips to the bathroom.\n\nNow I know what you're thinking... \"What does he expect? He ordered a Fish Burro!\" And I know. You're right. It's just that I've had such good luck with fish tacos at a couple of other restaurants lately (Canteen, Tacos Atoyac) that I decided to see what sort of magic La Tolteca could create with their mahi mahi. Apparently their in-house magician has Mondays off.\n\nI seriously don't know why there's so many four and five star reviews of this place on Yelp. It's not that great. Even if my burrito hadn't made me ill, I still would have felt compelled to write something to balance all the positive reviews on here. Maybe the corn tortillas they use on their tacos deserve the accolades that other reviewers can't seem to stop talk about, but my flour tortilla was below average. It was dry and it tasted like paper.\n\nAs for the burro, I specifically asked about the filling prior to ordering it and I was told that it only contained cabbage, fresco cheese and guacamole. Sadly, when I took my first bite, out spewed a white, mayonnaise-like substance. The burro's filling was more like a fish salad of sorts and it tasted off. Very off. And the fish wasn't hot. Actually, nothing it the burro was the least bit warm. And the guacamole was on the side--not inside the burro. But again, I was starving at this point so I took it down. Every last bite.\n\nI knew immediately that something was wrong. I considered removing the food from my body as soon as I got outside, but I decided to keep my finger out of mouth and let things settle. Big mistake. There would be no settling. I consider myself to have an iron gut, too. I can basically eat anything in any quantity (not that I do this often) but normally I have good luck. I haven't been this sick since eating food from a middle-of-nowhere farmstand while bike touring in the Caribbean.\n\nI'm giving La Tolteca two stars because I did like their hot sauces--all of them. And they have cheap beer, too ($2 Coronas all day, every day). However, as Michael S. noted in an earlier review, everything I tried tasted off. Tangy is fine when that's what a place is going for, but everything I ate tasted slightly tangy in a ugh-this-is-going-to-make-me-sick sort of way. Not cool.\n\nSo that's that. I really don't think I'll be back. I have no desire to explore the bakery case and there's way too many small taquerias around to take any more chances with this high-volume, supermarket of a restaurant.", "business_id": "apCfJVnRyaw6oVUBKujpUQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-05-03", "type": "review"}

Its a noble effort to bring Mexican staples and unconventionals to the big city in the middle of Arizona, USA, but the product are tinged with americanization; from their weekend menudo, which is wholly rubbish, to the carne which is a grade above what you would get in a true Mexican market (damn FDA).  Though the latter may sound like an unusual gripe, its that stringy gato-grade-meat that makes fajitas and tortas uniquely tasty.  I was impressed one time, however, when my buddy Graham snagged a few pounds of fajita meat for the SuperBowl from PHX RM, and they marinaded it for him in a sturdy plastic bag which included whole jalapenos to boot.  However, I beleive it was Graham's skill on the grill that made them very tasty and moist rather than any particularly amazing grade of meat from the Market.\n\nAs a hispanic, the place feels appreciably disingenuous.

As of June 1, 2009 travelers must possess either a passport, passport card, or WHTI-compliant identification to enter the US by air, land or sea. Contrary to popular belief however, Americans will be able to visit the Phoenix Ranch Market without documentation.\n\nGENERAL DESCRIPTION/DESCRIPCION GENERAL: Phoenix Ranch Market III is an upmarket Mexican-style mercado complete with an interior food court called \"La Cocina\" (The Kitchen). It is located in a rather unpleasant part of town, but manages to attract a large following of gringos eager to inject some diversity into their palette without risking turista.\n\nTHE FOOD/LA ALIMENTACIN: Offerings in \"La Cocina\" run the gamut from Mexican style tortas, to more iconic tacos and burritos. Many items offer a choice of meat, from ham to carne asada, to carnitas. A separate area offers various seafood dishes. Everything is ala carte, suprising those hoping to economize using an American style \"combo\".  Despite this, \"La Cocina\" remains popular, especially at lunch time.\n\nSERVICE/SERVICIO: All orders are taken by an attendant standing next to the line for the cashier. Most guests do not wait long before placing the order. Some have reported difficulty communicating with the attendant however, the other employees tend to have command of the English language. Visitors are responsible for retrieving their own orders and seating themselves at long bench-style tables. \n\nPRICES/PRCIOS: Like Mexico itself, the Ranch Market is not the bargain it is made out to be. Prices that may look low for entrees quickly increase when adding in the cost of beverages, churros, and gas. Most respondents however, believe that the mercado occupies an important niche between true fast food and more sophisticated self-serve meals. \n\nSPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS/CONSIDERACIONES ESPECIAL: Some have accused the Phoenix Ranch Market from being too acommodating to non-Latino customers. While this concern cannot be dismissed, it is obviously the case that all of Mexico has fallen to this trend. New hotels now gleam along the shoreline in Puerto Penasco, golf courses spourt in the arid desert outside Cabo San Lucas, all while Costcos can be found in such tourist-heavy states as Veracruz and Guanajuato. The Calderon Government and America's Hispanics will have to confront the tension between assimilation and authenticity one agua fresca at a time.", "business_id": "VXIkI9_EbDbYHeO9IzKjJg", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-05-20", "type": "review"}

It's the closest Market to my house, it's fun and lively, the produce looks great, and the prepared food smells wonderful.\n\nBut I don't love it.  I'm actually somewhat annoyed by this store.\n\nNumerous times I have entered looking for something and haven't been able to find it.  I know you're thinking it's some wierd gringa item I'm looking for, but this last time I was looking for canned tomatoes to make chili.  Canned tomatoes!?!?!  I'll cut them a little slack because I actually sent the husband to do the dirty work and he couldn't find it after asking 2 or 3 employees.  I have a sneaking suspicion that they do actually have it there, because it would be ridiculous for a Mexican market to not have canned tomatoes.\n\nAnother time I took an out-of-town friend.  He was so enamored with the beauty of the bakery items that he wanted to photograph the many cakes and pastries.  But the tub-o-security rolled over and said \"No Photographs!\"  Seriously?  These people work so hard to make such beautiful creations and we can't take pictures?  Of food?  (Ironically, the next day we went to Taliesin West and were encouraged to take photographs of everything except the gift shop.)  And, we left empty handed because the store didn't have 2 of the ingredients we needed.\n\nBottom line:  If I'm incredibly unspecific with the ingredients I am looking for, I can definitely do some grocery shopping here.

On the way out you have a hankering for a Thirstbuster and a Payday.  This is the vibe of Rainbow Donuts.  I get the feeling this place had a reincarnation and they're disguising the catacombs with those unnecessarily GIANT glass displays.  I've never seen them completely filled ... uh, ever ... and it makes their selection of glazed pastry seem paltry.  \n\nI was so disoriented by this whole encounter that i actually ordered an ORANGE CAKE donut.  I'm puking on myself right now remembering it.  What a shite state of affairs when you think that ordering such a conception is a wise decision.  To be honest, their selection WAS pretty sparse, and I was just kinda wanting to bounce because some customer was arguing about a mistake the owner had made by inserting the wrong donut into his half-dozen LAST WEEK and wanted compensation for it THIS WEEK in the form of a free donut.  \n\nMeanwhile, my eyes are molesting my stomach by flickering between donut choices maple or orange.  My brain intervenes with a WTF?  So, i chose the lesser of the evils -- even going against my cake-donut discriminatory practices and made a panicked decision.  \n\nEnd result:  there are MUCH better choices for hangover donuts in the central area and for slightly cheaper.  Also, that 24 hour sign practically had me thrown in the clink one night as i foolishly left the bar drunk and early in search of hot, glazed donuts.  Because Rainbow was in fact closed, a kick in the gut to be sure, I ended up driving around central on this quest for donuts at 3-? am, until i eventually forgot I was even driving or why I was out in the first place.

I have to say, this is the worst Cocos location I've ever been at. The food made us feel sick, the service was horrible and the waiters and waitresses were rude. Our original plan was to go to National Pancake Day at IHOP. After seeing the line at IHOP we deiced to find somewhere else. I saw the cocos on the way home and we decided to stop there. \n\nWhen we first got there, over 6 of their tables were dirty wish dishes piled high. The waitress came out and said there was a party of 30 and it would take an hour for our food to be out. She cleaned off a table and sat us. We accepted and started looking at the menus. \n\nA random waiter came out, brought us our drinks and told us that they were no longer making pancakes, which is the reason we went there in the first place. We all decided to change our orders when our waitress came out and offered us the pancakes. We assume the cooks did not want to be bothered making more pancake batter and asked the waiter to tell us they were out. \n\nSome time had passed and we were all out of water with no service. I asked another random waiter for water and our free bread basket that every cocos normally provides. He gave me a dirty look and went into the back. 25 mins later our waitress comes back and finally asks if we need anything. I asked for the bread basket and she rolled her eyes and explained that they didn't have any bread and started walking away. I had to raise my voice to ask again for at least the water refills. \n\nWhen we got our food, it tasted fine, at first, but it made all of our stomachs hurt after a few mins.\n\nIt was the worst service I've ever received at a Cocos! I didn't even tip and I am always a generous tipper. \n\nAlso, this terrible service was from the night shift staff.", "business_id": "SZvYxcvYYVRue9MXcEDjsA", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-03-04", "type": "review"}

As I was rolling on 16th, I saw the sign...now if you blink you miss it.   I usually look for the big purple Dulceria across the street first and slow down as I near.  It is located in a strip of buildings that have seen better days, pero yo no tengo miedo.  I have stopped in 3 times to date.  On my first visit I picked up un grande Agua de Pina (Pineapple \"water\") and a few Paletas, fresh fruit/fruit juice popsicles (coco, pina, sandia y limon).  While the selection and the quality is not as extensive as one of my favorite places in Albuquerque (on Central just south of Coors) .  I have to say it is close.  At least my Agua de Pina was fresh and not the hyper yellow processed stuff I get sometimes at Pro's Ranch Market.  On this visit there was also a lady inside selling fresh hot homemade tamales for $5 a half dozen.  *Score*!\n\nOn my second visit I went in for another batch of paletas, and this time I also left with 2 Aguas Medianas de Limon y otro de Pina.  MmMMM....I liked how the Limon was still quite tart and just sweet enough.  The Pina I put in the fridge for later.  I also decided to try a Raspado de Mango (Mango snow cone) to which I allowed the addition of a little Leche Condesada/Azucarada (Sweetened condensed milk).  Not as much mango flavor as I was expecting but refreshing and tasty with nice little pieces of fresh mango.  \nI need to go back to try the nieves/helados (ice cream), and  Escamochas (mixed fruit served with coconut and drizzled with sweet condensed milk or sometimes honey and sprinkled with granola or pecans, usually fixed up to taste) or the Pico de Gallo (in this case it is a plate/cup with a combo of any of the following like cucumber , watermelon, canalope, honeydew, pineapple, coconut chunks, mango, jicama sprinked with red chile and served with lime wedges).

The pizza is fresh and really tasty and only 9.99 for a whole pie, the soft-serve yogurt is a huge portion in a plastic cup for 1.49. The hotdogs are terrific. Everything else is good and cheap too. There are no problems with the food quality and price. It's the service. The service is indifferent and inconsistent. Somedays it's ok to order pizza to be picked up later for a party, and somedays it is not ok and the workers will claim that it is not a service and never has been. Liars. Fat liars. I actually typed lairs by accident which works too. I'm done with this review due to boredom. I just can't stand it when a great business carelessly regresses to the mean.

The organics that will spoil the second I bring it home... the tried and true pure produce that is bright and fragrant and in a good way! unlike some of the stuff that can be found in the more run down Food Citys in this town. \n\nI really like being inspired by food to make even better food. And quality really plays a huge role in inspirational food. So go, and press your nose up on the bakery's glass display case showcasing it's decident sweet goods and dont' shoplift any cheese!

About 2 pounds. Price: 25.00. When I lived in Oregon last year, I was able to get 4 pounds of corned beef (a very cheap cut and preparation of beef) for under $10.

They sell the exact same things as food city for 4x the price (same company owns fry's, food city, and AJ's) because they know that a tamale will be something the whitebread customers of AJ's will consider a delicacy unavailable outside of the Spanish Mass at their local catholic church, and worthy of more than $2 apiece.\n\nFurthermore, more whole and organic foods are sold at any one Sprouts, Trader Joe's, Fresh and Easy, and Whole Foods than any AJ's that ever existed.\n\nAvoid this place unless you're a yuppie with too much money and not enough sense, or unless you think one of the sommeliers is hot. 2 stars for the awesome beer selection.", "business_id": "Mng1FUcW-xRSdsDkowQm2Q", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-04-20", "type": "review"}

I self-diagnosed myself with either a brain tumor or an ear infection. I looked up the closest Take Care Clinic, and took a drive down to Central and Osborn.\n\nThe clinic is in the far back corner, near the pharmacy. When you get back there, you have to check in using one of three computers, it is fast and easy. Next, you need to pick up a clipboard and fill out your info, much like you would at a doctor's office. I did my part, and then went and waited. There is not much of a waiting area, it kind of blends into the pharmacy waiting area.\n\nAfter about an hour, the Nurse Practitioner, Tina, called me back. They have a private exam room, fully equipped, exactly like your doctor's office. Tina was VERY kind and warm, and took her time asking lots of questions. If you are unfamiliar with Nurse Practitioners, allow me to tell you how much they rock. To become a NP, you must have years of nursing experience, including critical care, ER, etc. After years of experience and education, then one may attend college to earn a NP masters degree. One of the best things about NPs is that they take a holistic approach to patient care. For example, I have a primary care physician, who really, really sucks. When I have an appointment, she LITERALLY brings in a digital timer set for five minutes- and then starts talking. It was amazing to see her press the timer button prior to asking why I was there.\n\nAt Take Care, the NP didn't just check my ears, she did a comprehensive exam, full vitals, etc. Luckily nothing else was going on with me, but I am confident that other issues would have been discovered by Tina.My diagnosis was correct, ear infection, not tumor- which was nice.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend this location, and Tina, as a health care provider. I am seriously going to just stick with that as my primary care, and skip the egg timer doctor who only likes to write scripts for things, not deal with the source of problems.\n\nSome people have noted that the area is sketchy, and with all due respect, that is silly. This is in a populated area, it is safe. Are there people of all walks there? Sure. Is it safe, absolutely. \n\nMy only recommendation would be that Take Care hire a medical tech to assist with checking people, helping turn around the exam room, etc. As a tip, it can get busy, so get there very early. They take tons of insurance, and my visit was only $15.", "business_id": "HfWkdqxegjiGEXzI8j7Wwg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-03-02", "type": "review"}

My co-workers and I heard about this place through a listing of 20 great American Sandwich shops and it apparently even had an Oprah mention. After seeing these glowing reviews here as well I was pretty much certain that I would be let down in some way, but its hard to even imagine the reason for the hype this place achieved.\n\nIt is an extremely tiny shop stuck at the end of the strip mall with central music. It's so tiny I've parked in front of it before and haven't even noticed it. The inside looks to have been renovated circa 1982 with faux wood paneling and shelving, and vintage boar's head advertisements that have been left to rot. The menu spread out across the entire wall on a confusing mix of chalk boards and computer print outs. The eating space is an extremely claustrophobic setup of folding tables and chairs stuck between the deli counter and the half-assed market shelves that sported international items that were mostly covered with a thick layer of dust.\n\nThe actual sandwiches, solid quality deli stuff using primarily boar's head meats and cheeses. That's it? Why would you fall in love with this place? I went with five other guys who ordered a mix of their signature sandwiches (Doughboy, Bizmark, Manhattan), and all agreed you can get a similar sandwich at grocery stores and preferred even the likes of Sack's to this place.

If you're not, well, it's rather ordinary as far as pub food goes.  Come for the beer!", "business_id": "3UMcsN9IjoeV8JZvC4apag", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-04-19", "type": "review"}

Their bagels are better and they have bialy's, too.\n\nIf you are going to chance this place, I have one suggestion for you.  DON'T go in near closing.  Likely as not, you will be told you exactly how many minutes you have before they close.  They are blatant about doing this especially if you aren't ready to tell them exactly what you want at that moment.  I guess the fact they are emptying the cases in front of your eyes is not clue enough they are closing.   \n\nAnother reason not to go there is not their fault.  They are off of 7th Street with the traffic lanes that change with the time of day.

Sure they had basic cookies and cakes, and some sweet breads, but Momma L and I were hard pressed to find a special birthday treat for her.  \n\nIt could be the curse of an afternoon visit that could be blamed for the lack of variety, but they did seem to have plenty of cookies left.

Assuming my time is worth *something* - there's no way I could produce cakes like this for as little money as Asahi charges.\nThis isn't the sort of bakery that specializes in cool, funky cakes and I didn't see any fondant (but they may do some...I don't like fondant, so I didn't go out of my way to check.) But for a fresh, delicious cake that will be custom made for you on little short notice for a super low price?

What store has a minimum nowadays???  \n\nThe customer service was also very lack luster.  The dogs of the store employees were jumping on me which I found a bit annoying. \n\nNeedless to say a store that I used to like, I will no longer be back.  There are so many other great dog stores...", "business_id": "-ev01HlCKf7CYsh8ZXG_7w", "stars": 1, "date": "2008-03-03", "type": "review"}

This really isn't that much of a deli. It's more of a Luby's meets Subway. I'm not using that as a put down, it's just the best way I can think of how to describe this place.\n\nSecond: The food isn't great, it's just pretty good. I'd been hearing people rave about this place and how it was a NY style deli. Chompie's is more NY than this place and the food is generally tastier there. I ordered a turkey sandwich on french bread with Swiss and cranberry sauce... It was okay and filled me up but it wasn't anything particularly memorable.\n\nThird: Miracle Mile dishes out pretty solid portions. It's not too much and it's not too little. To be honest, it's probably a little more toward too much... but in a good way.\n\nGo to Miracle Mile for a decent meal, just don't expect the Second Coming.", "business_id": "fmuj7u1gflmEjW-h0v9bwg", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-03-26", "type": "review"}

My only request was to take off the Kalamata olives. Of course, when the food was delivered, it was chock-full of olives. So not only did the pasta lack flavor to start with, but the small amount of flavor that I was able to detect was ruined by the olives. I'm not a complainer, and I hate sending food back, so I picked as many out as I could, but it wasn't really worth salvaging. I mostly just pushed the pasta around my plate, took a few bites, and pushed it aside, which is disappointing since it's a $13 bowl of pasta. \n\nWhen the bill finally arrived, it added up to just under $50 for two iced teas, one bowl of pasta and one cobb salad. I'm sorry, but that price is just absolutely exorbitant for the poor service and lack luster food. This visit was most definitely my last visit to the Cheesecake Factory. And if you happen to be looking for dinner at the Biltmore, I would suggest you stop ANYWHERE else.", "business_id": "2r8jGeuYvMkyP2ik_X-Bxw", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-03-24", "type": "review"}

So much deliciousness wrapped in wonton skins and then fried, with a yummy cilantro sauce. MMMM.  Their corn cakes are also good, but the sauces on them aren't veggie; just ask for salsa instead.\n\nI also love the brown bread they serve with all meals, even if you're just getting starters or cheesecake.

On NYE, we went here for Cheesecake, drinks and the free champagne toast; we had two almost identical servers who clearly didn't communicate, and the two of us wound up with four classes of bubbly instead of two.

It was either between this place and Red Devil and I wish we just would have went to Red Devil instead. They do not take reservations but we were pleasantly surprised to find that the wait was non-existent on this night and we were seated right away.\n\nThe waiter took our drink orders and my sister was the only one that didn't want lemon in her drink and he was kinda rude about that, something about making his job more difficult or something but whatever. The menu is huge and they have a Skinnylicious menu that features light menu items if you are watching your weight. \n\nPretty much anything that you could want is on the menu; italian, asian, american, etc. and let's not forget that cheesecake! The cheesecake is the one item where you cannot go wrong. OMG Red Velvet layer cheesecake is 7.95 a slice as they are all aptly priced but it is a huge slice enough for two people.  The mango passion tea is great as were their mixed drinks which are $9.25++\n\nI got the veggie burger which was okay, nothing groundbreaking in flavor or toppings, sauces etc. The fries were a bit disappointing and the food presentation was pretty disappointing and lackluster. My mom got a turkey burger that was incredibly greasy and she was not happy with it. She asked the waiter if he was sure if it was a turkey burger and he assured her it was but again, did not get her something else or offer to take it off of the bill. So somewhat disappointing considering this is Mother's Day and I wanted my mom to at least enjoy her meal.\n\nSummary: Food so-so-may change on a variable basis, Service-abyssmal, we never even got our water glasses refilled, another waitress stepped on my sister's foot but refused to move in a timely manner.

But if this wasn't there, I'd have to go all the way to Metrocenter so... I'll take it.\n\nThere are so many reviews about Trader Joe's in other locations, so by now you most likely know all about their amazing selection of \"Joe's\" brand merchandise - ranging from pasta sauce to liquid soap.  If there is a Joe's brand for something - get it.  It will always be good.  And while their produce section is smaller than some of the other stores, it's not my main reason for going there so I can pick something up if it looks good and it's a fun extra.  They used to have almost no meat selection, but it's gotten better after their recent expansion.  It's no AJ's, but they have some nice basic and pre-prepared options.\n\nWhile in general I could talk forever about other great things from Trader Joe's, sticking with just this location let me say that I've never had anything but outstanding service.  The check out is always fast and friendly.  They even recognized my big blue cooler bag for what it was and happily packed the groceries right into it vs. using a paper sack.  It's not just being a bit granola (not that there's anything wrong with that) but it also keeps the goodies cold on their 20 minute drive back to the house.  \n\nBut why can't there be one closer to my house?

It's seriously the reason I picked the Biltmore neighborhood two years ago when I moved from LA.  It made my move seamless.  I can honestly say that for the last 8 years I have been going to TJ's weekly (first in LA, and now in PHX), and perhaps a little sadly, I tend to buy the same things each and every week.  If TJ's closed, I would die. \n\nFood:\n-- TJ's hummus: all of them are awesome, even the white bean hummus\n-- TJ's whole wheat pita bread, and the mini pitas.  Just dip these guys in the hummus (see above)\n-- TJ's dolmas (stuffed grape leaves).  Don't buy the more expensive canned dolmas they have from Greece.  Trust me.  TJ's is in a jar, you get a few more dolmas in there and they are firmer and don't have that old canned taste.  I think the Greek ones have been sitting on a shelf somewhere for years.\n-- TJ's nuts, all of them.\n-- TJ's frozen fish and shrimp.  They have excellent sea food and it's all been extremely good in my experience.  Their raw peeled shrimp makes for an easy meal of your choice.  I like to saute with garlic, olive oil, and lemon juice.  \n-- TJ's Greek yogurt.  They have a \"brand\" name, but stick with TJ's.  I have tried them both and still think that the house brand rules\n\nHousehold Items:\n-- Dr. Bronner's magic soap!  This stuff is great and will make you smell good (if you don't already smell good)\n-- STAY AWAY FROM THEIR PAPER TOWELS.  In the last few years they seem to be carrying more household stuff, but their paper towels are worthless and actually smell kind of strange.  If you spill something and reach for a TJ's towel, the spill will get worse.  These towels repel all moisture.  Go to Target and get the real thing or use a washable dish rag.\n-- Desert Essence face wash.  For a bachelor, this stuff is great.  It's a simple face wash that does what it says and doesn't leave you smelling like an orchard\n\nDrinks:\n-- Their juices are all amazing, especially their unpasteurized orange juice, but it's not cheap.\n-- Water is essential but I am a filterer at home so just buy their sparkling mineral water.  It's the best deal in town.\n-- Beer: They have the large bottles of Chimay, Arrogant Bastard Ale, and the usual suspects of trendy breweries such as Stone, Stella, Guinness, and some of the Japanese brands.  These are great, but my recommendation is for the Simpler Times lager.  It's only $2.99 for a 6-pack!  That's 50 cents a beer.  At first I was afraid, I was petrified...but seriously, I even served this beer to a female guest the other night and she was totally impressed.  Pour it in a pint glass and Simpler Times will stack up to the best brews.\n-- Wine: You have to be careful with TJ's wine.  Yes, they have some cheap wines, but you will have a serious time trying to swallow some of them.  Stick to the above $6 bottles at a minimum, and if you want to be safe, aim for the $11 plus bottles.  Also remember that southern hemisphere wines can be a bit younger because of the grow season.  For Chilean wines and Argentinian wines my price rubric can be cut in half because these countries have such low labor costs that even their cheap wines seem to be palatable somehow.  Also, those Bota boxes are convenient, but I think they taste about as good as two-buck chuck.  Someone told me they are inconsistent so I might give it another try. \n\nOther Hints:\n--  If you take your own bag they will give you a raffle ticket and every week they draw a name for a $25 dollar gift certificate (don't hold me to that price, but it sounds right).  I've been playing this bag game for years at this TJ's and my prior TJ's and have never won.  It makes you realize that if you can't win a simple raffle at the local TJ's you probably shouldn't waste your money on lottery tickets where the odds are really against you.\n\nFlowers and Plants:\n-- I've purchased all manner of TJ's flowers and plants over the years and find that they aren't very durable.  The flowers seem to die much quicker than the flowers you buy at the local florist and the plants are hit or miss.  If you have to buy flowers in a rush, go for it, but if you need them to stay perky for more than an day, you might go elsewhere.\n\nThat's my two cents.", "business_id": "Sy-hmzSH1OmWpHmAfZtxRA", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-05-03", "type": "review"}

If you want to buy even basic bread you're out of luck, there's nothing basic and straightforward in taste, only in name. Here's my summary:\n\nTJs yoghurt - bad, it just tastes sour with no redeeming features.\nTJs Pizza's - while I wouldn't kick em out of bed if they farted, they certainly won't be invited back for dinner.  (but I do reckon that the 4 pack of frozen naan is awesome)\nTJs Sauces - Take away the label and put it to a blind tasted test - you won't be amazed.\nTJ's curry sauces - frozen ones are sometimes made in india and taste good, the jars of simmer sauces feel \"hollow\" on flavor. that's they only way I can describe it.\nTJ Cakes - frozen cakes don't seem nearly as good since I found a few local french bakeries.\nCereals - okay, a redeeming feature, nothing wrong here.\nCheese - limited selection, expensive, upper middle of the road.\nTJs Beer - some like the simpler times beer - personally I'll upgrade to malt liquor from Circle K given the choice.\nTJs Munchies (tortillas, etc) - yep, they're  tasty, the longboard style chips are really good for maximizing the nacho cheese load when dipping.\nTJs Wine - 2 buck chuck has been know to cause systemic yeast infection (why argue? you know I'm right...) Spend your cheap-ass money elsewhere or you'll end up spending more than you save on monistat and live yoghurt.  The rest of the wine selection is not a problem\nTJs coffee - some family members like it, but personally I'd rather  go to McDonalds. (That hardly makes me a coffee snob does it?) I just don't like the flavors, at all.\nTJ Frozen Vegetable and Frozen Fruit - perfect! The frozen mango and petit pois are the main reason I keep coming back.\nTJs Staff -  Those guys rock! They're helpful, knowledgeable and always give my 3 year old a ballon and a toddler sized shopping cart. What more could you ask for?\n\nOverall - specific items of TJ's own brands are a strong hit or a strong miss. You may like some, but you won't like all. It's not a reason to stay away if you get a few duds in your basket, especially since they take back items with no questions asked. If you have a bad experience then don't be a hater, just be more discriminating next time when you make your grocery list.", "business_id": "Sy-hmzSH1OmWpHmAfZtxRA", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-03-05", "type": "review"}

Honestly, of all the grocery stores big and small here in the Valley, Trader Joes is probably my least favorite.  Over the years, I've tried to like them..trust me, I've TRIED. I just can't get into the Trader Joe's scene.\n\nIt's not one particular thing that turns me off about Trader Joe's, but maybe its a variety of small things that irk me. For starters, I find thier food selection odd.  Mostly prepackaged stuff, with no deli, meat counter,  and very little name brand stuff.  I know I know, I don't need to buy every single thing name brand, but there are some things name brand that I prefer over others.  Plus, when I buy lunch meat, I want to go to a Deli Counter and get it, which they do not have.  Just prepackaged meats n cheeses.\n\nI tend to buy mostly sandwiches here during lunch hour.  Their fair priced, and right there.  The first few times I went here, I was getting a Tuna Sandwich on whitebread.  I liked it, and started buying it on a regular basis.  Then, they stopped making it.  Why?  I dunno, but I haven't seen it in like 3 weeks.  Just when I start liking something, it vanishes.  Now all they have are tuna wraps, but they arent as good as the sandwiches.\n\nAs for grocery shopping on a weekly basis, I will probably never be a regular here.

This lady is never friendly, but yesterday was over-the-top nasty.    \n\nI asked for an iced tea and wanted to add \"light ice\".    She turned her back on me before I could finish my sentence.    When I called after her to finish the order her response was:\n\n\"I don't care.\"\n\nAnd after that, it got really ugly.     Among her other \"gems\" was the utterance that she has been making coffee etc for 7 years and I have no right to question her.     Hello!

It's actually $3.00, an extra 25 cents for running it on my card, which she tells me AS SHE SWIPES MY CARD. I had cash on me.

Hey that sounds good. The woman behind the counter, who was very nice, realized that we were newbies so she explained how things worked. Basically you can get any flavor you want in any drink you want. So I settled on a peppermint Italian Soda. The prices I noticed were very cheap for a coffee place. I was expecting smaller sizes for that price but no I ordered a medium and it was pretty big. Much bigger than I expected. Plus with 10% off for checking in it was great.\nOnce I placed my order my drink was made very quickly and with a great attitude. It tasted great. Cool and refreshing and it hit the spot.\nAfter looking over the other reviews I wonder if I went to the same place because I had a great experience and would go back again if I was ever in that neighborhood.

It started off innocent enough.  I would browse every now and again and marvel at the array of products.  Back then, I would never really buy anything, but I would promise myself that I could have whatever I wanted once I renovated my kitchen.  It took me a long time to achieve that goal, but eventually I did.  Then the flirtation blossomed into my first purchase.  My torrid affair with Williams-Sonoma has been raging for a couple of years now.\n\nIn Phoenix, the Biltmore Fashion Park store is my favorite Williams-Sonoma location.  The one at the Fashion Square is okay, but it feels cramped.  I travel for business and I seek out Williams-Sonoma stores on the road.  The one in Oak Brook (suburban Chicago) is nice.  The store in Walnut Creek, CA is also nice.  The new flagship in Union Square in San Francisco is like Williams-Sonoma Mecca!  It's four floors of everything Williams-Sonoma carries as well as artifacts from Chuck Williams' own kitchen.  It's like a Williams-Sonoma museum combined with the entire product line.  As a side note, the original Williams-Sonoma store that was on the square in Sonoma has been closed.  The Union Square store replaced it.\n\nWilliams-Sonoma is the best!  The products are all of the finest quality and they stand by everything they sell.  If you ever have a problem, they will take the item back with no questions asked and give you store credit if you don't have your receipt.    \nI've bought everything at Williams-Sonoma from my Le Creuset Doufeu to Fleur de Sel French sea salt.  If you love to cook, this is the place for you.  If you bake or cook a lot, be sure to check out their All-Clad Stainless Steel Measuring Cups & Spoons.

For standard measures, they offer sets of both four cups and spoons: 1/4, 1/3, 1/2 and 1 cup; 1/4 tsp, 1/2 tsp, 1 tsp and 1 Tbs.  The really handy items are the odd-size sets.  They offer sets of both cups and spoons in the following odd sizes: 2/3 cup, 3/4 cup and 1 1/2 cups; 2 tsp, 1 1/2 Tbs and 2 Tbs.  All the spoons stack together into a cute space-saving group.  All four sets of measures make an awesome gift!\n\nDon't overlook their website.  Sometimes they will have Special Offers for products online that can be upwards of 50% off of the same items in the stores.  This drives the BF a bit crazy because he thinks their pricing should be consistent across all retail channels, but I'm willing to check their website frequently as I have found a number of bargains online.", "business_id": "31bXixwy2GNmRlhpl21reA", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-05-28", "type": "review"}

It was pretty good. \n\nBut later on, when I gave them to my husband we tried the carrot cake cupcake first. OMG!! Seriously, I think it was the BEST carrot cake concoction I have ever had.

Perfect... the cake was still so moist inside. Loved the frosting. \n\nRed Velvet -- my husband prefaced w/ he knew that I must've gotten that one for myself since he's not a huge fan; but... when he tried it, he said it's the first Red Velvet that he's liked.

I had been familiar with Barbs from cakes that had been ordered for birthdays at a previous company, and from the Petit Fours I'd pick up on days when I needed an extra special treat. \n\nOur venue had originally sent us to Honeymoon Sweets in Tempe, which we had a terrible experience at.  Our ideas were shut down at every turn as \"out of our budget\" or \"not possible\" and we left Honeymoon Sweets feeling deflated and like we'd have to compromise on our cake.   Not happy with the experience, we reached out to our venue to ask about other options.  We were asked what bakery we would like to use, and Barbs Bakery immediately came to mind.\n\nWe scheduled a tasting with Barbs and from the moment we were welcomed into the little shop, what a difference!  We had a great experience!  They prepared four different flavor combinations for us which we had requested, and sat down with a partnership mentality to work with us to design a cake that came within our budget, incorporated our ideas, and made us feel like we would get the cake of our dreams.  Instead of hearing \"no\" or \"that won't work\" from the owner David, we heard, \"that's a great idea!  Here's how we can make that work . . .\"\n\nWe absolutely LOVED the cake that was delivered to our venue, and we received rave reviews from guests.

It was a gift from a friend. It was my first experience with Barbs Bakery. I fell in love! \n\nEver since then If I do not make my own cake or cupcakes I would go to Barbs. Baby Showers, Birthdays or just because moments. It's great cake with pretty good design capabilities for fair pricing. \n\nThe last thing I got from them was for my husband 30 birthday. It was a cake shaped like a hot dog. It was amazing. I think I paid $75. Totally fair. \n\nFor my Mom's 50th birthday I was throwing a huge event. I called for a quote on cupcakes for it. I was floored at the price. I just ended up making my own and getting rave reviews. I made Pink Champagne and Vanilla Bean Coconut.\n\n Not my favorite thing to do when planning a party but I will do it to save a couple hundred dollars. \n\nThen came my daughters 16th birthday and I called for a quote on a cake. I can't remember what they said but it was just hands down ridiculous. So I again just made cupcakes. \n\nFast forward to my Daughters graduation. I find a picture of a cake that I feel is fairly simple. It's 2 tier. Ombre ruffle cake. I said I wanted butter cream not fondant. Which they even said was easier but the price would be the same. ??? Ok then.  \n\nI then said I was flexible on the design once they said how hard that was to do. I said I just care about the color and it being ombre. I said, rosettes whatever I just need to stay in my budget of $150. \n\nShe had quoted me $115 for just the bottom tier and said she would get back to me with the total price and would also try to work something out since I had been a customer for so long. \n\nWhen I went in to order the cake, the cases were pretty much empty. They had some order and wouldn't have the cases filled until Thursday. It was Tuesday. I continued to get red flags. So I couldn't try any cake I wanted. \n\nI want to say the girl working was AMAZING. She was so nice, understanding and even let me have 3 cupcakes to try since I waited so long for help. It's all they had left. \n\nSo they called me back with a final quote of $389. Yep, I said that. $389. Whaaaat?!?! \n\nHow did it go from $115 for the larger bottom tier to $389? I mean even if you doubled that price it wouldn't be that much and the top tier is much smaller. \n\nI was confused and disappointed to say the least. I was so mad that I had waisted time with them, traveling all the way there, waiting in line and going over everything and waisting ink to give them the photo.\n\nIn my opinion if that cake is too hard for your baker to do, you should get a better artist or improve upon your skill set. I don't want to hear cost of labor when ordering a cake. \n\nI didn't even bother working with them as I could tell they didn't want or couldn't do the cake. Why else would they change the price to such a crazy amount.\n\nIt's sad that my favorite cake place has fallen off my list of go to places. I live in the north valley and I have to pass a lot of places to get to 20th st and Thomas. \n\nI won't be doing that any longer and my friends who I have turned onto Barbs won't either. I will personally make their cakes for free before I ever tell another friend to go there.\n\nI think they have gotten a little too big for their britches. The more I thought about it I started to think of who helped Barbs build roots in Phoenix and grow into a well knows establishment. It wasn't people with large pockets. It was lower middle class to low income families who lived in the area. I can't see how those same people could possibly afford to continue to buy cakes to celebrate family events. It's sad. \n\nI gave them 3 stars because they do make some good pastries and the cake is pretty good. My pink champagne is better and they don't have coconut.\n\n As far as decorating goes, they are not even close to $389 good. \n\nI ended up getting my daughters cake, exactly perfect with a slight variation to the decor. Rosettes. It was beautiful and the centerpiece of the party. Everyone was in awe of it and I didn't get it from Barbs. I got it from a bakery a few miles away. \n\n I also paid $150. Right in my budget. The new bakery will get plenty of new business with the amount of people who were in love with the cake. I can't see how they won't. \n\nAnyway, Barbs is good to pop in for a cupcake or a doughnut but that's about it. \n\nIf you want cupcakes or a cake, message me, I will make you the best tasting cake you have ever had and it will not require you to pick your jaw up off the floor when I tell you the price. \n\n;)", "business_id": "vv1uvJRBUqi707TA5GuhCg", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-05-31", "type": "review"}

My husband and I met with a representative and we chose the Champagne (Barb's signature cake) and the custard filling with white buttercream frosting and fondant border ribbon. The cake had a scroll design with candied pearls.  Beautiful.  They offered several sizes and styles but we got the perfect size for our champagne reception. We expressly told them we did not want anything on the cake that was not edible.  That request was fulfilled.  Everyone raved about the texture, moistness, flavor, and look of the cake. They matched the fondant ribbon to our invitations perfectly.  It was not overly sweet which was a concern for us. Actually the cake was perfect.  Barb's Bakery has been in the valley for many years.   I have recommended them to many of our friends.  Not just to drive by and get doughnuts but now that we have the right to be legally married in Arizona, Barb's bakery made my husband and I feel comfortable and welcome.  They provided the service they promised and advertise to offer.  No Hassles.\nIf you want cake, go to Barb's.   It helped we had a plan, We brought our iPad with photos of our clothing we chose, we had images of the simple theme we were intending, we brought a spare invitation to provide them, the number of guests, and the consultant took very thorough notes. \nThank you Barb's Bakery you made our cake and Champagne reception perfect!", "business_id": "vv1uvJRBUqi707TA5GuhCg", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-04-01", "type": "review"}

I almost don't want to share this, because it will eventually mean long lines for me.\n\nThis is a corner store (appropriately on the corner) of 56th Street and Indian School.  It at some time was probably a 7-11 or Circle K.  But they have THE BEST sandwiches in town.  When you walk in, it's a little sketchy.  So don't say you haven't been warned.  It is a convenience store and in a corner of the store they also happen to make sandwiches.  \n\nIf you aren't scared away, then you are in luck, because this corner of the store is where all the magic happens.  You ask the Asian guy at the counter for a slip and you write down your sandwich order.  He then hands it to the Asian guy in the corner who will then make your sandwich.  \n\nThey use Boar's Head meats and aren't stingy with it!  I had a roast beef sandwich that had at least 2 inches of meat on it...and with all the toppings, my sandwich was only $6!  \n\nPlus, since it's a grocery store/gas station type place, you can grab some chips, nuts, drinks, beer, wine...whatever you need to go with your sammie.  I passed on the beer/wine since I was headed back to work to eat my sandwich at my desk. I recommend that you too get your sandwich and sides \"to go\"...since it's a corner store, there is no where to \"sit and eat\" unless you like eating in your car...and I have a really weird aversion to people who eat in their cars.  OR...you can dine in the AZ summer heat at a picnic table that is in the parking lot.  But, the table was taken today by a truck full of construction workers who obviously also learned about this wonderful sandwich shop.\n\nAnyway, if you work or live in the area, you need to give this place a try...it is truly one of the best sandwiches I've had in at least a year or two.

They also have a great selection of beverages and beers to compliment your sandwich selection.

My toppings included black olives, mushrooms and artichokes.  My boyfriend enjoyed the baked ziti. \n\nWe have been driving past this place forever and always want to stop in. Last night when we were decided what to do for dinner I said, let's have pizza and let's look on Yelp for a recommendation.  We decided that Slice of Sicily would be our choice based on closeness to our apartment and the good reviews it received.    \n\nWe drive up and get a spot right in front!  Hooray for good luck!  There were only two people eating inside so we picked out a table and took a seat.  The tables were all red and white checkered and the walls full of Italian maps and posters.  The west wall was an interesting mural of an Italian landscape with bare trees and sunflowers.  The decor reminded me of how much I missed Italy. \n\nWe took a look at the menu, ordered and looked on the huge map of Italy next to us.  I asked Gary if he knew where I was born... he knew it was up north.  So I showed him, I also showed him the placed I lived in Italy and the place we are going to retire too.  He always laughs when I say that.  He doesn't know how serious I am!\n\nOur waitress was nice and between her and the owner we got everything we needed.  The owner's family is from Sicily, but her mother was born in the states.  \n\nOur food was fantastic.  I no longer need to drive all the way to NYPD for New York Style Pizza, I can drive up the street to Slice of Sicily.\n\nThere was a nice steady stream of people in and out of the restaurant.  They do many to go orders.  They had many regulars.  We will definitely be regulars. \n\nI would have given this place 5 stars but when we ordered two canolli's they went back to grab them and came out empty  handed.  They unfortunately were out of canolli batter.  We were a little disappointed but said we'd be back for more pizza and canolli another time.\n\nI definitely recommend this restaurant if you like family owned pizza places and great New York style pizza. \n\nI hope this review is beyond satisfactory to those who take this site way way way too seriously.

At any fast(ish) food restaurant, there is always an expectation of some mistakes being made on your food. But when those mistakes are continually made and cost you extra money...you start getting fed up.\n\nI've had certain staff members screw up my order every time they make it. This is very frustrating, especially when you order cream-cheese (at something like $1.50 extra..which is kinda ridiculous in the first place) and you don't get it with your food, it's infuriating. When you often get your food to go, you don't realize until you reach your destination and it is too late by then. You always have to check your order after leaving Taco Bell, but I thought Einsteins was a little higher than that - apparently not this one.\n\nHowever, there is one shining star - Cathrin.

I truly believe they are one of the best treats one can have.\n\nWhen I travel (which is often), I find myself compelled to look for the best cupcake that city has to offer. After scouring Yelp!, I found Tammie Coe. It looked promising, but I found it odd that two locations so relatively close to one another differed in ratings and reviews as drastically as they did. So, I decided it was my civic (and culinary) duty to try cupcakes at both.\n\nThis location has Red Velvet, Ooey Gooey and Coconut available.  I opted against trying the latter because I'm just not a coconut fan.\n\nOoey Gooey -- One thing I enjoy about this cupcake is how jovial it is.  It is pure joy in small cake form.  They come covered in sugar crystals -- in a variety of colors!  This cupcake looked better than it tasted, sadly.  Now, it was good.  But it wasn't amazing.  The chocolate cake was a bit dry and the icing was somewhat pedestrian.  Perhaps I've become too much of a cupcake snob, but I sincerely cannot tell a lie -- when it comes to cupcakes!  Truth be told, I feel this cupcake suffered from being a tad too old -- and kept it far too cold of an environment.\n\nRed Velvet -- This is the cupcake I use as my way to judge all bakers.  This cupcake is a classic.  Now, Tammie puts a spin on this classic that is extremely unique.  Their red velvet is not made with traditional southern chocolate.  It seems they use a vanilla based cake for their red velvet.  While I'm not sure that constitutes this cupcake to be called a red velvet any longer, I will say -- WHO CARES!  Their red velvet in a sweet, vanilla cake with a vanilla cream cheese frosting that is coated in red sugar crystals.  It was moist, flavorful, not overly sweet.  It is a very fine cupcake. Not the best I've had -- but it is up there and deserves praise.\n\nOne thing I'd like to point out is that unless you order ahead, you need to buy your cupcakes at La Grange Orange Grocery (or LGO as the locals call it).  The service there was wonderful.  They even let me pick whatever color ooey gooey I wanted.  That being said, when we walked into Tammie Coe (not knowing we had to buy from LGO), we were treated fairly -- cold.  The woman in the bakery looked at us as though we didn't get the memo.  She spoke to us with great disdain and sent us packing.  It really put me off -- but, I try to just judge the food.  And since you don't need to deal with that bakery to eat their cupcakes, I'll just thank my lucky stars!", "business_id": "bsEJKduEgoBhNNNHO4ZHEw", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-03-25", "type": "review"}

I was apprehensive at the long line of automobiles in front, and anticipated a long line for to order my lunch, along with a long wait to eat.  I was surprised at every turn.  The grocery  store was interesting with some offerings from local artists presented in a humorous fashion, a little wine store with really pretty wine bottles and no price tags.  I perused the menu, placed my order with a friendly cashier who explained the process,  was seated at a small table  and eating in around 10 minutes.  \n\nThe menu offers vegetarian, vegan and gluten free food.  I ordered the Guacamole BLT.  The sandwich was served with a pineapple slice and sliced pickles.  The guacamole raised an otherwise run of the mill BLT to a new level.  I think I'll try the Venice Beach Burrito on my next visit.

There's tables both inside and out, and you can peruse the store while your stomach rumbles!\n\n\nThe only thing I've ever been disappointed by is the sangria, but then again I'm not a huge fan of white sangria.  I will not be ordering it again but I have girlfriends that love it.\n\nI had never been here for lunch until this past weekend--it was always my late morning brunch spot.  Technically, I believe its a pizza place, but I've never had a pizza.  Although, they look quite good!  I ordered their tuna sandwich this past weekend, which came with a side of fruit and pickles.  The bread was thin and grilled panini style, and the tuna salad definitely did not disappoint!", "business_id": "R8VwdLyvsp9iybNqRvm94g", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-05-18", "type": "review"}

I've been to LGO for every conceivable meal of the day as they're in my neighborhood ... and somehow I've failed in my writing of The Review.\n\nI'm a terrible person.\n\nThe first time I knew I had a problem involved overnight guests. Somehow they assumed I'd be churning out pancakes and percolating coffee early in the morning. HECK NO. I pushed my friends down the stairs (pfft! to their protests) and off we went. Once they had coffee in their hands and were ready to contemplate making a breakfast order, things were good. \n\nSure, I could have turned on the Martha Stewart charm. But why bother? I have LGO in my neck of the woods. Anyhoo, here's a tip, which is going to kill me to share. There's no need to wait in that monster line in the middle of the store to place a food order. It's true. You can place a food order at *any* cash register. \n\nI just died a little. Everyone that knew that secret now hates me. (So yes! Head on over to the coffee area and place your food order.)\n\nWhelp! An update as I've been prompted. Yes, there are two distinct sides to this operation. The \"Grocery\" (right side) where you queue up for breakfast and lunch. The \"Pizzeria\" (left side) where there is everything else. But I don't see a distinct separation. So my review below is of my top faves. Yes, you have to order the items below on the left side. But you can eat them any where you'd like! When you order breakfast/lunch you usually end up meandering over to the left anyhoo, so there ya' go!\n\nFOOD\nI'm already a notoriously long writer. So I'm just cherry picking two favorite food items. The roasted chicken and the smoked salmon salad.\n\nPor quoi?\nWell, I had never eaten a roasted chicken quite like the the one prepared at LGO. My supermarket special, which I thought the high heavens of, opening the bag and sighing as I absorbed the heavenly, delightful, smell? That was nothing. LGO's version is an experience. The chicken sighs as it falls off the bone, the skin greeting me with a light crispiness.  If I could recommend anything to pair with this, it would be the caprese salad.\n\nWait? Did I say salad? I found Phoenix's best salad *ever*. The smoked salmon salad was so delightful my dining companion can't wait to order it his next visit. A manly man. Imagine that. A salad that a guy is gung ho on ;) All kidding aside, this salad was filling, fresh and offered a diversity of textures. All while being healthy. Sometimes salads can be...too rich. There was no \"to go\" box. I ate every crumb to my leggings capacity. \n\nDESSERTS\nI stop in here often for cupcakes and their miniature versions when I have a need to impress. Yes, I cheat that way. (Don't tell my Mom!) A box of their artistic works not only look delightful, they taste delicious. Their chocolate chip cookies with sea salt are ginormous. (And dangerous!)\n\nDESIGN STYLE\nThe first time I visited I was awestruck by the novelty of the store in restaurant concept. (I'll update my review to show Instagram photos from here.) It's just the coolest place filled with the neatest things. If you need a gift to to buy, I'm sure you can find it here. They stock books, cards, t-shirts, mugs, candles, purses, you name it. I bet their buyer has thought of it. (They even have a special section for children's gifts.) \n\nWINE/BEER \nOn the Grocery side (right side) of the store where the shopping is there is wine and beer you can buy. Had I not been with a regular I would have missed the obvious. Buy your beverage, meander to your table, drink it. (No fee!) Glassware is in the middle of the restaurant.\n\nPARKING & MISC\nSo yes, this restaurant is popular. Parking can be tight. (But there's now additional parking on 40th & Meadowbrook.) They are bike friendly too! If you have called an order in, don't fret. They have short term parking. Noted clearly with signs and diagonals on the pavement.\n\nClearly, I {heart} this place :)", "business_id": "R8VwdLyvsp9iybNqRvm94g", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-03-13", "type": "review"}

Whether you're hosting friends, you're looking for dinner for one, dinner for two, or just stocking up on goods, you're covered here. \n\nRacks of wine and champagne can be found along a few walls. On other walls and display shelves you can find great gifts or home wares, plus books, greeting cards, kid's toys, candy, and of course food!\n\nThere's a chilled fridge with pre-packaged foods like sandwiches and salads, there are cheese selections, pickled foods, and if you want something made to order they do that too. It's literally a godsend for anyone on the go for any meal, or just about any errand that involves impressing friends, coworkers or family.

I was skeptical at first because I am not a fan of boxed/store bought almond milk. Never fear, they make theirs in house. They use dates and coconut oil to flavor this milk.

There are some small tables in the grocery store portion as well as plenty of tables in the restaurant portion.

I stopped by on a weekend afternoon and had a difficult time locating parking; being naive of the place, I didn't realize additional parking was available about 2 blocks away, as well as behind La Grande; between La Grande and Postino's. This is currently my favorite place to eat. It's a grocery store and a Pizzeria next door. At first it seems compact when walking in through the grocery store. They definitely utilize every inch of space they can muster up to display their goods. The food offerings are wide and are displayed above the counter/employee area from one end of the store to almost the other. The selection appears to be a mixture of French and Italian. I've been a regular for about 2 months now (as of the writing of this review) and frequent at least once each weekend; sometimes twice. \n\nThere's so much to choose from and I've just barely scratched the surface. I've definitely picked out some favorites that I'm having difficulty swaying away from; thus, preventing me from trying something new. I totally love the Coconut Samoan Latte. The small & large are apparently the same volume, which confused me when I ordered the large and my companion ordered the small; the difference between the two is that the large has an extra shot of espresso. I also love the Fresh Fish Club Sandwich, which comes with a side. I've had it with fries and with a mix of vegetables, which appeared steamed. I'm not sure what La Grande called the veggies or if it's a regular side offering (it had a really long name). They have muffins made in the original French-style that I highly recommend. It comes in a bag of 6 for $9. You also need to go for the Avocado Pizza with Prosciutto. The prosciutto is an extra $3, but is so worth it. I had Easter Sunday breakfast here and had a muffin sandwich with eggs, sausage, and cheese. It sounds simple, but tasted soooooo good. I think the butter made it taste so good. And desert....DON'T FORGET DESERT!!! I love the peanut butter pie.\n\nRemember, this is a grocery so there are a number of other items to look through, which makes visiting all the more fun. There's a refrigerated area with all kinds of beer and non-alcoholic beverages. There's also an area with ready-made foods packed in plastic to-go boxes. A coffee bar is located towards the left as you come in. A grill is located outside. I'm not sure when the grill is used. I think it's used in the mornings. There are also a wide selection of wines. Further into it, there are a large number of non-food items such as shirts, scented candles, specialty soaps, books, etc. \n\nThe place has high traffic and as aforementioned uses all it's space, but there's plenty of room to sit both inside and outside. I love how wooden picnic tables are offered in the north of the grocery store. The neighboring La Grande Orange Pizzeria also offers plenty of seating for patrons of the Grocery Store. Outside seating is also located at the front of the store.\n\nThis place is definitely not boring and I tried to cover as much of what I've noticed and experienced so far. I highly recommend visiting if you haven't already, as you'll probably get hooked too. This corner of 40th St & Campbell (or at least I think it's Campbell) has much to offer to the food-lover with Ingo's to the north and Postino's to the west.

It's a bit overwhelming on your first visit, trying to figure out where to go for what, and it gets a bit crowded and hectic. I sort of just picked a line and lucked upon the right one. \n\nI got the Spicy Chickpea Lettuce Wraps, which you can order from the menu or pick up from their grab-and-go cold case, which is what I did. (Cuts down on wait time.)  Comes with 2 large iceberg lettuce cuffs, topped with their spicy chickpeas and avocado slices. These lettuce wraps are SO yummy and perfectly spicy.  Mine came with a fresh pineapple wedge; perfect for cleansing the palate. A nice, light, healthy, and filling option.  \n\nThere was a large dessert case, but there was only 1 vegan option: an apple pie cookie.  I started to pass (I had my heart set on a cupcake), but an employee convinced me to try one.  Great suggestion! It was one of the most delicious cookies that I have ever tasted. It was perfectly soft and chewy. An amazing treat!\n\nThe items in the grab-n-go section are labeled with the ingredients.\n\nThe parking situation is pretty insane.  They do offer complimentary valet parking (which I did not want to do), and there is another spill-over lot about a block north of the building.  I chose the later and walked back to the cafe.\n\ni didn't check out their groceries, pizzeria, or gelato bar, so I cannot comment on that. However, per their menu, most pizzas can be made vegan. \n\nI would certainly return to see what other vegan desserts they have, and to get more of those yummilicious vegan apple pie cookies.", "business_id": "R8VwdLyvsp9iybNqRvm94g", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-05-20", "type": "review"}

Seriously this happens all the time, something I like and buy regularly just disappears never to be sold again. Sure I can get it from Safeway or someplace else BUT NOT HERE! Why do I have to have a card to buy things that are on sale? The people who work in the meat department do not seem to know what products they sell and where they are. I once asked about the location of an on sale item and was told they were all out. I walked just a few feet away from the guy and there was a whole pile of it right there. This happens a lot.\n\nI am also tired of the strange sales like:\n10 items for $10\n10 items for $10 but you have to buy 10.\nSoda priced 4 for $5 ea, but you have to buy 4. I DON\"T WANT 4 cases of soda.\nWhy can you not buy a six pack of soda anymore?\nWhy is almost all the 1/2 gallon ice cream no longer a 1/2 gallon?\nMeat prices that are very high one day and then the next day that item will be the same price but listed as \"on sale\".\nWhy is a half gallon of milk priced higher per unit than a gallon of milk? The price of a half gallon of milk should be HALF the price of a gallon of milk.\nBuy one get on 50% off but the prices is way higher than normal.\nand just weird pricing in general.\n\nWho are you trying to fool?\n\nstrange baggers, not enough baggers, and surly or overly talkative checkout people.

Blue Saguaro is definitely a \"workers\" place - they are not open evenings and weekends and thus have no real neighborhood hangout crowd, but the atmosphere duplicates the neighborly feel admirably. Bright Mexican style painted walls take the edge off the otherwise generic mini-mall interior. A dozen or so 2 to 4 person tables are located inside and some plastic seating outside is usually ample enough to avoid waiting for a seat. \n\nThe menu is somewhat extensive for a small place like this but nothing fancy - sandwiches and a few salads; but there are some nice selections - turkey avocado, roast beef with horseradish, and a good veggies one too. And PB&J. haven't tried that yet - maybe next week. No grilled sandwiches. They have a selection of several bagged chips, and side orders of pasta or potato salad. Fountain drinks, bottled juices and waters, and Italian sodas with or without cream. Unfortunately the dessert selection is limited to a few sad-looking plastic-wrapped cookies and cake slices. They close at 2 or 3 PM - can't remember which. \n\nMornings they open at 6:00 and the coffee is almost always hot and ready. They do an assortment of coffee drinks. Breakfast fare includes bagels, bagel/egg sandwiches, and eggs with toast, although I've never had the eggs other than in the bagel sandwich. \n\nOverall I don't recommend making a special trip to seek out Blue Saguaro, but if you are in the 16th St. and Northern area and looking for a quick and tasty breakfast or lunch in a low key non-chain spot, you'll probably enjoy it.", "business_id": "3rJE7qliy8_ylKhY5FdlIw", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-05-01", "type": "review"}

Who knew you could hear amazing blues music for free -- in Sunnyslope of all places -- on the 2nd Saturday of each month!? I did, actually. The real question is why don't I go every month!?\n\nSo, now I'm hopped up on a dirty chai latte and I must share the details about this neighborhood gem. Truly, the Valley's BEST neighborhood coffee shop! For a number of reasons...\n\n1.) Grinders is a place where everyone feels welcome from high school kids to retirees taking advantage of the free wi-fi.\n\n2.) They roast their OWN beans. That's right. They wheel a roaster out onto the same concrete slab that becomes the stage for Valley blues legends like Ronnie Whitehead on 2nd Saturdays and roast the beans for themselves!! I find their coffees to be pretty earthy and smooth. \n\n3.) The fudgy pecan brownies are rich and chocolaty. The scones are biscuit-like and just the right amount of barely sweet. (I haven't tried the danish, but they look deadly!)\n\n4.) They are generous in sharing their own talents and promoting the talents of others, ensuring access to arts and culture. Each month, they allow a different local artist to show their work on the coffee shop walls. And while ordinarily they are not open past 6 p.m. on Saturday, an exception is made on the 2nd Saturday of each month when you can sit outside and listen to  live jazz and/or blues from 8 - 10 p.m.  And, by the way, Dennis, the owner, is a bad ass on the harmonica! \n\nWe really are so lucky to have such a great business, doing great things, in the community!", "business_id": "4eFIVmbeCvJGCrhzmd-VYA", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-03-14", "type": "review"}

It's about time I wrote a review, since I'm a regular. I can be found sitting on one of the giant chairs surfing on the wi-fi many mornings.\n\nI'm the one who brought the plants in. I used to water them a couple times a week but nowadays I'm lazy and they really need to be repotted. I should get on that ...\n\nThe music is always playing and everyone knows my regular drink ... they've continued to memorize it for me even as I started to slowly decrease the fat & calories of my regular order. Now it's an ice skim latte with sugar free vanilla. I used to get an Everything bagel with egg, cheese and potatoes most mornings. Now I get it on multigrain toast. Eh, it's the little things.\n\nThe coffee at Grinders is really really good. It's not bitter and sharp, it's smooth. They grind their beans outside many mornings per week. Sometimes it gets too warm inside during the winter so we prop the doors open, but if the grinder is going outside, it'll blow coffee bean fumes in the door.\n\nThere's some retired motorcycle cops who meet up every morning and sit around the big round table. They often park their motorcycles in front of the place together. They call themselves the Geezerados.\n\nThere's sometimes a few right-wingers having conversations mid-day. One time I listened to their meeting and heard them trying to come up with controversial topics to get people to come to church. They spent a long time trying to figure out who could get them proof that global warming isn't happening, so they could use that as their hook.\n\nA lot of moms come in with their kids. Seeing siblings piled up in one of the oversized chairs together is common. There are a few regulars who come in specifically to sit on the internet all day. I'm not there all day, but I'm there at all times of the day because I have a home office, and you never know when you suddenly need caffeine.\n\nEarly in the morning and after 3pm the place becomes flooded with Sunnyslope High School kids. They range from ROTC kids wearing pickle suits to trendy girls in neon to the alternative crowd. They often lay around the couch splayed across each other or gazing into each others' eyes. \n\nOrdinarily I'm a real talker and I can't usually keep my mouth shut, but Grinders is the one place that I go where I barely make a peep. I just eavesdrop on everyone's conversations and sometimes run into friends I know. I usually go before my brain is fully awake in the morning, that's part of it. For the record, a couple months ago one of the girls there said I was practically invisible and she hardly knew I was there, because I was so quiet.\n\nThere's nothing pretentious about Grinders at all, and it's also down to earth without being ghetto. It has character. Some months the art is better than other months. Hannah has been there for years (they call her Big Hannah now, only because there's another girl named Hannah who is tiny and they call her Little Hannah) and Hannah rocks and makes the best breakfast ever. \n\nI can ride my bike in the morning and be wearing my pajamas and not have anyone really bat an eye. That's the beauty of Grinders. I've seen other people come in wearing their pajamas, too. It's a little bit like the cafeteria in a college dorm, except the people are of all ages and we live down the street from each other instead of down the hall from each other.\n\nGrinders has a location inside the John C. Lincoln hospital across the street, too. It's common to see the hospital workers walk in wearing their scrubs. I think they're also opening one at Devry, or they just did. I was frustrated to hear that they tried to open a location at the Art Institute but they were one week too late, Stupid Starbucks had just gotten there.

The canned foods in the grocery area are dusty.  I ate here probably half a dozen times, and each time the sandwich had an odd whang to it that I can't identify.  It wasn't *bad* per se, but I quickly learned to spend another 2 dollars for Subway down the street.\n\nI ended up coming here for sodas and candy because it was so close to where I worked, until I caught on that I had to check the expiration date on all the items.  I am sure that the expired sodas and candy bars weren't dangerous, but I sure got a nasty tasing one from time to time.\n\nAlso, the prices randomly change based on who is ringing you up.  \n\nIt's an OK stop if you're hard up for cash and have a hankering for a sandwich with a weird taste, and don't mind rummaging through foodstuffs to find fresh items.  But certainly never go out of your way to eat here.", "business_id": "unPzS1QJJctlZyLGFSk_HA", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-04-05", "type": "review"}

It is the absolute worst place to go and I seriously recommend this place to no one ever. It started Wednesday when I drop my prescription off at 9 in the morning and they told me it would be ready by 11. I never heard of any place taking 2 hours to fill a prescription I wasn't in the mood to drive around looking for place to fill it quicker so I said Ok I'll be back. I ran some errands and at 12 noon I went to go get my prescription there was 5 cars waiting outside so I went inside and there was a line of 6 people.  Never had I seen a place so packed for prescriptions so I waited and as I get to the Counter and give my name they said it would be another hour or so. I explained I had to get to work and that I was told to pick up at 11 and it was 12 and the pharmacist named Frank said he would get on top of it and it would be 10 to 15 minutes well he was getting tugged around everywhere as pharmacists usually do but as soon as he got to my script he would type for literally 20 seconds before someone said something that called for a pharmacist to explain what medications were for and have you taken this before and blah..blah.. blah after 30 minutes he finally gets me my prescription and I vowed to never go back they didn't care and probably hoped I was serious being that they have no shortage of customers. That was Wednesday mind you and today my girlfriend took our son to urgent care and he needed medicine for his ear infection and also his rash I was at work but she told me that the same thing happened to her except they forgot to fill the rash creme and told her it would be another hour she was livid because they told her 2 hours and she actually waited 3 hours before she went back because she had to get my son down for a nap being that he was fussy and tired and the same thing happened and they didn't have the prescription ready. We will NEVER return to this walgreens. I will drive an extra few miles to cvs or any other place besides walgreens. I highly recommend no one goes here but if you don't take my word for it I guarantee you will be highly disappointed.", "business_id": "tbwZdMyjjLXgUt0l3b7kxA", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-04-18", "type": "review"}

And I said how long..?? And he said 30 minutes. So I went home and waited 40 minutes and then left just in case it wasn't ready. No call, no anything from them letting me know it was ready. I went in and there was a new girl up front. She looked and looked for my RX and kept asking me for last name cause she clearly wasn't listening. Finally, she found it and asked if I had insurance. Yes I have insurance I told her and she asked for my card and I gave it to her and then she told me she needed a different card specifically for prescriptions.\nLong story short, I wasted 1 hour of my time with a 102 fever, bronchitis, and a sinus infection. If they would have told me this in the first place when I initially dropped them off, I would have been at home resting.

Run away from the most incompetent excuse for a pharmacy and staff imaginable. We rushed my daughter to urgent care tonight due to a severe and fast progressing UTI. She is two. Doctors told us to immediately fill prescriptions and begin medication as time is of the essence and this could quickly develop into a kidney infection. We arrived at this Walgreens before 930 PM on May 6, 2015. We were told a 30 minute wait and our prescriptions would be ready. We drug our two year old, screaming in pain away as well as our 9 month old. Fine, I get fill time.\n\nWe returned ~40 minutes later. I WAS THE ONLY ONE THERE. The pharmacist and the tech both ignored my existence. After 20 minutes, someone acknowledged me. The tech walked away for 5 minutes, came back and said, \"Sorry, it's not in stock\". Then stared at me like I was an idiot. I asked her for my prescription back...they had lost it. LOST IT! Their careless disregard for patient and customer safety it repulsive. I'm fairly certain ANY untrained person could walk behind the counter and provide far more assistance. The tech eventually found my prescription after screaming at who I assume to be the pharmacist, \"Is there a prescription over there?\" SO NOW YOU'RE LEAVING PRESCRIPTIONS AND PERSONAL INFORMATION LYING AROUND?! \n\nI left with my screaming, extremely ill 2 year old in tow and infant at 1040 at night. I called another Walgreens to see if they had the prescription in stock. They were equally frustrated when they pulled up my daughter in the system and found that the PRESCRIPTION WAS NEVER EVEN RAN. These fools never even put the prescription into the system, didn't think to call, lost it, then informed me it's not in stock. So now it is pushing 11 PM, my kid is sick, my infant is exhausted, my cold has worsened and we still have no prescription. I find it disgusting that these supposed educated professionals feel it is within their right to take the LIFE OF MY CHILD into their hands. I will be pursuing this complaint to the fullest extent. Corporate will be involved. It should be of significance to the store manager that EVERY REVIEW OF THE PHARMACY IS NEGATIVE and mentions the same things that I have. This is not an \"oops\" or rare occurrence. It is a bunch of ignorant, ill-trained, poor excuses of pharmacy techs/pharmacists. I will make sure everyone in my entire neighborhood and every surrounding one, every person we come in contact with, as well as the entire hospital staff of every hospital within the area know how incompetent this place is. Thank you for not only risking my daughter's life, but actually further injuring her.\n\nIt happened again!!!!!! We went to drop off prescriptions (3) for both my children. Two were medicines available over the counter, but we were given a prescription. One is a \"add water and shake\". We were told an hour. We returned after that time and were told that a specific time was set....yet we weren't told. My husband returned nearly two hours later, just to be sure the incompetent fools had it done......and of course, they don't. I'm now about to take my kids to the emergency room because the pharmacy said they are too busy to fill it. Read the reviews you idiots. Fix your pharmacy staff or enjoy the lawsuits. Second time you have harmed my kids.

Always hated the long wait.\n\nLong Version: I usually weight my ratings more heavily on food, but in this case, the wait and whole inefficient process of ordering just makes this such a terrible experience. What is the purpose of one person taking orders but not taking payment? How about just taking orders and payment and using the extra person to prepare the food so that we can get through the line faster?\n\nAs for the bagels, the Everything Bagel is my favorite with salmon schmear on one side and light plain schmear on the other side. My office order Einstein bagels for us every Friday so I usually need to get to the kitchen early otherwise the Everything Bagel has been claimed.\n\nOn the weekends, when the line is even worse, I like to order an Egg, Turkey and Cheddar sandwich on an Everything Bagel, but instead of the Turkey Sausage that is on the menu, I ask for Breakfast Turkey, which is just regular Turkey Lunchmeat. However, if you ask for Turkey Lunchmeat, they charge you an extra $1.50, but if you ask for Breakfast Turkey, it's free of charge. It must be a difference in portions. I also add plain schmear to one side, which is important because if it's added to both sides, your fillings will just slide out and your sandwich gets messy as funk.\n\nAnyways, I was there this weekend and it took me, no exaggeration, 40 minutes from the time I ordered to when my name was called.

I absolutely don't like spending 15 bucks at a Grocery Store for a meal....but again that is not new for whole foods...LOL. However the reason I gave this location 3 stars is because the service here is always suspect....I mean you have to ask people for everything in the store.....no seems to want to help you which is very unusual for Whole Foods Markets. Also when I was ordering my food the young lady didn't seem to have any idea what I was talking about or how to make it....thankfully there was someone there to assist her or I think I would've had to make it myself....LOL!!!!

Maybe I'm spoiled with the shelf space and layout of the one on Mayo in Scottsdale (a flagship store built in 2008), but this Shea store is about a third of the size, if that. EVERY time I have gone there (it's much closer to me than the Mayo location), they NEVER have what I need. Whether it's a type of hummus, cosmetic, vitamin, flax oil, it's never there like it is on Mayo. They just don't have the shelf space.\n\nToday, I tried one more time for Barlean's flax oil. Oh, they had it, but the 16oz sizes had been sitting on the shelf since November (it says on the bottles when they are created) and due to expire in one month. Shows how little product they move. They just don't have the customer turnover. I looked for a hummus they had at the Mayo location and they didn't carry that either. When I asked about the brand, they tried to sell me something else that I didn't want. Weak. \n\nMy other major complaint and apparently it is a common one according to the staff, is that they have a HUGE display of bath salts (open) and soaps sitting out near all the food smack in the middle of the store. If you want flax oil, you'd better be good at holding your breath. It was so strong that just from walking through the area once, my boyfriend asked me \"what is that smell, it smells like cheap perfume soap or something\" on me when I got home. Wow. It's really bad for anyone with perfume sensitivities which is a lot of people in AZ, one of the worst allergy zones in the country. \n\nI mean, Whole Foods is supposed to be a mecca of health, not stench and inconvenience. \n\nThis long-time customer will be exclusively shopping (and dropping lots of cash) at Mayo from now on.

When I finally found the time to visit for lunch, it was only for takeout. I called in my order based on the items from their website. After viewing their website a few times, I thought they were part of a chain similar to Paradise Bakery. When I arrived to pick up my order, I was in complete shock as they are not a chain. According to the woman I spoke to, they have been around over 10 years. (And I just now noticed?!) My order consisted of a French dip for my husband and a roast beef melt for me. Their dessert case looked delicious, so I added a chocolate brownie for good measure. The woman behind the counter, who took my phone order, was both helpful and nice. I thought perhaps she was the owner or had been working for the company a long time as she seemed to know a lot.\n\nOnce back in the office, I dug into my sandwich. I really liked mine. The roast beef was delicious and I really liked the bread but the overall flavors of caramelized onions, mushrooms and mustard really blended well together. My husband liked my sandwich more than his French dip. I admit the French dip was a little disappointing. It was just bread, meat, and a small container for dipping sauce. It was a lot of bread and meat and no cheese. We've definitely had better French dips. However, the brownie... oh, it was amazing. It was super soft and fudgy with a dark chocolate frosting on top. Super decadent and would love to eat another or ten. \n\nIf in the area, I would definitely go back and try more of their sandwiches and desserts.", "business_id": "j5HLcBru7FEirYJPbKFVWA", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-03-06", "type": "review"}

As a bakery, it had a very limited selection, at least by noon on a Saturday.\n\nBreadcrafters is a \"one-of\" (not a chain) breakfast and lunch place just east of Paradise Valley mall, and it is a good one.  The real key to good sandwiches is good bread, so a place like this that bakes their own can have a big advantage -- if their bread is good.  In this case, it is.  Furthermore, the ingredients within the buns are fresh, tasty, and plentiful.  Special kudos to the tuna melt (not fried - just melted cheese), and a delight containing chicken and cheese.  An inventive mojito bar for dessert worked too.\n\nBecause it is fairly small, it can get crowded at peak times and I imagine that service could slow down a bit.

Went today around 2:15....it was pretty dead, I was the only customer in there. Ordered two sandwiches, two bags of chips and a cup of soup to go. Not cheap, about $27. The guy that helped me was not friendly at all. While he was ringing me up, another guy tells him that someone in the back \"isn't usually like that\" and that she was in a bad mood because someone else didn't show up for work. My cashier responds to him with \"I don't care, it's not my job to do that\"....obviously there had been an issue between coworkers before I walked in, but to have the conversation while I'm trying to order makes things awkward. My food was ready about 10 mins later and I was just glad to get out of there. We got a club and a southwest chicken sandwich. The club literally had one slice of turkey, one slice of ham and some bacon. Not worth $9. The southwest chicken sandwich had greasy soggy bread and dry chicken...and a bonus eyelash. The potato leek soup was actually pretty good, but the croutons that came with it were burnt and the slice of bread we were given with it was dry and had a dead gnat on it.

I sure hope they didn't suffer from former customers purposefully avoiding them after 2001 for any sort of discriminatory reasons -- what a shame that would be!\n\nPerusing the aisles of the grocery while waiting for your food to be prepared is like being flashed to an indoor version of an exotic marketplace bazaar (like in the first Indiana Jones movie, or hey, like Shakedown Street) full of strange and enticing shapes and smells and textures, foreign languages, and lots of \"What the heck is THIS!?\".  \n\nSpice grinders!

I was like didn't I give u .13 and she says no, you have me .22!  Ok, maybe I did but why the hell would I give u 22 cents with my $20? How about some freaking communication???!!!  When you counted it why didn't you say, oh you gave me a dime not a penny... Then when I wanted to give the .09 back and u give me my dime back and give u a penny to replace it it was too much of a brain malfunction!!!  Then you didn't hand me bag or anything and I freaking walked out of the store so frustrated I didn't remember to ASK you for my freaking bag and left without it!  Maybe if you said hello gave me a total and you actually say something to your customers we could avoid this whole big inconvenience!  I know it sounds so petty like I can't be bothered by looking at a screen myself to find the total but come on!!!  TALK to the customer in front of you... Not the customer who just finished on front of me or the other employee on break buying something behind me!!!!!", "business_id": "MJTds5mMqXEzYFI1TDCA8Q", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-05-20", "type": "review"}

Neither was really appealing, but the lure of pie is strong...too strong! \nGPS said that Marie's was closest and on the way home.\nGPS did not say that this location stilled smelled of stale cigarette smoke from 2 years ago.\nGPS didn't tell me that the reason nobody was at this place at 9:00 in the evening was because it just isn't even very good pie, anymore (or, more probably, it isn't very good anything anymore).\nGPS tells me about traffic ahead and bad weather, but it just doesn't do a very good job of warning you about crappy restaurants!\nIt was dark, kind of smelly and over air-conditioned in Marie's, but we pressed on regardless. Once seated, our waitress came by. \nShe didn't seem pleased to find out that we were only there for pie and coffee (I can understand...there only seemed to be 3 tables occupied in the entire place). She was however, pleasant, and for that I tipped big, since it looked like we were her best prospect for decent tip on Saturday.\nI believe that Marie's used to really think their claim to fame was their pies...I know they were touting \"whole pies\" in the signs as we walked in, but if this is still their big deal, then I am reasonably certain that I don't want anything to do with anything else they make/replicate/serve/unearth at Marie's. \nThe pie was no better than you would find wrapped in cellophane next to the cash register at Circle K. The coffee was even worse, if that's possible.\nHard to say what happened, but the crust was dismal (I don't think I'm a pie snob, but the Beautiful Carin is a baker of the first order, and she makes a vodka crust...that's right, you heard me, vodka crust, you replace  1/2 of the water in your crust recipe with vodka...that's to die for, and I would hurt someone that tried to take one of Carin's pecan pies away from me...I actually growl like my dog: ). \nThe filling in Marie's pies was even worse than the crust...just way too sugary, with no flavor except \"sweet\" and no body at all.\nI like pie! \nSadly, this wasn't it.", "business_id": "0QRvOpNbrHfik3wBupGFmg", "stars": 1, "date": "2009-04-21", "type": "review"}

My co-workers and I always recommend different plates from here to each others and each one of them has been a delight.\n\nLet me start off with the fact that their flour tortillas are the best ones I have had in ALL OF PHX. They taste homemade and you can taste the authenticity of its flour mix, its just simply the best. Lets continue our tour of the food menu with the CARNE ASADA BURRITO, wow! The meat is seasoned to perfection and their lettuce is always fresh and so is their guacamole. I am NOT  a fan of burritos but this is one of the few places in which I WILL order a burrito because of its deliciousness.\n\nThe flautas plate is also yummy, the flautas are long and deep fried with shredded beef and they are delish. \n\nA co-worker recommended that I try the Green Chile w Pork Quesadilla and add lime to it, and WOW, man, no words can describe the explosion of flavor that invades your tongue, its SO GOOD. \n\nFurthermore, this place always feels warm and welcoming. The two girls that basically run the place always seem to know who their repeat customers are and they spoil us with our requests for more salsa and guacamole and one of them even has our drinks ready for us as soo as she sees us walk through the door.", "business_id": "d2AeNB4xw67E1Bzpo1Pm7Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-03-19", "type": "review"}

As we were walking around an employee who came by was a bit rude but he offered us some samples of oranges/grapefruit/etc. He seemed a bit pushy and we had to say a few times, \"thank you, we are going to look around to see what we want.\" The fruits seemed fresh & the prices were pretty much as expected so we bought a few things. The people at the front weren't all that pleasant either. The older lady was rude and was talking to us but didn't make any eye contact. We were asking her regarding what seasonal items are offered / when they'd be there. She was dismissive & not all that helpful. I left with the impression that they don't care about repeat customers - If I were driving by I may stop in because, as previously mentioned the prices are good but I see no reason to drive out of the way to return.", "business_id": "1xoySA9Lzh3lwJeWJsq2Jg", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-03-15", "type": "review"}

The place is not open on Mondays and breakfast has limited hours during the week. There are three separate restaurant/eating areas on the farm. The lunch area is close to 32nd street with a canopy covered area and then lots of picnic tables deeper into the property. Back deep into the property there is a breakfast place, Morning Glory and the dinner restaurant, whose name eludes me right now. We dropped in for breakfast (almost missed it.)\n\nWe were able to seat ourselves and chose an umbrella covered table to stay out of the sun. The red and white checkered table cloths were very cute and very gave the whole area a homey feeling. Drinks here are serve yourself and you can just walk up and get what you like. (Try the lemonade/iced tea combo, aka. an Arnold Palmer, yummy. )\n\nThe wait staff were very nice and friendly. They asked where we were from and made a little conversation. SG got the French toast and I got a simple egg dish. The setting was gorgeous. I am not sure how it would be on a summer day in Phoenix, but March was perfect, especially with umbrellas to cover from the sun. Our food arrived fairly quickly. My dish was straight forward but good. SG's French toast was to die for. It was homemade bread, very thick and super good. \n\nThe lunch place was absolutely packed. This was a Thursday and the line was really long. Tons of mom's with little kids and people who look like they were on lunch break from work nearby. Food is served in baskets and then you can take it to your table. It seemed to be more like sandwiches and sides. I do not think there are servers, only counter service, and mostly it appeared to be cold foods. We did not get a chance to eat here. \n\nI have rated this place a 5 because the place is just such a great setting. All of the eating areas seemed to have great setups for groups, families, and couples. A designated room is set up for rental and parties. I think this would be a pretty great place to get married too and have the reception.

Yesterday there were some vendors set up outside Morning Glory Cafe, so my inlaws shopped a bit while waiting.\n\nThe food is absolutely delicious! I love how they use fresh and seasonal products, which I think makes it even better.  The American breakfast is standard breakfast but enough food to make me full without being stuffed. My husband had the belgian waffle yesterday and let me have a bite...it was awesome. Plus the whipped cream they give you with it is so light and refreshing...needless to say I ate the rest of it when he was done!  My mother-in-law loved her eggs benedict and had to give half to my father-in-law because the portions were so large. My father-in-law had the chicken enchalidas...delicious! Everyone at the table snagged some...the tomatillo sauce was so flavorful.  I love how they give you your own mini champagne bottle for mimosas.  I'm not sure what the final bill was because my father-in-law paid, but the first time we went for brunch, I think it was around $50 for my husband and I with tip.\n\nAfter eating, make sure to wander around the property.

There's also an expansive organic garden with rows of vegetables and flowers which I understand supplies the cafes that are on site with all their fresh produce. A little further behind the garden, the Morning Glory Cafe serves breakfast, The Retreat - a place for massages, facials, Reiki and mid-wife counseling, and the Cottage - a place for local artists to display and showcase their artwork.\n\nAfter I had breakfast at the Morning Glory Cate (that's another review) I spent some time at the artists studio looking over the work of some very talented artists.\n\nThe lunch spot is the Farm Kitchen which is located towards the entrance of the complex.

Servers were mulling about offering muffins and scones from large baskets as you looked over your menu.  Unlike bread at many restaurants these carbs ain't free.  we were told to help ourselves to drinks.  Nearby, there were spigotted vessels with coffee, water, lemonade, and a unsweetened flavoured iced tea.  Again, you will be charged for these later.\n\nPerusing the menu, we were torn because everything looked delicious. There were a handful of omelettes, eggs benedict, french toast, and even a french toast monte cristo.  You could also order beverages not on spigot, like fresh squeezed oj and mimosas (i think these were $7.50) from this menu.\n\nSticking with self-serve drinks, Jen ordered a South Mountain Omelette which came with rosemary roasted potatoes and an herb biscuit.  I ordered morning glory benedict minus the ham, which came with accoutrement of rosemary potatoes but no biscuit.  It seemed like our food came a few minutes after ordering it.  It was the fastest service I have ever experienced.\n\nJen's omelette had green peppers, red peppers, snap peas, tomatoes, swiss chard, and farmer's cheese ontop,  She said, \"This is the best omelette ever.\"  My eggs benedict (i'm a fan of benedicts) had perfectly poached eggs voluptuously mounting a tomato, on an english muffin bed, a dark green blanket of spinach draped over shoulders, and one of the best hollandaises ladeled ontop of it all.  It was delicious.  Also delicious was the rosemary roasted potatoes.  However, the biscuit was incredibly dry, so it was like mixing Quickrete(r) in yo mouf. (yes, i just said yo mouf)\n\nIt was very good food overall though with the eggs coming straight outta the hen house a few yards away and the veggies hailing from the equidistant farmer's market.

Our sandwichs were on par with any gourmet sandwich shoppe and the cherry bread pudding was average and very small on portion. Even with the groupon (which was worth $20) we still spent an extra $25, so it isn't cheap.

We spent about 5 min going back and forth about how if I just got half an order I would still have to pay full price (as I already said I would). Then someone else came out and told me I would have to pay full price, I said I understood that, I just didn't want to waste any food. Finally, my order comes out she says \"sorry the kitchen is too busy so you have to get the full order.\"\n\nMy eggs were okay but I think they forgot to toast the muffins so the meal didn't taste good.\n\nThe second time we went there, we decided to try going during the week so it wouldn't be as busy. Well, we got the same sucky server. She forgot to bring me my orange juice until the end of the meal and forgot to bring me my lemon. The menu is smaller during the week. The biscuits didn't taste fresh which is one of their signature items. The bacon tasted and felt like it had been on the burner all morning.

I had it bookmarked to try for over a year. Finally got around to doing just that on Sat, May 3rd, 2014. I guess it was a bad omen when the BBQ place I wanted to take friends was already sold out and had been before noon that day.\n\nWhile they may serve good ingredients they sure do charge a premium for them. I spent just short of $22 (yep, half sandwich, cup of soup, drink and a small dessert, $22) for lunch and that was no tip included.\n\nWhy no tip you ask? Well other then having to make the sandwich I ordered and pour the soup into the cup you have to do everything yourself including clean up after yourself. TIPS really means: To Insure Prompt Service. There is no service here. Plus they gave me the wrong sandwich. So they got 50% of my order wrong.\n\n$22 for a self service lunch with baskets and plasticware. The sandwich was good and the soup just ok. This should have been at the very most, $10 to $12. I guess you have to pay for the ambiance of dining outside. Hey, it didn't cost them a dime to erect a building, insure it, air condition it, etc. All of the other expenses which might drive the cost up to $22.\n\nAnd honestly while it was nice to dine on a rickety old splinter infested wobbly picnic table under a tree, it wasn't like it was a nicely manicured golf course like lawn. I'm not sure why all you people are so WOW about this place. I'm never going back.", "business_id": "MLcXtnpzygZvQ9BtseLLlw", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-05-06", "type": "review"}

I will probably come to Bagel Nosh again b/c I prefer to support the locally owned businesses over chains but I am not really sure if this place deserves the 4 1/2 stars it currently has.\n\nMaybe part of that is due to my bad experience there.  I ordered a latte with my bagel sandwhich and it took a long time to come out, even after the food.  Then when I finally got it instead of coffee they had given me hot chocolate.  A simple mistake but it can be really jarring when your mouth is expecting one thing and you get another.  Plus I really don't like sugar in the morning and this was extremely sugary sweet.  They did replace it with the latte I ordered but it made me a little grumpy to have to wait so long for my coffee on a Sunday morning so it kind of ruined my day.\n\nI will definitely give them another try and may raise the stars higher in the future.

Boom, roasted!\n\nJust remember, \"Stressed\" is just \"Desserts\" spelled backwards, so head over to NBC for some sweet de-stressing!", "business_id": "vPJ4iCOSuxCxHPtb18gwWw", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-04-25", "type": "review"}

I really don't get why a grocery store at his location would be stocked with so many of these.  I know the mark up on convenience items is what grocery stores thrive on, but is Albertsons is in a big outdoor shopping mall.

Most of the stores in the North Phoenix/Cave Creek/North Scottsdale area have switched to a look that feels more like a small specialty store.

The waiter came by after a few minutes, took our drink order and then actually snatched the menus out of hands. He brought us our drinks and promptly walked away. The floor manager came by and we told her what happened. She reprimanded the waiter in front of us and gave us two discount cards for our next visit and comped our beers. The food wasn't great by any stretch of the imagination. So little so that I don't remember what we ordered.\n\nWe decided to use our discount cards for a second trip. We were sat once again in a far corner by the kitchen. The waiter took our drink order and food order together and instead of bringing out our drinks and then our food, just waited until our food was done cooking to bring out the drinks as well. I ordered the lobster enchiladas which was about $18 (US) because on the menu it sounded tasty. On the plate it looked like a used deflated diaper. The enchiladas were TINY. I asked the waiter if that was what it was supposed to look like because it didn't look like $18 worth of food. The chef that made it came out with an attitude and said, \"You should have asked about the portion before we wasted all that lobster.\" To which I responded, \"What lobster? There isn't a lobster tank in here which means you pulled it from a can.\" I have never been treated so rudely. The floor manager apologized however refused to defuse our anger because the previous manager comped our beers and gave us $20 off our next meal which he felt was more than kind enough a gesture.\n\nSo if you want Rock Bottom quality food with Rock Bottom service at sky high prices then this is your stop.

The restaurants are always clean, the service prompt and friendly and the bagels (I almost always get a tasty turkey on a toasted everything bagel).\n\nYesterday, I dropped into this location hungry & ready for my usual.  The restaurant was PACKED, no biggie, I've seen this before, these guys are bagel slingin pros and will make short work of this line....\n\nSo, I step up to the order counter, look into the case & notice they're running low on some varieties but have what I'm looking for.  I order and make my way to the register.  This is where I notice they're set up kinda backwards.  You enter the queue on the left of the store, order and move to the right to pay.  The cashier is next to the restroom and drink machines (a dead end) but then you have to go BACK int the queue where people are ordering to GET your food... Not an issue if the store isn't busy but when all tables are occupied and there's a line to the door, it's kind of a mess.\n\nEvery minute or so, an name is called and a bagel lover gets his/her breakfast, everything's in order then right, well.... About every second name called seemed to result in the patron approaching the counter to get his/her order only to be told they'd run out of their bagel choice and would have to choose another.  After 15 minutes waiting for MY name to be called, the moment came and I stepped up to the counter and was told they didn't have any everything bagels and I would have to choose something else.  My response, you had plenty when I ordered, the response \"well, we're out now and people are waiting behind you so hurry up and pick something else.\"  This kinda pissed me off so I looked at the case and said I'll have a garlic bagel, \"if you have any left when you make my sandwich.\" Yes, I was snarky but so was the bagel maker.  The blonde girl next to him seemed offended that I would have anything to say about the goings on and stopped making sandwiches to make sarcastic comments to the guy who was making my bagel.  \n\nAnyway, 5min later I got my order and we headed home.  I opened my bag and inside was NOT a garlic bagel, it was NOT toasted but it WAS an okay onion bagel.  \n\nMaybe I'm overreacting but I don't feel like making bagels is THAT difficult nor do I think it's too much to crank up bagel production when you're slammed on a Saturday (5-11-13) morning....", "business_id": "IYWTOj970XqG2z9Xft_8SA", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-05-23", "type": "review"}

I'm not new to Mediterranean food. However, this was my first attempt at eating falafel. Here it's horrible. Tasteless even with the sauce. Burnt on the edges. I have since had falafel elsewhere convinced it was good because I understand the Greeks and Hebrews eat it like popcorn and I have found places with great falafel, just not here as the other rave reviews would suggest. BUT they have great Adas soup. It was really spicy in a good way and nice and creamy. So I can't explain the falafel failure. Overpriced for what you get. I had to eat off my husband's plate to get full. They do bring OK pita bread out to you. \n\nAs far as atmosphere goes, it's lacking a bit. This place is (as somebody wrote) 2/3 market, 1/3 restaurant. They have a sign in the window that says \"Allah\" and \"Mohammed\", which I don't think is a good idea. There is definitely NOT outdoor seating as the stats indicate. The tables are the cheap fold-up kind and so are the chairs. The tables are chipped. The waiters serve in a timely manner but don't smile like they would at a chain. They do have a big screen TV that was playing a soccer game but at least the volume was low. \n\nI can't recommend this place for a date or for families.

I don't want to add up how many times that is but 2000 might be reasonable. I have to admit that the location is a bit weird, its a strange little mall tucked away from the street.  The sign has letters I don't understand.  \n\nI went there because one of my techs was called to work on one of their refrigerated cases and told me how nice it was.   I went in there and did not tell them anything about my guys working there.  They were so incredibly nice and helpful I could not believe it.  When I told them that is was my first time there they patiently explained everything on the menu to me and even brought me samples of some items I had not had before.  \n\nThe shwarma is my favorite for the meats (both chicken and beef) but everything I have tried is fresh and flavorful.  Their kabobs use good quality meat that isn't too chewy.  I am a total hummus snob and make my own frequently.  Theirs is made fresh every day and tastes as good as my home made if not better.  In fact my wife bought some at Costco today and it was so bad in comparison that it made me remember I had to give these people a good review.   You can buy the same ingredients in the attached store and if you ask they will tell you which ones are best.   The have great pita bread in the freezer you can warm up and is better than any other pita bread around here.  Their prices in both the restaurant and deli are very reasonable for the quality of the food.\n\nAnother reviewer mentioned wiping the tables with the same rag as they wiped the tables.  I have seen multiple restaurants do this and as long as the rag has proper disinfectant I do not see anything wrong with it. In fact -- think about it -- you almost always put your hands down on a booth when  you slide in, then you eat with them!  I am GLAD they wipe down the booths with disinfectant.    I like this place because it is clean, you can see back into the kitchen and see how they keep it.  I don't think giving such a low rating for what seems to be a standard practice is very fair. \n\nYes, the different tiles in the dining room a a bit weird, but it is only like 1/4\" difference.  The location is a little different as is the layout.  In the first of this review I mentioned I had driven buy it literally thousands of times over the last 13 years. It seemed a little odd and I missed out all that time by not exploring it.  If you don't like exploring a little different cultures go to McDonald's.  These are hard working people who make the best food they know how, make it fresh and are incredibly nice.  They have some very beautiful women working there who are also very nice and helpful.  The whole place is maybe a little different than we are used to in Mesa but if you want interesting and flavorful experience stop there and give them a try.", "business_id": "4rr-CJp0jMKr-kg9wnrTdw", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-04-18", "type": "review"}

Over the course of time I have unfortunately seen the quality of this place slip.  I used to really enjoy this place.  The Princess Combo was good.  \n\nI went to Princess last night with my wife.  We ordered the Princess Combo.  The following are some of the observations noted:\n\n1) The cleanliness of the place has slipped.  Please clean your booths and tables (the tables and the floors).  It was nearly impossible to find a clean table.  Cleanliness is something that my wife and I do not compromise on.  We have been to the developing world, and even with that, we still find restaurants in the developing world much cleaner.  \n\n2) Some of the dishes need to be cleaned better.  I had a water glass that was stained, and asked for a new glass.  Please pay attention to this.  \n\n3) My wife found the beef or lamb kabab, in the Princess Combo (do not know which one it was) as being very chewy (inedible).  We enjoy kababs but it was just too chewy.  We could not determine if it was beef or lamb.  It was just too chewy.  Either it was overcooked, or undercooked (I am guessing overcooked...it was not red or raw).\n\nMy wife and I have experienced Middle Eastern and Mediterranean food and we love it.  We have been to that part of the world, and have many friends who are from that part of the world.  \n\nAlso, a lot of my colleagues where I work know that I tend to find restaurants that are \"diamonds in the rough\".  I used to think that Princess was one of them.  I am questioning this now.  \n\nMany of my colleagues are former military, and politics aside, they have been deployed in the Middle East, and they remember that corner cafe or related in Saudi, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Turkey, etc.  They acquired that taste while serving there.  They often ask me about places I recommend for Middle Eastern food.  I used to recommend this place.  I am questioning whether to recommend this place now.  \n\nPlease take a long and hard look at your place:\n\n1) Clean it up\n2) Figure out what has changed (for the worse), and fix it as far as food\n\nI trust that you have a good people who mean well.  Perhaps a little training may be all that is needed.  \n\nYou have a good \"product\" or \"service\", you just need to burnish your image a little bit in order to \"return\" to what I would call a 5 star rating.  \n\nI recommend you do it soon so that the reputation of the place is not tarnished.  I want this place to do well, but you need to re-double your efforts and go back to the basics.", "business_id": "4rr-CJp0jMKr-kg9wnrTdw", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-05-23", "type": "review"}

It's located in a strip mall (surprise!!) with the worst parking lot ever, so I didn't really know what to expect. My only other TJ experiences have been in Center City Philadelphia (gross) and a stand-alone in a suburban Seattle neighborhood.\n\nThis store is really clean. I went on a Sunday afternoon so it was fairly crowded, but the shelves were stocked and it was pretty easy to maneuver around. If I had a cart it might be another story but I grabbed a basket and went up and down each aisle a couple times. The only messy area was the bathroom but I probably just caught it in between cleaning shifts. \n\nNot knowing what I was looking for, I picked up a couple items for dinner and snacks for the kids. Yogurt tubes - good price. English muffins - good price and probably the best I have ever had. Orange Chicken (frozen) - could have been spicier but the kids loved it. Meat dept - expensive...better prices at Sprouts. Frozen blueberries - cheapest around. All-in-all it was a good experience, I was pleasantly surprised, and I started drafting my \"okay, you win\" text to my friend who stood her ground and I headed to the register.\n\nI stood in line and when I was my turn, I told my cashier that I had a bag. This is where they get docked 2 stars. For the amount of time it takes to ring up the 7 items that I had, my cashier made not one, not two, but five smart-ass comments about the fact that I had a Whole Foods bag. I know, I know, what a dumb thing to get bent over, but for me it has to do with service, and Roger (cashier), should just bite his tongue, keep his opinions to himself, and just be happy that I am contributing to his ability to receive a paycheck. I know the $22 I spent is just a teeny-tiny percentage of what the store brings in on a normal day, but because of that interaction, I won't go out of my way to shop there, even if it means saving a couple bucks.", "business_id": "4EeLblEpJc2VeBowa94YPQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-03-04", "type": "review"}

More than one-third of people are terribly worried that there might not be enough cookie butter to go around (fake shortages).  The situation is so dire that there is a 3 jar minimum at most locations.  Bad news indeed.\n\nDo you know what this means?   It means that Trader Joe's is consistently packed with cookie butter preppers, stocking up for the next drought.  This means that I sometimes have to park as far as two stores away just to shop at the Baseline Rd location.   It's an arduous struggle that I'm willing to deal with.  I go about once a week.\n\nThe efforts are rewarded with:  conveniently packaged organic produce, mini pots of fresh herbs, $2 bundles of seasonal flowers, the absolute cheapest nuts and dried fruitbits I've ever seen.  Even the processed junkstuff is somehow less junky, less infused with artificial flavors, colors, toxins, and evil gmo monsanto-ness.  So, when I do want to buy junk food, I feel a little better about getting it at Trader Joe's.   The eclectic frozen foods offerings are also appealing.  Predictably, if you cram some Kale into anything,  I'll put it in my cart.  And the two buck chuck ($2.99 in Arizona) ain't bad either.\n\nDid I mention the conversation?  On a recent visit, an employee wearing footed pajamas (I am totally not even making this up - it was pajama day for the staff) indulged me in a debate about how to best win if  a game of \"Supermarket Sweep\" were held in the store there.  He suggested that it would be best to fill the cart with some of the more expensive cases of wine.   I countered by telling him I'd likely risk it by making a bee-line straight to the nut butters and fill my whole cart with Speculoos Cookie Butter.", "business_id": "4EeLblEpJc2VeBowa94YPQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-05-02", "type": "review"}

I have 6 items, 4 exactly the same.  She tell me \"you have too many items, I can't help  you.\"  Really, 6 items is too many for you?  So as usual, poor customer service in this store.  So I turn around, and of course every one of the do it yourself registers are now full.  So not only can she not help me, because I have 6 items (too many for her little Walmart brain to handle) but I now get to stand in line again.  I walked.  I have had very poor customer service in this store again and again, and I keep coming back.  This was the last straw.  I  have also written Walmart, and I bet you money that I will never hear from them.  It's all about volume for this company, they could really give a shit about customer service.  As long as all the people come to their stores and spend money, that's all this corporation cares about.  Do yourself a favor and stay away from Walmart.  I know they are less expensive that Safeway, but not at the expense of your sanity, and if you expect anything resembling customer service, you won't get it here.  STAY AWAY!", "business_id": "OdXjGy_iU6MpbDUmXDU8pw", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-05-16", "type": "review"}

The employee proceeded to ask the manager on duty. He blatantly told me that he was too busy and that he wouldn't know when he would be able to find that out for me. WOW. Are you serious? Then he proceeded to go on about his way. I asked him how long I would have to wait and he said he didn't know and that he would page someone to see if they are still on the clock to help me. After waiting about 20 min he turns around and says, \"oh, didn't know you were still actually waiting.\" And this is their manager? A young man with blonde hair and glasses.

A head of lettuce is ridiculously priced at 50 cents. I get two and a $1 bag of pre-peeled carrots and have myself good-sized salads for a week. They sell the cheapest paper towels for .54 each. They carry Tina's Burritos at .30 each. Fry's doesn't. They have $1 crab. Just don't buy the packaged deli meats. Those are overpriced. It's clean. All employees speak English.

I had to get some gelato...and I needed it now!   After we left Grimaldis, I looked this place up and decided to swing by.\n\nThere were a few people in there which was good because it gave me time to scope out what I wanted.  I decided to go with a medium, half chocolate, half peanut M&M.  They sure do give you a lot of gelato.  It was only $5 bucks and they give you a packed 8 ounce cup.  I paid my money and took my gelato outside to eat by my car.\n\nThe chocolate was really good and the peanut M&M tasted exactly like a chewed up peanut M&M.  It was a great blend of flavors.  The only thing that was a tad off, was the texture of it. After every bite, I had a \"filmy\" taste/feel in my mouth.  Hard to describe but I know for sure I didn't have that type of sensation at the other place I ate at earlier today.  The odd after bite texture keeps this from being perfect.

The directions listed on the website were good and I found it quite easily.  End of the good part - when I entered the store there were two people working and neither one bothered to say hello, welcome, get out - nothing!  A few minutes later I did find what I was looking for and then one of the employees walked over and asked if I needed help.  Told her I already found what I was interested in but wanted to see the rest of the store.  It is a small place, with jars of teas and herbs so it really didn't take me too long.  I was a bit put off by the sign \"God and the angels are watching you and so are we\" (can't remember if it was angels or spirits) not only once but again in the second part of the store along with a few mirrors.  This struck me as a little strange as this is a holistic center and the clientele that would frequent this type of store do not need to be reminded that the employees here look at you like you are going to steal something from them. Asked a few questions about their products and felt like I was bothering them and when I was ready to check out with my purchase, I had to ask someone to ring my purchase up so I could leave.  One employee was free and one was with a customer but I still had to wait.  At this point, I know I should have left the purchase on the counter and left but I did wait to be rung up and paid in full.

Its a small place (as is the parking lot in front, spots are definitely at a premium, I wish you luck!), nice and quiet on the inside, with plenty of seating, and an area with computers (internet code comes with drink purchase should you desire to use it. So its not really \"free\" wi-fi, per se, but \"if you buy from us you can use our internet, till the code expires in a few hours, and you need to buy another drink from us to get a new, active code\" wi-fi). Outside, there's a scattering of tables, ashtrays, and lakefront seating. Lakefront seating you say? In Arizona? Well, you better believe it. Sitting on the corner of a man-made lake for an apartment and condo community, those who are so inclined can start the morning (or end their days) sitting by the lake, enjoying the ducks, and the view of the water, and whatever beverage you have purchased to wet your whistle.  Pretty calming if you ask me, but, hell, I grew up on LI, NY surrounded by water, so it might just be a bit of a bias, based on the fact that, well, I grew up on an island. Which means you should take my advice: sitting and listening to water flow and watching the lake is calming. \n\nBut what about the drinks, you say'? They are the reason you go to a coffee shop, so sure, I'll get on with the drinks. Get. The. Coffee. It's good. There isn't much other ways to say it. Get the coffee, its good, you won't be disappointed. You can fancy it up with milk and sugar, or drink it straight up black. Its just good coffee. If you down for the other drinks, The Frosts are pretty good as well (blended ice, mocha, flavored syrup of your choice, and espresso). They tend to be a bit on the pricier side (6$+/drink), but if you're willing to drop the dough, they are pretty tasty. Iced Tea wise, they have your standard regular unsweetened tea, which is good, a green tea, and I'm not sure, but I think they'll drop  bit of flavoring syrup into the tea should you desire. Unfortunately, the iced tea only comes in one size. It's pretty good tea, but I suck down the approx 16 oz cup way too quickly. If they'd serve it to you in the giant Frost cups, then all would be right with the world, but alas they wont, and you're forced to go back and pay for a refill sooner rather than later. \n\nAll in all, good coffee, good (albeit small sized) iced tea, semi-free wi-fi, and relaxing lake front setting.

It's not undrinkable, but it's not good--just somehow off. Why go to a coffee shop if the coffee you're going to get is crappy?\n\nBut there are plenty of other reasons to avoid Coffee Rush. A big one is that it's about the least green coffee shop I've ever encountered.  They don't even have ceramic cups on the premises. If you're staying and you would like to drink your coffee in a mug instead of a paper cup, you have to bring your own.\n\nAfter establishing that, I ordered a piece of baklava. The counter person asked if I wanted it \"on a plate or in a box.\"  \n\n\"On a plate,\" I replied, figuring it would at least be ceramic.  But no: It was styrofoam. The really annoying thing is that the baklava was already in a paper muffin cup and didn't need to be on a plate. Just one more way for Coffee Rush to add to the waste in our landfills.\n\nIf you want water, there are large styrofoam cups for it. \n\nParking at this location is truly terrible--the stalls are too narrow.. I was seated outside and watched patron after patron struggle to get their cars into the stalls and then struggle to get out.\n\nThe water that other reviewers find so picturesque is a vivid green man-made \"lake\" that anywhere but Arizona would be called a duck pond, because that's what it really is. If sitting by a duck pond and drinking lousy coffee while people smoke all around you is your idea of a pleasant morning, then this might be the place for you.

They automatically give you 10% off the prices at the checkout counter. No membership card needed. There is no one who can help you in the aisles so if you have a question, forget it. You better know what you are there to buy. If you ask why they have discontinued carrying a particular vegetable at the front desk, they just argue with you that they still carry it but the truth is, it hasn' t been there for like 8 time that I have gone.

I was perhaps customer #5 when he and his wife opened their first small store on the NW corner of Dobson and Southern, and their store was maybe 600 square feet max, and he personally had to drive his panel truck to LA to buy goods every week.  I went there today to get some ingredients for my Chinese food menu that I was preparing tonight.  But a couple of things really irked me so I felt I had to write this review.  First of all, I wanted so pork shoulder that needed to be larger than what they had in the prepackaged meat section.  I also saw some salmon and I wanted to know what kind of salmon that was -- farm raised or wild?  And what species -- red? silver?  I knew it couldn't be pink salmon from the color and it couldn't be king from the price.  But nobody in the fish section could answer my question.  And nobody in the meat section would go cut me a piece of pork in the size I wanted.\n\nThen I felt the urge to go use the restroom.  But when I got there, someone was cleaning the restroom and I asked if I could use it.  I was told, no, I just had to wait.  Ever have to \"go\" and there was nowhere to \"go\"?  I was so angry I felt like \"going\" on the floor in the hallway there.  WTF???\n\nMy point in writing this post is that Lee-Lee was great with customer service when the owner and his wife ran the place.  Then his wife became a stay-at-home mom and that was OK since he was still there to assist, help, and answer questions.  But now he is really big and has two stores.  He also spends 80+%  of his time at the the NW store and seldom is at the Chandler store.  His customer service is going downhill fast -- every year I get more and more irritated along with others I spoke with.\n\nGuess we gotta shift all our business to Mekong Plaza up the road.

A whimsical foodie could easily go broke here. I watch their ads and generally only buy things on sale or occasional indulgences (read: weekly sugar cookie trip). Surprisingly here, some things are no more expensive than other grocery stores (gallons of water, certain condiments, Peanut M&Ms, off the top of my head), but a lot of specialty items and most of the produce are nooooot cheap. Just the act of shopping here makes me giddy- there's nice lighting and soooo much beautiful food all around. \n\nMy absolute favorite thing here is the bakery- it's top notch. Depending on how early in the day you go, there may or may not be a lot of things to choose from. I love the sugar cookie and also the red velvet cupcake. You can't go wrong with the cheesecakes, and the tartufo we found during the holidays was the richest food i've ever eaten (chocolate mousse and white chocolate mousse layered with chocolate cake, covered in chocolate). Their coffee drinks are also pretty good although I have to ask for a bit less sugar. \n\nThe prepared food bars are also delicious- they serve a dinner every night that promises a good meal but at a cost of $12-16 a plate. The salad bar is good for lunch. I haven't yet tried the sandwich/pizza bar, but it smells good when i'm there. The sushi bar also has happy hour specials in the afternoons. \n\nGoing on around the store, there is an extensive meat and seafood counter. The butchers are knowledgeable about what they sell and are happy to cut/wrap things differently for you. Recently there was a sale on Kobe beef and I came in at least 3 times that week! Everything always looks and smells very fresh.\n\nOk, I feel like i've covered the highlights. Beyond this, if you're after something very specific/hard to find, this store will be the one to have it if anyone does. It's fun to come buy a new gourmet salsa/sauce/coffee, snacks, or just look around.

Keep in mind that if you're going in a large group, they don't do reservations so on a weekend night, expect a long wait!", "business_id": "78IaYCf9ktUep4UhhjXbTg", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-05-11", "type": "review"}

I was super impressed with the overall operation of this place. \nThis is my first visit to any cheesecake factory, and it was an excellent experience.\nI feel i should mention, i was there to have dinner with my wife and daughter, and i had no time restrictions. I wasnt in a hurry. I wasnt looking at the clock. I also wasnt worried about the cost. It seems petty, to me,to worry about dollars and cents when spending time with people you like. So my experience is based solely on what happened, and no outlying factors.\nWe were seated promptly, and greeted by a friendly, nice looking server( i wanna say her name was rachel?, but like i said, i was here for family time) all of the staff appear clean, in clean uniforms, and nice looking. Drink orders, warm bread , blah, blah ,blah. Waitress was super patient when we werent ready to order, she seemed relaxed, and not at all hurried, even though the dining room is ENORMOUS. So we ordered. shrimp with angel hair and asparagus for me, chicken somethin for my wife, and plain burger for my kid. It was all good. Asparagus was perfectly cooked, uniform in color, crisp, but chewable. Pasta was 'al dente', which is exeptionally difficult to acheive in a commercial restaurant. \nNow, i honestly couldnt tell you how long the food took, or how long we were there, or what the servers attitude was like, because I WASNT LOOKING for those things. In my opinion, if your in a hurry, or concerned with your funds, maybe a table service restaurant isnt your best choice.\nIn conclussion:\nAs a professional in the restaurant industry myself, i was extremely pleased with my experience here, and i will go so far as to say, \"cheesecake factory is pulling it off\".", "business_id": "78IaYCf9ktUep4UhhjXbTg", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-05-18", "type": "review"}

They had to hollow-out a sourdough bread loaf to put the soup in.  Where's the bread?  I've had this style of soup service before, and they usually put the chunk of bread they removed on the side.  I would have liked to have it.  It would have made the meal a bit more filling.  Without it the meal felt \"small\".  \n\nThe soup itself was tomato garlic.  It was very good.  The bread bowl also was good (it really would have been nice to have that good bread they removed from it!!).  My wife also enjoyed her minestrone and sandwich.  I tried her minestrone, and it was very good.\n\nHad the service been faster, and I had been given the bread (which I'm sure they just threw away...wasteful buggers), I'd rate this three stars.  Maybe 3.5.  The food was very good.  Not 'fabulous', but very good.  However, the time to get a simple order of soup and sandwich is simply unreasonable and they must receive a deduction in rating for that alone.  Not giving me the bread also is really stupid.  It costs them nothing, and would have been a \"class\" move, in my opinion.", "business_id": "U9iWs_XQ88IEj_Cgawyz4w", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-03-15", "type": "review"}

When we lived in San Francisco, we used to do pub crawls with our friends in search of the perfect pint of Guinness.\n\nAnyway, we went to this BJs because he had heard good things about the beer here, more specificially, their brewmaster.

Not again. It's ok.  I was angry at my salad and the slower service.\n\nHe finally learned his lesson - never get the beer at BJs. The first BJs experience was back in California at the BJs in Cupertino, across the street from the Apple campus (yes, as in iPod).

His exact words.  *gags a little*\n\nHe thought it would be different at this BJs...but was sadly mistaken\n\nBJs on the whole will never have imported beer. If you want a decent selection of imported beer, I suggest going to Whole Foods -- you can pick up Belhaven!\n\nMy salad pissed me off.  There was more dressing than salad. I wanted some lettuce with my dressing. Our server kept sneaking off - don't want to know what he was doing outside for long periods of time and come back smelling of smoke.\n\nMy suggestion?

It's as simple as that. There is nothing about the food that makes you want to come back...even for bar food. All of the dishes lack flavor. They look pretty on the plate but the flavors are not there. The calamari is dry and flavorless. The wings come dry without sauce; you have to ask them to \"toss the wings in sauce\" to  get what is normal wings(wet wings drizzling in sauce) anywhere else. If you don't ask that, they serve fried chicken with dipping sauces, sorry I can get that at KFC not at a supposed premium bar. The salads taste wilted and the dressings seem to lack flavor. The beer was mediocre. The menu is entirely too large.\n\nThis place is a hit because of it's location and it's  atmosphere. It's an upscale sports bar resembling the Yard House  so a lot of people like to come here to have comfortable seating, nice service and nice tv's.

When my salad was served, I had requested creamy garlic dressing (which they no longer offer) and instead, it came mixed with some type of vinaigrette along with creamy garlic.

It was the deep dish lasagna. It was disgusting and below the first layers the food was ice cold. I called the waitress over and told her the issue. She sent the manager over and he agreed something was wrong. He left the table and the waitress brought the tab which had no adjustment for the lasagna that was inedible. I was so pissed that I paid the tab along with a 20% tip as she did a good job. I wrote to the company the following day about my dining experience and was immediately contacted by the store manager who apologized.

Ordered the cajun pasta but the flavor did not taste Cajun. I had it once before and it was very good. It took a while but I was finally able to wave down the waitress and asked her if there was any way to make it more \"Cajuny\". It came back smelling like dirty sink water & it tasted like straight up salt along with a hint of the dirty sink water, making it completely inedible. \n\n2. My boyfriend asked for extra toasted buns on his crispy jalape\u00f1o burger and it came out very soft and un-toasted.. Their excuse for that was that they toasted the underside of the buns more than usual.. what kind of logic is that? The underside of the bun just gets soggy anyway because of the sauce so isn't it obvious if someone stresses the fact that they need the buns extra toasted they would do both sides of the buns?\n\n3. We were unable to get even one refill due to the extremely long absences of the waitress and my boyfriend even yelled for her when she was 3 feet away and she still wouldn't turn around... and the restaurant wasn't even loud, the table next to where our waitress was standing even looked at my boyfriend because he was calling for her. The experience was more of a hassle than anything. For the hour we spent at here, 30 minutes was spent looking around waiting for the waitress to bring us the check and togo boxes. After the 15 minutes past of waiting for the check my boyfriend kept urging me to walk out on the check with him because he felt like they didn't deserve our money but I waited another 15 minutes to pay for this horrible experience... Since when did it take 30 minutes to get a check and togo boxes? \n\nWorst of all, it was an extremely slow night, slow enough to see plenty of waiters sitting around and talking for 20 mins. Luckily our waitress took the pasta off of our check so we didn't have to pay for the extremely salty, dirty, sink water flavored pasta.\n\nNow that I think about it, I should've listened to my boyfriend. This experience, along with 1 burger and 2 appetizers was not at all worth $27.

It was not busy at all.  There was no wait to be seated, and we got to choose between a table and a booth.\n\nWhile looking at the menu, I don't think its that half bad.  The place is really clean, well decorated, but I felt that it was dimly lit.  It kind of reminds me of a place maybe my grandparents would go, as it kind of has a homely feel.  Like the kind of place you would almost find a bunch of retiree's???\n\nMy problems began during dinner.  First, I was a little shocked at how much some of thier dinners were, considering it was kind of a \"home cooking\" type menu.  Comfort food is served here.  We were debating on appitizers and couldnt make up our minds on what we wanted.  We thought, what the heck, lets get a sampler.  But, the sampler appitizer was more then some of the dinners on the menu.  We passed, and went simple with some spinach dip.\n\nWhen the spinach dip arrived, at first, it did not look like what we would have expected.  It just looked different.  It had salsa on top!  WTH?  Salsa on top of spinach dip??  Never seen that before. We did not like that at all.  So, we had to scrape it off.  But, when we went to scrape it off, we realized we had no silverware to do so with.  We had to ask the server twice to bring us silverware and napkins.  We were almost done with our dip before be brought it out.  We scraped the salsa off with chips.\n\nWe ended up ordering burgers.  We refer to hamburgers as \"old faithful.\"  When you cant find anything else to eat on the menu, burgers are always a safe bet for a solid meal.  So, thats what we ended getting.\n\nI only gave this place 4 stars.  For starters, no silverware, secondly, I really felt like maybe we were to young to be there??  Maybe for an older crowd, but for us 20 & 30 somethings, I just felt like maybe it wasnt a joint for us.", "business_id": "bTd2Z_ITOufvGySokmHfwg", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-05-26", "type": "review"}

The corn bread was ok, but the chili lacked meat, substance, annnnd flavor.

For the most part the store is clean.  The primary complaint would be stock/inventory issues.  For example, recently Coke products were on sale 4/$10.00 and as par for the course they were out.  Another time during the summer I asked for an item and was told I should get there earlier in day. Well if someone works, that is not really possible now is it?  Also I had run in just to attempt to purchase some fresh Rosemary.  I grabbed a pack and looked at the expiration date and it was 2 weeks prior.  Grabbed another and a week out of date.  Asked one of the employees that happened to be behind me cleaning up a spill if he could check if they had any in back and they didn't.  When are they getting more in? No idea I was told. \n\nBut on to why the negatives.  This is primarily for the Pharmacy.  I called to inquire if they had one of my medications I needed filled in stock.  It is not a common med so it is not often in stock in most places.  They did so I was was all woohoo... maybe I will transfer ALL my scripts here as they are numerous and they seemed to be easier and not as long to wait as other outlets in the area.  I have another medication I needed filled but have an issue with a lot of the manufacturers versions so I asked who the company was that they used.  I was told they used Company A but they were on back order so they had Company B.  Having never used Company B, I accepted the \"given\" explanation and tried them.  Wait time about an hour... no big deal I will do my shopping and come back.  Well upon picking up my order and paying, I overheard the Pharmacist \"counseling\" the assistant about a fill she had to verify. She told her not to fill the prescription for this medication... the exact SAME medication I called about earlier with Company A.  The SAME company I was told they were out of and on back order... and to instead fill with Company B.  Wait.... I thought you told me you didn't have any and now there is one that is filled and told her not to change it but for future reference?  I don't appreciate being flat out LIED to.  I don't know why you are holding back Company A other than you might be able to get more money from a cash customer vs insurance which I was.  Either way it is VERY bad form to lie to someone and it is NOT appreciated at all.  \n\nIt is for the above reasons that I will NEVER use this store again and drive the few extra miles to the one in Florence about 7 or 8 miles away that is bigger, cleaner, newer and more well stocked.  This is an okay place if you need one of your \"basics\" (bread, milk, etc) but I would not recommend full on stock your cupboards type shopping at this location.", "business_id": "F7Om2iv1CHVUbrJ3gKi1qw", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-05-18", "type": "review"}

Not only are there those 2 destination worthy places to chow, but Hale Centre Theatre which offers live performance theatre for post eating entertainment. The icon for downtown Gilbert is a massive water tower that is just amazing to stand by. I know its just a water tower but the history, being built in 1923, and the scale, 123 feet tall, it's quite a sight to stand underneath. With a 3 million dollar renovation and new park surrounding the tower, it's both modern and well, cool. \n\nHere is some good news if you're a fan of Joe's Real BBQ or Joe's Farm Grill; restaurateur Joe Johnston also owns Liberty Market. So you'll know right away that there will be high quality and tasty food at very affordable prices. This is also due to the fact that Chef David Traina and his wife Kiersten are pretty much running the show at Liberty. Both were so helpful that we felt like we were honored guests; as I'm sure most will feel when visiting. Chef David came from behind the open kitchen and greeted us personally. His gorgeous wife Kiersten was so helpful as she had many recommendations from the menu and drink list as we ordered. Its customer service like this that will not only make you a loyal guest, but you'll quickly share this experience with your friends.\n\nBuilt in 1935 the building has been lovingly restored into that retro-American-modern feel that the other restaurants have. On a side note, be sure to check out the bathrooms, there are several in which to chose and each has its own theme. To get things moving along at Liberty you stand in line and place your order at the counter, then they give you a number to place on the table and when your order is ready they bring it out to you. There are quite a few places to sit including a large patio, main indoor dining room and a long bar overlooking the wood-burning oven. This is the place to be if you love to see your dinner being made before your eyes, its up close and very personal.\n\nDepending on what time of day you go the menu has its bases covered. From the coffee bar to a fun and interesting breakfast menu as well as the main menu, you might be hard pressed to just order one thing. The main menu is comprised of sandwiches, pizza's, salads and cold case offerings such a fresh hummus and potato salad. You may also be happy to know that they serve beer and wine to compliment your dinner choices, priced so well that you may want to try more than one if you're not driving.  Be sure to take a look at the wall of kitschy gift items like bear shaped salt and peppershakers and Party Snaps. Who didn't play with those when they were a kid?\n\nBeing all about fresh and local we started with the Antipasto ($11), which was large enough to share between 4 big eaters. A large serving platter covered in Molinari and Sons cured meats, roasted Brussels sprouts, baby carrots, olives and slices of artisanal cheese were a delight. The grilled bread that came with the platter was a nice compliment to the deliciously salty cured meats. Instead of ordering the Caprese Salad ($8) we opted for the Caprese Sandwich ($7), which even came with a cold case side dish. The corn, tomato + bean side was a bounty of freshness from the crunchy corn to the smooth toothsome Navy beans. This was a real compliment to the wonderful flavors of the mozzarella, sliced tomato, fresh basil and balsamic on the sandwich. The Liberty Joe ($7) is a take on the classic Sloppy Joe enjoyed by millions of kids over the years. Tender ground beef in a rich and hearty tomato sauce a top a toasted bun, lots of love for this one. Mac and cheese was the only side that could have been chosen for this one, kid heaven!\n\nThe pizza's are all hand tossed and baked in a beautiful Renato wood-burning oven. The pizza crusts that come from this oven are lightly crisp, slightly charred and simply scrumptious! Starting with the White ($11) this one is not to be missed! If the combination of cream sauce and smoked mozzarella wasn't enough, wait till you taste the chopped bacon and tender pieces of chicken, oolala! Another sure fire hit was the Grilled Sausage ($10) covered in stringy mozzarella, roasted onions and tomato sauce. While the Molinari ($11) sounded great, the cooking of sliced cured meats makes them way to salty and intense for my taste, gamey.\n\nDesserts vary from day to day, so on our visit we had the pleasure of a slab of Red Velvet Cake ($5). If you've never had red velvet, please do. Moist chocolate cake covered in thick frosting of cream cheese delight. If you're in the mood for something a little different, order the Bread Pudding ($5). This was probably the lightest bread pudding I've ever had, which was more like French toast pillows swimming in a sea of creamy love.\n\nLoad up the car with friends and go ahead, make the trip to Gilbert and see what you had no idea existed.", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-03-06", "type": "review"}

The second thing was its stand-in-line order process.  I completely agree with Gabi M, as having to wait until you reach the cashier to ask questions regarding the menu is quite annoying for us, and for the patrons waiting behind us.\n\nMy wife was going to order the Rancher Salad, as it came with  grilled steak and caramelized onions.  Interesting note: the menu doesn't mention that the steak comes pre-grilled, served cold.  Good thing we asked.  Cold meat didn't sound that appetizing, so she deferred to the Liberty Bowl + Pasta.\n\nI was going to order the Salmon Plate but become enamored with the wood fired pizza oven, and went with a Margherita pie.  Good thing!  The salmon comes cured and served cold (the online menu didnt mention that, but the store menu did).  I also ordered a cup of caprese pasta salad.\n\nWhile we waited near a boisterous table, we noticed how loud it can get inside, as it echos.\n\nMy cavatappi pasta in my caprese pasta salad was fairly dry, although it did come with grape tomatoes and tiny balls of fresh Mozzarella cheese which were good.  I wouldn't order it again though.\n\nThe cavatappi pasta also made an appearance in my wife's Liberty Bowl entree.  I would have opted for a penne or spaghetti or linguine, but am sure its much easier on the kitchen to have to prepare one pasta type.  I liked the sauce, but found the meatball to be almost chalky, but definitely crumbly, with a taste reminiscent of Chef Boyardee meat nads.  My wife didn't want to eat them.  I smooshed one on my plate and photographed it for your viewing pleasure.\n\nThe saving grace was their wood fired pizza.  The crust was fantastic.  Thin but not cracker crisp.  It was crisp on the outside, but soft inside, with a great taste.  I highly recommend this menu item.  They used a fresh crushed tomato sauce, which was spot-on.  I commend them for this, as they could have opted for the easy way out, using the Liberty Bowl maranara sauce.\n\nTheir dessert case did not contain many appealing offerings.  Most of them just looked dry.  For example, refer to my photos of the brownies and cinnamon rolls.  I agree with my wife.  If you are going to display something in a case for all to see, make sure its fresh and remains visually appealing.  If you're unable to accomplish this, why have a dessert case?

If it weren't for the fact that I was on my way to join some friends at their house to watch the Super Bowl, I would've stayed here longer!  (My first, and so far only, visit lasted three hours.)  Liberty Market reminded me of Scottsdale's The Kitchen, but geared more towards the younger crowd- college, young upstarts, thirty-somethings (who here miss that show?), and the young-at-heart.  Loved the whimsically retro mini \"giftshop.\"  I would later on come to find that the restrooms here are reasons enough (five, to be more precise) for a visit!  Maybe it's just me, but it's the quirky touches such as these that make destinations like Liberty Market and brother company Joe's Farm Grill stand out from the pack.  (Although I must admit enjoying LM's restrooms MUCH better than JFG's (check out my review!).\n\nSo, what did I eat??  Only one of the tastiest white pizza and farmer's salad I've ever had.  The thin-crust pizza wasn't as crispy as I'd like (I'm very finicky), but this pizza was bursting w/ so many flavors!  With grilled chicken, crunchy and chopped thick-cut bacon, parmesan cream sauce, smoky mozzarella, peppery arugula, and pine nuts, how could it not?? Can you believe I ate the entire thing??  Well, OK- I did shave off half of the crust (the soggy center), but nary a chicken chunk, lean bacon (I trimmed off the fatty layers, which there weren't much to begin w/, as these chopped pieces were grilled crisp-to-perfection!), nor arugula leaf escaped my ever-vigilant fingers!  And what about the farmer's salad?  (BTW, you may find its recipe on the walls of one of the themed restrooms.)  It, too, was quite scrumptious, if a bit too salty, and contained lightly-roasted vegetables, mixed greens, heavy on the palatable sesame-crusted croutons, and a really great lemon vinaigrette.  I'd be hard-pressed not to order these again on my next visit, but I am determined to try other selections as they sound so appealing.\n\nLM's layout made it fun to look around and get a feel of the place and what it has to offer.

Simple, honest food that does not try to be the El Bulli of Gilbert. The E61 bar is the perfect place for chic writers who enjoy a french press and good conversation. Thank you Liberty Market for showing me that Gilbert does have its well rounded individuals. For those of you who walk on you're knuckles and have negative things to say about L.M there is a Ihop down the street.", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-03-27", "type": "review"}

I had the Maiden Lane (turkey, brie, red cabbage slaw, cranberry, and a horseradish aioli). I really liked the combo of the cranberry with horseradish. It definitely has a kick to it. I also had half of The Farmer (roasted veggies, grilled sweet potato, and goat cheese). Loved all the veggies! Note: make sure you like goat cheese because there's a generous amount (Another friend got it sans cheese and liked it a lot). I also had the sweet potato salad on the side - delicious!\n\nWe couldn't leave without trying dessert. We shared carrot cake (it was very gingery which I love) and had delicious frosting.

Two of those six visits we experienced, what i consider to be, poor service.\n\nOverall the food here is wonderful, the prices are higher than average, at least the quality of food lives up to the prices.\n\nThe fact that there are no waitresses helps keep the overall cost down.\n\nHOWEVER, regarding the 5.00 piece of Red Velvet Cake:\n\nMy wife and I visited at night for a slice of cake and coffee, it was wonderful.\n\nSo wonderful on our next visit, we ordered another piece of Red Velvet cake to go. Later that evening, upon diving into the cake, we noticed it was dry. We assumed it was cut from the end, resulting in dryness from the one exposed side.\n\nOn the next visit, we ordered a piece of Red Velvet cake and I noticed it was pre-cut and sitting in \"to go\" containers. The whole cake was there, but the slice they gave us was pre-cut.\n\nI also noticed the bottom layer of the cake was a different shade of red than the other two layers. I notified the hostess, told her of our previous experience, to which she replied \"well, sometimes when people take the cake home and refrigerate it they confuse the coldness for dryness\". She proceeded to fetch us two forks to \"test\" the cake. She put the forks on our table and walked off...NEVER TO RETURN. \n\nFirst, I never said we refrigerated the previous piece of cake, because we did not. Secondly, we know our way around cake. Thirdly, when considering a FIVE DOLLAR SLICE OF CAKE, if I ask for a fresh cut piece, I better get one! NO QUESTIONS ASKED. \n\nWe spent $30 for two entrees, one drink and one slice of cake. That's a lot of \"cake\" in order to receive a slice of cake with less than grocery store freshness.\n\nOur other previous negative experience was similar, we asked to substitute macaroni salad for potato chips (due to food allergy issues), they refused, saying they could charge us the $2 for the single scoop of macaroni salad, we refused.\n\nTo their credit, Joe (the owner) was there, he came by and asked us how our meal was, we told him of our experience. He immediately jumped behind the counter and fetched the macaroni salad.\n\nMoral of the story...in my book Premium Prices dictate Premium Service...Liberty Market has the premium price part down, better than average on the premium food part...HOWEVER, on the premium service part...they fail, over and over again.", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-03-15", "type": "review"}

It was the original market in Gilbert and was renovated into a classy, urban restaurant and coffee bar. I have not had the opportunity to sample all of the fare on the menu, but everything I have tried has been no less than superb. \n\nFor breakfast I highly recommend the Breakfast Quesadilla or the Sicilian Scramble. The griddled bread pudding is a tasty treat, but be prepared to stuff yourself beyond belief (maybe make a stop at the Freestone Rec Center for a post gluttony workout).\n\nThe E61 espresso bar is separate from the main dining order line, but you can order food while sitting at the bar (I recommend this option). The espresso drinks are crafted very well and with a great attention to detail. In fact, I have had a barista re-make my drink (without my request) because he was not pleased with the crema on my americano. \n\nThe only downside is it can be noisy and crowded on the weekends, and parking is a bit of an issue. However there is ample parking behind the water tower park, its just not in close proximity. You might need the extra exercise though :)\n\nJoe Johnston has been a great ambassador to Gilbert and I am and always will be a huge fan of his business endeavors.

It was different from the typical pizza because it tasted like lasagna! My other friend ordered the Italian sandwich. The taste was not as great as it sounded. It ran a little bland. \n\nFor dessert, my friend ordered the bread pudding. It was a bit drier than all of the other bread puddings I've tried at other restaurants. The cream on this was very delicious and covered in cinnamon and nutmeg. I'd really recommend this dessert.\n\nOverall, great place to go with friends to sit, chat, and catch up with life.

So I yelped it to see what people were saying. We returned for dinner and studied the menu, but ate like it was lunch time (?). We ordered 2 of their \"Italia\" panini sandwiches (their sandwiches come with a cold side). The paninis were amazing (fresh, and not thrown together), and the side of tomato-cucumber salad I enjoyed was tasty. They have a nice assortment of local beers as well, which is always a plus. Service was great. I think we'll try it out for lunch next time.", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-05-03", "type": "review"}
