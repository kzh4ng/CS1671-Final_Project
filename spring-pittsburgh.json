I happen to have a project in the Pittsburgh area and was looking for a Hibachi place to take my co-workers. I read several reviews on other Hibachi places and they all sound the same. The typical they are so busy the service sucks and they rush you in and out to turn tables quickly.  I found Sapporo and was very pleased! It is in an odd location but once you step inside, you feel the ambiance of cozy and family style. My party felt the staff was very friendly.\n\nI had ordered the filet and shrimp with fried rice. The others in my group ordered chicken broccoli, and the Sapporo Deluxe which consists of lobster, filet and shrimp. We all got started with the soup and salads, which was a pretty good size. I didn't want to finish it all because I wanted to save room for dinner. Our Chef was one of the most personable Chef's I have encountered. He was very talkative and really wanted to get to know us. My file was delicious and the fried rice was excellent. They make their fried rice from scratch. It's not prepared ahead of time like I see at most Hibachi places. I can definitely tell the difference. My friend Sam who ordered the chicken broccoli could not stop raving about the sauce that they used. It is unlike soy sauce or teriyaki sauce. We asked the Chef about the sauce and sure enough it is one of a kind. Dan, who ordered the Sapporo Deluxe was very pleased with his meal and couldn't even finish it. Actually we all needed to-go boxes. The portion amount here is incredible. You definitely get your money's worth here!!\n\nI would highly recommend this place to Hibachi lovers because this place is surely a secret in Pittsburgh. I can not stress how different this place is compared to other Hibachi places. I think this restaurant is family owned and not a chain which I can always appreciate. \n\nThank you Sapporo for a great Hibachi experience!!

First, I'll walk you through my experience. \n This place is pretty large, and relatively clean, with a nice parking lot.  The racks are packed with clothes - and I mean, hard to move the hangers because there is so much stock, which can be a pro or a con depending on how you like it.  I found it a bit cumbersome since although the clothes are organized by type (dress vs. blouse) there is NO size separation.  In a place this huge, it takes quite a long time to find what you're looking for without the size separation.  But, I'm not one to abandon a bargain because I don't want to look around (after all, that is what its all about), so I gave a good 30 min-45 and got a handful of garments to try on.  (I would typically spend a few hours, but I was trying to spare a friend not as keen on secondhand garments).  With my carefully extracted finds I searched in vain for a fitting room, never to find one.  After asking the staff where it was, I had to take a seat and leave my jaw dropped for a while because THERE IS NO FITTING ROOM! \nI couldn't take this fact into my brain, and although there were some household items I wanted to go back and buy, I was too upset to continue.  (Sidenote: yes, I can understand how this can work for the RWB, but imho it is unforgivable, and I wish there was at least some warning before spending my time searching for a bargain when I couldn't even see if it would fit). \n\nI would recommend this store if you are looking for something specific secondhand especially for dishes, or older electronics, or even beauty products.  There was even a used Nikon SLR with a wide angle lens ($200 though)!  \nBut if you plan on buying a sundress, and don't plan on stripping down in front of your fellow thrifties, you'd better be confident in your purchase.

Here's my rant, a friend and I stopped in one day after high school. I was a senior at a catholic private school at the time so I was required to wear a fancy uniform so I looked highly presentable. I picked a shirt up I was thinking of getting and held it as we browsed through the store. They announced they were closing and I was across the store from where I got the shirt. Deciding not to get it, I placed it on a near by shelf. My friend checked out, and as we were walking out of the store a  woman that worked there said to me \"where is the shirt you were holding\". I told her I had placed it on the self in the back, and said sorry for not putting it back. She said \" I walked back there and didn't see it, so where is it\" and clearly implied that i stole it.  I told her again that it was on the shelf as nice as I could and she then told me that she didn't believe me and told me to go back there and get it or else she was going to search me. Now I get that it doesn't matter that the shirt was 50 cents because stealing is still wrong but because I didn't steal it and told her so I feel Im justified in being furious that I was publicly humiliated and falsely accused over 50 cents. I walked to the back of the store picked it up and started walking back and then the lady said in a grossly rude tone \" well I didn't see it back there\" no apology, no nothing. I handed it to her and walked out. I've never been there since. I was so angry I forgot to get her name tag so I could complain to the manager.

Nicole, our waitress, proved her weight in gold when she reassured me that gorgonzola would be a good cheese to accompany the bacon on the burger.

I was hoping for an oil & vinegar blend to have with the bread, but the spread served as a surprisingly tasty alternative. My partner's ravioli looked delicious, and he let me try one of his meatballs, which I found to have that \"homemade\" flavor that's difficult to find at many restaurants.

The prices aren't the cheapest, but for what it is Pino's delivers small plates and dinners that are satisfying without breaking the bank. The lamb bolognese is one of my personal favorites, as well as pretty much any of the appetizers. I also love the creative cocktail list and the half price bottles of wine for happy hour. There are few places in Pittsburgh that can get me as excited about cocktails as Pino's. My roommate and I have come here with friends and sat at the bar for hours eating and drinking a variety of delightful things. In short, they do drinks and food quite well for the price. \n\nThe reason Pino's only gets three stars is the unfortunate inconsistency with service I've encountered. I get treated differently depending on who I come in with, and that's unprofessional. If I'm with my roommate and one of my friends (both of whom work nearby) we all get seated quickly and treated extremely well. In short, it feels like my presence is valued. When I've come to Pino's with people who aren't in with the owners though, I've had a thoroughly lackluster experience. Once I came on my birthday with my boyfriend and frankly was let down. We waited awkwardly for a very long time to be seated even though there were empty tables and in general had a very impersonal experience. I felt embarrassed having spoken so highly of Pino's to him beforehand. I know I'll be back for the occasional happy hour or small dinner, but Pino's isn't somewhere I would take anyone I wanted to impress due to the problematic service.", "business_id": "ZL6DNzyenFm9Kpz6uADlNg", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-03-10", "type": "review"}

This, I must add, was in opposition to his mother's strong protests to the effect of, \"There's nothing *in* Pittsburgh, why would anyone go there?\" \n\nTazza D'oro is the answer to that question. Especially if you like coffee. This is easily one of the best coffee shops east of the Mississippi, and I've been to a lot of them. So, what's so good about it?\n\nLet's go in order of importance:\n\nCoffee - It is really, really good. They use Batdorf and Bronson beans, where an ex-gf of mine used to work in Olympia. Believe me when I tell you that B&B is good. It's not amazingly great, but it's very solid and they take roasting seriously. When I go to a new coffee place I suspect might be good I always get a latte. Why? This one has a high upside if done well and the lowest downside (lots of milk) if done poorly. I got a latte. They have a few sizes, 12oz was the first one I got. It was fantastic. They did a nice little rosetta in it too (look up latte art on google if you have no idea what this is). The baristo really knew what he was doing and pulled a some good shots with excellent crema. \n\nThe coffee was so good (coffee is supposed to taste bold, smooth and rich, which it almost never does and this place had it down) I had to go back for an 8oz, which is another level of trust. It has the same amount of coffee but less milk to hide poor coffee quality. It was always superior. \n\nThis is a coffee place that is truly top notch based on the coffee alone, but there was more. \n\nPastries - They all looked amazing. I had a plain donut while I waited in line. Normally I don't eat plain donuts, because life is too short for plain donuts, but it was really, very good. Everyone was commenting on how nice the pastries were.\n\nAtmosphere - This place has it exactly right. It's a mom & pop feel, nothing forced. Some tables, outdoor seating, maybe some local art, but not in a goofy sort of way. Very friendly employees. Just a complete home run. \n\nObviously I loved it. Behind me in line for my re-up, I heard a girl behind me in line complain, \"we could just go to Starbucks, it's cheaper!\" then proceeded to order with sugar free syrups and skim milk. That's fine. Everyone has to do what they like... and with the proliferation of bad coffee (Starbucks only being guilty of mediocre, though a little bit interesting coffee) over the past 10 years, I don't blame people for being set that way. But the beautiful thing about Tazza D'Oro (cup of gold in Italian) is that--if you let it--it will remind you that you don't need to make your coffee up like a drag queen on Halloween.\n\nTazza D'Oro stands as a reminder that coffee can be enjoyed in all its naked glory in an awesome setting on a beautiful street and give you a good f'ing reason to go to Pittsburgh.", "business_id": "83_p9vIqOq1TUIf3_GD7bA", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-05-26", "type": "review"}

Given that, I consider it a testament to how absolutely wonderful Tazza D'oro is, because one sip of my friend's mocha and I was in silky, smooth heaven. I ordered the hot chocolate, which was every bit as rich and creamy as a hot chocolate should be. \n\nOn to the food - don't come here if you expect a wide selection of bites to pair with your drink. They only had a few options, but from what I could tell, each one was crafted with love, skill, and just the right amount of sugar. I had a fruit tart (berries and strawberries), which was a delightful combination of tangy and sweet. My friend had a very satisfying chocolate croissant - but to be fair, it's difficult to make a chocolate croissant anything but. I was so impressed that I took home an apple puff pastry and vowed to return posthaste. \n\nThis is precisely the sort of place in which Elizabeth Bennet would while away a dreary day, were coffee shops accessible in rural, Georgian England. I wouldn't suggest coming with a large group; neither the limited seating nor the ambience is conducive to that.

Just a fine sports bar - no more, no less.\n\nI'll start with the drinks.  They have a good draft selection, and supposedly they've got a nice bottle list too, though I didn't have a look at it, so I can't judge; and the Happy Hour special compliments it well ($1 off all drinks 5PM-7PM).   Plus they have East End drafts at $3/glass all the time, though they were out of Big Hop (the only East End choice they have) when I was there (I don't know if this is a regular occurrence, but if it is, they better do something about it).  The bartenders were friendly and quick to serve, qualities that carried over to the food service as well.\n\nThe menu has a pretty good selection of pub-y and Southwestern-themed foods from which I picked the black bean and corn quesadilla.  Although at the end I was running low on guacamole (which is $1 extra for a small cup) and sour cream, this is a small quibble.  The meal overall  was good, and since I got it with the happy hour special, I can't complain.  One thing I will mention is that there aren't too many vegetarian choices on the menu (I'm not vegetarian, but I try not to eat too much meat, so I notice these things), so if you're a vegetarian, I would try to look up the menu beforehand just to be sure there's something for you.\n\nI know I haven't said much negative about Buffalo Blues in this review, yet I'm still giving it only three stars.  This is the kind of place that makes me appreciate the \"word versions\" of the ratings that Yelp gives us.  \"A-OK,\" which, if you didn't know, is how Yelp describes three-star reviews, is exactly how I would describe Buffalo Blues.  The comparison I keep going to in my head is Die Hard 2.  It's not nearly as good as its predecessor, but it's still something I'm fine with popping in every once in a while when there's nothing better to watch.\n\nTo sum it up - I'm not a big sports guy.  Buffalo Blues, though it is a sports bar, is not the place that would sway me to go to watch a game there with my friends (I'll still say that some kind of playoff game of the Steelers-Ravens I watched at Big Jim's was one of the best sports-watching experiences of my life).  And, judging it as a sports bar, it didn't do anything to justify my giving it anything but \"just fine.\"  But I'm sure I'll go back there for happy hour again sometime.", "business_id": "Ts4xsKPU7FNPPZRj-nRjIg", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-04-03", "type": "review"}

It really is a Pittsburgh staple but come on....\n\nFood is really, really average. I love the ribs and wings, but it's about the same as any other rib place in the city, only they charge an arm and a leg for it. This place is for the people that feel that they are at a real rib place, but don't want to cross Centre or Penn Ave. to get real ribs. It, technically is in Shadyside so your Mercedes will be safe! \n\nThe ambiance: The restaurant is always crowded. Not just crowded, but packed with teens underage drinking, families with too many kids that overflow to your \"space\" and collage kids who also spill over from the bar. IT'S LOUD AS HELL!!! Forget about a nice quiet dinner. There seems to be no consideration for customers at all. Last time I was there, there was a St. Patrick's Day party (it was NOT St. Patrick's Day) that took over the whole place. Though the staff tried (nah, they didn't really try) to keep them in the so called \"party room\" I was bumped into several times, spilled my beer, and couldn't hear my wife speak. But as long as they got their money; they could give a crap. Oh and there are like 100 TVs to interrupt any conversation at your table.\n\nWant to sit in the bar area? Good luck. You will see a mix of drunk people, women who look like high-end prostitutes and college kids who are only missing a beer bong. Also IT'S LOUD AS HELL!!!!!!!!\n\nThe \"wonderful\" Staff: It seems like it's everyone's first day. To put it lightly; the staff suck! To be sure, you will be waiting for your your drinks, food and bill for a very, very long time. Expect to be there for about 2-3 hours. The wait staff are forgetful, inattentive and very sloppy at their job. It pains me to leave any tip for them. Most of the staff are hot, stacked, absolutely stupid and should be working at Hooters not a place where your bill will be upwards of $50 for two people. Be prepared to be met with this saying, \"Oh, like ohmygod, I am so sorry i forgot that, he he!\" (oh she's twisting her finger in her hair while she's talking). You will get bad service...period (in fact, I can't remember the last time a wait person actually wrote down my order, and they're idiots so no worries).\n\nThe food: Kinda good. Menu is huge, you'll find something you like. But I go there about 2-3 times a year for the food. It is way too expensive. Do not take a date there. Your average bill for a meal with actual proteins will run you in the high 40s without booze. There are so many bar-food places that don't claim to be high class that are just as good as this place. I grew up with the rib sauce and love it, but for your average consumer, skip it!\n\nThis place is a wannabe sports bar that tries too hard to be high end.

The customer service experiences I've had here have actually been mostly positive. Over the last several months, I've been going paint crazy in our house, so I'm pretty much on a first name basis with the guys at the Home Depot paint counter (it's kind of embarrassing that I'm there so much to the point where they know me, but whatever). Anyway, Jamaal and the rest of the paint department staff have always been very helpful, giving me tips and advice on paint color, type, tools, etc. They're patient with me when I request tons of paint samples (and I know how super annoying that is). Dare I even say that I look forward to getting my paint here?! \n\nAs another example, we get our Christmas tree at Home Depot every year, and we've always been very pleased with how nice the staff has been in helping us tie it to our car. And just the other day my husband and I were in the plumbing aisle sizing up tools to help us unclog a drain, and an employee walked up to us and asked us if he could help. So nice. In fact, I can only recall one less-than-positive experience here, and it was when an employee mis-cut some wood for us (which we didn't know until we got it home and it wouldn't fit in our subfloor). So I guess the service hasn't been 100% perfect every time I've been here, but for a big box home improvement store, I've been very pleased overall. \n\nI do hate the parking lot though. Every time we go here, we pretty much count on the fact that someone will almost hit us, either while we're driving or walking into the store. Also, we have a compact car, but yet it seems like we barely fit in the parking spaces.

This year, I celebrated by doing a make-it-now at the Glass Center with CM.  This event was held the evening of the day before Valentine's Day (2/13, a Fri.).  I'd been to the Glass Center in fall 2013 to observe an exhibition during RADical days, and had been meaning to try out a make-it-now, so this event provided the perfect opportunity to try my hand at glass craftsmanship as a novice.\n\nFor the V-Day event, you could choose between three items to make: a glass flower, a heart pendant, and a glass tile.  CM and I chose to make a glass flower, so upon checking into the glass center, we were told to go upstairs and check in at the hot shop.  Upon doing so, there was a 15-20 min. wait, given that many other couples were scheduled to do the activity at around the same time.  We passed the time by helping ourselves to some of the snacks that the Glass Center thoughtfully provided for participants.\n\nWhen we were called, we worked with an instructor from the Glass Center (I forget his name) to make our flower.  He first demonstrated the steps involved in the process, explaining each of them in turn.  We then chose the colors and design of our flower, and proceeded to work with our instructor to carry out each of the steps.  He was very patient and helpful throughout the whole process, despite our characteristic clumsiness!  Despite the amount of people and molten glass in the studio, crafting our flower was a breeze and a lot of fun, thanks to his guidance!\n\nAfter making our flower, we had to rush across the street because we had reservations for dinner at Verde.  After finishing dinner, we returned and observed the other make-it-now activities--the pendant in particular was fun to watch.  After they wrapped up, we went to the gallery to check out the glass art exhibit, which featured an arts program in Wilkinsburg.  We were even able to participate in it by adding to a mosaic that would be displayed at the program.  Finally, we checked out some of the glass art on exhibit by artists using the Glass Center in the foyer.\n\nOverall, we had an amazing time making our flower at the Glass Center during the V-Day make-it-now, and strongly recommend it as a unique V-Day activity.  The price was reasonable ($35), the activity was fun, and the staff was friendly.  The only drawbacks were: (1) it was crowded, due to the popularity of the event, and (2) you have to wait three days to pick up your item so that it can cool properly. Obviously, however, there's not much the Glass Center can do about them, so I'm awarding 5 stars for one of the most unique and fun venues and activities in PGH!", "business_id": "riqqVx-LssGUErBeQisKng", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-03-14", "type": "review"}

I've been brushed on the leg and knee multiple times by cut-throat drivers in that parking lot.

Not so long ago, I was forking out hundreds of dollars a month in prescription medications because my diet was HORRIBLE.  Since making the decision over two years ago to be more active and eat solely organic and Non-GMO, I'm off all of my medications, and the price of organic food is NOTHING compared to medications and prescriptions.  I'm actually saving money.  And No, I don't even make $20K a year - so it's all about choices.  I'm not \"rich\" at all, like most people assume, since I regularly shop there.  In fact, I'm usually dead broke.  But to me, eating whole and healthy and protecting my body is not a luxury, it's a necessity.\nI also like that there is no pharmacy in Whole Foods.  That should say something.\nMy love for Whole Foods resides in the Organic Salad Bar, and Prepared Foods section.  Their salad bar is so fresh and so delicious, that eating salads anywhere else becomes TASTELESS.  Organic makes all the difference.\nMy favorite Prepared Foods is their Vegan General Tso's \"chicken\".  Little popcorn nuggets of Seitan, drenched in the best General Tso's sauce I've ever tasted, with steamed broccoli.  Molly's Sesame Noodles on the salad bar is our favorite side dish to this prepared foods treat.  I swear we eat it at least once a week.\nWe also love their Bulk Section where we can get bulk quinoa, granola, lentils, and all kinds of things for a really decent price.  \nThe secret to shopping at Whole Foods?   BUY WHAT YOU NEED TO EAT THAT DAY.  It's not smart to bulk shop organic produce, because it goes bad faster.  Buy what you KNOW you're going to eat.  You won't see 10/$10 deals, because the food isn't crap, and you're not supposed to stockpile fresh foods.  You're supposed to eat it when it's fresh.  And buy your dry stock at Trader Joe's or the East End Food Co-Op.\nI love Whole Foods.

It took him the better part of 20 minutes to fillet a f-ing fish! All I got was a chopped up piece of crap that was useless. And scoffing is what these people are good at.

I must say that after my experience today, I'm thinking that the reviews here are far from hyperbolic. \n\nI was scheduled to see two units today - one on Walnut and one on S. Negley. When my boyfriend and I arrived at the first place, the building manager, Paul informed us that we could just look at the unit on Walnut Street because, \"They are identical apartments...Same builder and everything, but if you want to fight against traffic this time of day, we can.\" First of all Paul, the floor plan may be the same, but no two units are alike. The kitchen may have been updated in one or maybe the bathroom tile was different, the building may smell different and maybe a potential tenant wants to see the view out the window. Secondly, if we're going to potentially sign a lease to pay almost $1,400 per month, we'd at least like to see the actual unit we'd be living in. In addition to that, the other apartment was only three blocks from this building. We felt that the 8 minute walk would not be that terrible of an inconvenience (for us anyway, but then again Paul seemed to be in a hurry.) \n\nAnyway, we got to the first place and Paul let us in. Rather than engage us or talk to us about the apartment, he just stood there in the living room with his arms crossed and left us to wander through the apartment on our own. He didn't offer any information and answered our questions with one or two word answers. Seriously, if he's that rude now, what's he going to be like when the lease gets signed? Strike one.\n \nAfter we left the building on Walnut, the boyfriend and I walked down to S. Negley and met Paul there. He let us in and led us upstairs where he actually let a door slam right in my face. What a nice guy! And so gentlemanly! Strike Two. When we got to the second apartment, we were wandering around when I noticed a gigantic water mark with bubbling paint and all in the corner of the ceiling in one of the bedrooms with a lovely black stain that I can only assume is mold. The current tenant informed me that the roof leaked. Noooooow I know why Paul didn't want us looking at the second unit! Strike three. Kamin's out. We just turned around and walked out at that point. \n\n\nI do have to say though that Paul did us a favor by being so incredibly rude, unprofessional and overall kind of a tool. Heck maybe he hates working for Kamin and this is his way of \"sticking it to the man.\" If it weren't for him, we may have believed whatever BS story a *good* salesman would have given us about how they're fixing the roof or whatnot and we may have actually bought the story and been miserable for a year. How lucky for us that Kamin has such a \"pleasant\" guy dealing with the public. It's sad though because overall the apartments would be very desirable if it weren't for Paul and the obviously leaking roof.

Our server made it seem that everything she was doing was somebody else's job, in fact, it was mostly other people who delivered, which made it confusing in terms of knowing who to ask for things and whether or not to factor some of the fine service into the tip that presumably goes mostly to the primary server who was sub-par for upscale dining; our question for the kitchen left unanswered, \"the host is supposed to do that but I will...\" Run on.

Casbah is a whopping .2 miles from home (that's at least a thousand feet!) so while its convenience and accepting of reservations reign high on my list of must-haves, the food left me slightly disappointed.  Considering the price point here, we've dropped a star level or so.\n\nI made reservations for brunch (definitely do this; the place was full when we arrived at noon) and strolled through the patio(?) area to the actual(?) restaurant.  That set up is strange itself; especially with no indication of where I'm headed.  We were quickly seated in close quarters with our other lovely brunch eating brethren.  Service was fine.  We're easy guests, and our waiter was more than tolerant with the +1 having not scoured the menu to make sure he would like something there like I had.  We both opted to go with the prix fixe; with most items hitting the halfway point, 28 bucks seemed great for including an appetizer and cocktail.\n\nMy bellini was done right.  Fancy style, making all the schnapps (ha! sorry).  The appetizer of granola with a lil' yogurt that seemed more like cream cheese fatty goodness than the very vanilla yoplait lite I typically let myself have; a sprinkling of berries hit the spot.  Sweet enough for me--maple-y and rich--and didn't even for a second seem like someone poured some Nature Valley in a bowl.  The +1 ordered the cinnamon killed polenta and couldn't get enough.. so I barely got any.\n\nOur entrees though are a different story.  +1 got the mushroom and goat omelet with his little roasted potatoes and his little sausage and his little toast and was all happy enough with it. I am not so easy, I guess.  The brioche French toast sounded great.  Caramelized pear! Sold!  I received, next to a large, meaty chicken sausage link, a few small pieces of fruit and one slice of French toast.  How is that a thing?  Maybe this is the husky child in me, but I was not expecting one slice.  Luckily with the prix fixe, there was no way I would have been able to eat more than one, but really.  If I had only ordered that at some double-digit menu price, I would not be a happy camper.\n\nOverall, really, it was fine.  The food was actually better than I make it sound; it just didn't hit the expectations everyone had set for me.  The hungry girl me will always require more than one slice of sugar bread.

They didn't treat us like second rate citizens even though we were in casual clothes and I was carrying my backpack (typical student outfit).\n\nWe had the tuna tartare, which was lovely. Then, we tried the duck with gnocchi and spinach which was also delicious and a great blend of flavors. For dessert, we had the Chocolate Cheese Cake Bombe, which was just ok. It looked pretty, but the flavors weren't anything special. Oh, they also had really nice house made bread that came to our table warm, crusty and crunchy outside and soft inside.\n\nOverall, Casbah was a good experience, but I'm not drooling as I think back to the meal. I'm not sure I'll go back because there are other places to try and the price point makes it somewhere I wouldn't just go to on a normal day.", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-03-14", "type": "review"}

Because I had a phenomenal brunch here, and it totally restored my faith in not only Casbah, but Big Burrito. I can't lie, I love what the Big Burrito group does. I think all their restaurants are awesome, but Casbah was always my least favorite. Now, I feel it is on par with the others!\n\nI love a good prix fixe brunch, and for $28 you receive a cocktail, appetizer and entree. So I started off with a mimosa (always a good start!). Then I ordered the Tomato & Basil Bisque and parmesan crostini, which was excellent. I'm very judgmental of tomato bisque, as it is one of my favorite soups. \n\nThen came the main course. Braised Lamb & Eggs: braised Elysian Fields Farm lamb shoulder, spinach, poached local eggs, tarragon, grilled sourdough. I love lamb so hard. It's by far my favorite meat, but it has to be cooked with care. This definitely had flavor, was tender and paired perfectly with the spinach and eggs. \n\nI couldn't finish my meal, so they boxed it up. I separated the sourdough and the rest of the dish so the bread wouldn't get soggy, and our server gave it to me without the sourdough. I mentioned I did that on purpose and he immediately went back into the kitchen and got me fresh bread. How nice is that?\n\nNow I'm excited to try other meals here again!", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-03-18", "type": "review"}

It's 5 min walk from my home to Casbah and now we're finally here. The place looks really Greekish and I like the fake candle on the table :) Our waitress is really nice and friendly and seems to have a brightening personality, which is enjoyable. We ordered a bottle Project Paso and it goes perfectly well w the entree. For apps, we had sheep's milk gnudi. It is super tasty and I like the lobster and the lemon sauce together. We had the famous pork chop and the Long Island duck for entree. Both are really good. The duck has the fatty juicy leg separated from the thin nice part, which is really thoughtful and help boost the flavor. The pork is not bad either. But the texture of the meat is a little too dry for my liking. If not for the sauce and the braised kale, the dish would be disappointing. Then came out desserts: the vanilla bean creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and the chocolate de creme. Omg I can't even find a word to describe how good they are! The creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e is so much better than the one I had in Joseph Temberllini. I am totally blown away by the rich taste of vanilla and eggs. The chocolate de creme is perfect, too. The texture is between ice creme and fudge, really nice and smooth. My friend said that she could have another two of this.

I thought the duck itself was cooked well, but as I was eating it I had to constantly drink water to make up for the taste. There were a few measly pieces of gnocchi. There was no lavender flavor or kumquats. I would recommend getting something other than this dish if you do go. \n\nDrinks: We ordered a bottle of Riesling, which was good but nothing special. \n\nCost: The main dishes were all around $30-35. For the cost, I expected the flavor to wow me, but really I just need a lot of water to drink. \n\nAmbience: We sat in the part of the restaurant that was under a tent-like structure. It was a bit chilly, but they had the heated lights on. It is dark, so don't expect to take any good photos. \n\nOverall: Just okay.

As far as I know, gyros are supposed to be pretty meaty, but this was mostly lettuce with sporadic chunks of seitan and cucumber,along  with dreaded diced unripe tomato. The wrap was dry and upon looking at the menu again, I see that the sauce that it probably requires costs an extra $.50. The tortilla itself was very white and seemingly unnatural compared to those found at most veggie establishments. My beverage was good and affordable--ginger lemonade. It was sweet for my tastes, but I am sure most people would have thought it perfect. I'll keep Quiet Storm in mind as a coffee shop, only.\n\nF.Y.I after splitting the cost of the appetizer with a friend, my lunch cost me $17--ouch!

When at a veggie place, I usually try to change it up each time I go to keep my diet varied.

Different dishes require tofu to be cooked for different lengths of time and it different sauces, and it has always tasted bizarre when I get it there.

If you're going to serve vegetarian food, don't try to pretend it's anything else.\n\nThat grievance having been aired, I ordered the Blackadilla, a quesadilla boasting no false meat items, but stuffed with black beans, basmati rice, sweet potatoes, pineapple and cheddar cheese. It was delicious and filling, and at $8 for the enormous quesadilla and a small house salad, a pretty good deal. \n\nThe menu at Quiet Storm is large, with breakfast and lunch/dinner items as well as an array of cafe drinks and desserts. In spite of the prevalence of seitan and tofu, there are a number of dishes that I look forward to sampling upon return.\n\nAnd I do plan to return. As those of you who have read my other Yelp reviews know, the atmosphere of public places is very important to me, and the atmosphere at Quiet Storm does not disappoint. It's got a retro cool '50s diner vibe and a more modern but equally cool soundtrack that entices customers to stick around. The wait staff encourages this practice, giving diners plenty of space to hang out long after they've finished eating.\n\nThe one downside of Quiet Storm is its location, floating among gas stations and abandoned houses in Garfield, an area sandwiched between the more pedestrian friendly neighborhoods of Bloomfield and East Liberty, but not quickly accessible from either. It has to be a pre-determined destination rather than a drop in for random passersby.

Also they don't really wash their cups. There are 2 sink basins at the front where they just dunk the cups in one soapy basin then dunk the cups in a second water basin and then stack them next to the sink. It made me not want to drink my water even though I was thirsty. Good idea, but poorly executed food. I've had good vegan and vegetarian food before that's consisted of a lot of fresh greens, avocados, and more. For a vegetarian place, there was nothing green on our plates. This experience sadly fell enormously short of our expectations...

I have the excitement of the little girl on Despicable Me \"It's So FLUFFYYYY!\" \n\nMy excitement aside, the menu was pretty large for all veg food. They have breakfast all day, which is always ok with me. Prices were average (~8.50), and portions were large enough to provide lunch for the next day. (Although I have heard that the Cuban Sandwich is on the small side).\n\nI had the Banh Mi, which was fabulous. The bread was fresh, aioli was nice, vegs were pickled just right, but the tofu was a little on the dry side (on next day lunch reheat it was perfect). I was surprised by the veg seisage. It was really good. \n\nGazpacho was nice, although I am not really a fan of cold soup. It reminded me of a smoother salsa. Good, but just not my thing.\n\nSarah S. had the special, home fries with chili and cheese.  This was on the spicy side (a good thing) and came with tortilla chips.

Folks working were vegan-hipster quirky, but friendly and helpful.  We ended up waiting about 30 minutes for our food, so we decided to partake in an afternoon coffee to pass the time.  I  had an iced Morroccan latt\u00e9 with cardamom and rose,  husband the Mandorla sweet almond milk latt\u00e9.  Both were excellent.\n\nFor my meal I picked the Tahini Bowl with brown rice, spinach, roasted red pepper, tomatoes, pepitas and fried tofu cutlet with a tahini dressing.  I wished there had been less rice and more dressing; the bowl was also screaming for more seasoning.  Husband opted for the Crunch Wrap Extreme: scrambled tofu tossed with celery, carrots, edamame, kale and spinach, dressed with vegan wasabi mayo.  Again, twice as much dressing would have added flavor and moisture to an otherwise fine wrap.\n\nAnd that's just it: the food at Quiet Storm is fine.

The buildings surrounding Quiet Storm are often painted with cute art or have little interesting things about them. I love this neighborhood, but I love Quiet Storm even more! \n\nI've only been here twice, and I always want to go more often but somehow it doesn't happen. I've turned on three of my friends to Quiet Storm too, and they love it just as much. The first time I visited I ordered a tofu hash. It was an amazing blend of seasonal vegetables, including some I would never eat otherwise. The tofu was nice and firm, the seisage was spicy and perfectly chewy. The vegan \"cheese\" sauce was also rich and delicious.  The portion was so huge, I couldn't finish it. Leftovers are rarely as good as when the meal is fresh, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that my leftovers were even BETTER than the fresh meal. I think this is because the spices and vegetables had more time to meld together in a perfect veggie harmony. \n\nThe second time I visited was 4/21/2013. A group of my friends came here for Brunch. Two of us ordered the Vegan Country Burrito, another friend ordered the french toast with pistachio honey topping and my other friend ordered a tofu hash with black beans and salsa. Everything was generously portioned, but some meal choices were sold out. They were a bit disappointed that there was no more falafel. All of us devoured our plates and happily chattered about the complexity of flavor, protein content in vegan food items and how much we loved the atmosphere. \n\nQuiet Storm is a great little place to visit. It's never lacking in interesting things to look at while you eat. Food comes as quickly as possible. There are plenty of options to please everyone, and if you think you don't like vegetables, try one of their plates and you may change your mind. (Seriously, I am one of those vegans who hates veggies, but Quiet Storm food can get me to finish all of mine) \n\nTip: If you want to go for Sunday brunch, go early so your favorites will still be available. \n\nYou may also want to nudge the servers a little more than you usually would, because even though our drinks were bottomless, it was a pain to get them back to give us refills - even for water.", "business_id": "PzG0XmAmtXFs6Fdnubf41g", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-04-22", "type": "review"}

If not, bags and containers are available. All different types of vegan (as well as some non-vegan) canned goods, soymilks, vegan cheeses, and meat substitutes are available. There is so much crammed into the place sometimes its hard to find what you need, but staff is very friendly and are always there to help. It doesn't have the glitz and glam of Whole Foods but the prices are a little better. If you become a member, once a month you can purchase items at a pretty good discount.", "business_id": "-iVcmhjfq79QoTWzrb6pKg", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-04-03", "type": "review"}

They also served some impeccable cornbread as well. The first app was a pastry sort of thing covered in goat cheese, that was worthy of plate licking, had it been socially acceptable. The second was a batch of clams in a fragrant tomato sauce (the sauce also went well on the goat cheese pastry). Most of the time when I order clams, they are far too fishy, but these were perfect.\n\nThe lady friend ordered the special, a quail dish, while I ordered lamb osobuco. The portions were very generous, and you could easily see the care and prep that went into each individual dish. I must say, the quail was divine. I ended up super jealous and contemplated tricking the gf to turn around so I could switch plates while she was distracted. It was a mixture of sweet and layered with spices, the meat juicy and rich. \n\nThe lamb was textured and cooked very well, however it seemed to lack a distinctive flavor to bring out the qualities of the meat itself.

Parking in the residential area in which the restaurant is located is next to impossible on a busy Saturday night; the diner should be prepared to walk a distance to get to the restaurant from where he or she is ultimately able to park.  The greatest drawback is that the restaurant is tiny and the seating so tight that at our table, it was necessary to sit uncomfortably in order to avoid being bumped by anyone that walked by, which happened repeatedly as we were in a busy thoroughfare of food delivery.  No other table offered a much better situation and all others were occupied at the busy time we arrived, 6:45 p. m. The online menu boasts of a daily vegetarian and vegan special entree, but there was no such entree on this night.  There was only one non-meat item on the small menu, ravioli.  Our gracious server, Ramon, said that the kitchen could prepare a couscous and vegetable dish if the vegetarian in our party wanted it, and that was what we did.  The restaurant permits customers to bring their own alcoholic beverages, a nice convenience and savings for the diner.  A small portion of bread was served with a tiny amount of rock-hard butter.  My mushroom and cheese soup was a large portion, served piping hot, which was great, but it was a puree with no distinct mushroom pieces.  I would not have been able to distinguish it as mushroom soup.  All of our entrees were attractively presented and were tasty, average size portions.  All were served with a small amount of good, fresh vegetables. It would be helpful if the menu offered some description of the following entree so that the diner with an interest in a chicken dish would not have to inquire about it of the server:  \"chicken maputo\nRoasted w/ piri piri & chocolate scented sauce\".  Does the average diner know what \"maputo\" and \"piri piri\" are? The lemon tart dessert was a small piece not suitable for sharing, served with two minute pieces of strawberries and a small dollop of whipped cream.  It was not flavorful or moist nor worth the calories.  The gracious owner, Tony Pais, stopped at our table for a moment to greet us, a nice touch, and there were quality checks by a manager and Ramon.  I noticed a number of prominent people from the community dining here, individuals whom I was surprised were willing to spend a good deal of money to be packed into a sardine can of a restaurant.  Apparently they consider this to be the only restaurant in town.  The rest rooms are small, one-person facilities, naturally. An unfortunate surprise occurred when the individual that was picking up the check for my party presented his credit card only to be told that the restaurant accepts only cash and checks, this for a tariff of $148 plus gratuity.  It is supposed to be of some consolation that there is an Automatic Teller Machine on site.  I imagine less than 1% of expensive restaurants today are cash only.  Cafe Zinho is a highly flawed restaurant, demonstrating that there is more to a fine dining experience than simply offering fine cuisine.  If one is able to get beyond the feeling one has when visiting the rest room on a commercial airliner, the diner might enjoy it: not us.\n\nI posted comments about the restaurant at its Facebook page, in which I noted my displeasure with being cramped and uncomfortable, and about the restaurant being unique in its unwillingness to accept credit cards for a $148 check.  An individual identifying himself as the manager, who apparently had never received constructive criticism from anyone, initially demonstrated rage, posting a message that I can go to the Oiive Garden the next time I dine out.  He later added with similar condescension that I can use a coupon and a credit card at The Olive Garden.  Later, he thought better of his outburst and removed the comments...along with mine.  He ultimately offered me and my wife the opportunity to return to the restaurant at his expense.  I thanked him for the offer, but told him that one experience at Cafe Zinho was enough.  I had no intention of returning even if he had responded to my comments like a gentleman.", "business_id": "l_Wey2YC6NvVUIH8vTygGg", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-04-28", "type": "review"}

It had a great textural contrast with the flakiness of corn bread along with the fluffiness of loafs.\n\nNext, we had frog legs in a lemon and white wine sauce. The sauce was very pleasant as it highlighted a contrast among bittery, buttery, and sweetness. We dipped many pieces of corn bread in the sauce. Most of the flavor of the frog legs came from the sauce. The frog legs themselves were very chewy. I suspect that they were prepared in an oven; I think quickly grilling or quickly deep frying the frog legs might yield a more pleasant texture.\n\nThe main entree was great! I had the filet of trout which comes with grilled vegetables. The grilled veggies were simple yet well executed. The trout was nicely seasoned and cooked. I was able to appreciate the taste of the fish as well as the light seasoning. I wish the trout's skin was a bit crispier; however, I want to emphasis the the fish was cooked very much to my liking.\n\nAll in all, the food was very good. The main entrees were quite pricey.

It is complex of museums and  buildings set in several acres of lawns and gardens in Pittsburgh's East End.  It is a wonderful place to bring your out of town guests or just spend by yourself.\n\nYou begin your tour with the Helen Frick Art Museum, located on Reynolds Street.  It features  porcelains, bronzes, and rare examples of 17th and 18th-century furniture.  Current exhibits include Steel: Pittsburgh Drawings by Craig McPherson and A Panorama of Pittsburgh: Nineteenth-Century Printed Views. They will  remain on view through June 8, as part of Pittsburgh's 250th anniversary.\n\nNext we have the Car and Carriage Museum.  Henry Clay Frick was apparently quite an auto enthusiast.  His 1914 Rolls Royce Silver Ghost touring car is here as is the first car reportedly registered in Pittsburgh.  My husband Rick likes the 1931 Lincoln.\n\nThen we move on to my favorite, the Greenhouse, the Gardens, and the Lawns.  I believe that admission is free if you just want to stroll around the lawns, which I like to do on a Sunday in May.  In the late 19th Century, greenhouses were very popular with wealthy families.\n\nFinally we come to the house itself, Clayton.  It was purchased for the then princely sum of $22,000 by the Frick's in 1882.  It is done in the Italianate style.  Over 93% of the furnishings in the house are original, and that's what makes it so wonderful.  You get a fair sense of how the Fricks lived--quite a contrast to the steelworkers!  \n\nNo stop to the Frick is complete without visiting the cafe.  They believe that good food is an art too and the service here is wonderful.  I took a friend out for her birthday recently.  We had lunch at the cafe, the menu rotates seasonally.  I tried the Shrimp Tostones, which was sauted white shrimp, autumn sprouts, toasted almonds, guava cream, and annatto oil.  In the mood for more \"traditional\" museum fare like hot dogs?  Then try the \"Ultimate Chili Dog\".  Per the website, it is Grilled chicken apple sausage, wild boar chili, grated Gruyere cheese, caramelized onions, and mustard piccalilli on a sourdough roll!\n\nDon't forget to have tea here too.  It is wonderful and the service is impeccable!  You and your guests can easily spend a whole afternoon here!", "business_id": "XWLtYPhCpHht5Zn52zp3-Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-04-03", "type": "review"}

However the Met did not want everything. Helen Frick bought many pieces that the Met had already passed on, with good reason. Of course not all of the Frick Art collection consists of the Met's castoffs. There many portraits of insignificant nobility done by French court painters who had little talent.

When the family moved to New York City after Henry Clay struck it rich in the steel business, they kept their house in Pittsburgh for return visits to the city; 93% of what's in the house is original to the Frick family, which always makes a house tour more interesting to me.  They lived lavishly, and Frick was an avid art collector.  His personal collection -- displayed both in the home and museum -- is impressive.\n\nAfter our tour we visited the Car and Carriage Museum, which had husband transfixed with its Model T Touring Car, Rolls Royce Silver Ghost, American Bantam Convertible Coupe, Panhard et Levassor Tonneau and Lincoln Model K Sport Phaeton among others.  Finally, we finished up with a spin around the Art Museum itself.  It's a beautiful building with a very manageable size.

We had the pleasure of talking to the Chef- as we were seated at the table just by the door, in close proximity to the kitchen (you'll get it when you get there). We liked the guy so much we handed the menus back to the server and told him to just bring us whatever the chef suggested. \n\nThe whole meal was amazing. But I will say this without any qualification. The next sentence is not at all taken lightly. \n\nThe smoked cheese app with truffle oil, arugula, and lemon was the best first bite of food I have ever had in my life, a life that has had a considerable amount of top contenders for bites. \n\nLet that sink in.

Also, there are free extras when you order $20 or more (such as a 2 liter of Pepsi).\n\nUpdate:  Much to my great sadness and disappointment, I have had to stop patronizing this establishment due to the extremely rude and unprofessional man they hired to answer the phone.  We tolerated it the first few times, even got a laugh out of the fact that he actually dropped the F bomb a few times while taking our order.   But when he became hostile and irate with me on a recent order, it was all over.  He started like he always does by laughing at our street name and having me spell it 5 times, then interrupted the order without excusing himself to set down the phone and yell at some children I heard in the background, then he argued with me about what the menu in my hand said, telling me I was wrong and it said something different.

The potato pancakes are, without a doubt, the best in Pittsburgh!!\n\nWhile the food is fantastic, the staff and customer service is what keeps this place from being really excellent.  Its a very \"come as you are\" sort of place and rightfully so as it's a tavern/restaurant but the staff may take the casual nature of the restaurant a little too seriously.\n\nOne evening about a year ago, I went in for dinner.  I originally thought to sit at a wooden booth in the bar and there was only 1 open, the last towards the back.  I sat down and the seat completely collapsed on me!  I'm far from what you'd call \"fat\" \"heavy set\" or even a \"big girl\" and the staff just sort of stared at me as though it were my fault that their booth just fell apart, the bartender even laughed at me while I tried to get up.  No one asked if I was ok, no one asked if I needed help and I was generally ignored as I tried to pull myself to my feet.\n\n*I* had to approach the hostess, tell her that the booth had just collapsed and ask to be reseated.  She rolled her eyes at me and told me the dining room was full so I'd have to wait.  \n\nOk, understandable... could you offer a drink or a manager or something while I waited considering the fact that your booth just broke apart?\n\nThe entire incident was either completely ignored by staff, like it never happened or I was looked at like it was my fault.  I didn't even get so much as an apology!\n\nI've been back a couple of times since then because the food is always good but I always sit in the dining room now which is sort of a shame because I actually like the bar atmosphere better.  \n\nLuckily for me though, their menu is online and they offer take out.  Unfortunately, they have the hostess answering those phone calls and since she's not a server, she doesn't have a lot of knowledge about the menu.  When I asked for a total, I was put on hold for a couple of minutes.  She finally came back and I asked how long and was put on hold again so she could go ask the kitchen.  She was quite rude about it, like I was bothering her.\n\nBottom line: Max's *is* the best place for German food in Pittsburgh, hands down.  But, the food is the only thing you're going for.

I really want to like this place. It's a cool building with neat old fashion feel to it. But the food is mediocre at best.The last time I was there I got what they called German goulash. I have had this made for me by real German cooks so I have a good idea what it's supposed to taste like and this isn't it. It was made from pork instead of beef with frozen peas and carrots. The gravy wasn't a rich and savory, it was canned or packaged with I don't even know what spices in it. When I complained to the waitress she said that most people don't like it either. She asked me if I wanted something else but I was in a hurry and ate the meat after I scraped the gravy off of it. I have been to this place 1 or 2 times a year and I have had undercooked potato pancakes, greasy rubins and cold sausages. The only thing I can say is really good is the spinach salad with warm bacon dressing. It is a bit over priced for the size, but it is always really good.\n\nSunday brunch\nA neighbor talked me into going here for the brunch and I was glad she did. For an all you can eat brunch they do a nice job keeping things stocked and fresh. The omelet chef was very good making stuff just as you asked him for, yum. The sausage is great and the bacon is cooked in a range of doneness that everyone can find. So, for dinner and lunch my original 2 stars stand but the Sunday brunch is a solid 4 1/2 stars.", "business_id": "IxQ1ATP_Wg_QujO9nywzcQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-04-08", "type": "review"}

I LOVE German food. And German beer. \n\nThe bar is awesome. Wish we had more time just to chill and drink. But our waitress was awesome, attentive and knowledgeable! Order a REAL beer. Something on tap from Germany. (If not, I'll give you dirty looks from behind my coffee cup.)\n\nWhat you should order: The Sampler Platter. Pick three amazing entrees, two awesome sides. Brilliant for $16.95... best deal on the menu. And if they have a meatball appetizer you want this. You do. \n\nSo which entrees: \n - Schnitzel. Whichever one you're drooling over. Personally Jager Schnitzel is always best because God blessed the world when he made mushrooms, and man praised God by making mushroom sauce.\n - Leberkase. Wow. This was fantastic. It's like a cross between liverwurst (but NOT made with liver) and a meatloaf. Fantastisch.\n - Weisswurst. It was good. I've had better and yes I know its a German faux pas to have weisswurst at any other time of day than a midmorning snack... however. it was still yummy and I happily moaned with each bite i consumed with mustard.\n\nSo which sides: \n - Spaetzle! Buttery goodness. Never had it or heard of it? Think little dumplings. In butter. Es ist wunderbar.\n - Sauerkraut... they make theirs with sausage. what?! Ja... mmmmm.\n - Potato Pancakes. You order these with applesauce. you hear me? applesauce.\n\nWhat to avoid... that's pretty harsh but they lost a star for a reason:\n - German Potato Salad was too sweet and soupy. My great grandma's recipe puts this to shame.\n - IF you don't like mustard (weirdo) the Sauerbraten has a mustard sauce. I like it, but others don't. You've been warned.\n\nWe walked here from the ballpark... took about 15 minutes. Worth the walk both ways and they treated us well despite me wearing a Cardinals shirt in a foreign land.\n\nDanke!", "business_id": "IxQ1ATP_Wg_QujO9nywzcQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-04-06", "type": "review"}

Most of the churches are so beautiful that it's such a great use of space.  This is no exception, as it's just so unique inside! \n\nIf you're looking for that nontraditional hotel that's NOT a Marriott or Hilton, this is the place you'll want to stay!  It's fashioned like a European boutique hotel, plus all the amenities you'd be looking for like WiFi, a shuttle and continental breakfast (score!). \n\nIt's also a really lovely place to have an event.  For smaller events you can rent out specific parlor's for a reasonable cost and you're able to bring in your own caterers.  I really like this option because you're not boxed into one choice that may be out of price range.  If I would have gotten married in Pittsburgh, this would  definitely have been my first choice for the reception.  The Grand Hall is just gorgeous!  It has the original church organ and stain glass windows.  When it's all dressed up for the event it's just a stunning place for a magical affair! \n\nThe Northside of town, where it's located, has walkable access to the Andy Warhol Museum, The Mattress Factory Museum, The Children's Museum, The National Aviary, The Carnegie Science Center, PNC Park (home to the Pirates, go bucks!) and Heinz Field (home to the Stillerz, as we call them in the burgh).  Some are farther than others, but there's always the shuttle if it's in our frigid winter season.  In the summer, go for the walk so you can take in the sights!\n\nThere's also a lot of cute restaurants and bars on East Ohio River Boulevard, which is two streets up from the hotel.  My suggestions would be Bistro to Go and Bistro Soul, Rita's Italian Ice (personal fave) or The Priory Bakery for dessert!  There's also Legends North Shore not far on E. North Ave. about two streets up from E. Ohio and Amani Coffee Shop and Cafe for a quick stop for coffee or a great panini for lunch.   \n\nIt's really a fantastic time to go in the summer because EVERYTHING is within walking distance.  Plus they have a great farmers market in the park right along E. Ohio and they have kayaking in the park right by the Aviary.  The big kayaking organization, Venture Outdoors is right under the 6th St. Bridge next to PNC Park.  You're able to kayak around the three rivers for only $15 an hour!  It's a great way to see the city!\n\nThis is your place for one unique stay, I wouldn't steer you wrong!", "business_id": "hBAcj7X5JHeX2hvmptwH-w", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-04-29", "type": "review"}

Anyway, my mom and I went to the Carnegie Museum of Art to see the exhibit, \"Read My Pins: The Madeleine Albright Collection\".  We went  on March 4, 2012 the day it closed.  O' but I'm so glad we saw it, albeit at the last minute!  \n\nMadeline Albright has always been one of  my favorite women in politics.  In 1997, Albright was named the first female Secretary of State and became, at that time, the highest ranking woman in the history of the U.S. government.  Prior to that, she was Ambassador to the U.N.  While serving under President Bill Clinton, first as U.S ambassador to the United Nations, and then as Secretary of State, Albright became known for wearing brooches that purposefully conveyed her views about the situation at hand.  She was famous for saying, \"While President George H.W. Bush had been known for saying 'Read my lips,' I began urging colleagues and reporters to 'Read my pins.'\"\n\nIn 1994, Saddam Hussein's government-controlled press referred to then-U.S. Ambassador to the UN Albright as an \"unparalleled serpent.\" She then wore a golden snake brooch to her next meeting on Iraq,  \n\nI was really quite enthralled by the collection that Secretary Albright cultivated.  As my guide says, \"The collection is distinctive and democratic-sometimes demure and understated, sometimes outlandish and outspoken-spanning more than a century of jewelry design and including fascinating pieces from across the globe.\"   Some of the pieces on display were fine antiques, such as the circa 1880 \"Blue Bird\".   But many of the pieces were costume jewelry.  \n\nI guess my favorite piece was \"Liberty Brooch\".  Now this piece, circa 1997 by Gijs Bakker, is the head of Lady Liberty with two watch faces for eyes, one of which is upside down-allowing both her and her visitor to see when it is time for an appointment to end.  A very clever piece, and judging by the others' comments at the exhibit, I'm not the only one with that opinion.  Mom really loved it too.  \n\nSo this was a really powerful exhibit of an eclectic collection of jewelry.  I strongly recommend reading the accompanying book, \"Read My Pins: Stories from a Diplomat's Jewel Box\", which you can get at Barnes & Noble or Amazon.  Madeleine Albright is an inspiration to women in politics and government.", "business_id": "EEuGTah-oEssSl3o6pK-ZQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-03-13", "type": "review"}

My wife and I stopped in this past week, and for me, I was reminded of why I enjoy Atria's...but this having been our first time at Atria's together, and witnessing my wife's experience, I realized why the place could garner such low reviews.\n\nFor someone like myself, who's actually had enough positive and negative food experiences at Atria's to know exactly what to order and what to steer clear of, I can make the experience a positive one, but that's a situation I'm afforded now thanks to my previous patience and convenience. My wife, opting to stray from my suggestions had an awful dinner. Her plate of bland fish and asparagus left her turned off completely. Luckily, we were using a gift card, so it wasn't as frustrating for her as it could've been. Regardless, walking away from an entire plate of food is disheartening.\n\nThat led me to realize this: If you're only at Atria's once, you're odds aren't that great of having a good experience. That's just the reality of the situation. There are a handful of really good things on the menu that I LOVE. The parmesan crusted chicken is really good, although it can sometimes be a little too oily. The pot roast is excellent, but it's way too heavy for most of the year...ESPECIALLY during baseball season when they're busier. Their chili is really on-point...especially paired with their bread, and the salmon salad is excellent. Although, I don't like the salmon, so I swap the salmon for chicken for a great salad option. The carrot cake is insanely good, but truth be told, it's not homemade. I could care less, though, as it's still some of the best carrot cake I've ever eaten. Period. Other notable items are the pot roast nachos, crab cakes, red skin smashed potatoes, and the reuben.\n\nThat's really where the positives end, though. I've learned to steer clear of the burgers because of the inconsistency with which they're prepared. I've received more undercooked burgers at Atria's than any other restaurant, and it's just not worth the gamble anymore. My filets have always been perfectly-prepared, but the one time I got a strip it was practically burned on one side and undercooked on the other. Failing to cook burgers and steaks correctly isn't that surprising, but deciding to serve them to customers despite their incorrect preparation IS surprising...and poor.\n\nI know that the last time I had salmon on my salad, the fish tasted \"off\" and I paid the price for it later. I've never given a single fish meal a chance there since (we're talking years now). Hence, my request for chicken on my salads now. Most of the meals that I've had are average, and I've practically tried the entirety of the menu over the years, so believe me when I say it.\n\nWhy do I continue to go? Well, because the few items that I do love, are crave-worthy, and having become a regular (less so, nowadays), the service that I received at the bar was always excellent. Daniel and Roy have always provided  great service to me, and good service goes the distance, as far I'm concerned, so it's been worth stopping in from time-to-time. Unfortunately, if I can't sit at the bar, I don't always stick around, as the service at the tables is really hit-or-miss. For every good server they have, they have two more that could care less about their jobs...especially during peak times.\n\nRegardless, this is my favorite Atria's location, because it's the least \"stuffy\" and pretentious location of them all, but there's still a lot of room to improve...and I hope it does.", "business_id": "Z101WZaISochG6g7tI2ZVw", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-03-26", "type": "review"}

I visited this restaurant with a large group of about 40 people before going to a show at the New Hazlett Theater. We were seated upstairs and ate a buffet-style dinner (the dishes had already been picked). The two waiters who took care of us were extremely friendly and efficient, and they made sure we would leave in time for our show. While we waited for the food to come out, they served us drinks, but the waiter stopped offering straws after the first couple tables.\n\nWhen the food came out, they let a few tables help themselves at a time. They provided us with three different types of plates (large square ones, rectangular ones, and small circular ones), which I found odd. We had three entrees in the buffet line: Chicken Marsala, Tomato Vodka pasta, and Parmesan Crusted Tilapia.\n\nChicken Marsala: flavorful, tender chicken served with mashed potatoes. I really enjoyed the potatoes because they had a distinct potato flavor, unlike most butter-heavy ones. However, I wish they were more generous with the tomatoes and mushrooms in the dish. There was no vegetable-based dish in our entire meal, and I missed them.\n\nTomato Vodka pasta: penne cooked with just a little bite left in a yummy tomato sauce with a couple leaves of spinach here and there. Again, I wished there was a lot more spinach in the dish. Also, the pasta was a little sauce-heavy.\n\nParmesan Crusted Tilapia: the fish was crispy and delicious, the angelhair pasta was cooked perfectly, and the tomato sauce was good. I grabbed some pasta near the edge that hadn't been touched by sauce, so I liked the amount. No vegetables, though.\n\nAfterwards, they brought out a tray of bite-size desserts for us. I don't see any of them on their menu, so I'm not sure how the organization ordered them. Both the cheesecake flavors I tried (raspberry and almond) were delicious--the cheesecake was really light and airy, and the flavors really came through without being overly sweet or overpowering. They also had strawberry halves and chocolate chip cookies, which were soft and cakey--not the best I've ever had, but pretty good. Also, there were these little squares that, as far as I could tell, were squares of iced cake covered in chocolate. These were way too sweet for my taste.

I'd wanted to try Wilson's last weekend before a visit to the Mattress Factory, but wasn't able to because we lacked cash, and Wilson's is a cash only establishment.  This time, we came prepared with plenty of green, so we were able to get our BBQ bliss on.\n\nIn case you don't notice the heady odor of smoked meat when approaching Wilson's, it literally hits you in the face as soon as you walk in.  I first inquired about the chicken, but was told by the gentleman working behind the counter (presumably Mr. Wilson) that they were out of it for the day.  Thus, CM and I decided to split a large plate of ribs (around $12), which comes with 6 bones.  Because we'd heard that Wilson's hot sauce is seriously hot, we ordered a mix of hot and mild sauce for the ribs.  For sides, we decided to order the collard greens and the potato salad ($1.34 each), and I got a can of iced tea, as well ($1).  Because he's still having some trouble breathing from his ongoing cold, CM requested that we get our items to go, so I obliged.\n\nAfter finding a picnic table in West Park commons with a little help from a local resident, we unpacked the food and dug in.  We first tried the ribs, and found them appropriately smoky and the right texture, with sufficient give but not falling apart.  The sauce was just the right level of spiciness to satisfy both of us, as well--spicy enough to provide a nice kick, but not so spicy as to be overwhelming.  After finishing the ribs, we both used the slices of white bread provided to soak up the remaining sauce.  As for the sides, they were clearly homemade and of good quality and flavor, though the potato salad was a bit mushier than I'm accustomed to, and the collards were a bit saltier than I'd like.\n\nOverall, we were quite pleased with the quality and amount of food that we received for the price that we paid (around $16).  Make no mistake: Wilson's is a hole in the wall, but in the best sense of the phrase--check it out for solid, unpretentious BBQ that hits the spot for a casual picnic lunch or dinner if you happen to be in the area.", "business_id": "Z0OGW8PysysRXE0dR7QxQQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-03-15", "type": "review"}

I pointed this out on the bill and he said that, its fine, I can just pay for the oil change (~$42). He asked me if I had $42 cash on me. If I did, I could have paid and left a happy customer. But I didn't, so I gave him my card and he went in the back and swiped it for the full price ($42 + $20 + tax). When I was signing the transaction receipt, I told him that he swiped for the full price. This apparently pissed him off a lot, he very rudely handed $20 from his pocket and asked me to \"Get out of there\" - and walked out. I tried to talk to him and explain my reason of asking - it not being the matter of $20 but of the principle that he said he wasn't going to charge me for what I didn't want. But he wouldn't listen, was very rude and said \"You're Done\" and \"Get out\" more times. I left. \n\nI ain't going back where they treat customers like that.", "business_id": "W25mXeVDTHBIXAidJrwHPg", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-04-09", "type": "review"}

Some better than others. With that said there is a jewel in the crown of Pittsburgh's Northside called 'Wise guys pizza'. Their menu has a lot of great gangster names and sayings, and adds a bit of mystic to ordering for first timers. Specials like 'The Don', The GODFATHER,  'the Luca Brazzi' fish and The KINGPIN. Additionally there are phrases like; side action, and a hoagie you can't refuse. While the menu is good, it isn't the star of the show. My experience with Wiseguys is that their food is a GREAT meal for a GREAT price. Their salads A#1, their wings not too greasy, fatty, OR dry. To quote my friend Goldilocks,  these wings are JUST RIGHT. Now earlier in this review I spoke of stars. The star of Friday nights show was the cheese steak hoagie. Brimming w/meat FRESH I say again fresh vegetables, and (a pgh thing) fries. Me, and my two growing carnivores left our dinner table quite sated.  Have I eaten there before yes will I eat there again oh heck yes. They are a good bang for your buck with several specials everyday. I end my reviews with this statement and my review of Wiseguys pizza will be no different. I vote with my money and feet, and rest assured that both will be making many more trips to this eatery.

Wiseguys is one I'm still on the fence about. \n\nI've had several items from them, wings, sandwiches, and pizza. Their pizza is par with the rest of the city, nothing special to write about. Their steak sandwich was bland and overcooked, but the veggies they added on were cooked well. They have several other sandwiches that are covered in obnoxious amounts of toppings, probably just to confuse your palate to thinking that you're eating something good. I must say though, their bread is really good. And this is coming from a South Philly girl. \n\nTheir wings are hit or miss. The first few times I've ordered them, they were big and cooked well. I ordered last night, and they were puny and soggy. And now they charge 25\u00a2 more for crispy? So I paid the extra charge and still got soggy wings.

Going to the right vet's office can really help with that anxiety, and for my family and I this animal hospital is the perfect place to take our beloved pets.\n\nMy family has taken our pets to this practice as far back as I can remember. While the team here hasn't cared for our house's entire little zoo over the years (which has seen everything from crabs to frogs to guinea pigs and more), they have helped us take care of our old rabbit and two cats. And I have to say the staff have never disappointed. Most recently they've often accommodated my family at the last minute when our cats took a sudden downhill turn, and when we come in they handle our pets wonderfully and kindly. One staff member once even asked for my permission before they brought in their interns and trainees to see my cat, who has a rare scar formation in her eye; given the stress that can surround a vet visit it meant a lot to me that this person checked with me before she used my cat as a teaching vehicle, rather than simply dragging their entire staff in to stare at my poor kitty.\n\nI know that some of their services can be a little pricier (surgeries in particular can seem a bit high if you've ever gotten estimates from shelters for the same procedures), but given their status as a local independent group I understand why this is the case. And on another important note, I strongly advise fellow pet owners to bring their animals either in crates or with proper leashes, restraints, etc. as needed, as this office does have a small wait room and that means it's super important for all owners to both have control over and to protect the animals they bring to this office. That said, I've never had a problem with my two kitties, my old rabbit, or any other owners' animals to date.\n\nI absolutely recommend this vet's office to other pet owners. Its location is excellent for people like me (even if its parking lot is a little small), and its fantastic staff have never disappointed and have always done what's right for my beloved pets. I admittedly hope that I don't need to be back any time soon, but it's good to know that this place is here and can provide the top-top service they do when I and my dear pets need their help.", "business_id": "titJ-ofqKMG9d0i9_kkX6A", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-03-04", "type": "review"}

The crust, sauce, and cheese illustrate unique qualities of Pittsburgh pizza.  Crust tends to be thin like New York pizza, but chewy rather than crunchy.  Pizzerias often use a blend of provolone and mozzarella or straight provolone, and if it's a pizzeria worth anything, the cheese will snap when melted (think of how stringy the cheese gets on cheap delivery pizza).  Pittsburgh pizza sauce will taste distinctly of red wine and not oregano (thank God).   Beto's parbakes the pizza and then finishes it for a few minutes before topping it with the cold cheese (by the way, they'll melt it if you tell them).   If you like provolone and want perfect Beto's, get six squares to go, and leave them in the box about 10 minutes.   Last time I flew into Pgh, my mom sent me to Beto's before I even got to her house.

I had been here once before but it had been a number of years prior.  Man was this place packed!  I had trouble finding a parking spot and upon entering the restaurant there were no open tables and about 10 people waiting for their orders.  Since I was due elsewhere later in the evening I decided to order four cuts of pepperoni to go.  After that I sat down on a chair to wait.  It was at this point that I heard one of the employees telling another that they should tell everyone it would be about a 30 minute wait.  Thankfully it only ended up being a 15 minute wait before I was out the door and into my car.\n\nSo how did the pizza taste?  Sorry Beto's and the South Hills but I just don't get cold cheese and toppings on top of a baked crust.  This is now two times that I have tried it and this time I was prepared for it and more than willing to give it a better chance.  However it just does not work for me.  The positives for the pizza are that the crust is super crispy, almost cracker like, which I really liked.  I don't know that I have had another pizza crust that was this crispy before.  There was also a ridiculous amount of cheese on my four slices which I consider to be a good thing.  As to the negatives of the pizza, the main one is the cold toppings.  To me it doesn't really feel right and I am not a fan of it.  This also causes a secondary issue of the pizza being extremely messy to eat.  Since the cheese hasn't melted together and also hasn't melted the toppings on, it goes everywhere.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I probably will not be back again in the future.

It was my first job and continued to supplement my burgeoning shopping addiction throughout High School and into College.  I had a fantastic time throwing people's menus down as a hostess and then filling food orders (and occasionally spilling orange juice on people's crotches, oops) as a waitress and gossiping with my coworkers.  So needless to say, I have a special place in my heart for this lovely establishment!\n\nI think for a Pittsburgh owned chain restaurant it's one of the best.  This is in terms of how the business is run and the restaurants itself.  My love affair of grilled stickies began here.  I may have occasionally shoved one or two in my mouth as soon as they came out of the oven.  I also can't resist a smiley cookie.  They seem to be at every event in the city, so I never have to go long to fulfill on my smiley cookie cravings.  Thank gawd!\n\nMy all time favorite salad is the grilled chicken and portabella salad.  I absolutely love the balsamic dressing and mix of fresh ingredients.  I also had a second in High School (when I didn't have to count so many calories, ew) where I'd order a Super Burger every lunch break.  They are seriously addictive with their super secret sauce combination.  \n\nTheir breakfast buffet is bomb!  I always have to go for the regulars and one word sums that up.  Carbs.  Pancakes, french toast and those delish strawberry muffins!  And seriously, what is up with how good their pistachio whip is on the buffet?

Cain's is a well-priced smoke free 1/2 bar 1/2 sports restaurant hybrid. The front has tall tables and chairs (like bar stool height) and the back has booths and 6 flatscreen TV's. The whole place was redone in 2009 when a new owner bought it, who bought Redbeards in Mt. Washington and totally redid it. The chef is from Grand View, a fantastic actual restaurant, not bar restaurant. So you're basically getting, at normal bar food prices, truly excellent bar food. Seems like the truly scuzzy clientele that someone 3 years ago mentioned have been evaporated to cheaper Dormont bars. The patrons here are more of the youngish (under 40) Mt. Lebanon variety.\n\nThe vegetable wrap is phenomenal, the burgers are great, and the \"Codfather\" gigantic fish sandwich is simply amazing, the best outside of Wholey's. The \"Codfather\" is prepared 3 ways - \"Part 1\" is tartar, lettuce tomato, \"Part 2\" is coleslaw, fries and hot sauce and I forget what \"Part 3\" is. The onion rings are beer battered (not breaded) and fried to perfection. They taste moderately of beer, the true hallmark of excellent rings. The food you're getting here isn't pushing any envelopes but it absolutely is the best bar food in Pittsburgh. Apparently they have a $5 \"express lunch\" that includes a 1/2 sandwich and soup or salad. Never had it but that's extremely cheap.\n\nBeer is fairly priced; Sam Adams and Blue Moon are $3.50 while Yuengling, Coors & Miller are about $2.50, $2 on special. Everything else is under $5.50.\n\nWing night Wednesdays the good: 25 cent wing night. Best wings I've had in the 'burgh. Wing night the bad: they charge 50 cents per ranch or blue cheese dressing, effectively making 10 wings (the minimum order, which they DON'T disclose) $3 rather than $2.50 which makes it more like 30 cent wing night. Nor do they include celery/carrots, as they do on the menu for regular wing orders. This is the first Wednesday (wing night) they've done this upcharge. I don't mind 30 cent wings, I just like honesty up front. They also don't let you take the wings home that you don't finish. Sorry, but I want two flavors and don't want to weigh 300 pounds so I'm only gonna eat 12-14 wings. We threw away at least a dozen between the 2 of us. People go hungry in this city every night and that's a crime.\n\nThe mild buffalo wings are more like medium buffalo wings and are excellent, as are the orange ginger wings. The bbq and honey bbq are what you'd expect. The jalapeno cheddar is fake nacho cheese and pickled jalapenos on top - NOT what we expected and not what we'd get again but still very good.\n\nService is good 4/5 times. It's slower with wing night; only 2 servers for the whole place.\n\nDefinitely go here for the Codfather and the veggie wrap. Get onion rings as your side. Oh! And get a salad too; they use spring mix and baby spinach and make almost all of their dressings.", "business_id": "5Udv4CASAXB2eH66TefWPQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-05-04", "type": "review"}

I've been stopping at Cain's since I can't remember when, and maybe their tap selection has something to do with that.  I have never failed to find something interesting and crafty on tap at Cain's.\n\nMy favorite night to stop at Cain's is Wednesday.  I try to get there early, because later in the evening, the place is usually packed out, even though there is a lot of seating.  On Wednesdays, Cain's has a special on their excellent chicken wings.  They are done the right way, and among my top favorites in the South Hills.\n\nYou can't go wrong at Cain's during happy hour.  Half price on all appetizers and a dollar off all drinks from 5 to 7.  But my favorite plan of attack at Cain's is to arrive around 4:45 and order the \"half sandwich and a soup\" deal they call \"express lunch.\"  It is served until 5:00, and you can't beat a half sandwich and two sides for $5.99.  By the time my food arrives, it's happy hour and the beers are a buck off, but you have to be seated in the bar area, supposedly.  My favorite sandwich to get with this deal is the Reuben, served with some volcano chili and slaw, but I've had other interesting sandwiches there as well.  The chili has got some NICE punch to it, and I am definitely a fan.\n\nI remember way back when this place wasn't so pretty, but they have done a nice job with updating the place and you won't be embarrassed to bring a date to this place.  But don't be surprised if you end up having to stand for quite a while before you can get a seat on a Wednesday night.  Chivalry is not dead in Dormont, which is one of my favorite parts of the South Hills, and I have seen young men give up their seats in favor of older ladies at Cain's.

And while I certainly didn't dislike my experience here overall I can't say I quite get what all the fuss is about.\n\nI came here for dinner and drinks with a friend and upon first entering we were pleased; the staff got us seats and our waitress very patiently helped us navigate their beer and cider options - which took a while, there were just so many! I truly do praise our waitress and the bar staff for taking my companion's final request, which was a little off-menu. No one complained and they whipped up my friend's drink while I went for a Pear Magner cider. \n\nThe particular night that we went was wing night, and while wings did sound wonderful we ultimately went for a plate of loaded fries in addition to our separate meals. It took a while to get them, but we figured it was getting busier since it was the evening and we let that slide. Here was where the meal began to lose some of its shine - while at first the fries were absolutely delicious, the more of them that I ate the less appetizing they tasted. I suspect that while the top layer was composed of perfectly cooked fries, the last layer of fries at the bottom of the plate was just drenched in extra grease and oil that kind of ruined the fries themselves for me. Plus, when ordering my sandwich I had asked for one of three sauce options listed on the menu - but once it arrived I realized after biting into it that my sandwich contained the wrong sauce. I didn't bother complaining at that point because of how busy it was - I didn't want to wait for a replacement meal; the sauce I got wasn't too bad or spicy for me, so the sandwich itself still tasted good, but it was still a bit frustrating. After actually finishing our meal, it took an INCREDIBLY long time for us to spot our waitress and flag her down for our check. We're not sure why she disappeared for so long; it was definitely odd to have our service go from above average to below average.\n\nAnd when we ducked into the bathroom on our way out? Good Lord, was that a tiny room! I almost hit someone with the door because you literally only have a foot or two between the door when it opens and the wall, so if anyone is standing on the other side they're often in the door's way by default. And it was almost impossible to sit in the stalls, they were so tiny. Definitely be careful when entering the bathrooms, folks.\n\nNeedless to say, my experience was pretty mixed - it definitely started out strong but it kind of went downhill throughout the night, although it never hit actual flat-out bad levels. I'd still come back to Cain's if someone wanted to, as their food was certainly enjoyable enough. It's absolutely a decent place with some decent options for food.

First my salad came out. It had cucumbers, tomatoes, onions on top of Romain. I had Blue Cheese dressing and it was very good. Then the Chicken Parm came out. Oh my did it look good!  It was two huge pieces of chicken fried to the perfect crispness with sauce, and melted provolone. On one said their were two huge pieces of garlic toast and on the other was Angel hair pasta tossed in sauce. It was A LOT of food! The sauce on the pasta and chicken was very tasty. Sometimes sauces can be too tomatoey or bland but their sauce was great. The chicken was still juicy and the pasta was cooked perfectly. \nMy husband ordered the Mixed Grill with shrimp. It was mixed veggies that were grilled along with wild rice. It came with 7 nice sized shrimp. The dish was seasoned well and I think if I had not been with him he would have licked the plate. \nI ended up taking over half of my food home.

The man can eat, and he's so thin, I really hate him and his metabolism.\n\nMy oatmeal cakes were HUGE, and three to an order, I got the first one down without any problem, they were moist, chewy, flavorful with real oatmeal and cinnamon, and the syrup was almost not needed as they have a natural sweetness to them.\n\nHe devoured his french toast, eggs, bacon, saying it was one of the best breakfasts places he's ever been to.\n\nIt's a shame we take restaurants for granted, here's a guy from Vancouver, over 3000 miles away wishing the Dor-Stop was in his home town.", "business_id": "2Igiyhi82R8_QaaPplRmCw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-03-05", "type": "review"}

The hotcakes are so different, some would even say magical. They are so fluffy and moist and complimented their super crispy bacon. I almost wanted to fold the entire breakfast up and eat a giant pancake eggarito. My mouth is watering thinking about it.\n\nMy girlfriend got the breakfast sandwich which was very well done. Their ham is so succulent and tender. They cut it off the bone at the Dor-Stop and is shows.

I went on a weekday morning so that I could actually get a seat and have the food at it's prime--not cooked in a hurry to see how the food really was.  Well, that was also the only time I had, as well.\n\nI was greeted quickly and seated and given a nice cup of coffee.  They did an exceptional job of keeping the coffee mugs full (another reason  to go on a weekday) and it was good coffee.  \n\nI had to try the hot cakes, but didn't want to OD on carbohydrates so I got the Egg Combo with the speciality hotcakes.  The waitress recommended the banana oatmeal or the apple cinnamon.  I went with the banana oatmeal.  Two over easy eggs and bacon, though they offer sausage patties or links in both regular (sage) and hot.\n\nMy food came quickly and I was disappointed to find the eggs sharing the plate with the hotcakes.  I like my food separated and dippy eggs leave a residue that sometimes can't be mopped up with bacon.  I guess I would have preferred a plate with the eggs/bacon and a plate with the hotcakes.  \n\nThe eggs were cooked perfectly as was the bacon.  Crispy yet chewy.  I have to eat my eggs and bacon before I can eat my hotcakes, because, again, I don't like my food touching--especially something sweet and savory.  \n\nLet's talk about the hotcakes.  They were served with a big dollop of whipped butter which I loved.  Whipped butter spreads pretty easy.  I like that.  I'm picky.  Especially with breakfast.  There were slices of banana cooked in which I also liked.  They tasted like a diabetics worst/best nightmare.  They were sweet and fork tender like a nice pancake should be.  They would have been fine without syrup.  When I added syrup it felt like I was eating a slightly sweeter version of banana bread.  I wanted to stop at one.  I really did.  I really really did.  I was getting full.  I can stop eating food that isn't good without much of a problem.  I had a problem with that second hotcake\n\nMy other \"complaint\" is that is is rather expensive for a small diner.  I paid a little over $10 for my breakfast.  For $10, I would have preferred a more generous portion of bacon, at least.  My idea of pricing is a bit off, I guess, mainly because I live in an area outside of Pittsburgh that is a lot less expensive.  \n\nSo, I will go back, for sure.  The breakfast is GOOD and I think most places that attempt to serve breakfast should be GOOD.", "business_id": "2Igiyhi82R8_QaaPplRmCw", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-03-27", "type": "review"}

I've had every combination on the menu and then plenty more (they'll usually grant a request if they have the ingredients and they usually run a weekend special).

The owner and her daughter are crazy endearing.  The focus here, of course, is on the pancakes.  This is the only place I know of that serves pumpkin pancakes year round, and it is for a reason.  These are dense and sweet, enough that even I don't syrup them.  A little whipped butter in a paper souffle cup and a dash of salt (hey, don't knock it 'til you try it), I can clear three or so in a few minutes.\n\nThey also have staple breakfast items, along with the jumbot. At least one of the guys in my party always goes for the ham on the bone/jumbot.  If you can fit this thing in your body, go for it.  The only other unique item to try would be the stuffed french toast.  Personally, between syrupy fruit filling (compote is too kind a word for this ice cream topping inside) and then topped with more fruit syrup, it tastes more like a heavy dessert for me, but I know those who swear by this as their weekend treat.\n\nIf you find yourself on the other side of the Liberty Tubes on an early morning, you need to go get pumpkin pancakes.

I stuck my fork into her dish numerous times to try it despite the 'angry scowls'.  There is a lot of potatoes, ham, eggs, onions, peppers, cheese and tomatoes in this hodgepodge.  \n\nThe service was friendly, fast and efficient.  They were always coming around offering up more coffee which I gladly accepted.  \n\nThe prices are well within reason.  They are equivalent to other diners but the food is WAY better than your standard diner.  \n\nHit this place up anytime you can...I wish I still lived in Mt.

Given that we were headed out to South Park for a hike, and we wanted to get brunch beforehand, I suggested we take the opportunity to try the Dor Stop, since Dormont was on the way and I'd heard great things about their brunch (not to mention that they were on DDD!).  In hopes of beating the late-rising rush, we arrived at around 10:30, and it worked out perfectly, since we only had to wait about 15 min. to be seated.\n\nOnce we were seated, we were promptly greeted and given menus by one of the waitstaff.  Having checked out the reviews ahead of time, I knew I wanted to try the raspberry French toast.  I mentioned the other items that had been featured on DDD--and that people enjoy, based on the reviews--to CM, and he decided to go with the famous pumpkin pancakes (yeah, that's what I call them, rather than hot cakes--so sue me!).  Our order was taken promptly, and was delivered to our table about 10 min. after ordering.  My French toast looked exactly like I expected, based on the pictures--it consisted of four toast points covered with raspberry sauce, and drizzled with raspberry jam.  The toast was perfectly crispy, and the sauce was delicious and flavorful--it was everything I could want in a sweet brunch item!  However, I did find the name of this dish a bit misleading, since the toast itself wasn't actually stuffed, unlike other versions I've tried before.\n\nI tried a bite of CM's pumpkin pancakes, and they were also delectable--unlike most pancakes I've had, they were quite moist even without any syrup, and definitely included real pumpkin, rather than just pumpkin pie spice, like many pumpkin items I've tried.  The butter added some welcome savoriness to the sweetness of the pancakes, and a bit of syrup added some additional moistness.  Since both of our dishes came with a breakfast meat, we ordered bacon (duh!), which provided us with a supply of umami flavor when we wanted a break from the sweetness of our entrees.\n\nOverall, CM and I were very pleased with our experience at the Dor Stop.  Our total check, which included a glass of milk for me in addition to our entrees, came to around $20, which we felt was quite reasonable in light of the quality of the dishes.  Service was friendly and efficient, and the ambiance was cheerful and light-filled--exactly what I'd expect in a diner.  Even though we both felt a tad out of place among the clientele, which was almost completely white families with young children (very different than your typical East End eating establishment, which is what we're both accustomed to), we felt welcome.  Without a doubt, the Dor-Stop offers one of the best breakfasts in PGH, and doesn't disappoint for down home diner goodness!", "business_id": "2Igiyhi82R8_QaaPplRmCw", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-04-22", "type": "review"}

She showed Geno the length she wanted, he cut it shorter than she wanted and you couldn't tell that it was chopped up all different length since he dried it blowing curls in. He asked her if she liked it, she told him she didn't like how he styled it and that she would fix it when you got home. My turn, I should have went with gut feeling RUN but I didn cause this was part of my Mother's Day gift. I told Geno I donate my hair to locks of love and showed him how much to cut off. I've been donating my hair for years and I know how much to cut. Geno told me I should donate my hair to Pantene and preceded to tell me why he likes them better than locks of love. Told Geno thanks for your input but I donate to locks of love. He put my hair in a ponytail got out his electric trimmer and preceded to cut off my hair. All the salons that have cut off my hair used scissors. Weird !  He cut way more than I showed him the back is so short the front is longer and the hole cut is choppy all different lengths. I don't know what to do with this other than wear a hat for a few week. Thank God my hair grows fast. This man clearly should retire. I wish my daughter would have read the reviews before we went there and she would have seen Geno can't cut curly hair. We got there at 2pm and Geno took my daughter right away, we weren't finish till 5:30pm that 3 1/2 hours to destroy two heads of hair. One reviewer said he takes his time I don't think that the case he looked a little confused at time. Over priced $60.00 each for Geno when my daughter had Danielle she paid $35.00 but they don't tell you Geno prices. NOT NiCE !

For me, my fallback, can't miss restaurant is Bado's. First off, the menu is huge- pizza, hoagies, pasta, sandwiches, big burgers, Boarshead hotdogs, and huge apps. Everything I have tried there so far has been above average, except maybe their lasagna which I found to be watery and tasteless. If you get a salad, make sure you try their house dressing. It's their own vinaigrette that comes in a Grolsh bottle and is by far one of the best dressings I've ever had. Make sure you try it on the giant antipasti salad (which you should split with someone), and pair that with one of their calzones (my favorite is the reuben calzone, but the meatball is excellent as well). Their pizza buffet is also good if you want to try a lot of different toppings. \nIf you're looking for a good beer, Bado's has a great selection of craft and microbrews on their huge board, and the choices are always changing.\nYou will also want to come to Bado's on weekend mornings for their breakfast. The omelets are huge and they have tons of toppings to choose from, and the rest of their breakfast choices are above average. Even the coffee is good!\nThe drawbacks to Bado's are that they're almost always busy, and tables are a little cramped. Expect to wait a few minutes when you get there, and don't expect stellar service. The wait staff is good but they're always busy, so you'll probably be waiting for a refill. Also, I like to have fries with my sandwich or burger, and while their fries are pretty good, they don't have them as a side. You have to order off their appetizer menu, and the order is too big for one person and pricey.", "business_id": "qemCNgjeYGcFsRwxW9x4xw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-03-08", "type": "review"}

The waitress's working weekends are pretty fantastic. The guys that work during the work are so-so. I don't have any experience with the bartenders, as we always sit at a table and eat.\nThe one drawback for me is how it's a bit \"too\" family friendly for me. I love children (work with them everyday!) but it seems that families here feel comfortable letting their children do whatever they want. Maybe it's because the environment already seems loud, parents feel they can let their children misbehave and it will go unnoticed.

Inside, it is your typical neighborhood pizza place/bar. Clean, well maintained but nothing shiny or fancy here. Looking over the menu, I noticed some classics and some distinct choices. Sandwiches, soups, salads, pizzas and calzones. Some with toppings/fillings you would not expect. Feeling unadventurous, we decided to order their (famous) wedding soup, a cheese pizza and a sausage calzone to be able to try a few of the classics. The soup came out first. The meatballs were tasty but otherwise, I'm not sure why it would be famous. It definitely did not stand out to me. Another item that did not stand out, the pizza. I was looking for something more. The pizza sauce was a bit tart for me. The real winner of the meal was the sausage calzone (which we added ricotta to). The sausage had a great spice to it.

They also had my favorite dressing, raspberry vinaigrette, which always scores points with me. But what struck me most was the sheer size of the salad. For a side salad this was huge; not a meal in itself but definitely bigger than I've gotten at most places.\n\nIt didn't take to long afterwards for the Lasagna to come out. In following suit with the salad, it was a huge slice covered in a tasty, tomatoey, tomato sauce. A slice of garlic bread accompanied it. Like I said, it was a cheese lasagna and there was no shortage of ricotta between pasta layers. A layer of sausage or ground beef would have done wonders for this lasagna but it stood well on its own just fine. I enjoyed half of it (how much carbs does one man need?) and put the rest in a take home container for lunch tomorrow.

This weekend I had burgers on the brain! My BF and I got the Balboa, the BBQ Texas, and two dogs, mac n' cheese and Mason Dixon with with cheese.\n\nThe burgers had really delish toppings but the meat was so dry. It was overcooked and did not have one bit of juicyness dripping down my hand. Missing that major component they were truly lackluster. The macaroni dog wasn't that great either. Mac n' cheese should be creamy, salty, buttery. So sorry but this weenie came up flat too. I did like the Mason Dixon! The crunchy-ness of the coleslaw made a huge difference but the meat was still chewy and too salty. Could it be that I am too picky when it comes to my meat?

All the dogs were good eats.  You can get your order vienna, veggie, turkey, cheese brat, or on a spicy dog.  The dogs arrive well grilled with a little bit of crisp blackening going on.  There are a shit load of additional toppings you can request (avacado, bacon, various mustards, saurkraut, etc.) and they seemed to be free...at least we didn't get charged anything additional .....Everything was included in the dog prices.\n\nWings were ok.  We did dry wings: jerk, spicy ranch, and parmesean.  They were all decently meaty.  The parmeseans with a side of the spicy mayo were good stuff, distinct flavor and good for dipping.

A bit off the beaten path, but an easy bus ride from my Oakland hotel (and bus originates from Downtown, so should be easy ride from there, too).\n\nDs did not disappoint: creative craft beer list of 25+ taps, plus hundreds of bottles in the Beer Cave that you can have onsite or take to-go, and some of the best dogs I've ever had. Was there on a Friday, so got the Scorpion (cheddar jalapeno kielbasi) & fries deal for $5.50--excellent.

Nice, friendly service from the guys behind the bar/in the kitchen made this a fine time.\n\nNext time I'm in PGH, Ds will be at the top of my list to visit. Can't wait to try their other dogs and whatever they have on tap (or in the Cave).\n\nP.S. There is also sit-down service in a room between the bar and Cave that seemed more family-friendly.

Given that CM lives right around the corner, and that I had a City Dining Card, D's had been on our list for awhile, and we were eager to check it out. We happened to arrive right when the Kentucky Derby was in full swing, and there wasn't a table to be had, so we gave our name to the hostess to be texted when a table became available (Note: D's uses NoWait).  Fortunately, we arrived right at the end of the derby, so several tables soon cleared out, and we received the text within 10 min., despite an estimated wait of 15 min.\n\nOnce we were seated at one of the high tops next to the mural, we perused the menu to decide what to order.  Because I don't eat beef, I decided to go with the turkey dog ($5.50), style of the month for May (topped with pierogies, onions, and sour cream), as well as a veggie dog ($5.50), Angry Tiki style (topped with bacon, pineapple, hoisin sauce, and spicy cheese sauce).  CM decided to go with the bratwurst dog ($6.50), Mason Dixon style (topped with chili and coleslaw) on a wheat bun (+$.50) and a turkey dog, Big Ben style (topped with fries, cheese wiz, and cole slaw).  In addition to the dogs, we ordered a large order of fries, pub style ($8).\n\nThe fries were brought out first, per our request, so that we could munch on them.  I'm pretty sure they were the largest order of fries I've ever received--they would have solved the Irish potato famine in a jiffy!  They came drenched in cheese wiz and generously sprinkled with real bacon bits (not Bac-Os!), with a sizeable cup of ranch dressing on the side, which we promptly poured on, as well (yeah!).  Despite all the dressings, the fries were pleasantly crispy, due to being of the battered variety.  However, over the course of our meal, they became progressively more soggy, due to the dressings soaking into them.  Between the two of us, we finished about 2/3 of them--not too shabby, esp. for people of our size!\n\nAs for the dogs, to my surprise, I was more of a fan of the Angry Tiki than the pierogi dog of the month.  When it comes to the dogs themselves, I preferred the turkey dog to the veggie dog, which I found bland.  However, the toppings of the Angry Tiki dog were so flavorful that they masked the blandness of the veggie dog, which was only detectable when I bit into it alone.  Although I thought the turkey dog itself was more flavorful, I wasn't impressed as much by the toppings, which consisted of what were no doubt Mrs. T's pierogies and too many grilled onions for my taste (I removed many of them).  CM preferred the turkey dog to the bratwurst dog, and the Big Ben to the Mason Dixon style slightly, but enjoyed both styles.\n\nThe service at D's was friendly and efficient--our orders were placed and fulfilled promptly and with a smile.  During the short time that we waited for our food, CM and I enjoyed examining the mural, which contains many real life and fictitious characters, and the monk decorations on the other wall.  Although we didn't order any beer, we checked out the beer cave before leaving, and were quite impressed with the selection--now CM has a neighborhood go-to spot the next time he needs to bring a six pack to a party!  With the City Dining Card, our total came to $23, which I felt was quite reasonable for the amount and quality of food received. In sum, we were very pleased with our experience at D's, and would definitely return, esp. in light of the proximity to CM's residence and the extensive beer selection.", "business_id": "2X5G4Ujq0s4Wfn4TC7gX0g", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-05-03", "type": "review"}

As I walked up the stairs I notices ZERO customers in the store, however; two employees were working on the sales floor. I stood there like a jerk for a bit while both employees (one was the owner) kept to themselves. The owner did not respond to me for, at least, 10 minutes even though the store was empty and another employee was just walking around \"dusting\" (the store smalls like the inside of a mascot costume).\n\nWhen the owner, finally, saw me she made a little annoying noise like \"What the hell are YOU doing here!!\". She walked over slowly, like a zombie looking for fresh brains and giving a crap why I was there. She asked me to follow her as she took me downstairs to an absolutely empty storeroom (by that I mean: what was she doing that was was so important that she couldn't wait on a customer) and took her sweet-ass time to get the dress which, by the way, was a second alteration. You see, they screwed up the first time they altered the dress (even after my wife tried it on there and markings or whatever were made!). So everyone is entitled to a mistake even a business that claims perfection; it's important to give them a chance to redeem themselves. But, to my surprise, she handed me a bill for the second alteration!!!!!! Are you kidding me?!!!\n\nI argued a bit, but then gave in; what was I supposed to do? We were leaving to go 200 miles away the next day for the wedding. So I paid. Do not go here ladies!\n\nOh, if you think I'm exaggerating, feel free to Google this company and read the many reviews that make mine look like a compliment.

A voice from downstairs says \"I'm down here.\" So we turn around and start going down. She then starts up the stairs and says \"no go upstairs.\" She asked what I was there for and I told her I was in for a appointment to look at wedding dresses. And then she said \"No, what KIND of dress.\" A little taken, I calmly told her the style I liked. She took me into the room of dresses and said to look around. She did not offer to pull for me (she knows her stock, not me.) I found one dress I had a mild interest in trying on. She asked if I needed help trying it on. At this point, in no mood to deal with her, I said my friend would help me. We took the dress in the fitting room and noticed it was dirty and tattered. We tried it on as best we could (if anyone has tried wedding dresses on, you know how difficult that can be). As fast as we got it on, is as fast as we took it off and booked it to the door. No way I was placing the responsibility of ordering and altering a dress for my wedding day in this shop's hands. They can't even give you the courtesy of trying on their dresses.\nAll I can figure is this lady has zero patience and should not be working with the public.

So I had high hopes that my 9(!) bridesmaids would also have a good experience.\n\nThe pros: the dresses are beautiful and the prices are good! Overall, I loved my bridesmaid dresses.\n\nBut getting to that point was one disaster after another.  I had my bridesmaids pick from two different styles of dresses. Two bridesmaids and my maid of honor lived out of town and we were told they could order over the phone. \n\nSo after that was all taken care of... We waited and waited and waited. We ordered on February 1st. I was told that because of Chinese New Year (the dresses come from china) it would take about 10-12 weeks for them to come in. At the end of May, I called just to check in about my order. The girl who answered sounded confused and told me she'd have someone call me back. No one ever called. So I called again after a week and was told there was no way to track my order and that I'd have to continue waiting.\n\nThen, in June, my maid of honor calls me. She got a bridesmaid dress in the mail! Yay! But it was not the dress she ordered. Not even close. In fact, it had some other girl's name on it and a different wedding date. It was a dress from someone else's wedding. \nI had to travel back to the store to return that particular dress.\n\nFast forward to July (5 weeks before the wedding). The dresses finally arrive! They are the right sizes! The colors are pretty! I am relieved.... Until my one bridesmaid from out of town calls me to tell me they ordered her the wrong style dress. She's an easy-going gal and normally this wouldn't be a concern, but she had just given birth and was nursing and the dress they sent her was strapless and a little skimpy. \n\nI called to see how Candalina could possibly amend this and was told (by the owner's wife) that she shouldn't have ordered over the phone and that it must have been her fault for ordering the wrong dress! I asked to talk to the owner, but was told he was out of town. \n\nSo now I'm pretty livid. I travel there AGAIN to see if I could talk to someone in person. The woman who was there was very understanding, but couldn't really help me. She said there was no time to order another dress. No time to get additional fabric. She suggested buying a shrug in a \"close color\"\n\nIn the end, that bridesmaid got a partial refund for the dress. But that was after MUCH time and effort and after many conversations. \n\nThis experience was not worth the beautiful dresses. Save yourself the headache and stay away from this establishment. Planning a wedding is stressful enough, you don't need to deal with this mess of a business on top of it.", "business_id": "YSwiLSkOzH-gQU6PVJ9kmA", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-04-03", "type": "review"}

They assured me I could pick it up on Monday morning. \n\nMonday afternoon I stopped by and was told the suit wouldn't be there until 5:00PM. When I insisted that I had been told morning, she went into the back and came out with what I first thought was the suit but turned out to be only the jacket. She told me to come back after 5:00PM. When I asked to speak with the manager, she informed me that she was the only person there. I asked her to have the manager call me - she said the manager wouldn't answer the phone and reiterated the 5:00PM time when the last delivery came and petulantly informed me that none of this was her fault.\n\nAt 5:30PM I called and was told that the last delivery hadn't come yet and I'd have to call later. I again asked them to have the manager call me and she told me she couldn't give me the manager's phone number - which I hadn't asked for. I was again told this wasn't her fault. As of 7:00PM, the delivery finally arrived but not my pants.\n\nI was told the manager would call me after she arrived in the morning. I finally called at 9:00AM and was criticized by the manager for demanding her home phone number and told that there was never any guarantee about when clothes would be returned even when a rush was placed on them. \n\nApparently a *lot* of clothes were missing from the Monday delivery so I wasn't the only person upset about this situation.\n\nWhen I told them they'd lost my business for good, I was told that was fine and hung up on, forcing me to call again to find out exactly *when* I might be able to expect my missing pants.\n\nAt this point I'm still waiting and will be for the next three hours. In the meantime, I have to go out and try to find a suit that I can afford as a replacement just in case. \n\nI absolutely cannot recommend Regency Cleaners.

Every time... EVERY TIME we went there, we left reeking of smoke.  There's no smoking inside, of course, but it always happened.  Maybe it's due to poor ventilation, or the fact that the employees were regularly outside smoking, but we always left smelling like we were in a bar.\n\nThen, the tables were usually dirty.  When we would order our drink, we would usually have to get ourselves a napkin, wet it, and wipe our table ourselves. Not surprising, as most of the employees I've encountered there (with the exception of the very nice older woman) seemed pretty put out when I asked for anything.\n\nIn any case, we have internet access at home now, and haven't been back to Katerbean since.

How nostalgic you are.\n\nWe were the proud owners of a gift card to Applebee's (Christmas gift!) and the best part of this gift was my boyfriend's reaction to me later.  He has never been to an Applebee's.  Or an Olive Garden.  Or a Chili's.  His first time at a Red Lobster was with me when we were stuck in a strip mall hell for the night.  So he's new to these restaurants, which so many of us grew up with.  I'd only been to an Applebee's a handful of times, but I was down to go back - it seems like they sort of have everything, no matter what you're hungry for.\n\nSince we're spending all our time now packing to move back to Chicago (WOOHOO!), we don't always have time to make dinner.  So we busted out the Applebee's gift card and journeyed to Edgewood Towne Center for some chain restaurant foods.  \n\nWhen we arrived, this server really awkwardly asked us to sit at the bar.  I missed the finer points of the interaction, since he was talking to my boyfriend, but he basically insinuated that he'd just sat some large tables, or something, and it was his turn to have a table in his section but he didn't have the time to serve us, or something, and he didn't want us to wait (for what, I'm not sure) so he was basically like \"Can you sit at the bar?\"  Which was weird because there were like, at least a dozen open tables.   But whatevs.  The cool kids sit at the bar, and we are the cool kids.\n\nChuck, the bartender, was running this show.  Dude.  He was on top of everything.  Taking orders, serving drinks, answering phones, getting takeout orders, keeping his bar neat and tidy - he was HOPPING!  We were both in awe just watching him.  That man is earning his tips, for reals.  So I'd recommend sitting at the bar if Chuck is working.  He's also cute, so bonus there.  The Applebee's bar is kind of a hilarious place - random people having drinks as if it's a real bar and not a restaurant, this one lady READING A BOOK WITH A GLASS OF WINE like it was some fancy cafe, some annoying fratty people....and us.  A healthy mix.\n\nI had a Shock Top and my boyfriend had a Sam Adams - mad props for Shock Top on draft, not expecting that from Applebee's.  We ordered spinach and artichoke dip, which I believe was half price (as are all apps) during happy hour.  It was served with regular tortilla chips (like from a bag) but the dip itself was pretty tasty.  It was served in a really wide but shallow crock, and tasted appropriately spinachy and cheesy.  It was served very hot and was pretty satisfying!\n\nMy side salad arrived shortly thereafter, and it was amusingly huge for a side.  Iceberg lettuce, cherry tomatoes, crispy croutons, shredded cheese, tangy bottled Italian dressing on the side.  I bought it to balance out my entree, but somehow these iceberg lettuce salads never really feel healthy, you know? Like eating crispy water.  With cheese and croutons.  YAY HEALTH!\n\nThen came the entrees - I got an order of wings (which I think is technically listed as an appetizer) with \"Sweet and Spicy Sauce\" which was listed as the second-hottest sauce on the menu.  They were pretty decent - served hot, juicy chicken, and the sauce was sweet and sticky.  It was a little *too* sweet for me - picture gloopy Chinese takeout in sweet sticky sauce, and that's what the wing sauce was like - but it still made a satisfying meal.  My boyfriend got one of their \"special burgers\" from their new New Orleans menu -something like a Bourbon Bacon burger.  They asked him \"pink or no pink\" which we thought was funny.  He said \"pink,\" and the burger came out with like, a tiny touch of maybe-pink in the middle.  Medium-rare, this ain't!  He said it was okay.  Not great.  Just a burger.  I didn't taste it, I just nibble on a few of his fries, which were pretty average.\n\nThat all came in at around $30, aided greatly by the happy hour appetizer discount.  I have no interest in going to Applebee's again because I can get better burgers, pasta, chicken, bar food, everything, etc anywhere else, but if I was road tripping and needed a place to stop, this wouldn't be a bad choice.  Sit at the bar and hope Chuck is there, and enjoy pretty average versions of American bar food.", "business_id": "h3la53L9-OX_HlfeAySh0Q", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-03-01", "type": "review"}

Horrible service! Took 15 mins to even take a drink order...then when I had a question about a speciality wine the waiter says he didn't know so ok no big deal, could he go find.. NO! Told me to go the bar and ask the bartender. Really?!? Then the chef came out and was pretty good although cooked everything separate starting  with only onions and zucchini, where's the veggies?? From start to finish it was about half an hour! If we ate the dinner as a whole it would've been cold.. So we ate as we went. Also drink refills were a tough task too.. the chef had to keep asking other servers to assist. few and far between!! We had 3 birthdays at our table.. Not one song , which I didn't care, not one complimentary picture, no dessert was offered until another customer said something. Then the bill.. Oh the bill... That took another 15 mins!! At this point I told my family to go ahead home and I will wait considering this overall experience was almost a 2 hour ordeal. I was double charged on two items. At this point I was DONE dealing with this incompetent and appethetic waiter!!! Went to settle my bill with the manager who was nice and accommodating. Rectified the errors. And was generous with a $20 refund! I told him about the experience and all he said was \"I can take picture now for you\" UM... I was by myself!!! No thanks! One last thing, the male greeter needs some drug intervention.. He was high as a kite and made my daughter & I feel very uncomfortable to the point of invading our personal space and staring with those glazed over eyes as he staggered to and from his post.

It was my granddaughter's 4th birthday and thought she'd get a kick out of a hibachi chef. Fist we wait 45 mins or so to be seated. The restaurant wasn't even half full. We chose the dinner portion instead of the lunch because by this time we were very hungry and the waitress said we would get larger portions. She lied. Our hibachi chef was absolutely horrible! He spoke so softly that you couldn't hear anything he said. He barely spoke and didn't put on any kind of show at all! Our 4 year old was so bored that she wanted to leave. The other party that was seated with us all ordered the lunch versions and they got more food! The chef mixed everything together so no one got a larger portion than anyone else. The only thing that we got instead of them was a half a slice of zuccini and a little bit of onions. None of us even like onions. My \"steak\" was at least 1/4 fat which the chef cut off and disposed of which didn't even leave enough for a small sandwich. By the time our main course was served our vegetables and rice were ice cold. We asked to speak to the manager who told us that they weigh the portions in the back before they bring them out to cook them. However like I said the chicken was all mixed together and at least 1/4 of my steak was complete fat and thrown out. The manager didn't seem to care at all about our situation. We paid almost $10 a meal extra for the \"dinner\" portion. He could have easily knocked it down to the \"lunch\" price, but he refused. After all this, we over heard another chef complaining that the place had new owners and everyone quit.  I for one will never, EVER, go back there and would suggest everyone who reads this to stay away.

The furnishings, carpet, set up hasn't changed in years and the staff/food isn't always up to par. I can eat Paleo here though, which was a new discovery. I've always appreciated sushi, but I never ordered it raw without the fun additions of tempura, sesame seeds, soy sauce, cream cheese, and everything else that makes sushi AWESOME, so this was a new experience. I ordered the Tuna Tatiki, which was 10 chunks of raw tuna. I ordered it without sauce or seeds. It was a little tough to get down because there were so many pieces and after a couple raw pieces, I needed some extra searing, which they did for me no problem! The server was wonderful- she was helpful and had no problem going to extra mile for someone with diet restrictions! I was very happy about this because the last time we sat in the bar, our waiter was really odd. He didn't explain the foods and extra charges (our waiter last night did) and he seemed like we were bothering him. I was happy to have a better experience last night, but I do think that Benihana needs to monitor their staff better. I had negative experiences twice related to incompetent staff, which really made my overall feeling of Benihana go from positive to neutral. Not to mention, the last time I was there, perhaps because we got hibachi at the bar, but it was not very good at all, and I got the most expensive dinner on the menu: \"Ocean's Treasure.\" More recently when I visited Benihana though (the same time I got the raw tuna), I had a better experience- I ordered salmon and yellowtail sashimi. I was very nervous to bite into a raw cut of fish by itself, but was pleasantly surprised at how good the cuts of fish were. The yellowtail had a sweeter taste and the salmon was less sweet, but more flavorful. It was a great to jump outside of my comfort zone and appreciate the rawest of the raw food! I would definitely recommend Benihana due to its location- I love that it is on a hill all to itself, and it's unique mark in Pittsburgh, but I would choose other hibachi restaurants before I would choose this one.", "business_id": "1vQLTKwmcmZXtNzfKEvMmA", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-03-23", "type": "review"}

Honestly, the only time I have ever been to Benihana has been for birthdays. As many yelpers noted- their parking lot is VERY odd. Be prepared.\n\nI wanted to try some items that I never had at Benihana before, so I decided I would be adventurous and try some sushi....vegetable sushi that is (I am not a seafood lover). The vegetable roll consisted of: green leaf, avocado, cucumber, tomato, red cabbage and yamagobo. I dipped it in some soy sauce and added a small dab of wasabi to each bite. I didn't love it- I think sushi just all around is not something that I enjoy the taste of. \n\nFor my meal, I ordered the hibachi chicken. My boyfriend ordered the spicy hibachi chicken. The first course was soup. It was a light, chicken broth based mushroom and green onion soup and it was decent, nothing crazy or packed with flavor. The salad came shortly after- ice berg lettuce, cherry tomatoes, thinly sliced radishes and ginger dressing. I loved the dressing! I wasn't a fan of the mediocre choice of greens and vegetables though. \n\nThe main portion of the Benihana/hibachi experience, is the show. Our chef was very nice and very talented. He recognized the birthday girl at our table and gave her a special chef's hat, haha. He prepared our vegetables, shrimp appetizer and main entrees in front of us. The vegetables consisted of zucchini and onions. I agree with other yelpers- the vegetables could be improved. The portion isn't very large and more variety could be added. Having said that, they were delicious. The shrimp was also very tasty. \n\nMy entire table ordered the fried rice with their meal and I HIGHLY recommend doing so, rather than ordering the white rice. The fried rice is made fresh right in front of you and is very good! The yum-yum sauce, of course, is the icing on the cake... SO GOOD. It went perfectly with the rice, chicken, veggies and shrimp. My whole table asked for additional sauce to go and the staff was very friendly and super accommodating! The hibachi chicken was very good and came with saut\u00e9ed mushrooms. I really enjoyed my boyfriend's spicy hibachi chicken- the sauce was wonderful.  \n\nAt the end of the meal, everyone had a choice of sorbet. I had the rainbow sorbet- it was the perfect ending to a delicious meal. The staff also took our picture and printed a copy for the birthday girl.\n\nBenihana is not my favorite place to eat at all, but they are a great place to go for a birthday. The staff was wonderful, the food was good and we all had a great time.

The soup came out quick (the only good thing that happened) we finally got our food - I swear it took like 30 minutes. I got my burger and it was very pink in the middle, but had the waiter asked how I wanted my burger cooked, he would of known that I wanted it done and not pink. However, there was NO WAY I was sending it back. I didn't even eat all of it. I gave half of it to my husband to eat. The fries are very salty. NEVER did our waiter come and ask if the food was ok, how we are - nothing. RUDE! Then he comes by and says \"Your cookies will be right up\" - like ok? We don't get a choice of which ones we want? I guess not, so we get the cookies - they are outstanding, as always, but not worth the trip. This whole \"adventure\" took a hour and half. Others around us that didn't have our waiter seemed to have better service, so I am wondering if it was who waited on us? Either way, I am not going back to find out. \n\nHow disappointing, because we recently moved here to Pittsburgh from Virginia where they took out our Max and Erma's - we loved it there, so we couldn't wait to go back to one - how quickly we found out not all are the same....", "business_id": "SgQYRICpMdWCmY7wM2Cmcw", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-03-15", "type": "review"}

There's a Giant Eagle (grocery store) in walking distance! Can you say CONVIENT! Free breakfast buffet for the guest? SAY WHAT?

I was traveling in Pittsburgh for work and picked this Holiday Inn due to it's proximity to downtown. I was not disappointed. This has been one of the better hotels I have stayed in.\n\nThe facility is very clean and the staff is very helpful. You can tell they recently renovated. Their workout facility was great, which is a nice change of pace from the majority of the hotels I have stayed in. The rooms are very spacious and have a refrigerator and microwave. This is great if you don't feel like going out to eat. There is a Giant Eagle right down the street too.\n\nThe hotel offers free wifi which has great speed and makes working from your room easy. There is a shuttle service that runs from the hotel to down town ever hour. All you have to do is ask the front desk and they will help you coordinate. They offer a free breakfast in the morning which is always great as well.\n\nThe next time I am in the Pittsburgh area I will be returning.", "business_id": "chDzLfj8CqvsJq4wzW1ZqQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-05-21", "type": "review"}

I really only had one complaint.....the internet! Like other reviews said the internet connection in the rooms is shotty. I would say it worked 40% of the time. Super annoying.\n\nOther than that I had a great stay. The staff was so unbelievably friendly, front desk and  house keeping. Really awesome people, I got to know them through the week. The room was clean. I had a suite which was nice because it had a living room and full kitchen. I didn't pay extra I just asked for it...they gave it to me no charge. I assume because my stay was Sunday to Friday the hotel was in no way full so why not. \n\nThis really is a great hotel option in Pitt. I must say I would have never stayed here if it had not been the class location but after I did I think I will look for hotels in this class in the future. I normally am someone snooty who likes to stay in some fancy boutique downtown (wherever) for nearly $300 a night. This place was 1/3 of the cost and was perfectly fine. \n\nThe shuttle takes people downtown in like 10 mins.... no biggie. May as well pay low $100s than high $200s and just take the shuttle. \n\nBreakfast is included but left a bit to be desired for a food snob like myself. I had some whole foods granola in my room. No on site restaurant...honestly I could care less in a big city who eats dinner at the hotel anyway. Bar would be nice tho. \n\nSolid low priced option.", "business_id": "chDzLfj8CqvsJq4wzW1ZqQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-03-17", "type": "review"}

Now I have a whole grain bagel with hummus. \n\nI will say their pretzel bagels are rather good, nice crust and crunch from salt, a chewy center and makes an awesome pizza bagel.\n\nTheir bagels are pretty expensive, a baker's dozen and a container of cream cheese is over 14 bucks.

Maybe it was just the hairdresser I booked an appointment with, but I did not have a great experience. I'm a nurse who works mostly day shifts, and I value sleep over styling my hair in the morning. I tried to articulate that I wanted a hair cut that required minimal styling on my part. The hairdresser immediately shot me down, asking me how I expected to have my hair look nice if I wasn't willing to put work into it. She then berated me for not using styling products-- again, I'd rather sleep. \n\nNow, maybe a few people feel differently about their hair, but all I wanted was a cut that allowed for minimal styling on my part. I wasn't asking for some trendy 'do that needed 3 different products, a round brush, and a flat iron in order to re-create it. I ended up getting almost the same exact cut I had going in there (just an inch shorter). Oh, and she also told me the cut I had coming in wasn't entirely flattering because of it's blunt ends--- funny, I ended up with the same thing. \n\nThis experience has definitely made me decide never to go back, for $50 I expect a little bit better service and a little bit nicer treatment. Oh, and somewhere that isn't constantly pushing products.", "business_id": "ih6d7hBWss05xXWUznuFaw", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-03-31", "type": "review"}

I am so happy!\n\nI had been wanting to try MCN for quite some time, and I pass the salon almost every day so on a whim I finally just called and made a same day appointment for a womens cut.  I said I did not have a preference as to which \"level\" my stylist was, and they were able to fit me in with Margeaux.\n\nIf you can, book an appointment with her!  She should be Marg-WHOA--bc my hair looked FANTASTIC after we were done!  And trust me, my hair never looks fantastic.  \n\nI was greeted warmly when I arrived and offered a beverage.  There was an adorable bull dog in the salon, and the dog ALSO  greeted me.  I loved it!  So cute and wrinkly...\n\nMargeaux was warm and friendly and I felt comfortable talking to her about how i wanted my hair to look.  I believe I told her, \"I want my hair to look not like this,\" (pointing at my current hair).  My hair was limp and I'd dyed it black for the past 3 years.  I needed a change.  \n\nI was kind of shocked when Margeaux told me she could get the black dye out of my hair bc stylists have told me that before, and it was a disaster every time.  There is a huge difference between what you get in a low end salon and a high end salon.  Margeaux explained the process to me, the science behind why it would work, brought me magazines, and spent the next hour or so foiling my hair.\n\nIts always kind of awkward when you meet someone for time and have to have small talk---I really enjoyed having Margeaux work on my hair.  I just LIKED her, she was easy to talk to and it wasnt that awkward, \"What do you do?  Where do you live?\" conversation you typically have with a hairdresser for the first time.  We just had a normal conversation and as I  said before, I had a really good time.\n\nAll of the stylists there were extremely nice.  Kara came over and asked me how I was doing a few times, and several stylists stopped over to check on my transformation throughout the process.  Everyone was so nice I'd feel comfortable in any of their chairs.\n\nMy quick haircut ended up being a 4 hour appointment.  It takes a lot of time to get a lot of black dye out of your hair.\n\nSHE SERIOUSLY GOT THE DYE OUT OF MY HAIR.  Seriously...whoa!\n\nI have a new hair color, and she gave me a fantastic cut.  I cannot more highly recommend her.  I loved my hair and I have never left a salon loving my ahir before, I always leave thinking, \"It will look cute when it grows out a little bit and I style it myself.\"\n\nWe are talking hair miracle.\n\nI cut 5 inches off my hair and left without scissor shock.  Ok, maybe a little, I had a major transformation, but I love it.\n\nI had mentioned I want hair i dont have to style every day and Margeaux said she could do that.  She wasn't kidding.  Even my freaking BED HEAD looks adorable.\n\nBED HEAD.  yeah.  worth the price at any cost.\n\nThis is not the cheapest salon but if you need a major change like I did, it is worth it to spend the money.  My cut and extreme color work came to $240 but I dont think this is typical, you have to keep in mind I came in with jet black hair that had ot be stripped, toned, corrected, and now I've got medium auburn hair.  \n\nSo it probably costs a bit less if you're not having a complete hair color over haul.\n\nI highly recommend this place and cannot more strongly recommend Margeaux!", "business_id": "ih6d7hBWss05xXWUznuFaw", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-04-13", "type": "review"}

I've recommended some of my friends to him who have had bad color jobs and he's been able to fix their disasters.\n\nI tend to be someone who is open to letting my stylist do 'whatever they think works best' because let's face it, they are the expert. Even though I've been seeing him for years, he still always asks how I have been styling my hair and so forth to get me the right cut that works for me at that time. For example, in the summer, I love to let my hair air dry. He makes sure that during that season, the cut is going to work for how I'm planning to style my hair. His recommendations on products to achieve certain looks are spot on as well. I can replicate what he tells me to do at home and that's important to me.\n\nHe's friendly, professional and he makes the appointment a lot of fun.

I explained that I needed a haircut that was intended for curly hair, with layers and not so symmetrical. I wanted a cut while the hair was dry but I let her do what was best for her, knowing that most stylist don't work this way. So she cut my hair wet, dried it and finished while it was dry. I got a cut that's a bit too short (that's the problem with cutting curly hair while wet - it \"shrinks\" once it dries) but I really like it!\n\nThe hair salon is very trendy. It was busy at the time I showed, one weekday afternoon. Two bulldogs came in after being walked and hang out at the back of the salon.

Then out walked Jenna, super bright, bouncy personality.  She listened to what I said about wanting to maintain some natural texture, volume and curl.  Also about wanting to maintain as much length as possible while still getting rid of my split ends (I hadn't had my hair cut in almost two years so it was a wreck).  I was really intimidated when I saw the sheer amount of hair falling to the floor and especially when she broke out the razor, but when she had finished it was EXACTLY what I had asked for.  She even used the appropriate products (most of the other women walking out of there had also beautifully done cuts but were much more polished, which is not what I was going for and I really appreciate that she listened and had the know-how to apply it gracefully when I said I didn't want to be overstyled).  I normally hate fresh hair cuts and it takes a couple weeks of the hair growing out for me to get accustomed to it, but this was perfect.  It was exactly the feeling you should have walking out of a salon.
