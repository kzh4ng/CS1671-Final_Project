I tried the mashed potatoes and found that they too came from a package; but, again, they didn't taste bad with the brown gravy.

After our visit yesterday, however, I don't think we'll be back. When we arrived we were greeted by a long line of people waiting to buy game cards.

The girl that was left was more than incompetent, and was taking extremely long to fill these game cards.

The floors were filthy with trash, and the bathrooms: repulsive! I had to use the restrooms twice during our visit, and not only did both bathrooms I used have no toilet paper in them, but there was TP all over the floors, and the sinks were less than cleanly. My boyfriend mentioned that the guys restroom was no better, as it smelled like pee and the paper towel dispenser didn't work. All I have to say is get your crap together. We could see a difference in the type of crowed that was there on Saturday compared to what it used to be, and I'm I have no doubt it's due to the poor service and attention to cleanliness.

I came to the Homestead location last night eager to see the beer at this location.\n\nNow, Rockbottom is a chain brewery, so a lot was the same... the menu, the food prices (yet beer is cheaper, and I am fine with that). I have always found their food to be pricey, but they use excellent ingredients and it has always been tasty and filling so I am fine with that. The food here was just as good as the Long Beach location, so I have no problem with the chef at all.\n\nService was good, our waitress was very friendly and helpful. I wish that they had asked us if we wanted to sit in the bar since happy hour was still going, but that isn't a big thing. Went to the bar to get a drink and had to wait awhile to get the bartender's attention, but he was very friendly and I got a nice welcome from him and others at the bar when they learned I had just moved here... I really enjoyed that.\n\nBeer: We got the beer sampler to try the whole list... and, well... I found the dark beers a bit lacking in comparison. The light beer and the wheat were amazing, very impressed. The pale was ok, as was the velvet pale that was one of the specials of the night... but both were way too citrusy. The Uppity IPA was very good... I don't usually like IPAs because the hops overpowers all flavor but the brewer had a good balance. Still, couldn't do a whole glass. I felt the Imperial Stout had a bitter burned taste that was overpowering... I almost want to say the batch had too much chocolate malt in it (not ice cream malt, for the non-homebrewers). The brown and amber were decent, but bland. I ended up getting an actual glass of the light beer and was able to finish it all without forcing it.... one point up on Long Beach, who had a good light but the aftertaste got to you before the glass was empty.\n\nI REALLY wanted to try the Das Gut Dopplebock, but they were out. Looks like they will have it in bottles to go soon so I hope I can catch that. Also want to try the Snow Moon Belgian.\n\nVerdict: While I was not too impressed with the dark beers, I found the lighter ones very good and I look forward to trying the other seasonal beers.

I got the Catch of the Day, Off the Hook, Fish Dish, Sailors Delight or something(I forget it had some cheesy fish themed name).  It was cod (meh, that should have been the sign not to get it) with roasted asparagus and lemon rice.  The fish was suppose to be broiled but it had a thick breading (annoyed) and the portion of fish was tiny. The rice and asparagus were great though. \n\nMy friend got a chicken sandwich which he enjoyed although the fries were pathetic.  The fries were probably pre-cut frozen fries or just very poorly executed.  They were so thin that you have to grab a huge handful just to get any actual potato flavor.\n\nPros: A lot of tables (no wait), brew special beers, big menu, could hear the dueling piano bar next door\n\nCons: Place was fairly empty and we got a crappy table by the door when it was 5 degrees outside, most of the food was fried, cheese filled, cream based, or wrapped in bacon.  I know some people love to eat food like this all the time( I do every once in awhile) but if you eat out a lot you can't always get the spin dip, burger, and ice cream sundae.  (I would love to but its just not in my cards). I do like like when causal places offer some healthy options.", "business_id": "McikHxxEqZ2X0joaRNKlaw", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-01-25", "type": "review"}

Also, I've found the service is generally better in the bar area than the dinner area.  Join the Mug Club, even if you don't go often, and rack up points for free mugs and beers.

I say \"surprised' because with any restaurant that falls into the slippery territory of a \"chain\", you expect to find your fair share of culinary duds.  But I've really had a lot of good meals at Rock Bottom.  Now, granted, you do owe it to yourself when ordering to not forget where you are (a \"bar-straunt\" if you will), and don't get anything above and beyond this place's call of duty.  For instance, I will never be ordering the ahi tuna.  I'll leave that to my favorite sushi bars and restaurants a bit closer to the water (the Mon doesn't count.....).\n\nBut besides that, I always really enjoy my meal choices.  I've recently gotten the chicken avocado sandwich.  Chicken was grilled perfectly, plenty of avocado, and it was a good sized sandwich without being excessive.  I've also ordered the Margherita pizza, which could definitely be split between two people.  It's an eight cut that comes to you on a big wooden pizza paddle.  The pizza was really great.  The crust was crispy, it had a good balance of cheese and tomatoes, and the basil pesto was fresh and tasty.  And not greasy whatsoever - BIG bonus points there.  But my biggest surprise as of late was when I ordered their chicken flautas.  I'm a HUGE Mexican food fan and always hesitate to order Mexican outside of a Mexican restaurant for fear of being disappointed.  But I had an insatiable craving one night and decided to go for it.  It was DELICIOUS.  The flautas are deep fried which gives you an amazing crunch, and they still managed to not dry out the inner ingredients.  The accompanying rice was nice and moist as well.  I was so happy!\n\nI've always been quite happy with the service there as well.  I go on Thursday evenings for trivia, and nine times out of ten the service is really spot on.  The ladies servicing the bar area are friendly and attentive.  Only once or twice, to my memory, has my service been sub-par, and that can usually be chalked up to an extremely packed Trivia Night with only two visible servers helping 50+ people.\n\nI definitely give Rock Bottom two thumbs up for taking your typical chain-found food and making it fresh, yummy, and worth coming back for more.", "business_id": "McikHxxEqZ2X0joaRNKlaw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-01-23", "type": "review"}

The place was pretty busy, we had to walk around the bar area for several minutes until a nice couple told us they were about to leave and we could have their bar table.  As nice as this was of them it was awkward standing over them as they finished their drinks paid their bill and left.  \n\nSo finally seated I look over the drinks and being the huge IPA lover that I am I went with that and it was indeed a good choice.  The hubby had the Red Ale which was also rather good.\n\nThe service was OK, not the best not the worst.  But moving on to more important thing, the food.  Talk about missing the mark hugely!  I ordered the mini street fish tacos.  You get four mini tacos with a marinated in lime piece of fish, and tomatillo salsa.  They were just strokes away from inedible.  I love fish tacos, I mean it is such a simple concept so why do people have such a hard time executing this dish? The shells were hard and literally split at the bottom when I picked them up.  The sour cream sprayed all over the plate only made them messy and the poor fish was just so overcooked.  If I wasn't so hungry I wouldn't have eaten them at all! Lesson learn on that.\n\nThe husband had the BBQ Chicken Pizza.  It had beans and corn with roasted red pepper on it along with some sour cream.  My husband is usually the type that will order these lovely specialty pizza's and ask for them to remove all the wonderful unique toppings!  For instance, he would usually just say, Chicken BBQ and cheese, nothing else!  I refused to let him do that this time, because I was really intrigued in the combination of ingredients on this pie.  And boy was I jealous when it came out.  It blew my crappy tacos out of the water!  Should have stuck with something simple.  \n\nFurthermore I could care less if I come back to this location.  The beers were good but hell you can get a decent IPA just about anywhere anymore.  And the underwhelming food sealed the deal.

Now that my palate has matured and I no longer think chicken fingers and french fries are gourmet cuisine, I really can't find anything to eat in a place like this.  \n\nMy husband and I were running errands at the Waterfront, and we needed to find a place for lunch.  We decided on Uno because pizza sounded good to us.  My husband is a meat lover, so I agreed to let him order us a meat-covered pizza.  To counteract this a little, I ordered a tomato mozzarella salad, so we'd at least have some vegetables in the mix.  \n\nWhen the salad arrived, it did NOT look like the picture.  The menu description is thus: \"chopped lettuce, roma tomatoes with basil and garlic, buffalo mozzarella, drizzled with balsamic syrup.\"  This description is accompanied by a bright, colorful picture of a salad with bright green lettuce, bright red tomatoes, and a delicate \"drizzling\" of balsamic syrup.  It looks light and yummy.\n\nWhat we got, however, was soggy yellow and white iceberg lettuce, COMPLETELY DRENCHED in dressing, a total of four tiny pieces of tomato, and some cheese.  It was DISGUSTING.  There was so much dressing dripping off of this dish, it was more like a soup than a salad.  I suspect that the lettuce was so wilted and brown, they figured they could disguise it by completely soaking it in dressing.  Not only was it disgusting, but it cost us about $10.  $10 for complete inedible slop.  \n\nThe \"numero uno\" pizza we got was nothing to write home about either.  It was ok... very mediocre.  The crust tasted like it was undercooked, and the sauce tasted like plain tomato sauce with no seasoning whatsoever.  I have been to Chicago many times, had real Chicago deep dish many times, and this just doesn't even come close to the real thing.  \n\nThe ONLY positive I give this restaurant is they have the kiosk in the front where you can look up the calorie count of the food right there.  It would be better if they'd actually print it on the menu, but they are still doing better than most restaurants in this effort.  They are making strides, too, with their whole grain crust options.  I'm sure there's still a lot of room for improvement, however.  If you're listening, Uno, please work on providing your customers with healthier food - not just healthy options like salads, but work on making the main dishes you serve better for your customers (low-fat cheese, low-sugar sauce, less sodium, etc.).   Their hearts will applaud you.  \n\nAnd lastly, why does every chain restaurant have to decorate with old signs?  Is there some sort of chain restaurant decorating requirement I don't know about?  It's baffling.", "business_id": "6p9TlP2I8S4agxYMNFSDjg", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-12-27", "type": "review"}

Reading the other reviews, it makes me wonder if people were a the same restaurant I was.  Sure, it isn't a world class dining establishment, but it is decent considering it is a chain.  You should know that going into any chain, really.  It was basically exactly what I expected in terms of food quality and price.\n\nWe were greeted immediately upon entering, and while the hostess went to grab menus, another server asked us if we were taken care of.  Service at our table was very attentive and water and other beverages were promptly refilled.  I ordered soup and two appetizers instead of an entree or pizza and the server made sure to ask me about the order in which I would prefer receiving my food.  \n\nMy fiance ordered a deep dish pizza and we know they take longer to make than other food items.  It was quicker than we thought it would be and he really enjoyed it.  I had the potato skin appetizer.  It reminds me of a \"baked potato pizza\" that I used to enjoy at a local place back in Buffalo.  It was delicious, especially with the addition of a little bit of hot sauce.\n\nOverall, it doesn't even come close to visiting an Uno's in Chicago, but then again, when does a copy every live up to the original?  It won't be a regular location in our  dining rotation, but it is good to know that when we have a craving for deep dish, Uno will do the trick and cost a lot less than a trip to Chicago.", "business_id": "6p9TlP2I8S4agxYMNFSDjg", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-02-05", "type": "review"}

I love everything about crunch crust, a nice rich tomato sauce, and a thick layer of melted cheese. I have never tried Chicago style pizza before and when we had to rescue our friends from car troubles, Uno's was right there so we decided to try it out. \n\nOnly a 30 minute wait for a Saturday is pretty good for any restaurant in the Waterfront. We were seated at a booth in the bar area. The tables were clean and it was a big booth so the four of us were not squished. Only complaint, the bar was loud and when they did blended drinks you had to pause your conversation because the blenders were so loud. Good news, only happened twice!\n\nThe four of us decided to order two pizzas, the Pepperoni and the Farmers Market. I also ordered a Caesar salad because I needed more vegetables in my life.  \n\nThe salad. It was a big salad that I shared with my boyfriend. The croutons were huge and very crunchy. The Caesar dressing was not creamy, it was vinegar based and had a little bit of a \"bite\" to it as Chris kept on saying. I thought the bite had more to do with the vinegar than anything spicy, but who am I to say.  The lettuce was fresh and crunchy and they even added tomatoes like I requested. \n\nThe main dishes came out about 10 minutes later. I do not know what I was expecting but the pizzas were not as large as I was imagining. Two of the larger pizzas looked like personal pizzas to me. But!!!! I was soon to see that even if they are a bit smaller they were filled to perfection. \n\nThe Farmers Market pizza had caramelized onions, spinach, SUN DRIED AMAZING TOMATOES, regular tomatoes, eggplant, pesto as a sauce, and a blend of cheeses. The crust was perfection being so crisp and light that I stole Chris' extra from his plate. The sun dried tomatoes were great adding just enough sweetness to the pizza that I went looking for the slices with the most on them. It was a really really good pizza. We even ended up taking slices home with us! My eyes deceived me at first with the size! \n\nThen our friends told us that we had to try the cookie pizza. Cookie pizza? What sorcery is this? Matt, the one who suggested it said that we would not be disappointed. This cookie came out in a really large, bigger than our pizzas, dish. It had three scoops of icecream on it with a pile of whipped cream. WARM, right out of the oven, fresh cookie pizza. Oh sweet heavens, it was good. I am glad that I had enough room in my stomach to pile in that sweet goodness. \n\nChicago Pizza, I would absolutly try again.", "business_id": "6p9TlP2I8S4agxYMNFSDjg", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-01-06", "type": "review"}

My only encounter with my beloved Uno was when my mother came home with a take out box that she ordered for lunch that day.  I would scarf down the thick wedges of pizza and greedily pick off the loose toppings from the box. The cold 4 hour old pizza has since plagued my mind.  I desperately tried to find an Uno but found that the nearest one had closed down. CLOSED DOWN. My dreams were crushed, my psyche disturbed. I had become a changed person. I wanted more. I needed more. My mother stopped coming home with Uno take out boxes. I stopped eating pizza. I hated the flimsy crusts that were just cheap variants from my beloved Uno, I despised the New york style that you could so easily fold. Feh, I would resign from eating pizza till I had my precious. My precious, my Uno deep dish. \n\nIt wasn't until that fated day when I drove past an Uno. The neon lights called out to me, it was like seeing heaven for the first time. I stumbled into the Uno.

I sat down and ordered the Numero Uno with a side of fries.  \"No not personal...Regular.\" I wanted the entire thing, not just a wedge of a dream. I wanted the whole thing. \n\nIt came out, steaming. Bubbling. Oozing. Fresh. So fresh. I took a bite - the cheese was perfectly melted. And then another - the dough was so thick and tasteful.

How crude! \n\nSpoke to the manager after paying the full check and first of all, she did not even offer to re-imburse for the item we did not even order, and that had been forcibly thrust upon us. \n\nWhen I asked the manager about the Buffalo Chicken sandwich not having any lettuce and tomato, she said they just got new menus and that description is not correct and that Buffalo Chicken Sandwich is supposed to be without lettuce and tomato! What a lame excuse!

I decided on the Clark Bar.  \n\nI've only been to the Clark Bar once before for lunch about three years ago. I remember being impressed with the Boomer Burger and even tweeted the following about it: \"Just had a Boomer Burger at the Clark Bar for #lunch. Half pound of deliciousness discovered on the N. Shore of #pgh\" (the accompanying pic that I took that day is uploaded here). So I came back to drink a few beers and have some dinner with my lady before the show. \n\nSpeaking of beers, there's a limited selection of craft beers here.  As of this writing, on tap they've got Penn Marzen, Dogfish Head 60 min and Sam Adams Cold Snap.  In bottles there's Bells Two Hearted IPA and Sierra Nevada Pale Ale (they also listed Blue Moon and IC Light as craft beers but I'm sorry, I don't think so).\n\nI walked in the door at around 5:30 and I noticed that it wasn't too crowded; possibly due to the weather.  There were four guys at the bar and a couple of tables were occupied but nothing like I've experienced at the establishments on the other side of the parking lot.\n\nWhile waiting for my date to join me, I started with a Sam Adam's Cold Snap as a tribute to the day's February, single digit, temps before moving on to the Marzen. Both were decent beers, very drinkable, but nothing all that special.\n\nIt was pushing close to 7:00 when we decided to order dinner. By that time we were the only people left in the bar.  We asked the bartender about the crowd they get and if this is normal for a Friday night.  He said that lunchtime is normally their busiest time and he gets a few regulars that work in the building after 5:00 for a bite and a few drinks. Other than those times, it's before and after the ball games that draws the most business (as you would expect).\n\nThe menu is pretty simple offering a few appetizers, salads, burgers, sandwiches and the \"House Specialty\" Fish and Chips.  There were also specials listed on a chalk board at the entrance announcing drink specials, wings and a Cajun burger.  I decided I would go Cajun tonight. My girlfriend settled on a turkey burger. \n\nMy Cajun burger was spicy good delicious; perfectly grilled with a slice of pepper jack cheese and hot pepper rings balanced with a tomato slice and lettuce. I also got a sample slice of my lady's turkey burger (yeah, we do that) and it was juicy goodness as well topped with cheddar cheese, onion, lettuce and tomato. Her burger came with slaw and mine with fries.\n\nOverall this is a casual, easy bar.  They obviously recognize their Pittsburgh roots and being nestled between the two stadiums they cater to the Pittsburgh sports fan.  Photos of past local sports teams and legends adorn the walls in a relatively tasteful manner. But what's really cool is all of the autographed baseballs, bats and footballs in the hallway behind the bar.\n\nI'd recommend this place to any out-of-towner or anyone going to see a ball game or show on the North Shore. I give it a solid 4 stars for ambiance, service and delicious burgers. If the beer selection was better I would have up it to five stars.", "business_id": "k1A8pNspBPinGDivxkuDSA", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-02-15", "type": "review"}

You'll need it.\n\nOnce you're in though it's super fun. Build your burger, eat greasy appetizers, and taste some delicious milkshakes. I've had the lunch special - soup or salad or half sandwich for pretty cheap. It's just enough food to not leave you in a food coma after lunch. The only thing I wish (and yes this took away a star) is that there were more sandwich options. So sometimes I get the soup & salad and I'm still hungry. That's a no bueno.\n\nThen there's dinner. Their burgers are kind of fantastic. I'm still not over the whole eating a rare cooked burger so everywhere in PA gets added bonus points for that. So overall it's a good burger, but it's certainly not the best burger I've ever eaten and there's nothing really creative about their burgers to make them stand apart from other place's burgers. \n\nThe atmosphere is something between a TGIFridays or Chili's but very Pittsburgh-centric. I found it somewhere between comforting and annoying. I don't really like chain restaurants but this one had some nice personal stuff to keep it from venturing into the Fridays realm.\n\nAlso, if you're a craft beer & burger sort a gal, you'll notice this place is not for you.

I was actually incredulous at how big the eponymous Jo Jo Omelet could be, but whoa! First of all, Jo Jo's sort of has this reputation for being a bit dingy, having bad service (as it originated as a diner mostly for truckers), etc. but it was, all-told, pretty fun. We went on a Saturday morning and the wait was about 15 minutes for a table. The place has absolutely no ambiance whatsoever, but it was crowded with couples and families. The servers/waitresses are extremely ornery, but I think it's part of the experience. \n\nOnce we were seated, we looked around at what everyone else was eating. Surprisingly, no one was eating the Jo Jo Omelet, but they do have HUGE pancakes, excellent looking egg dishes, etc., so I can safely say that basically everything here is good. Well, we did come for a reason, so of course we went for the Jo Jo Omelets... The only mistake was ordering one each. We should have really shared one, and even then, it can be shared among three or four easily. So what is a Jo Jo Omelet you ask (aside from the most expensive thing on their menu at $9)? It's basically a HUGE omelet filled with sausage, peppers and onions, wrapped around a ton of home fries (see my photo for an idea!). Not only was everyone gawking at us when the server placed them on our table, but we were sort of in shock at how big the thing actually is. With that, we dug in and I was successfully able to put away about half before my heart began to hurt. My friend was able to eat even less. Sadly, we sent most of ours back (just because we were so full), so word to the wise, SHARE IT. \n\nOtherwise, Jo Jo's is a great Pittsburgh experience and I'm looking forward to going back on future visits (once my heart recovers). It's centrally located in the Strip District, so makes a good place to start the day for shopping and walking around in nice weather.

This is a typical sports bar packed with TVs and loud noises.  There are three bars in the joint and plenty of space to be had.  There are booths with individual TVs for each booth, there are regular size tables and tables for large groups.  There was also outdoor seating.  There are some arcade style sports games, electronic dart boards, and a few pool tables.  There also appeared to be 2 small stages.  The TVs were ok.  They had several projection TVs with an average picture.  I didn't check out the \"regular\" TVs to see if they were HD or not.  I did like all the jersey they had on the wall.  They had a Ripken, Namath, Mario, Selanee, Montana, McGwire, and a couple of others I can't remember.  They were having a Hold 'Em tournament that evening (they have one every Tuesday apparently).  They were setting up as we were leaving so I'm not sure how that was supposed to work.\n\nWe had wings and beer.  The beer was average price ($4.75 for 23 oz) and the wings were good (they have several different flavors).  Our waitress was ok.  She was a young hottie but kind of on the slow, dense side.  Also, the other waitresses were nice to look at as they roamed the premises.  As someone mentioned earlier, they do wear tight shirts and small shorts that resemble a referee's outfit.  \n\nThis place is close to \"The Strip\" and right next to the Heinz sports museum and Hampton Inn.  We walked from here to Mellon arena and it took about 20 minutes.   \n\nIf you're looking for a place to watch the game and want the typical sports bar experience, then you get that here.

I've found that Pittsburgh locals are super fun! I absolutely loved how everyone cheered the singers on during karaoke and sang along making it extremely comfortable to get up front and center! \n- Healthy food choices! Instead of having to worry about adding a ridiculous amount of calories (in addition to the crazy amount I had already consumed for the day)...it was nice to snack on some hummus, fresh tomatoes, feta cheese, and pita bread. \n- Very friendly DJ!\n- Bartenders were simply wonderful and always made sure you were taken care even with the enormous bar crowd.\n- Prices were very reasonable. I think I had six or seven captain and cokes (blush) and the platter for only $20?!\n\nDislikes: \n- POLLUTED AIR. I now have to take my jacket to the dry cleaner, thank you. \n- Location. There were no available taxis at any given time. We contacted two different taxi services and they never showed. We finally had a taxi pick us up after calling the hotel valet and asking them to send for us (I was a little desperate).\n- This place is very, very, very small. The karaoke room was closed off by 11 PM due to the room being so packed. If you were not in the karaoke room, you were smelling the person next to you's breath. \n\nAside the heavy smoke and tight spaces, I would recommend Nico's for a fun night of karaoke and cheap drinks with friends!", "business_id": "tQpYnf3P3Q_OQLYYJvlV-A", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-02-24", "type": "review"}

It's really easy to brush it off if you're walking by; from the outside it looks like a pretty standard bar. And when you walk in, it smells like a pretty typical bar - meaning that if this place ever closed, the next owner would have to rebuild the entire place to get the cigarette stench out. So yeah, I admit that my first impression was not a good one, and I actually thought to myself that if any more people showed up and started smoking I'd have to ask my friend to pick somewhere else for us to eat and talk.\n\nFortunately, between it being a Thursday, the snow and the bitter cold temperatures, very few people showed up and the majority of the smokers stuck to the main bar area. So I picked a booth in the far corner of the seating room and met up with my friend; while I waited for them I took a peak at the menu - nothing super spectacular, but the prices were pretty cheap overall. So hey, at we know this bar has cheap sandwiches and cheap burgers.\n\nOnce my friend arrived we both ordered some drinks, because of course you drink when you're in a place like Nico's. The beer and cider we ordered came in a glass and the original bottle respectively, and our water came out in plastic cups (something I'm admittedly not a big fan of - it's such a wasteful practice). We then split the fried zucchini and the recovery room pizza. The fried zucchini basket had four or five enormous stripes of zucchini and came with marinara sauce - it was quite tasty, although the sauce was pretty cold. Maybe it's just me, but I'd rather have warm marinara sauce than cold. The pizza, on the other hand, was absolutely delicious. The recovery room special is a specialty; it has gyro meat, feta cheese on top on regular cheese, mushrooms and green peppers. This was VERY good, and I'm sure the fact that they make the pizzas to-order was part of why I found it to be so yummy. And by the way, my friend and I both took some pizza home with us - it was an enormous meal and more than either of us needed. So don't let the prices on the pizza frighten you, they're worth it.\n\nThe good news is that overall my experience definitely got better as the night went on. The bad news is that I honestly don't think I'll go back to Nico's, at least not for quite a while. As delicious as the pizza was, nothing can make up for the fact that this place is a smoker's haven. With lungs as sensitive as mine, this is a dealbreaker, and I'm pretty sure it was only by pure chance that I came in on a night where no one was smoking near me; if the place had been any busier I'd've had to leave just so I could breathe normally, I'm sure. I'll still give the place an \"a-ok\" rating since the food was delicious, the prices were good, and our waiter (who I think was bar-tending as well) was very nice and very attentive overall. But with such a strong smoke smell an \"a-ok\" is all I can honestly give.", "business_id": "tQpYnf3P3Q_OQLYYJvlV-A", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-01-09", "type": "review"}

It's one of my favorite weekday after-work places to visit and I come here often.\n\nThe restaurant has a real hardwood grill that is is located in full view of the main dining room and baths the neighborhood with the smokey sweet smell of grilled meats that makes you salivate and your stomach ache for food.  It's one of those things that makes you feel that this place is going to be great - you cannot wait to get inside and order.\n\nThe interior always has a great vibe.  High tin-covered ceilings, old-school wood bar, exposed red brick, and denim tablecloths cover tables that are closely-spaced and nearly always full with patrons happily eating and drinking.  Arrive at a peak time, any weekday or weekend evening, and you'll likely be getting a drink at that nice bar while you wait for a table.  That's OK - the bar is fully stocked, with local Penn Pilsner on tap (along with other good beers), and service is attentive and efficient.  Don't forget to take a look at the chalkboard on the wall to see today's specials.\n\nWhat to order:  You must try a burger here - I virtually guarantee that it will be one of the best you've ever had.  Tessaro's grinds their beef for their burgers fresh daily, and they rely on their own recipe for their ground beef that mixes different cuts of beef in a predetermined proportion to achieve a balance of taste and the right amount of succulent fat - both for taste and for the right amount of drippings onto that hardwood fire which flares and sears the outside of the burger with tasty good stuff.  The burger is nicely-sized, with a great selection of cheeses and toppings, and grilled to your desired level of doneness.  This is the only restaurant where I frequently order a burger without any trimmings - just so I can taste the beef in all of its smokey goodness.\n\nA wish:  I wish they made better side dishes to accompany their burgers.  They offer some good side dishes: potato salad, steamed fresh vegetables; and some side dishes that could be better, especially the home fries, which tend to be soggy, greasy, and/or burnt.  They don't offer french fries.  I think offering a proper french fry - made with freshly-cut potatoes, first par-fried at a lower temperature and then flash-fried at a very high temperature to order would go a very long way toward perfection.\n\nTheir soups are OK, and, strangely, a good portion of their menu is listed as \"Mexican\" fare.  They don't need it, and would be better off limiting that fantastic hardwood grill to burgers, steaks, and fish specials.\n\nIf you haven't visited yet, you will not be disappointed.  I highly recommend checking it out.", "business_id": "vgXE1I7c9ElcfYyZfQiN1Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-12-15", "type": "review"}

We sat at the bar and so it took a while for the bartender (one of two) to take our orders.  It then took approx. 40 minutes for our food to arrive.  I ordered a wrap and my friend ordered a sandwich.  My order was fine, my friend's was nothing close to what she had ordered.  She then had to wait another 20 minutes for the correct sandwich to be delivered.  Of course, we understand that mistakes happen.  However, what was truly frustrating was the fact no one else in the entire bar appeared to be eating (just drinking) with the exception of one table that had ordered one plate of wings.  So, was the kitchen so backed up that it should have taken so long for our food to arrive?  Where they so crazy busy back there that they got confused and prepared the wrong sandwich?  In addition, and I do find this to be an isolated occurance, I was ill for essentially the entire weekend after eating here on a Friday night.

There weren't too many people there when I walked in, so I went right up and sat at the bar.  I was greeted right away by the bartender (Bill).  He told me which three beers he was out of (which unfortunately were the three best ones on draft), then took my order.  I started with some wings and a beer.  I only order a half dozen of the atomic flavored wings which was unfortunate, as they were some of the best wings I've had in quite a while.  As a comparison, they weren't as hot as Buffalo Wild Wings 'hot' wings, but had decent heat and great flavor.  I then had another beer and ordered a meal they had on special.  It's not what I would call bar food by any means, as it was a perfectly cooked baked chicken with vegetables and potatoes.

The jalepenos add a nice kick and the chips didn't become overly soggy from the meat, which was very tender. Sour cream and salsa are served on top and an order is huge-easily feeds 4 people. \nThey have a couple of new sandwiches as well, a roasted Italian vegetable sandwich (I did not try this so can't really speak on the quality) and a smothered pot roast sandwich described as pulled short ribs with a marsala mushroom and\nonion sauce topped with swiss cheese on a rustic roll. This was so juicy and flavorful and plenty to eat the next day too. There's also a new southwest turkey wrap (lettuce,tomato, corn salsa, fresh turkey, bacon and chipoltle ranch). The chipotle ranch added just the right amount of kick and I loved that the turkey they used was of the carvery style. I took half of this home and it was good reheated the next day. They also have a new short rib mac and cheese entree and a pretzel crusted salmon dish, one of which I will be getting on my next visit. Service was excellent as usual-Adrienne, whom I'd never had as a server there before, was quick to continuously serve with a smile.

It will either be a buffet or a menu for a fixed price of $13. VERY meat heavy, but I'm sure there is always something veggie-friendly, but never expect vegan-friendly.

These drinks are going to be on the $8.50 side, some are worth it and some aren't, but The $3 Frozen Cosmo happy hour is the best deal on Ellsworth. Even if you're a manly man, this very pink booze slushie is amazing. Go with a big group and ask for the lounge upstairs or a window booth.

My \"man-friend\" was appalled (he is normally an IC Light kinda guy).\n\nAfter we waited by the very dimly lit bar for about 45 minutes the hostess sat us at a table in the downstairs portion of the restaurant (basically right next to where we were standing.) \n\nI started off with the veggie chili which was hearty and filling. It was topped with sour cream and served with a pita chip...delish.  I also ordered a spinach salad which the server explained to me is now different from what's on the menu.  Something about no strawberries, crumbled blue cheese, spiced pecans... It was definitely a change for the WORSE. The salad came out looking rather lonely with sliced almonds, 4 orange slices and chunks of mozzarella cheese.  It was sooooo bland. The dressing was just straight up balsamic vinegar.  Not only was it bland but it was tiny (almost looked like a side salad for $9.50). My date got the 'Salad a la pittsburgh' he wasn't thrilled by it either. His was much bigger than my salad and came with chicken (i think it was $1.00 more). \n\nWe didn't get alcoholic drinks with dinner and our bill was $29.00 which isn't that much more than our bar tab for 2 drinks. \n\nPros: Lively, fireplace when you walk in the door, a bunch of vegetarian options, big drink list, \n\nCons: Pricey drinks, very dark inside, sub-par salads, \"funny\" menu ( you have to read the whole description to figure out each item, I understand how lazy that sounds but witty names are only good once in a while)\n\nOverall: Might go go back and not get a salad.

The food here is just all kinds of disappointing. First of all, their labyrinth of a menu. I understand that they are trying to be cute and witty by concealing the item descriptions within paragraph-long stories and forcing you to read them due to the completely nonsensical names they give to said items. I truly understand the concept behind this. But can I be the first to say...IT'S NOT CUTE! For the drink menu, fine. I'll admit to having a few laughs at their PG-13 drink encyclopedia. I'm not that cold-hearted. But when I'm hungry, the last thing I want to do is spend 20 minutes trying to decipher what my options are.\n\nClearly I have a vendetta against their obnoxious menu, but the real problem here is that the food is the definition of mediocre. I go here fairly often, so I've done a lot of hopping around their menu trying to build my go-to order. I still haven't figured it out, and it's at the point where if my friends want to grab food here, I'll make a point out of eating beforehand. Plus, oh WOW is this place overpriced! This was especially highlighted to me on a Sunday morning when our bill came to $42 for brunch. Not expensive, but the wheels started turning in my head...we just paid $42 for an appetizer, two entrees, and two bloodys, all of which were eh, passable. For exactly $6 more, we could have went down the street to Casbah and had TWO appetizers, two entrees, and two much stronger bloodys, all of much higher quality.\n\nThe reason I still come here though is the drinks. My favorite is the Happy Ending which involves pineapple juice, ginger, and cucumber. You really can't go wrong with anything though except for the Statutory Grape--if the name doesn't dissuade you enough, just heed my advice and don't order it. Unless of course, you want to have flashbacks to that time you attempted to robotrip on Dimetapp in middle school. Memories!\n\nIt's official, I am done with the food at Harris Grill.

I don't enjoy doing it.  I love our city and I think our diverse restaurant choices make us a great place to live and visit. But when I hear great things about a place only to be consistently let down, I have no choice.  That being said, I'm going to have to rip Harris Grill a new one. \n\nI waited a long time before reviewing Harris Grill.  I've been there loads of times; happy hours, bacon night, brunch, crowded Friday nights, and not-so-crowded Monday nights.  Almost every time I have been let down. \n\nI'll break it down. \n\nDRINKS: The drink menu and draft lift offer a solid list of (overpriced) choices.  That's fine.  What isn't so fine is that the bartending is inconsistent and I have too often received ill-concocted highballs and sangria that tastes like Franzia.  Perhaps I'm just unlucky, but almost every time I'm there at least one or two beer taps \"aren't working.\" \n\nAPPETIZERS: Nothing really wrong here.  Good spinach and buffalo chicken dips, the \"Britney Spears\" (chicken strips), and hummus are all very tasty. Thumbs up.\n\nMAIN COURSES: I guess it depends on your taste, but I am simply not enthralled by any of the entrees.  The salads are overpriced for their small size, their highly touted macaroni and cheese is bland, and their chicken quesadillas are NOT quesadillas.  Just about everything on the menu at Harris Grill is overpriced for the quality.  $17 dollars for homemade hamburger helper?  $16 for two fish tacos? \n\nI don't HATE anything on the Harris Grill menu.  Their entrees are between \"ok\" and \"good.\" Just overpriced.  I do enjoy the Henny Penny and as I said before, all of the appetizers.  I'd give them a 3-star review if it wasn't for the....\n\nSERVICE:  Or lack thereof.  Sure, Harris Grill gets crowded, especially on the weekends.  That does not excuse the waitstaff from being rude and ignoring their tables for upwards of an hour.  On one occasion, our server clearly forgot about us and we watched astounded as tables seated long after us were brought their meals.  When we finally did inquire about our food,  the waiter made a beeline for the computer to put in our orders.  No apologies, no offer to comp a side or a dessert.  In fact, the check was rushed to us before we even finished our food because the restaurant had a long waiting list.  Bad form, Harris Grill. What makes it worse is that I've been here many times, and have had similar problems with the service. \n\nBut truth be told, I'll probably be back.  Because I really want to like Harris Grill. Moreover, my friends love Harris Grill and I love my friends.  I just sincerely hope they hire more competent waitstaff.

We moved to the area in August and are moving away in June, and unfortunately decided we won't be coming back here before we leave. \n\nThere was only one very small table open in the crammed dining room downstairs when we got there. I'm not sure if there were tables open upstairs, but it didn't look like the hostess checked before seating us. Our table was facing the door, so I kept feeling the cold air every time people came in and out, and we were very close to the table behind us, beside us, etc. We eventually asked to move, but I thought the hostess should've asked us if that table was okay before seating us there - because I would've rather waited for a better one to open up.\n\nI thought the selection on the menu was pretty poor. I wanted an entree rather than a salad or a sandwich, but since I didn't feel like Mexican or a huge plate of macaroni & cheese, there were really only a handful of options. None of them appealed to me, so I ended up ordering the \"Henny Penny,\" a chicken sandwich. I asked for the spicy chipotle mayonnaise on the side because I have a really low tolerance for spiciness. When it came, the mayonnaise was on the sandwich. I said I would try it in case it wasn't that spicy, but when I took a bite I felt like my mouth was on fire! Then the waitress asked me if I knew the chicken itself was spicy. The menu said nothing about that, so I had no idea. She suggested they re-make it with plain chicken, which was nice, and it was fine after that. I also had the sangria, which sounded like it would be amazing from the description, but I actually didn't think it was good at all :( It tasted really watered down to me. \n\nA few redeeming things: the mac & cheese that came with my sandwich was really, really good!

There's an outdoor patio when the weather is nice and the building is two floors. It's dark and cozy with art on the walls. \n\nService is always spectacular. The servers are helpful, friendly and take great care of their customers.\n\nTheir hummus is AMAZING!!! It's super tasty and it's my favorite hummus from any restaurant. Their platter comes with tons of veggies and pita bread. The Britney Spears chicken tenders are awesome- their sauces are unique and packed with flavor. Why did I call them Britney Spears chicken tenders you ask? Because their menu is awesome and witty and hilarious- their items have really goofy names with long descriptions that make you laugh. \n\nToday I ordered their grilled weasel which is a veggie sandwich. I've had it in the past and it's perfect every time. Ciabatta bread, portabella mushroom cap, grilled zucchini,  red peppers, melty cheese... So good! Their eggplant parm is awesome too! Sooo yummy! \n\nHarris grill is consistently good. Is it the most amazing meal you have ever had? Well no, I mean maybe .. .. But overall it's always good.

The service has always been friendly, and it never seems to get as loud in here as it gets in some other places (Shady Grove, I'm looking at you).\n\nI know it might sound strange, but one of the things that I appreciate the most about Cappy's is that it treats its waitresses as waitresses, not as sex symbols.  I've always found the skimpy outfits that waitresses choose to wear (or are made to wear) at some other places to be rather insulting -- these women are there to do their job, not to be ogled at by everyone in the area.  So thumbs up, Cappy's, for treating your female employees with some respect!\n\nMy wife and I moved away from the Shadyside area a few months ago.  Cappy's is the one thing we miss.

Plus, it has the essential Applebee's staple: a darn good menu. (Well, I think it's good anyway. If you like Applebee's menus in other lcoations, you'll like the one here.)

I have attempted to order the same thing four times: a 4 piece chicken tender plate. Not once have I eaten the same thing.\n\nThe first visit was fine. What kind of sauce would I like on those, they asked. They had barbecue and \"spicy\". I pondered aloud if I could get both, half and half. \"Sure thing.\" Sure enough, a few minutes later it was on my table. Two were covered in a sweet and savory BBQ sauce, and the spicy flavoring turned out to be some kind of buffalo. All told it was fantastic. The portions here are huge (the one constant). Every plate comes with free texas toast and hush puppies, and you get two other sides of your choosing. I usually end up getting fries or tater tots with another order of hush puppies just because they're always awesome.\n\nThat was the last good experience I've had here.\n\nNext week I happily tried to repeat the last order I got. The lady on the cashier was somewhat annoyed and had no idea what I was talking about when I said the tenders were covered in sauce. Ended up just getting plain strips with honey mustard on the side. One more time the next day: different cashier yet again. Didn't bother trying to explain this time since apparently some of their servers take offense to it, so I just asked for BBQ tenders. BBQ came on the side. Last time I went, much to my surprise they asked me what kind of sauce I wanted, so I tried getting 2 and 2 again. After a short trip to the kitchen: \"Yeah, we can't do that.\" OK.\n\nMisc:\nThey apparently broadcast their own radio station, which is cool if you're into oldies. There's a studio in the dining area that I've never seen used. Steak sauce is plentiful but all the other condiments are randomly scattered around. Drinks are far too expensive to try any.\n\nAll I've learned is this place is a roll of the dice, since apparently they rotate the entire staff out every day of the week.

This isn't saying much, because the tavern is quite small. Luckily, there were some empty seats at the bar.\n\nThey have a pretty extensive lunch menu & everything sounds good! I had a hard time choosing, but I went with the burger & cajun fries. (My second choice was the grilled cheese - maybe next time!)\n\nWe didn't wait too long until our food arrived. Holy cow (pun intended), this burger was HUGE! There were plenty of fries, too!  The burger was so tasty. It was just the right amount of juicy, without said juicy running down your wrists & arms. The bun from local Nova's Bakery was a fantastic addition. Word of caution: you will have to cut this burger in half!  Needless to say I finished my entire burger...it was only right! I wasn't able to finish the fries, but they were hot & crispy & the cajun seasoning had just enough \"bite\"...it wasn't overpowering.\n\nThe staff was so friendly & chatted frequently with us. They always made sure our glasses were filled & that we were enjoying our food. \n\nThe prices are a bit pricey, but in my case, the portion equaled the price ($9).\n\nI'll definitely be back!", "business_id": "ePP0Eqz8JKSbtdt2phiB4A", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-01-04", "type": "review"}

When I told him how I came, he said he'd show me a quicker way back to my motel after I'd eaten. An hour later, he kept that promise, seeking me out despite the lingering crowd.  But more amazingly, when I got back to my room I check my email and found a message on LinkedIn, from HIM--informing me that I'd left my credit card behind at the table. How had he found me on LinkedIn? His effort was astonishing. \n\nExcellent and varied food, good drink, attentive and helpful wait people, and a cheerful crowd combine to make a visit to Alexander MIchael's a special night out and a haven for the traveler at the end of a day on the road.

I also find it amazing how very hard Latino cooks work back in the kitchen, and how quickly they can switch from getting their orders in English yet speak Spanish back there among each other. Their head cook was about as hard working an Expeditor as I've seen, repeating every order and making sure his line cooks get it done right.\n\nMy little blonde waitress was filling in for someone who apparently called in sick, and she was uber busy yet kept me happy with coffee and getting my order in and to me very quickly (like 5 minutes). \n\nSo I'd say the STAFF here easily gets 5 STARS. Very hard working and efficient.\n\nNow that I've painted the picture on how this place operates, let me tell you about my Greek Omelet. I got it with Gyro meat and grilled onions, and it was very good! Hash browns and English Muffin were acceptable and average. But the Greek Omelet was filled with tomatoes, feta cheese, gyro meat, grilled onions and some Greek spices. Not overcooked and quite tasty overall. Good size too.\n\nI got about the most expensive thing on the menu and had a coffee and it came out to just over $10. They have MANY breakfast items that hover around $5 if you didn't want to get one of their \"signature\" dishes.\n\nSo if you're Uptown and want a good, home cooked meal, come to Showmars....just don't expect Dean and Deluca quality (nor their prices).", "business_id": "ASwN3Ih0Eh1oH0npLbzVjA", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-01-30", "type": "review"}

I emailed her ahead of time to see if they had a meatless option, and she was great about writing back quickly and gave me the alternative course, which was fully vegetarian, and even asked for confirmation if it would work. I said yes, and it did. \n\nThe fist plate they served was a delicious deviled egg salad (they made sure I wasn't vegan before bringing this out). It was HUGE and very good. The serving size was actually enough to split between four people! The deviled eggs were diced into mini cubes and really nicely evenly spread throughout the salad. I loved the dressing too, though I'm not sure exactly what it was. I think it was ranch. \n\nThe main course was another gigantic plate. It was filled with broccoli, sauteed spinach, mushrooms, and grilled tomatoes. To look at, it was not that special, but the sauce that was added to all the vegetables was mouthwatering and made a plate of vegetables taste amazing.

We waited about 15 minuets and saw tables empty and then we went and asked if our table ready.  So I think they forgot about us.  We ordered the chopped salad for $10.00 and it was nothing special, my wife ordered the salmon which was not as good as I could cook on the grill at home.  The New York Cheesecake for desert was no better than anything I would buy in a grocery store.  I guess if I am going to drop $150.00 for dinner I expect outstanding food and service.

Oh the food.  I was unsure what cut of steak to go with and my server recommended his favorite cut.  To be honest, I can't tell you what it was, but it was beautiful and perfectly cooked.  We ordered two sides to split.  The server told us that both of these are on their new menu which hadn't been printed yet by the time we were there.  One was a scalloped potato that was phenomenal.  But my favorite of the two sides was the creamed corn with tasso ham.  I was so enamored with it, I jotted down what was in it so I could try to replicate it at home!  Haven't tried to yet, and I'm sure my culinary prowess will get me CLOSE, but I would rather get it from Morton's.\n\nFor dessert I HAD to go with the molten lava cake which is apparently their best dessert and for just cause.  It was incredible!  If only I weren't so full on my sensational steak and sides (pardon the alliteration!), I could have finished it all.  \n\nAll in all, I WILL go back to Morton's, and I really really hope they have the creamed corn again!", "business_id": "Lt9o2RmacVY2L-IWLA8uTg", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-01-03", "type": "review"}

Also, I want to add that the server was extremely nice by letting me only get the tacos. I didn't want the extra rice & beans so she took a couple dollars of the meal price and just gave me the tacos. \n\nObviously Rock Bottom is known for their beers and they definitely had a great selection to offer. I tried a few =) but ended up really liking the Brown Ale the best. \n\nThey were packed when we went but we didn't have to wait too long for our food and our service was on point! Clean place too. \n\nWould definitely hit up this place if I'm ever back in Charlotte again. =) Go try it!.", "business_id": "ym9QwkmB5ZKTyj7q5huTDw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-02-15", "type": "review"}

We ended up getting there around 7:45pm on a Friday night to find the place very alive with people, both young and old, carousing, socializing and being merry.  \n\nMy friends and the party I was attending were stationed in the bar area, to the left as you walk in.  Though there was a jumble of people standing around drinking and talking, a server promptly noticed we were new to the scene and took our drink orders and provided us with a menu to look over.  I ordered a \"light lager\" for my girlfriend and a \"Brown Ale\" draft for myself.  Draft beers were running $4 per pint on Friday night; which certainly isn't bad, but isn't a deal by any means. \n\nAs evening turned into a chilly night, the people I was with found a few tables in the bar area and placed food orders.  I ordered, the BBQ pulled pork sliders as an appetizer, and some sort of lobster and shrimp rolled into a black corn enchiladas.  As a devout BBQ lover, I found the sliders to be an extreme disappointment.  The BBQ was border-line cold and there was very little BBQ on each of the sliders.  As for the enchiladas, the appeal of my meal was more in the uniqueness of the dish than its actual taste.  It's not that the enchiladas were bad, they just left me wanting more.  My girlfriend got the steak with mashed-potatoes and green-beans.  I thought the steak was above par.  My girl friend said it was cooked to her specifications.  \n\nOverall, I felt the food was good not great, and the BBQ sliders were not up to BBQ code.  However, Rock Bottom offered the perfect ambiance to enjoy myself and my friend's birthday in splendid fashion.  The service WAS GREAT!  I wish I could recall my server's name, because I would love to give her a shot-out.  Despite the chaotic atmosphere that reigned throughout the bar, she was prompt, polite and accurate with everything.\n\nTIPS: *Nice, classy atmosphere, *Nice seating area outside  *Parking can be found by turning either way on 7th street, including in the garage attached to Rock Bottom itself (KEEP YOUR TICKET!!  BRING IT IN WITH YOU!  ROCK BOTTOM VALIDATES PARKING, SEE THE HOSTESS.)  *Stay away from the BBQ Sliders  *Great, friendly service  *Good for parties or pre-gaming before going out somewhere else", "business_id": "ym9QwkmB5ZKTyj7q5huTDw", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-12-04", "type": "review"}

I ordered chicken quesadillas which were MIND BLOWING!! I mean OMG, they were soooooo good! I had never eaten sour cream or avocado before that night, and now I eat it all the time when I get the quesadillas.  Next, my boyfriend ordered a burger(with cheese, ketcup and mustard. PLAIN I know.) He ordered steak fries that came out more like potato wedges. He thought his burger was so-so. I tasted it, and it was dry and overcooked. The wedges were salty as well. \n\nI ordered a steak(medium well) and fries. Now that was 10 times better than my boyfriends plain burger. My steak was juicy, seasoned well, and cooked to perfection. I couldn't have asked for a better steak! So kudos to the cook! My fries were normal fries which were just as tasty(once again better than my boyfriends) lol.\n\nI have been back to Rock Bottom 4 times since then, and now that I live up the street from it, I plan on becoming a weekly regular! I always get the chicken quesadillas, and have even tried the chicken nachos. Let me tell you that the nachos coming in a heap PILED up on a plate, with cheese, olives, tomatoes, and other stuff. They were sooooo good! Me and my friends couldn't eat it all.\n\nAlso, my boyfriend ordered the ribs before, and he did not like them WHAT-SO-EVER. But then again, he was comparing them to the ribs at Firebirds so yea. He also ordered the cheese pizza, and I must say that I have gotten better pizza at chuckie-cheese.

My colleague, John, flew in from Toronto and I flew down from Boston.  We arrived late in the day and roamed around downtown looking for dinner on the Company's dime.  John suggested Uno's--he wanted something he couldn't get in Toronto.  I pointed out that if I wanted to eat at Uno's, I'd have stayed in Boston.  So we meandered some more on that stultifying evening but couldn't agree on anything until I saw the sign for the Graduate and said, \"That looks sort divey!  Let's check it out, eh!\"  (John's Canadian so I thought I'd make him feel at home by speaking like a McKenzie Brother.) \"Right on!\" John exclaimed.\n\nThe Graduate amply filled our gustatory and cultural needs.  The place was clean if self-consciously dingy; the barmaids were hot.  A college cover band performed a passable rendition of a Green Day anthem before segueing into a more challenging Sublime ballad.  The buffalo tenders were hot, spicy and cheap, and the beer was even cheaper.\n\nJohn asked me to recommend an \"American\" beer and once I ascertained that Rolling Rock, Brubaker, and 'Gansett were not on the menu, and being kind of a jerk, I suggested Pabst Blue Ribbon: An American favorite if you happen to spend eight hours a day at General Motors, stamping pieces of metal with a drill press and need a refreshing pick-me-up before smacking around your wife and kids.\n\nThe cute little waitress gave John a look bordering on horror, \"You want PBR?\" she asked incredulously.  \n\n\"What's wrong with her?\" John asked.  \n\nI murmured something about his choice offending her collegiate aesthetic.  \"She's probably not used to real men ordering real beer,\" said I.\n\nAs it turned out, John developed a liking for good old American PBR and asked for it wherever he went.  Boy was he pissed when someone explained where Pabst fell on the beer chain!\n\nWhat does this story have to do with the Graduate?  Not a hell of a lot but it was a good evening.  We got pretty smashed, ended up with something like a fifty dollar bill--including the tip--and were in fine shape for the start of our conference the next morning, where the evening cocktail reception contained a NASCAR theme and an open bar.

She was raving about Harpers, saying it's her \"best kept secret, the place I take everyone!\", which sounded great. We went for lunch and had a really nice meal; the one thing that was a disappointment was the service. SLOW is the only descriptor I need.\n\nThe food, though, was excellent. We started off w/ house potato chips (my friend had never had these at any restaurant. That, I thought, was odd). The chips came with blue cheese and some blue cheese sauce, with scallions liberaly placed throughout. They were awesome, the perfect munchy to start off lunch. We both ordered salads for the main course; I got the Oriental chopped salad and my pal got the grilled chicken house salad. Both were typical salads, but the portions were huge. The dressing on mine was particularly yummy, and the Asian noodles were a nice crunch between the lettuce.\n\nThe slow service moment happened during our checkout--we tried to get our bill for at least 20 minutes before we saw our server. Even when she split the check up, she split the meals wrong and I ended up paying for my friend's potato-cheddar soup (v. good, btw). Oh well. The restaurant overall was a nice experience, and I have never eaten at a Harpers.

We head there every Sunday after church, always sitting at the bar.  It's not that the seats are more comfy or the food is better.  No, we sit there because 1) there are TVs to watch football but mostly 2) because of the AWESOME bartenders!  Shelly has got to be one of my favorite people in Charlotte, and her partners in crime are also friendly.  She is so friendly and sweet and sassy--a great combo in a bartender!  \n\nThe food, of course, is great too, otherwise we wouldn't keep coming back.  My husband adores the brisket (it IS delicious!).  I have had the turkey burger and the regular burger and loved both of those.  Usually on Sundays I get something from the brunch menu.  My only complaint is that it's a bit lacking in length, but there are pretty good things on it.  I have liked the waffles, I have also had the BELT (which was alright) and the French Toast (which was good, but ask for the fruit compote on the side).  The grits (if you have read any of my previous reviews, you'll know that I LOVE GRITS!!) are good.  They clearly make them with chicken broth, which almost makes them too chicken-y, but they also have cheese.  They're very good. (Today, in fact, they lacked the signature chicken flavor, and were some of the best grits I've ever had!)  \n\nMy husband has had the French Dip Sandwich (pretty good), pork tenderloin (also pretty good--not outstanding) and the Cajun omelette (just okay), but he remains convinced that you should just get the brisket.  For $13, you get a lot of delicious brisket with BBQ sauce, excellent fries, and one more side (it comes with cole slaw, but we've never gotten it.  The green beans were good when I had them).  I have also ordered the brisket, and he's right, it is FANTASTIC!!!\n\nOn Thursday they have trivia night.  My husband and I happened to be there this past Thursday, and beat the long-time reigning champs.  It is pretty easy trivia (college mascots, car makers, countries and continents were our categories this week. Apparently the reigning champs COMPLAINED that the questions were too hard.  Excuse me?  You've won for the last few months and have the balls to complain that the questions are too hard?  I don't like these guys.  I'm glad we kicked their asses.--sorry I just got totally off-topic.).

I ordered the spinach quesadilla, hoping it would be more spinachy than cheesy and thinking it's hard to eff up a quesadilla.  Right?\n\nWHAT a disappointment.  The quesadilla was a total mess, stuffed to the brim with a slurpy cheese mixture.  The filling was incredibly uneven - one triangle had cheese with just a hint of spinach, another was filled entirely with the spinach mixture (which I am 99% sure is just their spinach dip repurposed), and another had a surprising number of cold, mealy tomato cubes.\n\nPer the usual, my dad ordered a small cup of soup, and the server barely hid her disdain at our tiny order.

I'm pretty standard with the marinated chicken over rice, greens, and usually another veg. Is it amazing? No, but it's just right. Kind of like something you'd had for a family gathering that has plenty of love put into it. Always filling and affordable, too. As a sidenote, I've had the vegetable soup a few times and it is truly incredible. You typically don't think much of it in other cases, but do yourself a favor and try Nick's. Truly delectable. \n\nIt's the typical cafe where you pay at the counter. Some old candy rests within the glass case that hasn't been touched for year and a cool old cash register rest atop.

Some of the other reviewers said this was a Charlotte institution, but I haven't been here long enough to know that. I just know they need to change the inside because it's a bit creepy. So, I ordered the chicken cheesesteak, fries and some coleslaw. This is not authentic if that is what you are looking for. the cheesesteak was soggy. I got mushrooms which were runny. What was more disappointing was that the chicken was like steakums and it was one layer of chicken on top of a glob of mayo, tomatoes, onions and mushrooms. Basically there was no chicken plus it tasted like shoe leather. The fries were ok. Not as crispy as others stated and they needed SALT! I didn't eat them all because they got cold and kind of gross.  The coleslaw was full of mayo, so I didn't eat all of that either.  The pickle was good even though it was really salty, but I like pickles so I'm bias. I can say I probably won't go there again and I should have just gone to Subway.

I was warmly greeted when I entered and promptly seated.  My waiter came over immediately to get my drink order, came back a moment later and I was ready to order.  My food came out very quickly, and was smoking hot.\n\nMy food:\n2 eggs over well - cooked perfectly.  Eggs were fresh and delicious.\n4 slices of turkey bacon - it seemed to be Butterball?  It tasted exactly like what I make at home, only it wasn't burned like I always manage to do.  \n3 pancakes - so good, so very very good.  Fluffy, not crazy sweet - with butter and some ample pours of the warm syrup, I could have eaten my body weight in these pancakes and I find myself craving them.\n\nThe total for my meal, without tip, was $8 (I had water to drink).  The food was delicious, service was wonderful, the gentleman who seemed to be the boss that evening was very pleasant.  I will definitely return to OPH.", "business_id": "UzMMpUFwJhwUkHOyeXeWsQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-02-01", "type": "review"}

I'm thrilled if I can pull a beer not slapped with a \"Lite\" label; or when I ask for a stout the waitress has something other than Guinness to provide. I crave diversity of lagers and ales like a foodie craves weirdly named cheeses. I'm pretty sure, in fact, that the Saucer was created for people exactly like me.\n\nWalking into the door I instantly get the same feeling of the hole-in-the-wall pubs I frequented back in college - just much larger. And cleaner! Almost every surface not walkable in the building is covered in decorative dishes so dense that your grandma's cabinet just shed a tear. It's cluttered but not oppressive, and again, it always feels clean and comfortable. There's a couched section up front for those really lazy days; elevated booths on the wall for small parties; and a lot of tables for any size group you can organize. And then there's the bar...\n\nBellying up to the bar at the Saucer is easy - it's roughly 50 feet long. From this bastion of beervana, you can see the real reason you came here - the jaw-dropping wall of tap heads and stuffed bottle coolers. It's a selection so big that trying to pick by looking is almost a fool's errand - you could easily down a pint just while trying to weigh the options. Thankfully, they have a well-organized (and four-page dense) beer menu that will help you find just the draft or bottle you're looking for. I want to give some kind of feeling for what you'll find here, but the simple answer is - everything. I've had everything from double IPAs aged in oak barrels to blueberry wheat beer to a savory coffee milk stout. Any style you could ever want, well, it's here. It's impressive. It's a little terrifying. It's very, very delicious. There are $3 fire sale specials every night of the week as well. Saturday's \"Beer Poker\" is my favorite - a random bottle from their cooler for three bucks. I've scored a few Victory and Rogue bottles there, so it is definitely not just the leftovers. \n\nAs for the food, well... It's decent. Let's be fair, I'm not coming here for their burgers. Food at the saucer is a means to an end; the food is here so you can cleanse your pallet between brews. That being said, there are a few musts on the menu. For a snack, you cannot beat the soft pretzels. You get two, they're huge, warm, salty and soft - if you're on a date and you don't get this, don't expect a second date. The brats are decent, the burgers have flavor, and oh yeah - spicy cheesy pepper tater tots. You'll find something. \n\nI guess the last thing worth mentioning is the service. A place with this diverse a beer selection could rest on its laurels, but the Saucer follows through with an excellent staff. Beyond the fact that your waitresses are gorgeous smiling Beer Goddesses wearing short short skirts and knee-hi stockings... They're genuinely nice and know what they've got on the menu. Talking with them is talking with peers. They check in on the table frequently and always have a good recommendation on what beer is next. A few of them pay attention enough to recognize me and remember what I had on the last visit. Coming to the saucer is like hanging out with friends.\n\nOne last word of advice - if you're serious about your beer exploration, sign up for the UFO club. For $18 you get a commemorative t-shirt and a membership which clears you from (very infrequent) cover charges and lets you track the beers you have on each visit. Drink 200 different beers and you get your name in the ring of honor, a commemorative plate on the wall, and a $100 tab for a party for you and your friends. There's a reward every 50 - I just earned a free pint - and you get the benefit of trying a ridiculously wide selection of beers and learning more about what the craft has to offer. You will find new favorites and probably a few that you can't stand. But that's the point of the journey, now, isn't it?\n\nSo bottoms up, there's a lot to drink. As for me, I'm going to discuss with my Beer Goddess which brew is next on my list!", "business_id": "F-e-sWfVd3eCYll3BP1QFA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-01-01", "type": "review"}

The brunch alone is worth it.  I went for beer on a Saturday and came back for brunch the next day.  The other perks are listed on the website and take a little time to accomplish.. Like try 200 different beers and get a $100 tab and your name forever enshrined on a plate on the wall.  I'm going for it!! \n\nDon't care about joining the BeerKnurd club... Thats cool too.  Just go on in and try the pretzel.. Let me rephrase that... YOU HAVE TO TRY THE PRETZEL.. I grew up in the Philadelphia area and we are used to brick pretzels.  Though the sad thing is that we like them.  Here, you get two huge... soft... fluffy.. wonderful pretzels.  How can someone be so excited about a pretzel, you ask??  Just trust me and order it.  Enjoy!\n\n-Ian M.", "business_id": "F-e-sWfVd3eCYll3BP1QFA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-02-15", "type": "review"}

I will take this early opportunity to divulge that the only reason we have decided to go back is that it is under new management and that new manager is a close friend. The following review, though, has nothing to do with our friendship and he was NOT present at the time I went so had nothing to do with the food or service we received. This was a real dinner visit with guests in town for the holiday and they wanted good Q and Wes assured me that the place had turned around. He was right. \n\nI can be a harsh critic. I expect a lot from an eatery. As posted before in other reviews, I think restaurants are magic. Unfortunately, there are a lot of bad magicians out there. Smokey Bones had fallen far from pulling rabbits out of hats and was doing Wal-Mart magic kit stuff that just wasn't working for them. They needed a turn around moment or they were done. I am seriously surprised that, with our last experience and the reviews that have been posted here since, it hasn't closed it's doors. They found the magic again and here's what went down:\n\nWe were a party of 6. My immediate family and my sister and brother in law. We dropped in about 7 and entered. The design flaw of this building is that the entrance area drops you right in to the bar area which can be a bit loud but the food seating area's are much more noise appropriate. We were seated at a 6 top near the bar but found the noise level a bit much. We asked for a new seating arrangement which was immediately and pleasantly taken care of. The place was not terribly busy but several tables were occupied and most folks seemed in good spirits and were eating and drinking away. \n\nOur server was Krista. Super pleasant, nice and attentive. She circled the table and was kind enough to repeat the special to my brother in law who was directly under the speaker (at first) and couldn't hear her. \n\nWe decided on the smoked wings for an app. GOOD CALL! These little dandy's are double smoked (according to the menu) with a dry rub and then drizzled with a sweet, almost teriyaki (sp), type of sauce. Drizzled is the main word here because too much would just be too much and the wings would have lost their appeal to me. We polished off 16 in no time flat and were unanimously impressed. \n\nThe orders around the table were varied, which was great because I got to try a little of a bunch of stuff. Across the board we were impressed with the food quality and flavors.  I got the St Louis ribs and brisket combo platter with a baked tater and broccoli. The ribs were with out compare the star of this whole program! Well rubbed, cooked to a tender but not \"falling of the bone\" overdone-ness. The smoke ring was deep and the meat was tasty. I dipped the ribs in some of the Chipotle BBQ sauce (which is now, thankfully, set at the table again for your enjoyment and mixing pleasure!). My Bro-in-law got the baby backs and was fully excited about them. I could see the incredibly deep smoke ring from where I sat a couple seats away. He finished his and got a whole rack to go for cold eating on his drive home today! My wife got the half chicken/brisket combo and was delighted in the moistness and tenderness of the chicken meat, though she is not a big sauce-er and felt that for her taste is was too saucy. She did rave however on the meat itself. My sis got polled pork and it was NICE! I stuck my fork over for a steal and agreed with her judgement. At the risk of saying moist too many times, it was really moist and flavorful. The 7 oz. medium steak my son got was well cooked and looked great but wasn't on the plate long enough for me to get a bite (cause he's a punk!)\nSides were good, I loved the broccoli, the tater was well cooked and tasty and overall I was very pleased with the food. \n\nSo's we all don't think I am being pulled along by my friendship with the GM, here is the stuff that may have left us wanting a little bit. The brisket was okay, not great but well cooked, fat cap on keeping the meat (wait for it...) humid! (jk, it was moist!) but didn't blow my head off like I hoped. My sis said the slaw was okay but nothing special. It was a little loud in the bar area but sitting in the dining area took care of that. \n\nSo that's that. Sometimes you gotta change the driver. Smokey Bones was on the verge of ruin and they changed the driver to a guy who I can vouch is a true restaurant dude who is more concerned with quality than quantity of food served. His employee's seem happy to work for him and in return he gets employee's who want to continue to work for him so they do a better job. \n\nWhy 5 star's you may ask yourself. Well, my last review was a deuce and the difference in the experiences was more than a 2 star upgrade. If it were possible I would probably do 4.5 stars but, alas, it isn't a possibility so 5 it is. \n\nThe standards have been raised.\n\nGood eating!\n\nV-dub", "business_id": "KxJ5DRcSo83N-GW4f_gMQQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-12-27", "type": "review"}

The atmosphere, staff and patrons will certainly help to make your visit enjoyable.\nLast time I was here I ordered the caramel nut covered cinnamon roll.  The waitress asked if I wanted it warmed with some butter.   I thought that sounded even better and said to go ahead and do that.  She nodded agreement.  Then when she brought it to me it was unheated and no butter.   Odd but also kind of humorous.  I always enjoy being in a David Lynch film from time to time.\nThe service and food is way better than the country restaurant just a mile south on 51.  Be sure to go here instead.   Their booths are made for skinny people from the 50s.   take a table.  start a conversations with the truck driver to your left. \nWe used to go to the Pine Cone when it was across the street.  Must be hard times for these guys because the interior appears to be older than what they had when they were on the other side of the street.   That place now sits empty.   Why is this area depressed?   Don't ask me, I don't know.  Do I look like I have all the answers?\nThe food here is good and the prices are cheap.   Go here for a nice meal and a flash back to the past and don't forget to take home some bakery.  Or if you aren't hungry just stop by for some great baked goods.    Well worth the stop.\nThis place gets four stars because of their five star bakery selection.  Crazy big cinnamon rolls and good prices.\n\nPS The pecan cinnamon rolls are the best.   The frosted cinnamon rolls are too much frosting in my opinion and too doughy.  The apple fritters are quite good.\n\nTip.  The entire place is made for skinny people.  If you are heavy set you will not fit in the booths.  Take a seat at the counter.   I am a rather big guy and it took me over an hour to squeeze myself out of the bathroom.

I guess I could think of a few things.\n\nI went there today for the first time and was dazzled by the charm it flaunted, while still maintaining the gritty edge of a backwoods Wisconsin eatery.  Let's not get it twisted folks, we're not breaking gastronomic ground here.  What we are breaking are your misconceptions of what a restaurant can be whose parking lot is largely composed of Chevy and Dodge trucks, and whose front, snow-covered, lawn is full of snowmobiles.  Deal with it kids, this is that slice of Midwest Americana you've been looking for in any number of wayside eateries in rural America.  Fish fry anyone?\n\nTo begin, let me explain that one of the many draws for the Beach House's patrons is the fact that it is still legal to smoke indoors in McFarland.  I stepped inside and was immediately made aware of this fact as plumes of smoke took up residence in my clothes and nose.  \n\nDo not fear, however, there is a separate dining room that is nonsmoking.  And man was this separate dining room packed (Superbowl Sunday).  Packed with large women squeezing into convention center chairs.  Packed with waitresses who wore skin tight white Jordache jeans, giving you a fleeting sense of their giving nature.  Packed with the eager anticipation of an entire day spent watching football and football-related activities: drooling, eating, drinking, and smoking.  God bless America.\n\nThe AM dish to get here is the Walleye and eggs breakfast.  I would tend to agree, although their limited selection of omelets is made marginally more tasty by the addition of broccoli (you heard me punk).  As breakfast wore on, the dining room filled, emptied, and filled again; the waitstaff eagerly setting new places, removing paper place settings, calling people darlin' and hon'(always appreciated).\n\nSo give it to me hard backwoods Wisconsin.  Give me every sinew of your being: your ice fishing, snowmobiling, smoking, bloody Mary drinking, being.  Just be.  And give me a friggin' huge piece of deep fried walleye to help me digest the spectacle, with scrambled eggs on the side.

We grabbed some stools but found ourselves giving up our seats to some lovely ladies who were waiting to be seated for the fish fry.  (Like I said, we weren't here for the food, but I gotta wonder why the fish fry was JAM PACKED CONSTANTLY.)\n\nAfter bugging the extremely convivial bartender about the history of the place, and begging to see the \"wine cellar\"/slave-holding-tank in the basement, he tossed his apron at someone and announced an impromptu \"tour\".

Once you've been there a few times, everyone who works there begins to recognize you and seems glad to see you. They have a small menu of yummy fried items (Spudsters!), great burgers and sandwiches, and daily specials (love the French Dip on Wednesdays). All the food is cooked right behind the bar, and they keep their cooking equipment impeccably clean. They make good drinks and have a small but respectable selection of draft beers that meet the needs of both craft beer lovers and Miller Lite-types. Bartenders are not afraid to do a shot of whiskey with you, and many of the regular patrons will buy you a drink if you chat with them. \n\nThe Green is owned by two brothers who are almost always there, cooking or bartending. The place is closed on Sundays, and rarely stays open past midnight - it's just not that sort of bar. Go across the street to Hody for late-night drinking. Any other time though, I promise you'll find the company much more enjoyable at Village Green.", "business_id": "G1qUGBNYNS220jKlPAlFsA", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-01-12", "type": "review"}

The sides, service, and atmosphere leave a little to be desired, but if it's fantastic fish you're seeking, look no further than the VFW 8483.  Please note that they're a cash only place - no debit/credit cards - but they do have an ATM onsite.\n\n\nDetailed review:\nThe VFW 8483 is located on the north side of the Dane County Airport - hop onto Packers Avenue and follow it north until Packers turns into CV.  Continue about a mile or so, and you'll find the VFW - look for the big airplane on a pole out front.\n\nWe arrived at around 6:00pm and easily found a parking spot.  We made our way into the VFW where we were immediately greeted by a gentleman who took our order and money.  Fish options included cod, walleye, shrimp, and poorman's lobster.  All are served deep-fried, and include your choice of a potato (baked, fries, or wedge fries), coleslaw, bread, and coffee.\n\nWe went with the cod for $8.50 (it comes with 2-pieces; you can add additional pieces for $2/piece), and after the gentleman took our money, he gave us two small index cards that read \"Cod.\"  We were instructed to seat ourselves at the table of our choice, and that we could purchase drinks at the bar.\n\nWe grabbed a table and wandered over to the bar, where we purchased two drafts of Miller Lite for $3.50.  Served in an ice cold frosty mug, the 16oz drafts are definitely a bargain!  \n\nOur waitress arrived, picked-up the cards and asked what we'd like for sides.  We went with a baked potato and an order of regular fries.  She headed back to the kitchen and returned a few minutes later with our bread and coleslaw.  The bread consisted of yeast rolls, which were soft, slightly warm, and delicious.  The coleslaw was uneventful - no real seasoning to speak of; bland and boring at best.\n\nWe downed our beers and ordered a second round; just as I returned from the bar with the beers, our fish arrived and it looked unbelievable.  \n\nThe good news is that the fish tasted even better than it looked - the breading featured a hint of spicy seasoning, and was expertly applied and fried.  The breading didn't steal any thunder from the fish; it complimented it perfectly.  \n\nThe fish itself was amazing - thick cuts of cod - moist, flaky, nice and firm, and absolutely delicious.  Best of all, there wasn't a hint of grease anywhere on the plate.\n\nFries were a bit cold and lifeless; baked potato was, well, a baked potato.  Not much to add there.\n\nAfter our plates were dropped off, we never saw our waitress again, but that was ok, as diners are left to their own accord when it comes to getting drinks.\n\nVFW 8483 = WIN\n\nService = 1 star (virtually non-existent)\nFood = 4 stars (the fish was top notch; sides bland and forgettable)\nValue = 4 stars ($8.50 per person + $1.75 for 16oz taps)\nMISC = 1 star (ambiance leaves much to be desired)\n\nIf it's good fish you're seeking, this is one of the better places to check out.  Just don't expect anything fancy or \"over the top.\"", "business_id": "YEGS2TuSk7TQ_F8fWsE9ag", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-01-09", "type": "review"}

I used to go with my parents as a kid, and now as an adult I've started to rediscover how much I loved their food.\n\nNestled in the eclectic Atwood Ave neighborhood, Monty's presents a 50's style diner with yummy lunch specials like meatloaf (very good meatloaf), sandwiches, and a wicked good brunch.  They also have ridiculously delicious chocolate shakes, so don't be afraid to splurge while you're there.  \n\nOne of the other great things about Monty's is the atmosphere; the area around it is filled with little mom and pop shops, the Barrymore theater, and relics of an older time.  Take a stroll around if it's a nice day and your bound to find something you like.  If not, I'm sure you probably enjoyed the food as all the dishes I've ever had were great and the portions were generous.\n\nThere are a few drawbacks though that held me back from giving a 5 star review.  First, there is usually a very long wait.  The place is popular, but I don't feel that the food and eastside location (I live far westside) always justifies the overall experience.  Secondly, the service is hit or miss.  I've had some waitresses who were prompt and polite, making me feel right at home, and others who were sarcastically rude to the point where people in my party almost had to say something.  Furthermore, the kitchen doesn't always look clean, as trays of biscuits have been left sitting out and flies have been a buzzing.\n\nSetting all those things aside though (which I know may be hard for some), the blue plate is a Madison delight that should not be missed.

I tried this place for the first time the other week when my grandparents were visiting me in Madison.  It was just wonderful!\n\nThe decor is adorable, the servers were friendly and prompt, and the food was fabulous.  I went with the Heathen Vegan Sandwich, which is piled high with mushrooms, tempeh, and avocado.  For my side, I chose the bean salad.  Both of these items were delicious.  The sandwich was HUGE.  I could not eat it like a regular sandwich, so I ate it in an open-faced sort of way with a fork.  A little messy, but totally worth it.  The mushrooms and tempeh were perfectly seasoned and tender and the avocado brought it all together with the toasted bread.\n\nI got a bit nervous because at the *very last second* my grandma changed her order to the exact same thing I got (she's not vegan) because she \"trusts me\".  I was pretty nervous, but she ended up loving it!  I was so pleased.  My one complaint might be that my bean salad had a bit too much dressing on it, but my grandma's did not share that problem and it wasn't difficult to just eat it with a fork instead of a spoon.\n\nMy grandpa ordered some sort of breakfast platter and was very pleased.  He basically always orders the same thing at diners - two poached eggs, bacon, potatoes, and toast, so if he is impressed I feel that it is a good sign. He said the eggs were cooked perfectly.\n\nThey seem extremely accommodating for allergies and preferences as well, which is always a huge plus.\n\nOverall, I was very happy with my first visit to Monty's.

For having such a big and varied (vegan, vegetarian and uhh... carnivorous?) menu, everything I have ever tried has been really incredible.\n\nThey have options for everyone, sweet and savory breakfasts, filling dinners, boozy shakes and tons of delicious cakes and cupcakes. I usually just go for a sandwich, sometimes the Artichoke sandwich, or Farmer John's. My absolute favorite from back in my vegetarian days is the Meatless Meatloaf of the Gods. I would usually ask them to make it into a sandwich and they would do so, no problem. I've heard incredible things about their regular meatloaf, but I can't stop ordering the meatless version to ever get the real deal. They also have incredible sides. The Three Bean Salad is sooo addictive, the Mashed Potatoes with Cashew Gravy (!!!) is really comforting and their Waffle Fries... I could probably just order a plate of those fries and call it a day.

Standbys be damned! So I ordered the Meatloaf Stacker sandwich (open face) with the gravy on the side (I'm not a big gravy fan) with their always fabulous waffle fries and an Oreo shake instead of Chocolate. Here's how it went down:\n\n~ Sandwich: The meatloaf was good - fairly moist with a nice full flavor profile (wise addition of sausage). The mashed potatoes were dry and needed seasoning so I pulled those off and skipped them altogether. The sprinkling of fried onions on top was brilliant both flavor & texture-wise.\n\n~ Waffle fries:  SO GOOD - ALWAYS!!!!!! Enough said.\n\n~ Oreo shake:  It was delicious with lots of real Oreos. And I love that they give you the extra shake in that metal blending cup - so old school, so classy. I only wish they made their shakes just a bot thicker so it didn't get liquidy so quickly.

We agreed to meet there at 8pm.\n\n- Not good for groups. We originally thought we would have six people, and were told they didn't think they could accommodate us. Turned out we had 4, and that was still a stretch.\n- The wait! Holy cats. One of our party arrived at about 7:15pm, and put his name on the wait list. We weren't seated until after 9pm, and were then told that they had run out of cod, and had a half piece of walleye left, \"maybe\"\n- The smell. I'm going to smell like a deep fryer for 2 weeks after standing in that tiny, low-ceilinged place\n\n- Prices. For a dive bar, they're fairly proud of their stuff. Further, a drink board special showed Alaskan Amber on special for $3, yet it always rang up as $4.50?\n\n- Service. Atrocious. Abysmal. Two servers, running around like crazy, yet not really helping anyone in the process. \n\nWe were seated at 9:00pm, and didn't receive any food until 10:15pm. How is this possible? 3+ hours??? To make matters worse, as we sat waiting to share our order of cod and half-piece of walleye, we repeatedly asked for refills of waters/drinks and for an extra piece of bread or two to help tide us over... nothing. \n\n- The cod. Boo. When it finally arrived, the three pieces of heavily-battered European block cod were far too watery. According to my fisherman friend (he's a professional fisherman who fishes for Alaskan salmon, cod, and sable fish), the cod they serve here is a pressed-combination of cod loin and belly. It fell apart as we cut into the pieces, and was difficult to eat, other than to scoop it with a fork. At least it was served piping hot, and the batter had a decent seasoning. But the fish itself wasn't exciting at all.\n\n- The fries. Cold. Lifeless. \n\nI love dive bars, a lot. But Villa won't be on my list of places to return.

At first I thought it was just sarcastic \"Soup Nazi\" humor, but soon realized that the prevalent hostile attitude there is genuine and that it trickles down from management to employees, customers, and even performers.  I've seen bar managers there either berate customers directly or berate the bartenders who then have to try very hard not to pass that negativity on to customers.\n\nAlso, it's downright embarrassing to be an audience member there when the bar mistreats the band.  I once saw a Harmony bar manager preempt an encore performance by turning on the overhead lights, jumping up on the stage, and literally grabbing the mike from a performer to announce that the show's over and that everybody has to finish their drinks and leave.  I was floored.  It was the first time I'd ever seen anyone kick a band off the stage just because they wanted to close their bar early.  \n\nThe kitchen staff works hard, and the food is decent.  Unfortunately, this is the only bar I've ever been to in Madison where I've been asked to pay for my dinner tab up front.  (There are lots of other bars that also don't take credit cards, but they still let you run a tab.) It made me wonder if they didn't trust me to close out my tab or if they were hoping my tip would be better prior to experiencing their poor service.\n\nIn short, even on occasions when they book national acts, it's not worth going there if you're going to encounter hostility when you want something from the bar.  There are too many other fun places to go in Madison for anyone to have to put up with the miserable buzz killing atmosphere that prevails at The \"Harmony\".", "business_id": "KHOHjA8HOcTlFBCtMQFv8A", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-12-01", "type": "review"}

Everyone was in the mood for burgers so it seemed like a good fit for a relatively inexpensive Friday night dinner.  Pulling in the parking lot I was surprised at the lack of business - that should have been my first clue.  We were seated promptly and our drink order was taken.  Then we waited.  And waited.  Finally our drinks arrived and our order was taken.  We ordered a small appetizer and bowl of soup with our meals.  Again, we waited.  Our appetizer finally arrived - but no soup.  It was mediocre, and sadly, the best food we would have that evening.\n\nOur entrees arrived shortly after.  It was then my husband asked if he could have his bowl of soup.  Soon after the waitress arrived with a half filled bowl.  It almost looked as though it had been full at one point, then dumped out.\n\nThe fries were cold on all our meals.  The burger I ordered well done, was extremely pink. I did not bother to ask for it to be corrected because at this point the whole experience was quite laughable.  More than halfway through our entrees, a gentlemen in what appeared to be a manager's uniform, came to the table with a bowl of soup asking if it was ours.  My husband laughed and told him, \"No, I already got this half full bowl.\"\n\nA few moments later I bit into something hard, like bone, in my burger.  At that point I was disgusted - and done.  I would have told the waitress that the food (and service) was awful, but we were never asked.  When she brought the bill she said she had taken the soup off the bill since it was only a 1/2 bowl.  So my husband's comment must have at least made it back to her, yet there was no apology for it, nor the fact that he had to ask for it and received it after his entr\u00e9e.\n\n$58.00 for 3 people, lackluster/slow service and terrible food?

It took a couple years because of the diversity and number of places on that street, but eventually he got to all of them. That sounded like a fun project to undertake, so I thought I'd do the same. Picking which street in Madison was kind of difficult, especially since you can stay driving on the same road and it'll change names like 4 or 5 times. I decided to pick one such road: Monona Dr which turns into Attwood Ave, which turns into Willy Street. There are so many great places on this road, some of which are already favorites, but others that I need to get around to visiting and reviewing. Now the journey begins....\n\nIt was a snowy December Sunday afternoon when I visited this Red Robin. The snow kept a lot of people away, but the place was still about a third filled. I was greeted and seated promptly. I've been to Red Robins before and I like to think of them as an easy place to go when my sister is in town visiting with her kids. Kids seem welcome here (they even can get a balloon) and since it's already a loud place, I don't mind when my niece and nephew act up (to say I'm not a kid person would be a great understatement). The burgers here are good with fun toppings. My go to is the A1 peppercorn burger which may rival Bob's Bad Breath Burger from the Weary Traveler when it comes to giving you bad breath afterwards. The onion bun along with the crispy onions on top definitely leaves you reaching for some gum after dinner. If you are feeling gluttonous, the never ending refills of steak fries can fill you up. When they are fresh and hot, they are pretty tasty, but if you are looking for crispy fries, this isn't the place for you. They had some boozy ice cream shakes on the menu that looked interesting, but I'm not in the mood for shakes in winter. Overall it's a decent place for burgers and fries if you don't mind that it's loud, there's tons of pop culture crap all over the walls, and that it's a chain.

We live in Monona so it's the closest and used to be dependably good food and service.\n\nStopped in before Christmas, snow coming in and they were not busy.  Lots of servers.  Sat down to order and our waitress took our drink order, came back with it and told her we needed a couple more minutes to decide on our order.  She never came back, I could see her behind the bar talking to the other servers, she wasn't busy.  After about a half hour another server who seemed to have quite a few tables stopped by and asked if we were ok, I said no, we didn't seem to have a server.  She took care of our table, seemed to try to talk to the manager about what was going on but he looked pretty disinterested.  After we ordered our food our original server showed up, apologized and told me she had gotten busy behind the bar, honestly, lying is not the best policy, telling me she forgot would have worked better with me.  At the end we tipped the server that actually helped us and did not leave a tip for the no-show server.\n\nCouple of other things, the bottomless fries are now a few fries in a little basket.  Talked to some other locals and one had food served with wrappers from food products in her food.  Other problems were mentioned, this location seems to be struggling.  This could just be the Monona location or maybe Red Robins in general?  We haven't checked out the East Towne location.  This is too bad they typically had good, reliable food, priced pretty well.\n\nI don't leave bad reviews for restaurants that are not great but this was a ridiculous experience considering there was no one in the restaurant.

The price was reasonable too, as their large beef brisket (which is 8 oz) was $9.50, coming with two sides of our choice. The ranch beans was awesomely cooked.\n\nIf I could, I'd give them 4.5 stars, but 4 is too low for them. You ask why? Well, I was expecting it be a bit more elegant. For example there is no waiter service. You enter their store, get into the line to order, get your food (very quickly) on a tray and then will go to find a place to seat. Another reason I wanted to dropped a half star is that they didn't accept my DISCOVER card (Although I'm kind of used to it, but nevertheless a nuisance). Another thing is the pricing on their small beef brisket. They ask for $8.50 for the small one, and $9.50 for the bg one, thus they're totally urging you to eat more (Not that the meal is bad, but too much meat isn't good for your health anyway).\n\nBtw, the sandwich prices are very reasonable, with most of the sandwiches being a measly $3.99. I didn't try them, but they come in small burger buns (think MacDonald's $1 burgers size) but with meat extruding from the bun, like twice as big as the bun itself. I guess it is probably enough for a meal.   \n\nAnother good item on the menu is \"meat from the pit\", which they sell by pounds. Basically if you want to bring them home, this is the best deal. If I'm not wrong, it was $9.25 for a pound of their awesome beef brisket (the same price goes for all other BBQs as well). I'll remember this deal for my next home party!\n\nAll in all, a good place to eat.

The menu is limited, and specials change from day to day, but you can expect to find fried chicken, pork tenderloin, meatloaf, Salisbury steak, and beef Stroganoff, pot roast and other Midwestern standards. Mashed potatoes with gravy, green beans, and corn accompany. They have excellent rolls and serve them with a squeeze dispenser of apple butter, making them ridiculously addicting.\n\nThe eponymous and enormous apple dumplings are divine. Save room, you will not regret it. They are essentially cored apples, stuffed in cinnamony goodness, wrapped in flaky pie crust and baked. They are worth a trip in and of themselves.\n\nThe decor seems a bit odd, but is well-suited to the restaurant. Country effects and pictures of family worthy of awkwardfamilyphotos.com adorn the walls. The walls are light, and the fluorescent lights are bright. Do not expect an intimate or quiet meal, but this works as this is primarily a breakfast and lunch joint (traditionally, farm families eat the biggest meal of the day at noon, and call it dinner, with supper in the early evening). The dining area can be crowded and loud, and there is a huge open entryway into the kitchen, so the curious can literally monitor everything that goes on in the restaurant. All this fits, however, as this is restaurant's honesty is bared for all to see and what is revealed is pure.\n\nWhat separates the Apple Dumpling from other restaurants is not just the menu items and decor, it is the sense of family. Servers, cooks, and other staff are clearly all from the same extended family and/or social group (probably the church across the street). If you happen to be of Midwestern stock they will serve you food that is exactly like what your mother and grandmother made, and that is a big compliment in my book.\n\n5 stars for the food, minus 1 star for a complete dearth of vegetarian and/or healthy options (other than a half-assed salad bar), a smallish parking lot, and limited hours of operation, minus another for no alcohol, but plus a star for the great prices.", "business_id": "Gf9HbiraKNZpxbxwScHBVw", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-12-18", "type": "review"}

Tom's looked appealing so we stopped in. We were both very hungry and the menu had some awesome looking offerings. \n\nFirst we ordered the Spinach artichoke dip, as this is one of our favorite appetizers and we like to try it wherever we go. What we didn't realize (which is admittedly our fault) is that it's got jalapeno cheese. The 2 horrible things about this dish were : #1 it's $9.50 and you get the tiniest little cup of dip...seriously...so teeny tiny!!!! Give me a break! And just a handful of stale chips. #2 Who puts jalapeno in spinach artichoke dip? At least SAY SO in the title...when you read \"Spinach Artichoke Dip\" you just assume that's what it will be. Who reads the description, anyway (still, I will take ownership of that part). It was so gross...we sent it back. \n\nThen the dinner salad. A small plate of iceberg lettuce and a few croutons. Really? \n\nThen the worst...the cheeseburger. I asked if their medium was still a bit pink inside and was assured that it was. I realize some places interpret medium rare and medium differently which is way I always clarify. Well, this wasn't even close. It was cooked WELL. It was over cooked to the point of a leather consistency. Also, it was so bland. No seasoning or anything. Our waiter asked if I wanted them to cook me another one but even if they got the meat temperature right it still would have been nasty with no taste, so I passed and just sent it back. \n\nI did eat the fries because I was hungry and it was the only edible thing I got (and not even that good). \n\nLastly...our waitress. She sucked. Never checked on us, seemed to not really care, and it wasn't busy so it's not like she was in the weeds or anything. Needless to say we won't be visiting ever again.

Certainly not what brisket should taste like and definitely the worst I had ever had... period. I thought okay this could just be a bad menu choice, but then I looked at my wife and after a bite of her pulled pork sandwich she removed the bun and started \"picking\" around with a fork. I asked her what was going on and she said no worries, it's okay. She is a very kind lady and would never complain, so I inquired further and she said the sandwich was almost all fat and quietly said nothing else. My wife is NOT a picky eater so this was to take note of. After some time I realized she just pushed the plate to the edge of the table and a server picked it up.

I enjoyed how this particular show brought out some pretty artsy-lookin' and jam-jivin' folks. I can hang with these peeps, I thought. I actually did enjoy the Beat Battle, for it was something new. Nothing like a new experience at a new venue to make one helluva memory. \n\nOnly downside was that the beer selection was lacking. I wanted something seasonal, yet they didn't offer any sort of winter lager or ales. Bummer. I settled for a Kiltlifter to start off with, followed by a Newcastle.  Plus, there's a kitchen for people who have the munchies. They offered a drink, fries and burger for $5. Now that's a bargain.\n\nOh, and let's touch upon the bathroom, shall we. Ladies Room, my arse. More like a \"Enter at Your Own Risk Waste Disposal.\" I mean, seriously. Door 1: the lock didn't align; therefore, the door didn't lock. Door 2: 1/2 the seat lid was broken off and missing. Door 3: Out of Service note. Door 4: The large stall with the big door that wasn't quite big enough to meet the stall column; therefore, it just swing wide open the other way.  Can you guess which stall I chose?  \n\nBut, c'mon, I admit it: I like this venue. I don't always need or want pristine, perfect or even pleasant. In fact, I am thinking my review will change and a 4th star may find its way into my rating if I go back here to see a band of my liking. I missed the Okkervil River show here, and I'll never forgive myself for that. \n\nOf course, this is definitely not a 5 star venue - unless, of course, there's the exception to the rule: no cover, better beer selection and Harry Connick Jr. on stage. Ha. I kid. Make it Bob Dylan and ya got yourself a deal.", "business_id": "4WcxnNv_lzCIG2eb8O5Mlg", "stars": 3, "date": "2007-12-10", "type": "review"}

No big deal we didn't ask for it. We sit down and probably 10 minutes passed and finally someone comes to take our drink order. Another 5-10 minutes passed and we get our drinks and have to ask to place our food order, judging by the service so far its going to be a long time before we get any food so we want to get the process going. I ordered the boneless buffalo wings with a side of fries, my husband orders the ribs, and we got the chicken tenders for our son. The boneless wings were gross, not even warm and not even really reheated all the way, not very saucy almost like a dry rub with a splash of sauce. The fries were good. My husbands ribs were alright, however the waitress didn't come back to check on us until we were done eating. So I snacked on wings I didn't even really want. We couldn't get anymore sauce or a wet nap for my husband to wipe his hands on so he instead had to take off to the bathroom to wash his hands. My husbands decides to order a beer and asks what size the \"tall one\" was, the waitress doesn't know a size but points to someone's glass and says \"that size right there\" so my husbands said he would take one, when it finally comes it doesn't come in a glass but rather a disposable cup, he asked why it was in that and not a glass and he informed him they were \"out of glasses\" \n\nProbably 5 minutes after the waitress drops the check off (the quickest she has came back the entire time we have been there) she comes back and asks us if she can move us to a table outside and mentions how our son will be able to overlook the field if we move out there. NOTE: they have tables inside overlooking the field that say 1 hour maximum sitting time, we WERE NOT at these tables but rather the ones in the back of the restaurant that have no sign with a time limit posted. She also tells us how we can take our sons leftovers and our drinks to go and they will let us bring them in the stadium downstairs. We agree and I go ahead and go out to the outside area while my husbands waits for our to go drinks and a box. I no more then set our stuff down and the hostess comes overs and tells me that we CANNOT sit at those tables and acts like she has no idea why my waitress had told me we could sit there and like I was crazy, then she proceeds to tell us there are stadium chairs out there on their patio that we can sit in but we can't sit at the tables. At this point i'm annoyed because our waitress had kicked us out of our table only to get sent outside to find out we couldn't sit out there either. We take a seat in two of these stadium chairs on their patio and sit there for probably about 10 minutes until a security guard comes and tells us those are ticketed chairs and we can't sit there either. At this point we are more then ready to leave and never come back. When we are leaving there are people waiting all over. I felt bad that they were waiting that long for bad food and bad service, which is the only reason I am even writing a bad review.\n\nOnce we get back downstairs and try to go in with our to-go stuff that we were told we could bring in we are told we cannot bring in the iced tea in the to go cup because it doesn't say TGI Fridays on the cup even though everything else we had clearly said it and we had just came out of the exit. \n\nOverall we were very disappointed by not only poor food but also poor service and lack of communication amongst the staff members.", "business_id": "1-1VcGTL3GyCqUpXZLFTZA", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-01-26", "type": "review"}

No unevenness in texture, light, and just barely strong enough to contain the burger... well maybe not entirely contain.\nThe red beans and rice were good - I'm not well versed in the craft of that dish, but it was tasty.\nBoth the other customers that ordered inside got the fried chicken biscuit sandwich with apple butter made by one of the staff.

Two of us chose the South Carolina-style pork sandwich on a biscuit and a side of fries while our friend grabbed the peanut butter bacon burger and some Sweet Republic ice cream. \n\nWe sat outside instead of in.

I want to totally love this, but frankly, Phoenix is still missing the traditional diner, even when it's housed in an authentic diner. I was hoping this would be the epic college hang-out, but it's too expensive for that. An 8 buck burger is three dollars away from a night out for a collegiate. 5 bucks for a 12 oz plastic cup pour, even a good draft, is still not in that ballpark. Actually, it's close to ballpark pricing. Knock off at least a buck.  And 4 dollars for a very small portion of collard greens will not bring me back to eat it.\n\nI ordered the most expensive meal because I wanted the food experience. Their PB and B burger is exceptional, peanut butter with burger sounds weird, but it's damn tasty and good Schrieber's bacon(also used at Bill Johnsons Big Apple for less dinero). It's the highest price burger at $12.50. I also had the previously mentioned collard greens and a 7 buck Hurricane, tasty and well-mixed, almost at price point correctly with such good ingredients.\n\nThree items and with tip, over $28.00.  This falls into the realm of special event for me, and that's a shame as the folks running the kitchen, taking orders, owners are ALL great and the service was really casual yet efficient.\n\nI would love to see something like a whiskey and soda for $4.00, discounted pitchers of beer, maybe even a discount for bringing in your own coffee cup or dishes as there really is a lot of plastic waste coming out of there.\n\nSure, I'll be back, and for what it is(an amazing restoration of a wonderful place with a killer patio)I'm glad it's here. I'll have whatever is on special now, and skip the sides, though the fries with gravy could be killer with cheese curds a la  poutine. \n\nYet still I wait for the college hang-out.", "business_id": "tb24fvNJfHhyKEXkKn12Xw", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-02-23", "type": "review"}

It's possibly because I was hoping to keep them my little secret. These guys took their Old Dixie food truck and took over this unique and eclectic location that has been home to other popups over the last couple of years. Inside seating is VERY limited 8 built in stools against a small counter. I love sitting inside but I often enjoy their out door seating during the summer and especially on these beautiful Phx winter nights. [They do lunch and brunch as well.] \n\nThe Food: I have enjoyed everything I have tried here. They are known  for their biscuits, which are fairly large, sturdy enough to be used in their biscuit sandwiches but tender enough to enjoy with their homemade honey butter (the honey sourced from a small apiary in the neighborhood) or house made jelly/preserves or apple butter. Many of their veggies are often sourced out of the community garden when possible. They source locally as much as possible, and their menu adjusts seasonally, while keeping some of their popular favorites. They always offer vegetarian options and occasionally even vegan. [Skip the goat cheese on the beet tureen salad and that is a yummy vegan option]  \nThey make all food to order and honor substitutions or additions within reason.  Heck, for dinner one night I ordered their biscuit with goat cheese and smoked apple butter (found on the dessert menu) and asked if they could add bacon.  They gave me a bit of a raised eyebrow as they found the request unique and gladly served it up (and it was SOOO good) \n\nMy favorites:\nAnything with their fried chicken. \nAnything with their biscuits. \nTheir french fries are  hand cut and fabulous. \nThey smoke their own meats  (and sometimes apples for their smoked Apple butter) so try the Carolina or any smoked  sausage, pork chop, etc. that shows up on the specials board. \nTheir burgers rock! (YOU HAVE to try the PB&B, well unless you have a peanut allergy). \nTheir salads are lovely and tasty. \n\nThey offer some select cocktails and a limited choice of liquor. But this doesn't matter because all you need to know is get a HURRICANE (or 3). You'll thank me later.", "business_id": "tb24fvNJfHhyKEXkKn12Xw", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-01-20", "type": "review"}

But where there is jackfruit I will follow.\n\nWelcome Diner on Roosevelt and 10th Streets sells a lot of burgers and booze but they also offer a jackfruit po'boy ($8) and several other interesting veggie dishes.\n\nEven though I fancy the taste of sweet, juicy, ripe jackfruit, it's also scrumptious when cooked and used like a vegetable.  This is the fourth spot where I've had jackfruit in a sandwich (or taco) and 'twas delicious.  \n\nPaired with a cabbage slaw that adds crunch to the 'wich, the flavor was mild and hearty.  I requested no BBQ sauce because that sickly sweetness would have disturbed the taste of the fruit.  My only regret is no side was included in the price.\n\nWelcome Diner also sells a fried green tomato sammich. ($8.5)  Doesn't that sound delicious? \n\n[crickets]\n\nDoesn't it?  Okay, well maybe it's just me.  And lesson learned:   \"Sounding\" delicious and tasting delicious are two entirely different senses.  The sourdough was oily, toasted with a few slices of breaded fried tomatoes laid in-between.  And a fried tomato is...well...it tastes...uhhhh...urrrr...well...well, at least it's a vegetable, damn it Janet.  \n\nNo side either.   If it wasn't for the arugula, corn relish, and ranch dressing on the sandwich, it would have been a complete disappointment.  Ya' hurd meh?  Complete. Disappointment.   \n\nAnd so TOMATO gets added to the list of things that should not be fried and passed off as food.  (That list is quite long, but let me not diverge from the review.)\n   \nAnyway, I will return someday for another jackfruit po'boy, but at $8 bucks with no side, my next visit won't be too soon.", "business_id": "tb24fvNJfHhyKEXkKn12Xw", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-01-29", "type": "review"}

Pretty sure it's the only one left in the city.  When you walk in you can sit on one of the stools at the original bar and one of the lovely folks there will make the drink or ice cream desert of your dream.  A fizz, an egg cream, a malt or even a simple Dr Pepper float.  You name it, they can make it.  The ice cream deserts rock in their simplicity.  \n\nThere are some very cool original booths still left, and some extra seating in the back.  It's not a huge place by any means, but I've never had to wait for a table - even when they were a stop on the First Friday bus route.  Folks who came by acted like they were in a museum - just looking at all the cool stuff - some of which is for sale - and left.  They have NO idea what they were missing out on here.  \n\nThe ONLY thing that makes the place not get 5 stars is that they don't offer french fries.  Their burgers are awesome - but without the fries, I stick more to their amazing BLT or their messy but good good egg salad.  Both of those go great with their potato salad - which I think is one of the best ever.  \n\nThe absolute best part?  We had 2 meals, 2 flavored drinks and 2 deserts and it cost less than $25.

I actually started my journey thinking I would stop at the drip. But when i got there that place just seemed to modern for me. I was in a funky mood and just wanted a nice cup of coffee, nothing fancy. So I saw an older man waving a sign that said \"Best lunch in town!\" and he was kind of dancing too! And I said to myself \"Yes, i think I will\". So I stumbled upon MacAlpines. They had just opened and I sat right down at the counter. I had two cups of yummy diner coffee and after realizing I was hungry too, I ordered a stuffed tomato that was oh so yummy with super fresh veggies. The decor was adorable and welcoming and I loved the juke box. 25 cents gets you two plays! anyway, I'm not giving it four stars because it took some time for the staff to warm up and be friendly.

We had to say good bye to family at the airport, and so wanted a decadent distraction to followup the sadness.  Fancy phosphates and floats served us nicely!\nYou know how classic diners and decor are trendy now, and places are trying to make their restaurants look like they came through a time machine?  Well, this place is the real deal--an authentic 1920's soda shop, now surrounded by a vintage shop (it used to be a drug store).  The place is just wonderful to walk into.  \nOur waitress was unbelievably friendly.  You could tell that the 50's look for her was not just an act--it was her life.  Not only was she friendly, but fast as well.  From the menu, I tried a kiwi phosphate, a tiger's blood (cherry/coconut) Italian soda, tuna sandwich on sourdough, Navy bean soup, and a float to top it off.  All was delicious.  The tuna was not flooded in mayo and was the fattest tuna sandwich I've ever had.  The cole slaw on the side was also a bit dry (little mayo), which to me, is a wonderful thing.  A little pineapple acted to enhance the flavor further.  I am persnickety about slaw, but this I liked.  The drinks were deliciously fizzy.  For desert, we ordered the pumpkin cheesecake bunt cake.  Moments later, the waitress came back to tell us that sadly, she did not have a piece big enough to sell to us, but that there was a small piece left that she could simply give to us for free.  We agreed and added a float for good measure.  The float was pistachio ice cream and amaretto soda.  Unbelievable!  Hands down the best float I've ever had.  And I love that the spoons come in a shot glass of even more soda.  That way, when you eat some of the ice cream, you can add more soda.  Brilliant!  Oh, and the free piece of bunt cake?  It turned out to be the size of a normal piece of cake, but for free.  And it too was delicious.\nThe stores that flank the restaurant served as a good distraction while walking off a few of the hundreds and hundreds of calories consumed.  \nThe only real problem was coming down from the sugar high about halfway between Phoenix and Tucson.  \nI will be back.

I like to linger and hang out due to the charming, lived-in atmosphere, the forgotten Andrews Sisters hits on the stereo, and the people-watching.\n\nThis is a place where you (I) go for certain things only.  I'm not a huge fan of the food because it's not my style.  It's the kind of stuff my grandmother fixed for lunch on summer vacations.  Plain, old fashioned fare.  If you are nostalgic for white bread and mayo, then get to MacAlpine's NOW.  That said, I have had some good sandwiches there, and I like a place that doesn't serve unnecessarily gigantic portions of food.\n\nThe service is always very friendly and pleasant, and they have some good stuff in the two antiques shops on either side of the restaurant.  \n\nHere is what I want from MacAlpine's:  Get a website! Oh my god!  (& when you do, put your menu on it)  And secondly, I'm pretty sure they don't serve espresso drinks right now, despite the fact that I believe I have noticed an espresso machine behind the counter.  If I'm right about that, I should be proven wrong post haste.  I would really like to be able to get lattes at MacAlpine's, because I'm just not a malt, phosphate or egg cream kind of lady.", "business_id": "R6aazv8FB-6BeanY3ag8kw", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-01-17", "type": "review"}

Then while we were sitting 25 minutes waiting for our food we noticed another customer at the bar trying three times to get the manager and the bartenders attention by waving. They didn't give her the time of day we had to flag him down and get their attention so that they would pay attention to the people at the bar. Are food came 25 minutes later. And yep you guessed it it wasn't correct. We had asked for water didn't get it another girl came by and asked if she could remove my cup I said no I would like some water please she said all will let me just take it and I'll bring you another glass of water over 10 minutes later she brings me a glass of water. We had to ask for our bill so we could go and when we got it I walked over to the manager and let her know that I felt that the service was inadequate and she said oh you're the one that had to weigh me down she fully acknowledge that she had to be waived down to serve a customer she didn't offer to pay for our meal she just apologized to pick up our bill and Cassius out.

When we first walked in it was kind of a weird feeling. When we sat down my friends and I were making comments on how the staff looks like they hate each other and how it made an awkward work environment. We are all server so we understand a bad night but seriously it was really uncomfortable in the place. All the servers and host giving each other dirty looks. The food took a while to come out which I get sometimes the kitchen is slow. New cook, under staffed whatever not to big of a deal the issue was our server. I don't know if she had a bad case of resting B**** Face or what but she just seemed like she was annoyed with our existence. This is when it really gets bad about half way through eating my burger I got stabbed in the mouth by something sharp when I pulled it out it was a bone! Now I'm not the one to complain about my food and it was really good up till the end so I just ate the fries and was just done with the burger. ( I was to grossed out to finsh.)

You can't go wrong.\n\nI'm very disappointed that two things I loved on the menu are gone.  First, is the ahi salad, it was really good.  When I inquired, I was told that with the rising costs of ahi that it wasn't a cost effective option.  I LOVED, LOVED, LOVED the blackened chicken sandwich.  I craved it.  Blackened chicken with applewood smoked bacon, jack cheese on a grilled bun.  They changed.  Dammit!  Why?  I'm holding a little grudge on that one.\n\nAt lunch, I always get the soup and salad.  Soups are good, particularly the yellow split pea and I love the honey ginger salad dressing.\n\nThe bar is good for happy hour and relaxing after a movie or a night out.", "business_id": "Pfb6VOIiroqDWOebfgWGPQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-01-14", "type": "review"}

Decent upscale American restaurant catering to older steak/seafood eaters.\n\nI went there for a work dinner with 10 people and was pretty excited at first with its slick interior design and good looking menu, but was consistently let down throughout the evening.\n\nI got my first warning sign as I started looking around looking at the clientle. It looked someone started handing out 50 dollar gift certificates for PCG at Luby's the night before. With a crowd that old and tame, I knew the food wouldn't have as much flavor as I look for.\n\nNext, my pomegranate margarita arrived which tasted likely what pomegranate kool-aid would taste like if they made such a thing. I'm not sure if it even had alcohol in it. I switched to their draft beers which are from several small breweries and much more worth your time.\n\nNext came my Ahi Tuna special which was definitely not worth the price tag. Very bland. Didn't seem like they should even be serving it if they don't know how to make it interesting. Although the rice side dish that came with it was great. Other's in my group who had steak, salmon, and such were much more pleased.\n\nI gave them a chance to redeem themselves with their Croissant Bread Pudding which sounded phenomenal, especially to a bread pudding man like myself. Again it was fairly par for the course and not worth its price tag. The bread pudding at Sonora Brew house is worlds better for less money.\n\nIt seems like a great place to take your parents or people who like meat without much spice and drinks without much alcohol, but it's definitely not a place for me.", "business_id": "Pfb6VOIiroqDWOebfgWGPQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2007-12-07", "type": "review"}

Now PCG makes a darn creamy rich flavorful Mac N' Cheese and that to me signifies attention to quality.  I have had bad MNC at other \"deconstructed\" restaurants but PCG doesn't stray to far from the point of the dish...and they are successful.   I also fancy the Pot Roast or the Pork Tenderloin.

Happy hour is only available in the bar area, where I quickly ventured to. Some of the happy hour items are: Beef sliders with yummy Tillamook cheese (whaddup Oregon!!!), grilled fish tacos, hummus, Green chile cheese dip, beef and chicken skewers, etc. All in all, a great selection with wonderful execution. \n\nThe liquor selection is also solid. Any bar that has items, such as Plum Vodka, gets a thumbs up in my book. The wine selection is also good. \n\nPCG is right off the 51 and also closely located to my dive (yes, my personal dive) the Swizzle. \n\nMy only gripe: The bar area was serviced by one waiter - the bartender. So, being that he was making drinks for the restaurant side as well as serving the bar area, the service suffered. He was not nice, inattentive, and at times rude. \n\nI was able to ignore him as the food made its way to my belly.", "business_id": "Pfb6VOIiroqDWOebfgWGPQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-01-29", "type": "review"}

I had the Surf N Turf Pasta. Its is Grilled beef tenderloin medallion and jumbo Sea of Cortez shrimp over fettuccine tossed with tomatoes, mushrooms and sweet corn in a green chile butter sauce. It was delicious. The beef was cooked a perfect med rare and the wood grill flavor really came thru. The shrimp were great wish there was more shrimp. I did get the small portion so more shrimp with the large . Small was $14 large is $18. My friend ordered the Grilled Beef Tenderloin which is Wood grilled 8oz. center cut filet with chipotle cheddar stuffed potato and sherry glazed mushrooms. $27 These mushrooms were like candy they should serve them for an app cause I know I'd get them.

Their prime rib and sea bass specials looked mouthwatering so I made reservations. In the end, this place did not disappoint!!

I don't like it when margaritas are sugary so this one was perfect, and a great way to get my Christmas festivities started. \n\nFor my main course I opted to try the sea bass special. It came with almond crusted asparagus and some garlicky (and insanely buttery) rosemary mashed potatoes. How would I describe the entire meal? In one word, perfection! That sea bass was so fresh and delicious it practically swam right up to my plate. You can't really go wrong with asparagus but this wasn't just your regular vegetable. They coated the asparagus with a crunchy layer of almonds and it was soooooo tasty. And yeah, the mashed potatoes tasted like they had about 5 cubes of butter in them... but that's the best way to make em!\n\nI wish I had known about this place sooner because it really is such a delightful restaurant. The atmosphere isn't too lively but it isn't too dull. Tons of families, friends and large groups filled the interior so PCG really suits any age demographic.

Not much not to be unhappy about here. \n\nThe Good: \nFood was great. Fresh. Delicious. Served hot.  \nLovely and I split the Chicken/Steak skewers. Delicious, perfect size served with a touch of sweet heat and ahhmazing peanut sauce. Meat was cooked to perfection. Presentation spot on.\n\nThe kitchen was out of salmon but the almond crusted talapia was deeevine. A very generous portion, cooked perfectly with a lovely light berry reduction and beautiful roasted baby carrots and sauteed haricots verts. It was served hot - right off the line hot, which I prefer to resting happily for too long...The Lovely had tenderloin accompanied by what tasted like a chipotle, cheddar mashed potato and a boat load of sauteed mushrooms that was yum and he had no trouble finishing. \n\nWe both had side salads - gorge and fresh mixed greens, on a cold plate no less - me with a balsamic vinaigrette served on the side that was perfect. \n\nSince it had been loudly uttered by the Sweet One that it was my birthday, upon removing the entree dishes, the server presented me with warm chocolate torte and vanilla gelato full on with a candle. Decandent and delicious. And it was comped. Total yaydom for me and my birthday! \n\nWine choices are really fine. Me: Fess Parker Chard, The Boy: a Pinot Noir that I can't recall and therefore shant speak to. Chard was nice, crisp and not overly dry. \n\nThe Bad [or to be fair, Not So Very Good]: \nWe were seated at one of the smaller booths - a two seater. Which is cozy but across from the kitchen and the clang of dishes and next to a loud group of retirees discussing the new HBO series with Dustin Hoffman at full volume. Mmmmm, not so much. \n\nReservation had the wrong name. Not tragic but its not that difficult. \n\nSeemed odd to be out of two entree selections at a 6PM seating on Sunday. But since one was fish, I forgive them. Sort of. That means they're buying very close to what they serve which = fresh. \n\nThe Ugly: Nada. Zero. \n\nWe'd go back. Its a nice spot with really good fresh food. Service was attentive and solid. Overall a really very fine experience. \n\nTopped off with a gift of diamond earrings.

I had the special of the evening, seafood linguine with shrimp and crab and lemon capers butter sauce, .   WOW!!   It was great.  In fact, beyond great.    I was trying to figure out how the pasta was flavored with every bite I put in my mouth.  I think I shall call the restaurant and find out.    It was the right mix of ingredients, not too buttery, which would make it oily/greasy.   The right amount of capers, which, if there's too many, overpowers the other flavors, and the right mix of barely knowing it also contained lemon.     Oh, yes, he had the Grilled Beef Tenderloin.    Since he is on a \"low carb\" diet, he asked to exchange the starch for veggies.    I was thinking about having that, but I am more of a seafood, chicken gal versus beef.    I tried it.   It was good, the beef was very tender.    Sorry, can't give a review from  just one bite.   My wine was the cab, Sebastiani, Sonoma Black Cherry.

The green chili wasn't cooked enough as well. The bread was good but everything in-between wasn't. I had the cole slaw as my side and that was good but nothing that left an impression on me. The other business associates I was with had the Pork special, PCG pasta and the chicken sandwich. All of theirs looked good and I definitely had plate envy.

The most memorable dish from here was actually a Basa filet in mushroom gravy and perfectly grilled veggies along with mashed potatoes. That, my friends, is NOT traditional bar-fare. The chef they have locked up (love that comment Joe S.) does a stellar job. Please don't forget they offer all the traditional fried food options you can dream up. But this is a multidimensional bar, which makes it so unique. They also have stellar drink specials throughout the week and into the weekend. The barkeeps keep regulars happy with free-flowing drinks and will make your day as well if you stop in! They offer a full bar along with beers of different variety as well as select wines to be pared with your special dishes if you purchase one. \n\n~Atmosphere/Service~\nOnce again, service is superb every time I go. I am by no means a regular, but they treat you like one. I feel at home here when I come in to have a bite or shoot some pool. There is no real dive atmosphere, its truly an interesting mix. The inside is by no means \"nice\", its a bit older and adds to the general feel of the room. Along with the bar area with the regulars and the OTB on the screens with rooting betters, it surely is an interesting collection of atmospheres in one. You do not need to worry about loud noise though, the patio outside is helpful and can alleviate any issues with inside noise. I never have noticed much of a noise factor though, its a fine spot to both watch a game and dine at. Its impressive how you can go about it at the 'Dillo.\n\n~Extras/Rating~\nCall ahead for specials that day/week, the website they have does not get updated at all unfortunately.

If you're there to watch a whole football game like I would on a few occasions you could end up spending in the mid to high 20's when it's done, but if you're just there to get a meal and maybe a beer, then obviously you won't end up spending as much like around $15. The bartenders are overall ok. No real issue there.\n\nOverall it's more of an interesting experience than a pleasant experience, which is why I will pop in from time to time, but only from time to time just to mix it up.\n\nOh yeah, and to their credit (at least in my book) they play metal later in the night when all the games are over and there's no more retarded horse racing on.", "business_id": "CqhsIZ7TzCfJTrZqg5-gqQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-02-15", "type": "review"}

We like it so much we go there for our anniversary every year and since the first year we have always sat in a \"snug\" which is a private booth with a curtain so you can have a nice quiet meal with your dining guest.\n\nThe food is always fantastic and I always leave stuffed and satisfied.  I always order seafood (usually fish) and my seafood-averted sig other usually gets steak.  I think it can be romantic if you're dining in the snugs, but if you're out with the rest of the diners it's just another nice dining room and can be a little on the loud side.  We have no complaints and will continue the anniversary dinners and more.\n\nTheir happy hour is fantastic.  The drink specials aren't anything to write home about, but the food is worth the trip.  The burger seems to always be around and I recommend the fish tacos if they show up as well.  I've never had any bad meals and the ever-changing menu keeps us coming back for more.  I've had many, many desserts and they are all fantastic.  The creme brulee is a solid choice and the flourless chocolate cake with raspberry sauce is as sinful and decadent as it sounds.  The wine list is somewhat short when it comes to \"by the glass\" offerings, but I never have a problem finding one I like.\n\nAnother little-known perk is their Preferred Guest Membership.  You are awarded points for every dollar you spend.  If you are a frequent visitor like myself, then it's worth it.

This was our first visit to a location in the Phoenix area, we had been to the location in Columbus, Ohio several times and always enjoyed our meal and experience. This was no different. \n\nFor apps my wife had Lobster and Crab bisque, crab was very fresh lumb crab on top of a little tower of rice. Lobster bisque was poured over table side. Flavor was wonderful and I loved the texture of the bisque. Next up was oyster sampler, 4 oysters of the day. All tasted very fresh, my only issue was some shell pieces in one of the oysters (quite a few pieces) it happens when shucking, but it was quite a few pieces. We then had the Tuna Tartar (chopped Ahi with capers, peppers, onions, dijoin and egg) served table-side with some crisps. This by far was my favorite of the apps that we had. Flavors jumped in my mouth and the crisps had a great texture to compliment the tartar. \n\nNext up was our entrees. My wife ordered the Pancetta wrapped scallops and I had the Crab, Shrimp and Brie stuffed Salmon. We also ordered a mushroom risotto for the table. I had some of my wifes dish and the scallops had been cooked very well, charbroiled just right to give the ham some texture and the scallops had absorbed the fat and flavor. Very yummy. The side with hers was a sauteed spinach that was very flavorful with wine and garlic and not over cooked. My dish was very good, could not really taste the crab, brie and shrimp as much as i would have liked... this was due to much sauce being poured over the fish. Besides that the fish was cooked perfect and I liked the side cut presentation for the stuffing. Fish was mid-rare as requested and I was happy with the dish. The risotto for the table was pretty much standard fare for risotto in most places, I was very happy that it was not overcooked and mush. \n\nOverall our experience was very nice and I will return in the future even without a gift card. One thing I would like to point out compared to our several visits at the Columbus location is that the drink menu was alot smaller, my wife always enjoy trying a bunch of the bar drinks since they use really fresh ingredients and make their own syrups. We had been used to like 6-8 page menu and here it was only 2. \n\nSo overall I recommend the location and next time we will try the Scottsdale location and see if maybe they have a bigger menu.", "business_id": "MU3i2uEyUBntebU6pEyMbw", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-12-21", "type": "review"}

There is a very wide selection of fresh fish prepared to different global styles. \n\nI started the meal with the salmon cakes, salmon spices breadcrumbs and more all cooked in to a little mound, they were moist and crisp, the flavor balance was just right.\n\nFor my meal I selected Ahi in a Asian presentation, This was served very rare if cooked at all sashimi style, there was a small coating of sesame seeds, a side of soy and wasabi. The quality of the fish it self was un paralleled. This came with an again style ginger cabbage slaw salad that was great.\n\nI did attend an event here once which had the most amazing fish presentation I had seen, there was a whole salmon cooked, and its body between the head and tail was skinned, thinly sliced cucumbers were used to create edible scales. \n\nI also enjoy the option of semi private tables, great for a date. They are in their on little cube / room with curtains that can be closed to provide additional privacy.\n\nFor seafood in the valley this is my #1 recommendation and if you are ever traveling check to see if there is one at your destination as I found them to be quite consistent.", "business_id": "MU3i2uEyUBntebU6pEyMbw", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-02-28", "type": "review"}

I have one hell of a sniffer and as I have admitted in prior discussions in this open forum, my nose can be a nuisance. Today as we were out celebrating the holiday at the Biltmore Fashion Park and looking for a light bite, maybe even a glass of wine or bubbles, we decided to stop upstairs to Christopher's. It has been several months since my last visit and recently - in one of last week's discussions - I strongly encouraged a fellow SF yelp-er to visit Christopher's. I thought it would be wise to revisit a place I have genuinely enjoyed. \n\nNow, before I continue, I agree, Christopher's can have, what I refer to as, disconnected service. And, when I am on the receiving end and being disconnected, I force a connection - especially if I want to engage conversation and have questions answered from the service team. That being said, we walked in, asked to sit at the bar and for menus and a wine list.\n\nThey were going to disconnect us. Yeah, not going to happen. We were in a chatty mood and we wanted, very badly to have one glass of champagne and to be full of cheer. I ordered two glasses of Tattinger Rose Special Cuvee and as I sat for my friend to return from the restroom, I couldn't get past the smell. I know that smell. I used to work at an older Tempe bar and I know the smell of well - I know the smell. And, I also know the lovely perfume that should be enjoyed with this champagne, that wasn't happening either because I was distracted. As my friend returned and sat down, she said \"Does it smell funky in here.\" Thank goodness, she smells it too. Its not just my obnoxious sniffer. I opted that we move outside.\n\nAt this point, I let the bartender know why we were moving. I am of the thought that you should responsibly let the service team or management know when something really displeases you or distracts you from a moment. Restaurants, lounges and bars are in the business not of just food and wine, but of making memories. And a memory shouldn't stink.\n\nSo, I casually said something to the bartender know and we moved outside. And, although we disconnect ourselves with the odor, our service stayed connected. We enjoyed our glass of champagne and moved on and through our shopping extravaganza. \n\nI hope that our fellow SF Yelper didn't receive any funky odor and that it was a stale rarity. And for now, I'll give Christopher three stars.", "business_id": "ET9VpUk1UgjMN5DJRV0yOw", "stars": 3, "date": "2007-12-15", "type": "review"}

I watched the hostess as she folded napkins and did other things at her station.  Another couple walked in and they were seated immediatly.  Then another mom and child walked in and were seated.

Ordered coffee with a shot of Baileys and had a slice of cheesecake each.  Our waitress was VERY enthusiastic about the cheesecake.

I will not blame Cheesecake factory because its not their private lot, but its bad.  When I first started coming to this district, parking was open and free, with some valet service.  Then, one day, I came here last year to eat, and it was all chopped up into different pay lots.  the first lots a valet, the next lot is all token pay parking, theirs a pay parking structure in the back, and tons of \"15 minute to go\" parking around the perimeter of the center.  UM, this is a nightmare to navigate!  There's \"free\" parking but they shove you way in the back on the \"north\" side of the lot and you would spend at least 15 minutes walking to cheesecake factory if you were to have parked on that side of the mall.\n\nMy advice?  Either circle 3 million times, or just drop your car off in the token paying lot down the way.  I think Cheesecake factory may even validate, but that's my thoughts...\n\nAnyways, I love you cheesecake factory and you have never failed me!

There's almost always a wait if you have a party larger than 2, even if the restaurant is empty. I don't know if they are understaffed or if there are tons many people visiting on a daily basis. Either way, call ahead if possible.\n\nThis particular location has a valet, but you can easily park around the mall and walk a couple minutes if you want to save a few bucks. Servers are friendly and attentive. Restaurant is nice, big, clean - kind of reminds me of a Vegas casino.\n\nI really like the rye bread - it's soft and sweet. White bean hummus is a nice twist on classic hummus, although I think the accompanying bread was a bit stale. No biggie. I just wish I had ordered a different entree. I got the Chinese chicken salad, which is a stupid choice given their huge menu of American and European dishes. The salad tasted like the Asian chicken salad from Wendy's, but with a bunch of rice noodles on top. Sure, it's a big salad, but not worth the $14.50 I paid for it. Like I said, my own fault - order at your own risk!\n\nThe crispy chicken costoletta was actually good. Once again, big portion, and the chicken was really nice. Mashed potatoes seemed a bit tired, and the asparagus was nothing fancy. Still, it was good, and I wouldn't mind ordering it in the future.\n\nI think the food here is good, not outstanding, and I do think it's overpriced.

My friends had arrived from Paris and were famished. I chose your establishment because of the extensive selection of menu items and the quality of food. It was approximately 5pm and we decided to enjoy our meal on the patio where it was relatively quiet. \n\nUpon entering the restaurant, we were greeted promptly and seated immediately. I was concerned because I didn't see anyone else eating on the patio which typically means the server sometimes can forget they have people outside. Our table was clean, music was at an acceptable level, the sunscreens were pulled down and everything seemed perfect, then...our waitress arrived and introduced herself as Nikea. At that precise moment, our experience began to change. \n\nGranted, had been shopping all day. My guests were experiencing jet lag from their travels. Their English is not that great which required translation and patience just to get through the menu. The four of us were hungry, but we just couldn't believe nor did we ever expect what happened next. Nikea created an environment which made us feel as though we were being welcomed in her own home. Not once did we ever feel rushed nor did we feel like red headed step children for sitting on the patio. She had other tables on the inside  but somehow knew when we needed drinks or her assistance. She made reasonable suggestions and was present for our entire meal.  Although we had just met, she created an atmosphere in which I felt as though I had known her for quite some time. One might ask what exactly did she do?  Everything. Absolutely everything was perfect and exceeded my own expectations this making taking our dining experience from perfect to a remarkably extraordinary epic experience! If she isn't part of your training crew, I would highly recommend you consider making her one. Her mannerisms, attentiveness and overall professionalism was superb, but it was her personality which boosted her A game and placed a personal touch on our experience.\n\nI truly hope you take the time to share this with her. Thank you Nikea for a remarkably relaxing and memorable dining experience. Entertains guests from foreign countries who have limited knowledge of the English language is very exhausting and sometimes stressful. Thank you for making this an amazing dinner for me and my guests. \n\nAnd if you are reading this to her, I hope you give her a great big hug for me right now.

Never saw it done like so, but I'm not a fan of soggy wings.  I always order on the side, but the bartender convinced me to go with \"the works\", and keep it as is.  I'm not a sucker for pretty bartenders, but how can I say no.....ooooh shucks sure!  I did not regret the decision - no foo, not the \"Lebron Decision\", I'm talking about the wings!  Okay let's stay focused.  The wings came with a perfect texture of crispiness with a jolt of sweet and spicy sauce.  Bam!  Best damn sauced wings I had!  Thanks for the recommendation!  I ordered a side of fries to keep that spicy to balance the spice.  \n\nAlong with your food you must order a few drinks here.  Not the largest selection in town, but if you need that go to the Yard House ya hippy!  My AA (Affordable Alcohol) group would love it here.  In my opinion the drinks are pretty cheap considered the prices of most places these days.  \n\nOverall, great bar to lay low if that's how you feel for the night.  It's right in the heart of the Arcadia neighborhood and it's not as rough as it looks from the outside.  I'm from Iowa and I've seen some rough bars and this place looks the spot, but once you start meeting the people around having a drink.  You'll feel just at home - a Midwest home that is....- Enjoy!", "business_id": "qz4ZOcv-840UjfCEYI4qZg", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-02-18", "type": "review"}

However we couldn't come up with a style of food we were hungry for.  Now, when this happens my boyfriend invariably reverts to his inexplicable love for TGI Fridays.  I don't really understand the infatuation.  Friday's is fine, I guess, but when there are so many other better options why bother?  Plus there isn't one remotely close to my house.  So i start rattling off other pub-ish type places in the area where he might have a similar (but better) experience.  We settled on Wally's.  I had been once before but this was his first time.\n\nWhen we walked in, the host gave us our choice of seating and we decided on a high top near the bar.  As we settled into our seats and took a look around, we agreed that the ambiance and decor are homey and welcoming without being obnoxious.  In fact, it sort of looks like a low key Friday's.  \n\nOur waiter came by promptly and took drink orders.  Wally's has a decent beer selection and the bf thought they had a nice whiskey selection as well.  We noticed how good the calamari looked as it was delivered to a nearby table and ordered that to start.  As we waited for it to arrive, we concentrated on our figuring out our entree orders.  I ultimately went with the chicken quesadilla off the appetizer menu and the bf ordered the Frisco burger.  The server was accommodating and helpful, making suggestions and answering questions as needed.  He specifically mentioned that the chipotle mayo on the burger was fantastic.\n\nWhen the calamari arrived, we dug in.  The calamari well well cooked, with crispy breading and tender meat.  The marinara it was served with though was underwhelming.  We sat for a minute wondering whether to send it back or just deal.  Then, my bf said, \"I wonder how that chipotle mayo would be with the calamari?\"  Genius.  We flagged down server and he agreed that the mayo sauce was great with the calamari.  In fact, it was a  vast improvement.  They should just serve both sauces with the calamari.  Or ditch the marinara altogether.  \n\nWhen our entrees arrived, bf was pleased with the mix of onion rings, fries and sweet potato fries served with the burger.The burger was cooked to order and similar to a patty melt.  My quesadilla, while not Mexican restaurant quality, was decent for the environment.  It was tasty and I appreciated the sides of sour cream, avocado and salsa it came with.  \n\nOur server was attentive throughout the meal and checked in on us occasionally.  He offered dessert, but we were too stuffed.  Overall, we had a great experience.  I enjoy Keegan's as a neighborhood pub spot, but I like Wally's better. We'll be back for sure.", "business_id": "To5CjntVFawXM_hpAhvVdQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-01-21", "type": "review"}

The serving sizes were perfect. \n\nWe rounded out the meal with two desserts, creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e for me and some sort of chocolate flourless thing for my husband.

FANTASTIC views of the valley!  EXCELLENT service!\n\nWhen making my reservation, I explained that I would be proposing that evening.  They made sure we had the best window table in the place.  I also had it prearranged that if I hadn't proposed at sunset, that I was going to do it between appetizers and dinner.  I have to give special thanks to our waiter, Luis, as he absolutely went above and beyond.  He made sure our dinner order didn't go in when we placed it(to insure I had plenty of time to propose outside on the patio overlooking the valley), and he even took my camera and snuck outside to take pictures of the actual proposal when I dropped to 1 knee.\n\nThe food was excellent and so was the wine selection.  It's a little on the pricey side, but worth it.  We both had the lobster bisque and the filet, and both were excellent.  I was pleased to see Cakebread wine on the list, as that is one of my favorites.  They also brought out complimentary hot cocoa from the chef, champagne to toast with, and a special dessert that had \"CONGRATULATONS!\" written in chocolate on the plate.  We spent 3 hours there, from start to finish, and we were not rushed once.\n\nParking was easy, since you just pull up to the front and they have valet.  There is also a full bar 1 floor below the restaurant that is spacious and classy.  The patio areas of the bar and restaurant also connect together outside, which gives the place a much more spacious feel to it.  The outdoor firepit and fountain area also a nice touch.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this place if you are looking for a romantic place to take your \"someone special\".  You can't beat the views, and you can even eat outside when the weather is warm enough.  Just make sure you call in a reservation well in advance to make sure you get a good window table.", "business_id": "3Zsjlum5kl5N5KV712aTMQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-12-27", "type": "review"}

We had gotten a limousine so that we didn't need a DD but we were disappointed when the driver informed us he would have to drop us off at the resort so we could take a shuttle to the top (the road is too steep and narrow for a limo). The friendly shuttle driver told us that this is a common surprise to groups coming for special occasion parties like the prom. So, just something to be aware of. Once we got up to the top, it really did feel like the place was built right into the mountain top. You can see the exposed rock of the cliffside surrounding the entrance. It was very cool. We rode an elevator to the top floor and you could see why they wanted to be as high up as possible. The view was stunning. I am sure it would be gorgeous at sunset but this was around 8pm and I personally really enjoyed being able to see all the city lights shimmering below us. The design of the restaurant is upscale but understated; they keep everything neutral so that the large wall of floor to ceiling windows is the main focus.\n\nWe decided to do the tasting menu and I am so glad we did. It was worth every penny ($80pp plus $40 for wine). The portions were a decent size and every one was delicious and unique. My sisters requested no shellfish or veal (and unfortunately I had to comply) so the chef substituted two of the dishes with something else. Our waiter was very diligent about making sure that we were all happy. We started with a piece of pork belly with wild mushrooms on a bed of bleu cheese polenta. This was a surprising first course (I think it was supposed to be shrimp) but I loved it! The pork melted in my mouth and I loved the tangy bleu cheese mixed with the creamy polenta. We had gotten the wine pairing as well so the sommelier made his appearance and explained that since we were changing up the dishes he was changing up the wines as well. He selected a very light red that had enough tannins to complement the pork and the cheese but was still light enough for a first course. This wine is not on their list but he had a couple bottles that he was trying out himself and he picked that one for us since he knew it would go with the dish that the chef had changed around for us. I couldn't believe how accommodating the staff was to their guests and how coordinated and educated they were. Second course we got a Pillsbury Rose which was also fantastic and the sommelier told us all about the history of this local winery and some stories about the AZ wine culture in general. It was awesome. The wine went perfectly with the salad we were served of assorted micro-greens with fresh currants and a tangy, fruity vinaigrette. A nice surprise was that under the greens were some hamachi sashimi. The fish was delectable and the salad was an explosion of flavors. I love dried currants in baked goods and currant jam but I have never in my life even seen a fresh currant, never mind bunches of them still on the vine. It was very cool! The next course was the fish course, accompanied by a crisp white blend. I am not a fan of sea bass but this one was cooked perfectly and it was a different type that was pink like salmon. I confess it did not convert me to being a sea bass lover but I loved the vegetables it was served with so much that I scraped up the remaining sauce with the rest of the bread in the bread basket (which was a very tasty focaccia, btw). The last course was the highlight of the whole experience. It was medallions of venison tenderloin. They were well-done (which is how I like my meat) but still completely fork-tender. The sauce for this dish was equally delectable, a sweet red wine reduction. The flavors in this dish were fantastic and the portion size was so large that my sisters had to take half of theirs home. The wine for this dish was a wonderful red that was so amazing I am going to go hunt it down and I will buy at least one bottle no matter how much it costs. I managed to save a bit to go with my chocolate cake dessert. The cake was good but it also came with a small cup of a super-thick and creamy hot chocolate that was out-of-this world. I thought it was great that we each got to pick our own dessert but my sisters both ended up not caring for theirs. One ordered the Apples on the Rocks, which is the one all the Yelpers raved about but it was completely tasteless and boring. It tasted like they had messed up and forgotten a few ingredients (like sugar?). My other sister ordered the chocolate and chestnuts dessert which was at least passable but somewhat blah. The boring desserts were not a big deal, though, since by that point we were sooo full!\n\nIt was such a fantastic experience from start to finish I really think this is one of those places every Phoenician must go at least once.

I brought my wife here for our first date, proposed to her here, and we even got married on the balcony outside. Dining in Phoenix doesn't get better than this.

Great story and example of how good the service is...even when your not the diner.\n\nI wanted to do something really nice for two of my friends on Valentine's day.  One problem though, they live in Arizona and I'm in California.  I know! I'll send them to dinner...wait, but where?  I have no knowledge of the restaurant scene in AZ.  So naturally, I jump on Yelp and start looking up restaurants.  Different Pointe of View comes up and it looks like a fantastic choice.  I check with one of my friends (she is in on the surprise) and turns out this is one of their favorite places to eat.  They are both foodies so that told me immediately that the food must be excellent.\n\nSo I found a place, but how do I arrange this so that everything goes smoothly?  Enter Catlyn, the hostess who answered the phone when I first called.  I explain the situation and what I would like to happen.  I was expecting something to the tune of \"I am sorry sir but we cannot accommodate a request like that,\" or something of that nature.  Catlyn responded enthusiastically to this idea and said she would email me the correct form to fill out so that dinner would be taken care of.  She then took my reservation for my two friends and assured me that they would be well taken care of.\n\nWithin hours the form was in my inbox.  I filled it out, preselected a bottle of wine off of the website and faxed it back to the restaurant.  Catlyn responded to each and every email correspondence  I sent her regarding my requests as well as making sure her managers were aware of the situation.  Her enthusiasm and professional manner made me feel at ease with regards to how the evening would unfold.  I knew there was only so much I could do from California so I was reliant upon people I have never met.\n\nI spoke with Catlyn on the phone once again to confirm the reservation and that everything was in place.  She assured me everything was good to go.  I was trusting the staff and the restaurant to come through for me.  A Town Car (not arranged through the restaurant FYI) picked up my two friends on Friday and drove them to Different Pointe of View.\n\nFriday evening came, hours later so did the phone call.  Just hearing how happy and surprised they were on the phone assured me that they had a tremendous dining experience.  They said the food was \"amazing\", the service was \"incredible\" and that they could not have had a better evening at dinner.  Their experience held true to every promise that Catlyn had made, and in turn made me me feel like the trust I placed in the restaurant was more than respected.  The restaurant went above and beyond.  I could not of been more pleased.\n\nI am so thankful to Catlyn and the staff at Different Pointe of View who played a part in my little surprise.  Thank you for helping me bring joy to two special ladies.  The way the evening went made me feel like they were just as important to the staff as they are to me.  Next time I am in Phoenix I will be stopping by to say hello and enjoy the food for myself, because I already know it is excellent.

Gorgeous view and great food, wish we had gone here on our first night. I had the pork tenderloin entree. The brie risotto was different (a bit pungent), but good. There are minimal vegetarian options, so my friend ended up getting the three side combination with Saut\u00e9ed Parmesan & Herb Gnocchi and the Seasonal Fresh Vegetables; which she enjoyed. For dessert we shared the Classic Tahitian Vanilla Bean Cr\u00e8me Brulee. It came with fresh blackberries, and was delicious. As others mentioned, it came with a bleu cheese cookie, which was unique and different but tasty and worth trying (although my friend did not care for it). For drinks, I had a glass of the Hahn Pinot Noir, which was delicious and I highly recommend trying it. My friend had the chocolate martini, which she remarked was standard. \n\nThe main reason I'm taking off a star is because the service, while polite and cordial, it felt like they were trying to rush us out the door. Our reservation for dinner was at 9:30 on a Saturday night, and I don't think we were taking a long time, though the restaurant basically cleared out by 10. So the ambiance also lacked a bit in that way. Make reservations---you may not need them, but there might be an event that makes it harder to get a table (as we discovered). There's a lounge downstairs that also has the beautiful view that serves appetizers.", "business_id": "3Zsjlum5kl5N5KV712aTMQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-02-24", "type": "review"}

My wife and I recently moved to the Phoenix area from Chicago and I really had no idea about where to dine. It was my wife's birthday and I wanted to dine at least at a 4 star restaurant- so I came to Yelp for advice.\n\nOur reservation was 8:15pm and we arrived at 7:55pm. We were invited to sit in the lounge area, which we did, and I expected to do so since we were so early.  We sat in the lounge for about 10 mins and were not approached by a server. In fact, I thought there were no servers since I saw none on the floor so I went to the bar and ordered myself, just like I would at a Chicago neighborhood bar. (Irk#1)Drinks were good and strong, but REALLY pricey- $26 for 2 drinks.\n\nAround 8:30pm, we went back to the hostess desk as no one came to get us for our reservation yet, (they said they would find us in the lounge). We were told our table still wasn't ready and to wait by the fireplace. I was a little peeved now and Iwould have expected to wait if I was late- but we were sufficiently on time I thought. \n\nWe were seated after waiting another 5 mins or so. (8:45pm-30 mins late)(Irk#2) The wait staff, I thought, were pretty good overall. They did a lot of table \"hopping\", i.e. covered each other's tables, so diners were well taken care of yet not too pushy or chatty.\n\nWe both ordered the lobster bisque soup. I ordered the halibut and my wife ordered the scallops. Bread was not brought to the table until after we ordered dinner- which was 10 mins after we were seated. (irk #3) The sourdough bread was excellent. The focaccia bread was kind of bland and dry. There were 3 dipping sides offered with the bread, which were very good. \n\nLobster bisque was quite delicious. They put this \"hydroponically infused\" basil seasoning on top of the soup that was very good. I thought the soup was a little overcooked (sitting in the pot too long taste) but still good. My dinner arrived hot and the halibut was bland and little overcooked. (pan-fried). I asked for 2 more pieces of the sourdough bread to eat with my dinner and we were told they were \"out\" of sourdough. (irk#4). Friday night dinner service and out of bread? Really? My wife's scallops were cool as well as her vegetable sides on the plate. (irk #5)The waiter didn't check on us until 10 mins after the dinner was serves (irk#6) so it wasn't feasible to send it back to get reheated. The waiter offered us comp deserts for the trouble, at least.\n\nThe last irk (#7) was that we asked for a bag to put our left-over take home boxes in- 3 total boxes. The waiter said they \"were out of bags\". He checked twice and the 3rd time brought us a Home Depot bag. I asked if he went to his car to get it. How difficult would it have been for the restaurant manager to go down to the gift shop and grab a couple of dozen bags? \n\nMaybe my expectations are too high since I'm from Chicago(?), but when  a restaurant is rated 5 stars by all of you Yelpers, I expect a little better service when dropping a couple of hundred bucks. Other than the view and the ambiance- I wouldn't recommend this restaurant.", "business_id": "3Zsjlum5kl5N5KV712aTMQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-02-25", "type": "review"}

The vibe of the place is very dressy, sophisticated, so come in your best dress. Reservations are flexible (I used OpenTable) and we were seated promptly near the window, with a gorgeous view of the city on a Friday night. If you have time, be sure to go to the Terrace Room for drinks, so you can have a cocktail and sit atop the hill and warm up next to the fire. \n\nOnce seated, our waiter was super courteous and funny, even the busboys were extremely gracious and polite. I never felt pressured to order anything (though they DO have a $9000 bottle of wine on the menu!) and was never intimidated by the atmosphere. We had focaccia bread the lobster bisque to start, and it was very impressive, be mindful that the texture is smooth, not chunky, and the flavors are very complex. We loved it. For entrees, I had the grilled endive and apple salad, which was surprisingly refreshing and not too sweet! The boyfriend had the duck breast and potato cakes, which had a perfect cook and looked just beautiful. \n\nWe finished by sharing a Birthday chocolate cupcake, which was cold but free :P As I think about it, I think the food was pricey mostly due to the location and the view, but I really can't say anything negative about the food, it was great. Take your loved one to this restaurant for great food and the experience.

If wasn't for the 6 pieces of bread I ate, I would have left hungry after dropping $150.  Much of what we were served was sparse and \"micro,\" plus severely bitter greens, which left both my mouth and my wallet feeling ripped off.

She really appreciated that I took her out to such a nice place, bless her heart.  We arrived about a half hour before sunset because I thought it would be fun for us to watch it go down - it WAS fun, great view, had our drinks served to us on the outside veranda then moved to our window table inside.  Drinks were perfect and tasty, but with tax were just shy of $28 for two small drinks.  \n\nAmbiance is impressive and classy, but no background music was heard.  Bread was presented to us almost immediately, a generous combination of focaccia and sourdough - tasted good, but wasn't warm.  The meager amount of basil dipping sauce tasted great, but they \"ran out\" of it at the point when I asked for more bread.  It seems the chef made a special effort to make more for us, and did so, which I appreciated.   But to run out of ANY key staple item like this isn't good.\n\nAppetizers. \n\nShe had the Pear Salad ($13) - the menu clearly misleads when it says it consists of \"pears\" (she got tiny bits of pears). I kid you not, it came to her with about half a handful of some kind of green sprouty looking grass plopped on the plate.  The \"pears\" consisted of 3 nearly invisible round scoops (maybe half a teaspoon each) of pears, another teaspoon of cheese and some thin dribbles of sauce splattered on this HUGE plate.  The size of the plate literally dwarfed the so-called  \"salad\" - it was ludicrous.  I mean, I could have played a game of chess on the plate and would never have touched any part of the salad.  Sure, the wife said it tasted great, but REALLY?  Four itty bitty half-bites? The pear and cheese components could easily fit into the center ring of a teacup saucer with room to spare.  \n\nI ordered the oysters, which turned out to be 5 of the smallest (1.5 inch - maybe) oysters I have ever seen, laid out on a bed of SALT with rosemary leaves (not edible).  The oysters tasted great, but again, I'm not a midget so why serve me a micro appetizer?\n\nENTREES\n\nShort ribs. For once they told the truth - these were VERY short ribs!  They were the smallest short ribs I've EVER been served - at 1\"x2.5\" - on top of a creamy rice mix that tasted just as good as I could get from a box of Rice-A-Roni.  I forced myself to eat it - it didn't taste bad, but - meh - it was oh so ordinary.  The meat tasted excellent, but really?  All that for $35?  This was billed as an entr\u00e9e, but you could sure fool me!  Even most appetizers have more meat than this entr\u00e9e..  I could have ordered a really large steak plus much more for that price at a really good restaurant.  And the butternut squash Risotto advertised in the menu as part of the meal was just the thinnest paintbrush swipe of paste...I could see the plate through it.  Not even worth putting on the menu in my opinion. Then there was a clump of limp wilted spinach-like greens between the rice and the meat.  Those greens were soooo bitter that it totally ruined my palate for the rest of the food.  When I asked our waiter if he had tasted the greens he responded by telling me that they were grown locally by some young kids who were trying to make some inroads selling food to them (thus avoiding an answer to my question).  I asked him again if he had tasted it, and he replied that he had not.  Folks, if the waiter at a place this high-end serves his guests anything he has not personally tasted, then he's not doing his job.  On my way out of the restaurant I deliberately snaked my way through some tables to see if anyone else had left those greens on their plate, and sure enough I saw some plates that had.  Hey chef!  Get a clue! (or do you even bother to check and see what your customers leave on their plates?)  \n\nMy wife fared much better with two fish fillets and 4 medium prawns on a bed of rice and greens.  She said it tasted great.  I was VERY glad she was happy with her meal.  If she had voiced any displeasure, I would have sent it all back.\n\nI won't go back.  I would have had a better meal at many other restaurants I can think of.  The view and service are nice to haves - but the food is paramount - and for what you're charging, you should be ashamed to offer so little on many of the plates we tried, and fail to ensure that EVERY ITEM on those plates tastes great and isn't misrepresented on the menu", "business_id": "3Zsjlum5kl5N5KV712aTMQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-01-22", "type": "review"}

I've never been to this gorgeous AAA Four Diamond restaurant overlooking Phoenix, part of the Pointe Hilton Tapatio Cliffs Resort, and we were immediately treated to beautiful skies and glittering city lights.\n\nI went there for the Insider's Point of View dinner, where Chef Anthony DeMuro prepares a four-course dinner tableside for only 12 guests. Attendees are treated to a wine reception with appetizers out at that breathtaking patio before heading in to the chef's table, with each course paired with a complementary wine. The dinner is held every month besides summer months, and this season goes through May 1. Every featured winemaker is different depending on the dinner, and last night, we were treated to the delicious J. Hofst\u00e4tter wine from Italy, a winery dating back four generations.\n\nWe started out with Pinot Grigio out of the patio with an artichoke appetizer (Different Pointe of View was kind enough to offer vegetarian alternatives for me outside the regular menu -- they'll work with any dietary needs.) The atmosphere was relaxed and friendly, with lots of room for guests to spread out and take in the view.\n\nAs an introvert who gets nervous at group dinners, the chef's dinner was so much fun and low-stress. Diners are spread out around the makeshift kitchen, and Chef Anthony lets diners know exactly how he's cooking dishes -- it's like a live cooking show in such a romantic setting overlooking the city.\n\nI love cooking but definitely can use all the tips I can get, and I learned a ton from Chef Anthony, especially in regards to risotto, a difficult dish to perfect, even for the pros. He advised to aim to get the rice crackling when it hits the oil-filled pan, and to treat it like pasta -- get it to the consistency you desire in the broth you're simmering it in, then drain it.\n\nAs someone who regularly botches any type of rice, I appreciated his tips. I also had purple cauliflower for the first time, in the absolutely amazing course featuring a spinach polenta cake, abalone and yellowfeet mushrooms, and a smoked tomato sauce. It was paired with a great Pinot Noir that was devoid of a heavy oak-y flavor, because J. Hofst\u00e4tter wine is housed in stainless steel, not wooden barrels.\n\nOur first course was light and refreshing but still really flavorful. My seafood-eating companion had lobster tail with a fris\u00e9e salad with lemon zest, herbs, roasted garlic oil and garlic chips, while I had mine sans lobster.\n\nI loved the crunchy texture, and it paired wonderfully with the J. Hofst\u00e4tter Pinot Bianco, a crisp white wine. My companion doesn't normally prefer white over red wine, but he loved the Pinot Bianco.\n\nLike Chef Anthony did a wonderful job at explaining the cooking process, winemaker Martin Foradori talked about the winemaking process and reminded diners how important acidity is when pairing wines with food. His vineyard has altitudes up to 6,000 feet, and it was really neat to hear about making wine in Italy while we sipped his vino.\n\nWhile we noshed on the veggie polenta dish, our companions enjoyed wild boar.\n\nMy favorite dish of the night was the herb risotto with golden beets, artichoke hearts and a broccoli rabe sauce -- meat-eaters got short ribs braised in veal stock. It was paired with J. Hofst\u00e4tter's Lagrein red wine, which is generally related to a Syrah, compared to the elegant Pinot Noir. Foradori described this wine as fresh and fruity, and it was a great addition to the tasty dish.\n\nOf course, dessert was a treat, a chocolate cherry balsamic cake with chocolate ganache and a chocolate balsamic sauce. The texture was moist and creamy, and I tried to get every last drop of sauce to cover the cake. I loved the cherry flavor, which related well to the red wines, too.\n\nThe dining experience was more than a two-hour feast, and it was so much fun, in addition to making my stomach so happy. The wine dinner is a great value at $99 a person, because you get unique one-on-one time with the chef and so many tasty glasses of wine in addition to the farm-fresh dishes that are incredibly healthy.\n\nThe next dinner is Friday, March 6, with wine's from Italy's Tedeschi Wines. Reservations can be made by calling (602) 866-6350.", "business_id": "3Zsjlum5kl5N5KV712aTMQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-02-07", "type": "review"}

The lobster bisque was delicious and very, very rich.  The daily chef's special halibut was outstanding, as well.  For dessert, we had chocolate with wine pairings - also a hit.  In all, we couldn't have been more pleased with the food served to us, both in quality and portion sizes.  I have read some reviews speaking to \"micro\" portions, and I just don't get it.  How anyone could leave hungry after a starter and entr\u00e9e is truly beyond me.  I also don't get the reviewers who complained about the prices.  Yes, any restaurant of this quality is expensive, but not \"wallet busting\" as mentioned a couple of times.  Our meal of two cocktails, two starters, two entrees, two glasses of wine and the most expensive dessert on the menu was $195, hardly in the top 25% of comparable restaurants in many cities where we have dined.  The service, though, was not up to what I would consider standard for a restaurant of this class.  Our cocktails arrived quickly, but the wine we ordered for dinner didn't arrive until after we had finished our starters - disappointing.  In addition, though we both ordered a wine by the glass, my wife's wine arrived 5 minutes before mine because they had to go to the wine cellar for a new bottle.  When it was time for dessert, the chocolate and two of the three wines arrived, but the third didn't come for another 4-5 minutes because the server brought the wrong one.  Finally, when we each left the table to go to the restroom, neither time were our napkins refolded.  All in all, none are a big deal, but a restaurant of this quality must pay attention to these service details, which make customers feel special and attended to.", "business_id": "3Zsjlum5kl5N5KV712aTMQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-02-19", "type": "review"}

Our waiter wasn't friendly and the person refilling our water spoke to us more than our actual server did. Maybe because it was the end of the night.

But, after thinking about what I would include in my write up I decided I have to go with five stars. Here's why: \n\n*FREE cookie sundae with the purchase on an entree on Sundays (Half-baked Chocolate Chip, White Chocolate Macadamia Nut or Peanut Butter with Chocolate Chip cookie topped with 3 scoops of vanilla ice cream and chocolate syrup. You can mix it up with two and go 1/2 and 1/2!) \n\n*Build your own burger - not only can you pick your \"meat\" but you can pick your \"bun\" and your bun can be a bed of lettuce allowing for less guilt over the fries. I'm partial to the Greek Burger (topped with feta cheese, diced tomato, black olives, and a side of cucumber sauce) made with a turkey patty on a bed of lettuce. \n\n*Karaoke on Saturday nights and, if you want, you'll easily get to sing more than once! (I, however, do not sing. I'm pretty sure I could get paid NOT to sing -- even at karaoke. I like to watch and make requests!!) \n\n* Generally not a problem getting a seat and TVs are EVERYWHERE! But, when it really counts, Gallagher's graciously took a reservation for the play off game and, actually had \"Reserved For...\" signs on the tables. The manager was very courteous, even when some of our group were slow to arrive. For this, Gallagher's has secured its place as my \"#1 go to watch a game\" spot for all time. \n\nP.S.

The first time for Saturday night Karaoke, and the second for the final playoff game (Go Cards!). Over the span of those two visits, I have tried quite a few items. \n\nThe nachos are really, really good. They use nacho sauce versus shredded cheese, which I happen to think is pretty tasty. However, the salad I ordered left quite a bit to be desired. I kept getting the crunchy gross part of the lettuce head so only half of my salad was edible. The cookie sundae was pretty damn good, as well. I have also had the cheese crisp which I have no complaints about. \n\nPerhaps the BEST thing about this place is the $3 well drinks. I am used to paying $5-$9 for a damn vodka tonic, so I was pleasantly surprised when I paid under $10 for three drinks! \n\nNow, service here is another story. I'm sorry to say that both times it has left something to be desired. I completely understand that the place was packed on a football day, but the whole place was reserved in advance so I feel like they should have been more prepared. I had to ask for limes three times, and waited twenty minutes to get one. It also took almost forty minutes to get my damn nachos when I first showed up. \n\nAnother flaw? They put bacon/chicken on my salad, even though I specifically said no meat... and had previously told the waitress I was vegetarian (when I ordered nachos). \n\nOooooo now that I think about it... the very worst part of my experience was that we were seated near the patio, so every time someone opened the door the cigarette smoke rushed in. My eyes were watering and I was coughing the whole time. It was pretty uncomfortable, actually. \n\nOverall Gallagher's is a pretty good sports bar with relatively good food and great priced drinks, but there are definitely some service issues. \n\nDamn....

As much as I'd love to give a neighborhood sports bar props, this place just did too many things wrong for me to comply.\n\nWent there with a bunch rowdy Yelpers to watch the NFC Championship game on Sunday and was fairly disappointed.  For starters, as a sports bar and Cardinals viewing destination that had been promoting themselves as \"the place to watch the big game,\" they seemed grossly unprepared for the crowd they got.\n\nFor starters, I sat at my table for about 15 minutes before I gave up on a server coming over to take my drink/food order, and went up to the bar to order and take the middleman out of the equation.  Only when I went up to the bar did I learn that they had run out of glasses!!!\n\nThis is where it gets good though.  Their drink specials that I was interested in were their $2.50 20 oz domestic drafts, pretty good deal if you ask me.  And since they had run out of glasses (definitely not my fault as I am not their barware supplier) and the bartender asked me to get a bottle instead, I naiively assumed they would honor at least a similar deal to the one that they were promoting.\n\nThis is where I was SORELY mistaken.  Not only did they not give me my 12 oz bottle for the same price as the 20 oz draft that they were unable to serve me, they actually had the nerve to upcharge me to $3 per bottle!!!\n\nNeedless to say, I was a bit incensed.  And it had nothing to do with the extra 50 cents per drink, I just thought it was poor business practice...a bit of a bait and switch, if you will.\n\nAfter the initial poor service and swindling of my hard earned $$, the bar ended up being okay.  Of course I will have to attribute at least 75% of this to the wonderful company of my yelp compadres, who I hate to disappoint with my less than stellar review, but I have to keep it real.  The TVs were big and plentiful, the food was fair.  I ordered a Buffalo Chicken Wrap which wasn't bad but my fries were SUPER cold and therefore inedible to me.  But the bar's sorry excuse for a smoking section is what threw me over the edge and made me want to puke on more than one occasion.\n\nWe had the bad luck of being sat in the general vicinity of the door that led outside to the smoking section, and every time the door was opened either by a server or a patron, you could literally see plumes and plumes of smoke wafting into the restaurant.  It was disgusting.  I couldn't stay even 5 minutes longer after the Cards won to celebrate because I was coughing and my eyes were starting to water.\n\nI am willing to give Gallaghers 1 more shot under the parameters that there can be no special event going on because they were terribly ill equipped to handle it, and mainly due to the fact that they had tons of TVs and it is relatively close to my house.\n\nAs long as the don't run out of glasses again of course...", "business_id": "F-ykHfGY9lWr12OJ_Ofy7A", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-01-19", "type": "review"}

However, with football games to watch last Saturday, it seemed like a fun idea.  Highly enjoyed Gallagher's!  I had a fantastic beer on draft for $2.50.  Hard to beat that price!  Then I ordered the smoked meat platter with pulled pork (BBQ sauce).  It came with two sides and there were many great ones to choose from.  I decided on the sweet potato fries and the BBQ beans.  Really loved their BBQ sauce and would order the meat platter again.  The true highlight was their spicy BBQ beans.  They were so flavorful! The only person that makes beans comparable is my mom. My mom's are the BEST but Gallagher's comes in 2nd place.  Service was prompt and there are lots of TV's so it makes it very easy to watch a game and enjoy your meal.  If I lived in Phoenix, I would make Gallagher's my favorite sports bar.", "business_id": "F-ykHfGY9lWr12OJ_Ofy7A", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-01-18", "type": "review"}

I do not know many people who would consider this a staple. Its there, if you ever need it...\n\n~Fud/Drinks~\nThe food is bland. Lets just call it as it is. Salads are a best example as to how a restaurant treats its menu. If its got good salads, then they must have amazing entrees. Well this works well for Gallagher's, because their salads are meh meh meh. I tried a Greek salad, which for some reason, comes with iceberg lettuce, crispy, dry, iceberg lettuce. SERIOUSLY!? All the other ingredients including the feta  tasted like they just came out of the box/can they were shipped in. Horrible food choices besides the salads. Greasy, overpriced bar foods that really serve no purpose than to make you fat. Lets just say the ingredients in all their foods are lacking significantly. The drinks are typical bar options. Beer selection is OK, nothing stellar, but at least they carry some local options. But nothing to note that will turn heads, just average.\n\n~Atmosphere~\nThere is no atmosphere really. Like an Applebee's, they put things on the wall and expect that to make the atmosphere of the room. No, it doesn't. There really is no ambiance or significant feel, its weird being that its a sports bar. The carpets are drab, by the way... just wanted  to point out that does not add to the experience. Waitstaff are pretty attentive, they do an OK job. But ya, the crowds aren't lively, and I can definitely name some other places you can feel the true sports-bar experience at. \n\n~Extras/Rating~\nThere is really nothing to add, other than the fact that an amazing resort, the Pointe Hilton, is literally a 1 minute walk away. They have amazing food options there, although its not sports oriented. They do have the Hole-in-the Wall restaurant as well, which is amazing western Bar-B-Q. Go there, honestly. This place gets two stars for being an average/below average sports bar chain with nothing much to offer. Their business model needs an update, there are some outstanding local pubs and eateries out here that loyal clients flock to.", "business_id": "F-ykHfGY9lWr12OJ_Ofy7A", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-02-01", "type": "review"}

They have generic bar food, generic drinks, and generic drink specials. They have poker nights several nights a week that bring out... well, just the kind of crowd you expect at a neighborhood sports bar poker night.\n\nThe only reason I'm taking the effort to write this review is to mention their hot wings. They used to have an \"atomic\" wing challenge, where you would sign a liability waiver then have to eat a dozen extremely hot wings. If you could eat all of them you would receive a shirt and your picture on the wall. Last time I was in Sports Peppers all of the pictures were off the wall and the atomic wing challenge was gone, but I believe their hottest wings are still just as spicy.\n\nSince the wings still exist and I did their old atomic wing challenge, let me explain to you how hot the wings were for anyone crazy like me who wants to test their manhood. Let me say beforehand that I can eat a ton of spicy foods. Suicide wings at most every place around town are not a problem to eat. They are enjoyable and do not resemble a challenge or anything too spicy. I figured this \"challenge\" would be easy. It was not.\n\nWhen the plate arrived, the fumes launched a barbaric attack on my nose. I cringed knowing what I might be in for. But hey, any loser cook can make wings smell hot. Actually making them hot is something different. I took the first bite. No sweat. I made a sarcastic remark to my friends, thinking about how awesome I am, probably something along the lines of, \"This shit is a joke. Too easy.\" Well, like most really hot foods, these wings take awhile before they really hit you. When they do hit, have some fucking milk nearby. \n\nSooner or later I finished all of the wings. I was victorious. Except for a couple of things. First of all, my mouth was numb. I drooled on myself a couple of times. My eyes were watering. When I got home, I lived in the bathroom for awhile and produced some utterly vile waste. To be honest, I don't think I ate wings for ~6 months after this challenge. This little sports bar taught me that I'm not the spicy food god I thought I was. You win, Sports Peppers.\n\nOh, to the guy who looks like Jesus and had the 1st place record for eating some absurd amount of these (100 maybe?): bravo, sir.", "business_id": "cTyBfWfmgL3vgRetyfmtyA", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-02-23", "type": "review"}

Yes, it was Valentines Day; but my wife and I have been together for 15 years and neither of us like to do Valentines dinner out for the obvious reasons (crowds, long waits, mediocre food, etc...).  We would rather enjoy each others company and have a good time just being together.\n\nI have been going to Gallagher's on Fridays with a group of friends for lunch.  I have enjoyed my lunches.  So far, the service and all the food I have tried has been very good.  \n\nSo anyway, we walk in and grab a booth.  The server comes over, introduces herself and tells us she will be taking care of us this evening (standard for most places).  We ordered a couple of iced teas and checked out the menu.  \n\nWe ordered our meals and an appetizer that was on happy hour special.  This was about the last time we saw our server (other than her walking by and looking at the table).  The manager (I'm guessing on this, he could even be the owner...) delivered our appetizer, our meals, refilled our tea, checked to see how we were doing, etc...\n\nOur server wasn't overloaded w/ tables, and the place was not packed (we went early, about 5PM), but it seems that we were an annoyance to her and not a table of customers that she was supposed to be \"taking care of\".  \n\nShe did show back up when we had finished our meals and asked if we wanted desert.  We declined because we were full.  She brought the check, I put my card in the folder for her to run.  When she returned the folder, she just set it on the table while walking by; no \"thanks\", no \"see you soon\", no \"go to hell\", nothing.\n\nI won't put the server's name on here because I don't want to embarrass her.  I understand it was Valentine's day and maybe she didn't want to be there, or maybe it was because we were not drinking alcohol.  I don't know...\n\nMy wife and I are pretty easy, we don't ask for a bunch of substitutions, we're not needy.  Just bring us what we order, fill our glasses when they're empty, and check on us once in a while.  Do those things and you will earn yourself a nice tip (I usually tip about 25% up to 40%).  \n\nI will also say that we had dinner on Friday night at the Gallagher's on Carefree Highway.  The food there was also very good, and the service was great (and they were busier than the Union Hills store was on Saturday).  Our server checked up on us a couple of times, the manager came by to check on us, even the young gentleman busing the tables wished us a good night.\n\nThis review is not so much about the food, which has been very good to excellent on EVERY visit (worthy of five stars!), but about the service we received on ONE occasion when we stopped in for dinner.", "business_id": "PkBkqQpAoeX3Ogo5HBthQg", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-02-16", "type": "review"}

In other words, I traveled all the way from Tucson to Northern Phoenix to eat an all right burger.  Well, that's not true.  My friend and I traveled there to watch Avatar on the IMAX screen at Desert Ridge.  \n\nTo reiterate, the burgers at Islands are \"fine\" in the mildest possible term.  The ground beef was of decent to good quality, and therefore the taste was of average to good caliber.  It was the fixings that sort of dragged down the burger in the taste department.  I ordered the Kilauea, which is a jalapeno & black pepper crusted burger with pepper jack cheese, chipotle aioli, lettuce,\ntomato and Island Reds.  I'm not a cheese fan, so I opted to forgo the pepper jack.  I'm not sure if that would've saved the burger.  The seasoning lacked any pronounced or distinguished flavor.  Sadly, the end result was a rather bland burger.  \n\nHave mercy, the fries, on the other hand, were probably the best thing on my plate.  The fries at Islands were good and fresh, just like me with the ladies after a few drinks.  With all due respect to a review who said that the fries \"tasted a lot like In-N-Out's,\" I disagree.  In-N-Out fries are of the thin-cut variety, while Island's are more of a traditional style.  What I appreciated the most about the fries were that they were crispy and fresh.  \n\nThe service was fairly fast, efficient and friendly, especially considering this a California-based chain.  I hate to wait for refills on my drinks, and our server was always on the spot just prior to hitting bottom as to satiate our impending thirst.  By the way, if you order a Cherry Coke here, it comes with an actual maraschino cherry.  Well, the first one does at least.  The second and third ones lacked any cherry.  I guess once you pop that first cherry, you really don't get any more.  \n\nOn that note, I would consider paying Island's a visit again, but it's not high on my list.  There are so many more cherries out there.", "business_id": "hNVcBhJSD5HyLKMf_Z7TaA", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-01-16", "type": "review"}

We both cracked some jokes about how gross the place was and both decided to not wait to eat.  We just got up and walked out.  Do not go here, you will be just as disappointed as us.  We ended up going to the 5 & Diner that is a minute away.  We have been there about 3-4 times and have always received good service.", "business_id": "qdI9KaRhOzaJRK0dvGUSaw", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-01-05", "type": "review"}

Hubby found it on Yelp this morning and so glad we gave it a try! It is located in a sleepy stripmall behind a Starbucks and Gelado Spot, so I am guessing a lot of people don't know its there.\n\nIt is small but they are big on friendliness. The waitresses are the fun no-nonsense type with great senses of humor and are very attentive. We were poured cup after cup of hot fresh coffee and they were very sweet to our little boy. Even the other patrons were sweet, saying hello to him and giving him a smile.\n\nThe food was out of this world- we got a nice big pancake, scrambled egg and sausage patty for our son who ate the WHOLE thing! I got the machaca and eggs and it was one of the best breakfasts I've ever had. The machaca was seasoned perfectly and had nice big pieces of bell pepper and onions, and was covered with eggs and chunky salsa. It also came with nice big chunks of chargrilled new potato homefries! So good!\n\nIt was so much food, I had to take half of it home, but it wound up being my lunch. Most of the dishes range from $6-$9 and they offer lunch and dinner all day long. This is a great place to bring your family, they are great with kids and we were in and out of there in under an hour.

But I am in a breakfast bliss thanks to this place.  \n\nMoving to a different part of town is difficult, especially when it comes to things like finding all new places to eat a inexpensive yet great breakfast on the weekends. Alas, the Peoria Cafe is too far away for a Saturday morning breakfast run, so a new \"hole in the wall\" was needed. I refuse the \"popular\" standards such as IHOP and Denny's, and I was worried that there might not be a suitable spot nearby.\n\nThank God for Yelp! The reviews were mostly good for this place, which was only a few miles away, so thought I would try it.  Everyone said to expect a line, but I got lucky and grabbed a spot at the counter right away. Ordered something simple; eggs and bacon with hash browns and toast. OMG, the bacon, the bacon.  It was incredible, the thickest, most wonderful bacon I have eaten in a while.  Hash browns were crispy (not greasy) and eggs, well are eggs.  I can't wait to bring all my family here when they visit! \n\nONe thing though, when people say it is small, they are not kidding.  Even after reading that, I was surprised how small it was.  There are about 15 tables packed in there, and that's it. One of the waitresses was talking about 2 guys sitting at a table talking for over 3 hours - don't be rude, go somewhere else and catch up.

It was amazing.  I can't believe this is only 15 minutes from my cookie cutter stucco house.  It's almost hard to believe it's even in Phoenix - though to a native like me, it's just one more reason to remember why Phoenix is so great.  \n\nWhen most folks used to think of South Phoenix they thought of crime, blight and anything else associated with being on the \"wrong\" side of the tracks.  Sure, there may have been areas right next to downtown that were like that, but most of South Phoenix was all farming community.  While some of this still exists - especially near and in Laveen - most of these farm plots were sold off during the years to individuals for their own homes - and any of the large lots were sold off to developers in the last 10-15 years or so.  Most of these became mass produced houses (like mine) or shopping centers.  The Farm is off of 32nd street (with property stretching back almost to 24th street) between Baseline and Southern.   To put this in perspective - there is a huge Target/Fry's/Ross/Applebee's kind of complex at 24th and Baseline - and the South Mountain Community College is just North of that on 24th.  At 32nd and Baseline there is the Raven Golf course, with lots of condos all around it.  That all seems a whole world away once you pull in to The Farm.\n\nI'm attaching some pictures from their web site www.thefarmatsouthmountain.com.  I've been only to one of the restaurants so far - The Farm Kitchen which is their lunch spot.  But I plan to visit Morning Glory soon.  All the stores are amazing - and it's so cool to see where it all grows.  As we walked by the gardens it was great to see some kids (and adults) having the process explained to them of how they grow the food organically here - and it could end up at one of their restaurants, in one of the nicer restaurants in the valley, or sold at their Farmers market to be eaten in their own home.\n\nCheck out their menus online.  Yes - it's a bit pricey.  I was hesitant that I'd think it was \"worth it\".  But oh it was.  I can't explain it any better than stealing from a commercial - You can TASTE the freshness!  Everything just tasted so much better.  Not that the atmosphere didn't help - but it wasn't the only factor.  One interesting thing to mention - pets are ok.  There were two folks there who brought their dogs.  The doggies seemed quite happy to have some run around space (leashed of course) and then a nice meal by a picnic bench.  \n\nI'm planning to go again - bringing lots of friends and family at different times.  I'd love to try out their yoga and/or gardening classes too! This will definitely be on the short list of places a visitor needs to go when visiting from out of town.  Better yet though - it's one of the few places you can go in town and feel like you took a day trip out of the valley.", "business_id": "MLcXtnpzygZvQ9BtseLLlw", "stars": 5, "date": "2006-12-28", "type": "review"}

I had french toast with a side of potatoes and my fiance had the monte cristo with a side of bacon.  I would recommend both entrees.  We both ate all of our food (which was a lot) and didn't feel overly full, which was nice.  The potatoes were delicious and the bacon was so-so.

He seemed like the nicest man and was so happy to pair a person with the perfect loaf.  My fiance didn't get that from watching him, but I could tell.

But the food is overpriced, and really small in quantity. I got the Italian sandwich with meats and pepperchini and cheese....it was good, though very much on the salty side. My friend got pasta. It was simple and tasty, but the quantity was so little that he was done in 5 minutes! My sandwich came with no sides. The passionfruit ice tea I got was delicious, though. I think the food prices include the price of the entire \"experience\"--the farm, the artists cottage and the ranch-like atmosphere just a short drive away from the city. That's what makes this place pricey. I had a coupon from Groupon so I didn't feel too bad about it! Oh, and we saw some people out in the picnic area with metal detectors....don't know if The Farm had hired them, but they were using those detector thingies to hunt for quarters! One of the men said on most \"expeditions\" they find rings dropped by guests. So be careful, people!", "business_id": "MLcXtnpzygZvQ9BtseLLlw", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-12-06", "type": "review"}

You can hold a corporate event in \"Stoned Grove\" area around an outdoor pizza oven or you can have an intimate dinner under mature trees with glimmers of stars at night at Quiessence.

I've posted pics too... \n\nOne of the things that the Yelping community might appreciate knowing is that you should visit their website for special events.

To start with, the basket advertisement tells you that you get: 2 gourmet sandwiches, 2 sides, tea or lemonade, 1 cupid\"s cupcake to share and a souvenir.   When we called to make our reservation, as suggested, the woman was very short and rude with us.  She wanted to know what sandwiches we wanted, when I told her I would have to look at the menu, which I had pulled up because we just looked at it, she told me to call her back when we knew what we wanted.  Hmmm... knew what we wanted, just had to look at the name again.  Ok, so we call back, get the same \"happy\" lady, she takes our sandwich and drink order, but then tells us that one of the \"sides\" that we selected was not offered, that there were only three sides to choose from.  It would have helped our experience greatly if the web had 1. Told you to select your sandwich prior to calling (and have the name ready so the \"happy\" lady didn't hang up on you), and 2. To list your sides that you could choose from.  \nWrote the ordering off as an employee having a bad day, and decided to make the best of it.  When we showed up at The Farm, had to choose from three lines, there were no signs to direct you, asked people in line and found out that we wanted line two.  When we received our basket and found a place that we wanted to sit, my husband showed me his pasta salad side, there were literally 4 noodles!  It wasn't even half full!  The sandwich was nothing to sing about, it was just a sandwich, DEFINITELY not a gourmet sandwich.  The cupcake was ok, moist but no flavor.  \nThen came our last slap in the face... your souvenir...a $5 coupon to go the their very over priced specialty shop.  Again... Really!?  I shop at specialty shops all the time, and this was a disgrace. The selection was terrible, and looked as if someone who didn't know what they were doing just set things out and WAY over priced them.  Love to support local artist and businesses, but these clearly were not local artist.\nThis entire process left my husband and myself feeling like we were cattle, moving through getting processed... hmmm... it is a farm, I guess.  We were thinking about trying the dinner one night, not now.  For what we paid, we could have gone to many different establishments, and received a better meal, and much better customer service.", "business_id": "MLcXtnpzygZvQ9BtseLLlw", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-02-14", "type": "review"}

Slightly on the dry side and I didn't like the crust, too hard.  The biggest drawback for me was that I was still hungry after eating my $11 sandwich!  I went home and ate another meal....\n\nMy friend got a TEENY tiny Greek salad - literally it could have fit in a 1 cup measuring cup (which they don't even serve with Greek dressing by the way... so the only thing that really makes it \"Greek\" is the olives and sprinkles of feta) and it cost like $6, meh.\n\nService: 2 stars\nEven though there was no line behind me, I felt like I was being rushed through.

This was the resort that was chosen after a night out. After years of never being taken out for my birthday, this was supposed to be that \"go to\"  food after being taken out for my birthday. 90% disappointment. There appeared to be only two servers working plus one cook. Not enough staffed for a Friday night/Saturday early morning, by far. It took precisely 23 minutes for my group to get served even just water. Granted there were three other big groups that were in the establishment other than hours the moment we walked on (three other groups totalling six or more walked in those twenty minutes we waited for our drinks), so that is the only reason I am providing some leniency. There were countless orders waiting to be served to customers constantly (minimum five plates waiting to be brought out at a time). Everyone's food, once brought out, was cold when delivered. Compared to the last time, the food actually had all of the advertised ingredients. Nonetheless, all cold. My BLT was cold as if it had just come from the refrigerator. The only thing warm on my plate were the three pieces of sausage (only three, really?). This is twice in a row I was severely disappointed with the staff working, and with the level of food quality. For a 25th birthday late night early morning meal, I'd much rather go to another establishment. At least the food is warm and friendly adequate service is provided. This place needs better staffing and management. It shouldn't be that hard to know that Friday nights should be fully staffed and prepared.", "business_id": "lq2iZK7epi23byzcejjqTg", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-01-10", "type": "review"}

Had a gift card so the family and I did dinner and a movie.  Upon entering the restaurant we were blinded by a lamp aimed directly at the door from the hostess station. Apparently the overhead lights in the lobby were out. As we were lead to our table, I noticed food and debris on the floor. We were seated next to the utensil folding station even though there were plenty of other tables available to accommodate the four of us. I had to wait for the hostess to move the broom and dust pan out of the way so I could take a seat. She dropped all four of our rolled up silver wear on the floor while trying to move the broom. She then put those on our table rather than reach over to the utensil folding table and get fresh ones. Our order took 45 minutes to finally reach our table. My vegetables were overlooked as was my steak. My daughter's steak was overlooked as well. My husband's burger was overlooked and dry. We ordered four desert shooters. My daughter's desert glass was broken almost in half. How could they NOT notice that. We will not be back there again.", "business_id": "pk0vem-ismpPnVeTIG0Q5g", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-12-19", "type": "review"}

I absolutely insisted that we not eat at Dave & Busters since their food is really bad sometimes.\n\nAnyways, we decided to order something to share since I cannot eat alot.  We got the cheeseburger pizza and it came out as described although I thought the amount of protein on the pizza was really skimpy.  It was really lacking in meat.  After taking off the heaps of lettuce that was on the pizza (the Chesseburger pizza is like a big-mac in pizza form) it was clear that there just was not a lot of meat on the pizza.\n\nOverall- good service.  My kid can sure drink the lemonades and the server was able to keep up with him.  Would we go back?  Eh...maybe.  Not real compelling due to the food.  Maybe we will try something different next time.", "business_id": "UpYva_zhJ6pRGfdTruIYIg", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-01-03", "type": "review"}

I have been here before and it has always been pretty good, I usually get a half caesar salad and a cup of tortilla soup but have also tried the spring rolls, the caeser sandwich, pastas, and some pizzas. It has all been pretty good. But anyway, back to yesterday... First off, when you come here you have to request bread and the bread they give you is just kind of plain mediocre bread, nothing exciting. Then it is time to order and I decided to try something different and ordered the chicken tequila fettuccini. My mom got the fusilli pasta with veggies (her usual) and the sis got a shrimp salad of sorts. Everything was good, but, in my opinion, it was overpriced. My dish had a lot of flavor and I enjoyed it, but it cost around 13$. I would have no problem with this price at an independent restaurant, but I think this is too much for a chain. Everyone else seemed to like their food too. Also, the service was decent, our waitress was timely and friendly. So this is a good chain to go to when you just saw a movie or are shopping at dessert ridge, but it is still a chain and isn't anything mind blowing.", "business_id": "UpYva_zhJ6pRGfdTruIYIg", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-02-28", "type": "review"}

The food is always exactly as you would expect and consistent.  The service was good.  Lots of seating.  However, first the hostess tried to seat us in this drafty room with little tables for four.  We didn't want to sit there.  It's 50 degrees outside!   I also noticed that they put all the other groups with children at tables in the corners.  This bad first impression was more than made up by our server.  She brought our food quickly when we told her that we missed lunch. We may go there again during this vacation...", "business_id": "UpYva_zhJ6pRGfdTruIYIg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-12-30", "type": "review"}
