This proved to have been a massive error in judgement on all our parts.\n\nThe first thing I ordered was a bowl of lemongrass soup.  The listing of ingredients made it seem like it should be tom yum soup, which is one of my favorite soups.  What I received was a bowl of dishwater-colored broth containing tomatoes, so that it tasted like watered-down minestrone, with some chicken submerged in shame at the bottom of the bowl.  A single lonely wilted leaf of cilantro wallowed on top.  No lemongrass was in evidence, but there were plenty of mushrooms.  I stopped eating this when I unearthed an unsightly artifact which turned out to be the bottom of a mushroom stem, with dirt still clinging to it.\n\nMy companions both got chicken and stir-fried vegetables in what turned out to be Singapore curry sauce.  This was passable, but not exciting -- again, although it claimed to be lemongrassy, there was no lemongrass flavor to be had, and the chicken was a bit rubbery and overdone.\n\nI got one of the fish entrees.  On the menu, the description made out like it was covered in a spicy sauce.  It turned out to be more like a not-at-all-spicy soup with bits of orange roughy floating in it.  Again, the broth was lacking in overall flavor, as if they were trying to save on costs by not adding enough spices.  The fish itself was at least not overcooked or dirty, but it was a poor aesthetic decision to bread and fry the piece of fish, then put the breaded coating into soup.  Gross.\n\nTo top it off, the service wasn't that great, and we were actually charged for the dirt-filled soup.

Thai Cuisine was my first experience with Thai.  A friend brought me there for lunch back in 2006 - and I have been a junkie ever since.  And, to be perfectly honest, I have only found one other place in the burgh that I think has comparable food in terms of taste - and the prices there are much higher.  We live about 45 minute drive from TC so for us to frequent there means that we really do enjoy the food!\n\nOver the years, DH and I have brought many friends to TC.  To be honest, it is not much to look at.  It really is lacking in atmosphere and, to be honest, I would love to see them clean up their restrooms a lot.  But the service is always good and the food - well, the food is so good, I can live with this little \"diner\".  Besides, we always end up down the street afterwards for a coffee and there are restrooms there :)\n\nWe have tried all of the appetizers - DH says it is hands down the best hot & sour he has ever had.  Steamed dumplings are the tastiest in town - good taste but nothing overwhelming (i have had them with so much garlic, I regret eating them). Spring rolls are always tasty & fresh.  BTW - if you go at lunch, they add a tiny salad with peanut dressing to your plate - try not to lick the plate when you are done :)\n\nI think we have tried every curry on the menu - red, green, pineapple, panang, musman, winter.  Winter is always our favorite - a green curry with the pumpkin is to die for.  DH will scrape the bowl on this one. \n\nI am a noodle junkie.  My favorite here of all the dishes is their Pad See Ew.  I always get it with shrimp which are nice-sized and plentiful.  It is the sauce that differentiates this from other Thai places.  TC uses a sweet black bean sauce that is amazing.  I have tried this dish and it is the sauce that makes this dish.  I have liked their Rad Na and enjoyed the fried rices but I always come back to the Pad See Ew because I know that I can't find comparable anywhere else.\n\nI will admit that we have never tried desserts there. To be honest, we find the portions plentiful and have never wanted dessert afterwards.\n\nIf you are looking for atmosphere, head to Squirrel Hill or the South Side or Wexford. If you are looking for tasty food at a reasonable price, this is your spot.

Their daily specials are a nice change from the standard Thai fare at so many restaurants.  They are great about tailoring spice levels.  \n\nI have a family member who is Thai and prefers the Thai restaurant down the street, however, I'm sticking with Thai Cuisine as my favorite.", "business_id": "sxeuOMBRllOHXJTaUlI9kQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-01-21", "type": "review"}

I didn't discover it until I had lived in Pittsburgh for almost a year, but since then, my friends and I have been going almost weekly--I think it's becoming an addiction.\n\nThey have a good number of tables and a couple of booths, so seating has never been an issue, even when we're with a larger group. The staff are friendly and incredibly attentive; I don't think I've ever had a glass of water that was less than three-quarters full. The food arrives at your table less than 10 minutes after the waiter takes your order. Their spice levels are pretty on point and range from 1-10, but you can always ask for the spice rack if you need an extra kick. I've tried almost all their noodle dishes and a handful of the curries and nothing has disappointed. They make one of the best Pad Thais I've ever eaten. They also have specials that are ever rotating, which makes it nice if you're looking to try something new. In general, everything is flavorful and you get what you order. Portions are sufficient for a solid meal and very reasonably priced.\n\nI might venture and say that this is one of the best Thai places in Pittsburgh, but I know that's highly debated here. I'll just say that it's one of the most reliable Thai places I've ever gone to and I'm happy to frequent it regularly.", "business_id": "sxeuOMBRllOHXJTaUlI9kQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-02-03", "type": "review"}

We were hungry and we wanted Thai. We walked up to Thai Gourmet, our usual go-to Thai spot, and were greeted by a \"closed\" sign on the door. They don't open until 5 on Sundays?!  But I want Thai food NOWWWWW (feeling very Veruca Salt that day). Dejected, I walked my rumbly tummy up Liberty Ave, and lo and behold, another Thai restaurant appears a few blocks up. Whine and ye shall receive.\n\nAfter perusing the menu, we decide to take out some chicken pad thai and another dish called \"three flavored chicken.\" Both solid choices. The pad thai portion was huge and chock full of the good stuff (they did not skimp on the meat or veggies in here!)  The sauce was flavorful and plentiful, yet light...not overly thick, oily, or sticky, as some pad thai sauces can be. The \"three flavored chicken\" was also tasty with its crispy, breaded chunks of white meat chicken. The sauce was interesting and unlike anything I've ever had before. Despite its name, I really only tasted two flavors that dominated the sauce -- vinegar (sour) and sugar (sweet). It could have used some spice to round it out, but even so, it was still delicious. I do wish it had some broccoli or other vegetable in it so I at least felt a little less guilty about eating copious amounts of fried chicken chunks :)  And overall, for our tastes, both dishes definitely could have kicked up the spice intensity. We had ordered both at a level 8, and as I said, I couldn't really detect any spice at all. So if that was an 8, next time I'll probably order a 33. :)\n\nOverall, this is very yummy Thai food. I'm not sure that it will replace my usual go-to Thai spot, but it'll definitely be high on my list!", "business_id": "sxeuOMBRllOHXJTaUlI9kQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-12-28", "type": "review"}

Actually, to be more specific, how I do love pad thai. \n\nI hadn't been to Wild Thaiger in a while because I hate navigating around Central Avenue these days, but it was my co-worker's birthday and she wanted Wild Thaiger. I'm so so glad we went there, and I was double happy this afternoon when I ate my leftovers for lunch. The best thing about the pad thai at Wild Thaiger (besides that it is so good) is that there is so much I always have lunch the next day ( which is just lovely). \n\nA note for those south of McDowell trying to get to Wild Thaiger: Drive up 3rd Street and turn left on Roanoke. You'll dead end into a strip mall parking lot. Park there and walk a few steps south to Wild Thaiger. Viola! \n\nI give this place 4 stars instead of 5 because I ordered a Coke and it tasted funny ... like way too soda-watery. When I told the waitress, she sort of shrugged and said, \"A lot of people say that.\" Yeah ....

My first culinary experience at Thaiger was several months ago with co-workers.

The restaurant atmosphere is very friendly and unpretentious.  \n\nThe food is where the adventure begins. For a flaming start, Tom Yum Goong is a must of any visit to Wild Thaiger.  The soup is a concert of spicy hot lemony flavors that leave you wanting more.  Don't fret, you can always order more to go.\nDragon's Eggs are paramount on our list of favorite's starters These Dumplings are stuffed with pork and crab, wrapped in tender wrapping, nestled in fresh vegetables and comes with a seasoned dipping sauce. \n\nThe Lunch and dinner menu is delectable and you will want to try a new dish on each visit.\n\nOrder hint: Each plate is made to your specification.  If you want \"more curry\", \"spicier\" or \"hotter\" you only need to ask. \n\nDesert Hint: The Coconut Ice Cream is made onsite: It is delicious and contagious.\n\nDrink hints: A nice compliment to the food is a glass of Chardonnay or you can try the sweet Thai Iced Tea. \n\nIt is very common for the Olashawn (owner and head chief) to leave the open kitchen to seat, greet, and serve her guests.  She is the heart of The Wild Thaiger.  As Marcial and I leave and thank her for another wonderful meal, her gracious smile, hands clasps and graceful bow, keeps us coming back.\n\nNote:  METRO Lightrail construction has impacted this restaurant and you need to follow construction signs carefully to navigate the street and driveway to Wild Thaiger.

And sure enough, we arrive and wait in the tiny entry way for at least 10 min before being approached by anyone. In that time, a friend who had arrived early and staked out at the bar informed me that as soon as she sat down, she was told that she couldn't order food because the kitchen was temporarily shut down because they were too busy. At the time we arrived it was maybe 30 percent full, and she assured me that that had happened 30-40 minutes ago, so they should be back on track by now. \nThe host finally showed up and said she could seat us, but it would be a while before the server would take our order bc they were \"recovering.\" Well, that's better than 10 people blocking an entryway, so I'm not sure why she seemed hesitant to seat us, even if we had to wait for a server. She assured us that we could order drinks from our table until the kitchen was \"ready.\"\nIt was only downhill from there. Thankfully, we were a jovial bunch - under any other circumstances this experience would have been disastrous. 15 min to get drink orders, another 15 to get the drinks. Another 20 min later he took our food orders. 30 min later they started coming out, sort of. Seven entrees came out, staggered over a period of five minutes. But three entrees - all pad thai - didn't arrive until at least 10 min later, when everyone else was finished. I understand not everyone can get food at exactly the same time with a party of 10, but they didn't even come close, and at the time we made our food orders it was at least an hour if not more after their alleged huge rush that shut down the kitchen. \nI got the peanut chicken - grilled chicken with peanut sauce, rice and grilled veggies. The sauce was too citrus-y for a peanut sauce and too thick (funny that I complained in my first review that my curry was too thin). Chicken underneath was completely flavorless and was dry and veggies were scant. Good thing it was only $10. Didn't get details from anyone else except the BF, who got the Kao Pad Jay, and kept saying over \"I'm so glad I got this!\"\nAll these issues seemed to be circumstantial (except the chicken dish), but, then again, how long has WT been a restaurant?

We were seated right away, but waited 15 minutes for a waiter.  Appetizer arrived fairly promptly, but there was nearly a 30 minute wait after the appetizer was cleared for main courses to arrive.  \n\nWe had the Vegie Sampler as an appetizer and it was incredibly delicious - I'd go back just to order that dish!  Crispy/crunchy corn fritters, big chunks of seared tofu (which sounds sort of nasty to a meat-eater like me but was incredible!) with peanut sauce, and crispy fried vegie rolls.  This dish was the only real winner - and was way over the top with flavor!\n\nMy buddy had a tofu/vegie dish - I wish I knew what it was exactly - but on the menu it had a single pepper on it.  He ate half of it and was beading with sweat, so beware that even a \"medium heat\" dish can get pretty hot.  I asked for a vegie/chicken dish - something \"healthy\" and was told about a dish with a soy and garlic sauce.  The chicken and vegies were fairly good (a bit heavy on the cauliflower maybe) but the sauce just tasted \"off\" - not like soy/garlic at all and was odd enough that I didn't finish the dish either.  It wasn't flavorful - it didn't taste like I'd had it described - and it didn't compliment the rest of the dish.   Both of our issues with main courses are probably more personal preferences but there's also room for improvement maybe in how the dishes were described to us.\n\nI had a ginger martini and my buddy had a very tall mai tai ($6 - which was a good deal for the large glas!).\n\nSo...hit and miss...but I will try it again.", "business_id": "KPoTixdjoJxSqRSEApSAGg", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-02-02", "type": "review"}

I can't think of a better place to have my birthday dinner. This place is fantastic!  The food was great and served with true elegance but in a casual setting. Even though it was a weekend evening and the place was absolutely packed, the service was great.  We were told right from the start that there would be at least a 20 minute wait and they were dead on in their estimate.  No problem at all.  I don't mind waiting if I'm told the wait time and it is accurate. \n\nThe atmosphere is relaxing, intimate and the decor is not over done as are so many Thai restaurants.  Can you say clean?  Even on such a busy night they kept the place almost spotless, even the bathrooms.  The kitchen is open to the dinning area and you can see how well managed and organized every thing is.  The kitchen staff looked like a well oiled machine in action.\n\nThe Food and Drinks:\nWell to start off, we didn't order any adult beverages this evening as we were going out to a local night club after dinner for our fill of libations. Instead I ordered the Iced green tea which was brewed to perfection!  I don't remember what everyone else had but I know one member of our party got the Thai Iced tea and said it was fantastic.\n\nAppetizers:\nWe ordered a bunch of appetizers for the table.\n\nDragon Eggs - These pork and crab stuffed dumplings were tender, tasty and served with a mild-tangy dipping sauce.\n\nSatay Sampler - Shrimp, beef and chicken skewers marinated in a tasty coconut curry and served with peanut sauce and cucumber chutney. Loved it!\n\nWild wrap - Spicy chopped chicken with a mint-lime sauce served with cabbage leaves. This tasted so fresh. Yes, spicy but very refreshing at the same time.\n\nVeggie Spring Rolls - Tender and crispy rolls stuffed with fresh veggies, cellophane noodles and served with a great plum sauce. They really were tender yet crisp, hot, tasty and the veggies tasted so fresh you would think they had a garden out back. I looked for it but found nothing but parking lot.\n\nHot Pot:\nWe also shared a Tom Yum Goong hot pot. The soup was nice and spicy, the shrimp was tender, the mushrooms had a rich earthy flavor and the lemongrass infused a wonderful aromatic hue to the soup.\n\nMain Course:\nI had the Ginger Fish. This is a breaded piece of salmon topped with mushrooms, onions, carrots and pineapple with a ginger sauce along with fresh sauteed veggies and rice. The presentation was first-class and portion size was very generous . In fact, I ended up taking about half of it home.  Trust me, it was so delicious that I really wanted to finish the whole dish but after all the appetizers and soup I thought I might explode if I didn't stop eating!\n\nOnce again, I cant remember what everyone else had but there were no complaints at all.\n\nDesert:\nOMG the Lemon Ginger Cheesecake is to die for!  Enough said. Period!\n\nWill I go back?\nI wish I lived in their back room so I could eat every meal there.\n\nHats off to The Wild Thaiger.\nThe best Thai food I have found anywhere in Arizona.", "business_id": "KPoTixdjoJxSqRSEApSAGg", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-02-05", "type": "review"}

The restaurant was busy but there were 3 empty tables and one group of 3 before us that was waiting in the outside patio area. The hostess was nowhere to be seen. About 5 minutes later, she shows up and takes down our names and tells us it will be about 10 minutes for a table for two. We're fine with that so we agree to wait inside the restaurant as it was pretty cold outside. Ten minutes pass. The group of 3 before us is still waiting and the 3 empty tables are still empty. In the meantime, about 5 other groups of people have come in after us and put their names down for tables. The hostess disappears again at 6pm. I noticed this because I looked at my phone and the 10 minute wait was now 15 and the group before us still had not been seated. About 5 minutes later, the hostess comes back to seat the group of 3 and disappears again. Two couples come into the the restaurant and after waiting 5 minutes at the hostess station, one of the couples walks to the back, hoping to get someone's attention so they  can put their name down for a table. We watched them stand there for 5 minutes and then walk out of the restaurant. 6:15. No sign of the hostess. Other people have arrived and walked out as well. We see the hostess clear a table and then bring to go boxes to a table and walk right by us. She doesn't make eye contact, she doesn't apologize, she doesn't tell us it will be just a few minutes. In fact, she scurries away so quickly, she doesn't hear us when we say \"Excuse me, miss?\" to get her attention to find out how much longer it will be. Most of the people who were in the restaurant when we arrived are now finishing their meals. It's 6:25 and the hostess has been away from her station for 25 minutes.

I didn't even see any shrimps and when I did find them, there was only 2!!! $3 extra for two shrimps! the presentation of the dish and taste was not the same and portion was smaller. did they have new chef or new owner? will not come back to this place", "business_id": "KPoTixdjoJxSqRSEApSAGg", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-02-12", "type": "review"}

This is the first Thai place I found in the valley where I left consistently happy.  Not dazzled, but happy.  I never experienced the snags in service that other reviews have mentioned, and every dish I tried was at the very least fresh-tasting and pleasant.  I always run Green Curry and Pad Thai as my first visit inquisition, and Thai Lahna aced them both.  Their Pad Thai is still very much in contention for my favorite in Phoenix.  The Green Curry has a great flavor, but lacks the array of vegetables that set a few other places apart.  So far, after over a dozen visits,  I have been very pleased with every dish I have tried, specifically remembering the coconut milk soup, yellow curry and pineapple fried rice in addition to the previously mentioned staples.  In all honesty, I probably feel a little more 4-starry about Thai Lahna, but because it made me believe there could be good Thai food here, I add the fifth for now.  Plus I need it to be ahead of Thai Rama, which sucks.", "business_id": "wct7rZKyZqZftzmAU-vhWQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-01-30", "type": "review"}

It was a little after 7 and Thai Lahna was pleasantly empty. You know, there were a handful of diners enjoying their meals but the small storefront was still quiet and servers meandered around checking in on guests and greeting us when we stepped in. I thought the decor was impressive in that it was actually Thai, not just generic Asian like other Thai places I've been to. Steve agreed that it was \"Thai-ed together\" well.  sigh.\n\nThe menu reads like a novella, but of course I only have to flip to the Vegetarian page. There were two or three appealing Veg options but the rest seemed pretty bland; noodles with vegetables, broth with vegetables, white rice with vegetables. I went for #93 the steamed tofu with...white rice and vegetables, with a 'light soy' sauce. My dining companion ordered #41, a shrimp and veg entree.\n\nService was quick and both the servers seemed friendly enough, and pretty quick with the water refills and ice spill disasters. I thought my dinner was decent with a standard mix of veggies, but seasoning wise found it basically salty and surprisingly oily. I wasn't expecting a spice explosion but sodium alone doesn't do it for me. I would like to come back and to try a few apps or other vegetarian options, and at $7.95 a dinner its a decent wallet-friendly choice. \n\nOh and at the end of the meal when we were comment on the decor we were presented with two chinese fortune cookies which kind of broke the mood...especially since my fortune wanted to teach me how to say \"long time\" in chinese. yeeeah.", "business_id": "wct7rZKyZqZftzmAU-vhWQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-02-18", "type": "review"}

I think it was Thai bbq chicken with spicy sauce. I figured, I can't go wrong with that. Not traditional Thai but I couldn't make up my mind about the others. \n\nWell, they ran out. I wasn't sure if they ran out of Thai bbq or chicken. Apparently its bbq so I settled for the sesame chicken. Bad idea. When in Thai- I should probably order Thai... but... um.. how do you screw up sesame chicken? The Panda Express has mastered it!

I've had them lose my appetizer order more than a few times with hardly an \"oops\" to say for themselves. I just don't order one anymore. It's also about impossible to flag anyone down after waiting forever for a check or - gasp - drink orders.

I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai, no shrimp. It was just how I like my Pad Thai, a little spicy and a little crunchy from the peanuts! My boyfriend ordered the Coconut Chicken Curry which was way better than I was expecting! We both split our dishes so I got the best of both worlds. The sauce on the curry was creamy without being thick, if that makes sense, and it was awesome. \n\nPrices are decent but it took awhile to pay the bill, just like it took awhile to get served in the first place.

They are consistent in one area: letting us down every time.\n\nWe're \"glass half full\" people. We're optimists. In fact, I don't think I've ever given a place a 1-star review. But when it comes to Thai food in Arcadia, stick with Sa Bai around the corner. At Thai Lahna, they are consistently slow at delivering average Thai food (at best). And by \"slow,\" I mean GLACIAL. \n\nif you go, expect long wait times for basic curry and rice. If you order take out, expect even longer wait times. A recent example is when I called in for takeout -- one order, just vegetables in red curry with rice for my wife, who was working late and just getting home. She said they told her 15 minutes for a wait time, so I went over there in 20, knowing exactly what kind of service I was getting into. I took a magazine.\n\nI was the second guy waiting to pick up my single-dish takeout order. The first guy got his order (also a single meal with rice). So did SIX OTHER PEOPLE who came in to pick up takeout after I had arrived. All of them waited, and waited. No one was happy. An hour later, I got my saucy veggies and rice. When I notified them that this was a constant problem, and that we wouldn't be coming back, the staff (who are not Thai and do not speak English) simply nodded and said something about being busy. Keep in mind that when I arrived, there was one guy waiting for takeout, and about 3 out of 12 tables occupied by couples. There was no apology.\n\nSteer clear of here and pay the extra money for Sa Bai. You won't be disappointed. They're nice, legitimately Thai folk running a great restaurant with a takeout window. It's slightly more (about $12-15 for an entree), but you won't be disappointed the way we are every time we go to Thai Lahna. Or, if you fall into the Thai Lahna Trap, walk over to Autumn Court across the parking lot for some great Chinese food that is fast, hot, cheap and plentiful from a very friendly, enthusiastic and outgoing Chinese owner. \n\nI think Thai Lahna would die a quick death if there was ANY other place to get decent, legit Thai food for cheap in the Arcadia/Biltmore area. There just isn't. As a result, we're stuck with this place.", "business_id": "wct7rZKyZqZftzmAU-vhWQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-01-25", "type": "review"}

I called them on the phone to let them know there was no chicken in my rice, expecting maybe a $5 credit towards our next visit, but was instead screamed at by the male cook/owner.

Yes, the service was fast and friendly but at a price I'm no longer willing to pay.\n   Visit 1:   I picked the budget friendly option of a lunch special to go of beef w/ red curry. At home, sipping a bit of the curry, I was treated to a complimentary burst of flavors that were very palate friendly. I thought I'd gotten lucky (only food-wise, can we talk?) and would be able to chalk up a new go-to Thai place, but as I spooned the dish over the rice and forked my way through the meal I became increasingly aware of a mounting saltiness that became relentless in the end. I know that people share a varied tolerance for salt; some just a little and some can't get enough. I can happily crunch through a half bag of salt and vinegar chips so I'm not exactly a salt sissy. But obviously too much of it in an otherwise tasty concoction just makes it a mess not worth serving. That's my vote on this one.\n   Plus, the egg roll was ridiculous. I didn't expect it crisp after the ride home but neither did I imagine the indestructable toughness I bit into. After a major effort to get the first bite down I realized that the dough wrap was at least twice the thickness of any roll I've EVER had and that I found so little filling of any kind that I had to check it out. Surgery STAT revealed contents of precisely two (2) bean sprouts and one (1) slender shred of cabbage. Period. That's it. In the trash. That was my budget lunch. Disappointing, but not bad enough to write them off just yet.\n   Visit 2:   Thought I'd take a chance and order what I really wanted instead of another 'test' meal.\n   In trying to recreate a truly great experience in the past from a place no longer around, I ordered Pineapple Curry With  Roasted Duck And Tomato from their list of 'Specialties' Sound good? Well, the curry WAS good; not too salty this time.\n   But back home, I soon realized that my parachute had failed to open: picture no more than a dozen slivers of duck, each the size of two toothpics side by side and 3/4 as long. Maybe a quarter OUNCE of meat? Maybe not even..\n   Envision similar sized bits of slimy skin floating around independently, indicating a minimum of four days in the pot, as did the rest of the ingredients.\nNon-ripe tomatoes. In July. In Arizona.\n   Add to this the fact that the kitchen (conspicuously) added what amounted to literally FIVE times the canned pineapple (why ever bother with fresh when you're just using it as a filler anyway?) that a dish this size can realistically support.\n   So that was my 4 minute, 'from order to door', 'Specialty' from Krua for 'only' $15.25 inc. tax.\nI'm absolutely certain they wouldn't have dared serving this 'bottom of the pot' debacle to a sit-down customer without  expecting to see it turned into 'instant wall art' but gambled that a  $15 take away probably wouldn't come back to call them out on this.\n   I'm doing that here.

You have to trust that I read every Thai and Vietnamese with baited breath. \n\nI know there are a few of you (e.g., Pierre) that love Malee's on Main and I have enjoyed my dining experiences there, but I've never loved it. Not the five stars that I've repeatedly seen. I can't wait to try Thai Lana and I enjoy Thai Pan in North Scottsdale. \n\nToday is historically the day of the week when I am cooking and experimenting in my own kitchen, but with a looming exam tomorrow night, I really didn't want to deal with the kitchen (prep or clean up) and luckily I received an invitation to go study with fellow classmates up at Desert Ridge. I agreed knowing that I was going to somehow convince everyone to join me at Malee's Thai at Desert Ridge.\n\nWe walk in and the restaurant is a mess - but there are large groups and kids running everywhere. It takes a few tries for the host to find a clean table for us. We finally take a seat and we decide on one sushi roll (this location serves sushi) - the Hamachi Popper Roll (yellowtail, jalapeno, cream cheese topped with eel sauce; Tom Yum Soup and Bam Gai (?) - I know I am crushing my spelling efforts. Please forgive me.\n\nThe food, quality thereof and flavor was fabulous. I do have a couple of presentation comments though. The soup was brought out in a flaming pot thingy (nice technical term) and we ooohed-and-ahhhed as the the server strategically placed it on the table. The challenge is with service from this pot-thingy. Its too narrow for a ladle and the large spoon that they do their very best to ladle your soup into the soup cup is tragically inefficient. \n\nThe Bam Gai, was delicious. But it had three different cuts of chicken and the wide rice noodles were also inconsistently prepared and there was no color on the plate. It was tasty but really ugly. Does that matter? My position: yes.\n\nWe were both drinking Jasmine hot tea, and I expected a different type of tea service, for no other reason than I just simply did. And, this type of point is where there has to be delineation between is the disconnect between the restaurant operator or the Guest perception. Tea service - my issue. Not theirs. But still, if you like great tea with your meal, its not here.\n\nFinally, and this was uncomfortable...at 10 minutes 'til 9. We had two bussers hovering on top of our table and waiting for us to leave so they could finish their side work and close that section of the dining room. It wasn't even 9 p.m.! I understand the term \"campers\" - those Guests that won't leave - but we had only been seated for an hour and ten minutes and unfortunately we noticed the hovering during an important flow of conversation. We both suddenly became nervous and uncomfortable and up and left. Neither of us finished the point that we were intently discussing. \n\nIt was just a weird closing to a very tasty meal. I really wanted to love this place. And I did love the Tom Yum. I might go back - but I think I'll stay closer to home and revisit the Main location; and I'll definitely try Thai Lana and head back to Thai Pan!", "business_id": "wzKMb1WAJbBVO819P4nDUg", "stars": 3, "date": "2007-12-16", "type": "review"}

The pad thai was very sweet, such that someone I brought there for lunch was almost unable to finish it.  The yellow curry (one of my favorites) was also cooked such that the curry itself was discolored, with brown flecks-- I was told by another Thai cook that this is from over-cooking some part of the mix, but I'm afraid I can't help past there (though it did not taste burned and it didn't actually taste bad, it just tasted \"off\").\n\nSecond, this is the second location as far as I know and it definitely lacked some atmosphere.  It felt more like a generic restaurant with some Thai decor thrown in for good measure.  The first location is a little bit more quaint, and the people working there seemed slightly more relaxed-- since that first location is not in the same sort of business-centric area, it's entirely possible that the faster pace of this second location is just part of doing business.\n\nAnyway, for a quick Thai lunch in the Chandler area it's not a bad choice at all.

My mouth is watering just thinking about it.\n\nMaybe I'll drag the boy and venture the nearly 30 miles this evening...\n\n****UPDATE: So rather than venturing for dinner last night, my cousin and I did the lunch bit this afternoon. I was extremely excited about it and couldn't wait to get my hands on some soup and that red curry. So the two of us are seated, we order our food, enjoy our soup, and receive our entrees. This is where it begins.\n\nMy cousin ordered the garlic tofu. Having much experience with Thai food, she could instantly tell the tofu was completely over cooked. No biggie, we thought, just explain you didn't like it and would like something else instead. So we catch one of the bussers and ask if we may have something else. She takes the dish and is gone for a couple minutes. Our server then brings the dish back, drops it on the table, and demands to know why she didn't like it. She explains the tofu is overdone and she would just like to try something else. The server stands there saying nothing, she looks at her for some kind of explanation. Not knowing what to say (we've never had this happen before), I speak up and say, \"She would like something else, can you please just exchange it?\". The server rolls her eyes, picks up the dish and walks to the back to ask \"the owner\" if that will be okay. \n\nMeanwhile, my cousin and I sit there, completely shocked by her reaction. So after a few minutes the server comes back, sets the plate of cold tofu down once AGAIN in front of her, shoves a menu in her hands and says, \"What do you want now?\". Feeling accosted and uncomfortable, she flips through the menu with the server standing over her. She says she would not like anything else and asks that she send it back and just take it off of our bill. \n\nI swear to god at this point I thought the servers eyes were going to melt our faces off, she was so livid. She rolls her eyes, throws her hand onto her hip and goes off on some tangent about how Thai food \"is different than other food\" and is \"more expensive\", and that they don't take items off the bill no matter what the complaint. Unfortunately, at this point she was causing such a scene that our neighboring tables were turning their heads and staring. I looked at her and said, \"we have never had this problem in any restaurant before, we are not eating this and we are not paying for it\". She replies with, \"Oh, so you return food all the time at restaurants then??\" and laughs. She walks away, comes back almost immediately with our check, opens it, throws it down on the table (literally, she threw it) and says \"HERE! We took the dish off!\". She turns around and starts talking shit about us five feet away with another server. \n\nAt this point we were completely livid and feeling rather harassed, so we left a $20 (no tip, I might add) and our food, got up and left. \n\nThe whole experience mad me so sad, I was really looking forward to it and loved their food.

I order it 10 stars, or double Thai hot. Yeah, I'm weird, I know.

Nothing to yelp about, but he liked it. The pad thai was a bit too sweet for my liking and a bit mushy. The plate was huge, and so I figured they made up for my dish with my friend's.

Swadee was sort of my introductory restaurant into the world of Thai food. I've gone with many friends and family her over the years and they all have been satisfied.\n\nSo it pains me to write a bad review, but the last couple experiences I've had at Swadee have required me to bid Swadee adieu.\n\nThe first bad experience I ordered the Larb Tofu. The dish was so salty I couldn't finish it. It literally tasted like the cap fell off the soy sauce bottle and they dumped  several cups of the stuff in the pan/wok. Even if they didn't, it was pretty much inedible. Inedible in the same way a salad swimming in vinaigrette is.\n\nThe second occurred during a visit with my girlfriend. We are both vegetarians and took great care to make sure that the dishes we ordered were meat (and fish sauce, and chicken broth) free. Those ingredients can upset a vegetarian's stomach if it's been a while since they ate meat (or if they've never eaten it). \n\nWell, my girlfriend ordered the pad thai (carefully made veg) and she found a piece of chicken in her dish. To most this would not be a big deal, but to us chicken isn't considered food and it taints the food it was cooked with. As a result she lost her appetite and it made me feel uneasy about what might be in my own meal. Our lovely Valentine's Day dinner came to a screeching halt.\n\nAnd as a side note they have a dish with oyster sauce listed on their vegetarian menu. Since when is an oyster a vegetable? The only vegetarian oyster is an oyster mushroom!\n\nI understand that there is always a risk for cross contamination and I expect it when I dine out. But this occurance is far more than just cross contamination. I mean, this thing was a pretty decent sized chunk of bird. It makes me feel uneasy about the level of cross contamination that takes place in Swadee's kitchen. \n\nThe staff was kind enough to comp the tainted Pad Thai (which accounts for the ** instead of *) but I don't believe you'll see me walking into Swadee any time in the foreseeable future.", "business_id": "vtQOervVVTXjhvSZQiZ6PA", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-02-15", "type": "review"}

The veggie rolls were tasty and larger than we're used to, which was a nice surprise. The Tom Ka soup was a little more sour than we're used to, but overall still tasty. However, it was almost $11 which we felt was about double what it should have cost. The Pad See-ew was the most disappointing part of the meal. The flavor was fine, nothing special but not bad.

I had the honor of eating, Thai style, with some of the kindest smiling faces on Earth every day for 2 months.\n\nI also toured the city with my  welcoming and accommodating friends  such places as the STRICTLY Thai neighborhoods, \"Farang\" party corridor, humble villages, and the Westernized utopia. I ate at a Thai BBQ w/ hotpot which was one of the most memorable eats of my life. I ate that whole city!\n\nAnd I have to say,  the way that Siam Orchid reminds me of Thailand most is the FACT that there is no true  \"THAI FLAVOR\". In Thailand there are a myriad of tastes and flavors depending on where you go and who they market to. Perhaps most importantly, in Thailand you had Thai Chefs wanting to feature new and bold recipes to make themselves stand out from their competitors. Thai food was the fact that you ate it in Thailand with Thai ingredients.\n\nWhat you get in the states is AMERICAN Thai food. You couldn't even get a major ingredient Kaffir limes here until recently. Really, who would want to eat frog and pumpkin soup or raw beef with spices anyway (other than me because they're both delicious!).\n\nThe owners of Siam Orchid are proof of the culinary creativity of the Thais. Their food is clean tasting with refined recipes featuring the flavors of traditional Thai spices such as ginger, tumeric, lemongrass,chili, and basil. They utilize their traditionally Thai ingredients to create you a Thai dish from Thais and they do a wonderful job of it!!! \n\nSo 5 years from my last meal in Thailand, I can still experience a little of that place I miss so much, and it's in the smiles of Pimporn, her husband, and their delicious family recipes.\n\n\nOur favorite dishes, try the: (7) Tord Mun Plah (appetizer fish cake) Panang w/ beef (spicy curry), Pad See Ewe w/Chicken (gravy noodle dish), Pahd Ga-Prao (chicken & basil- a Thai favorite), Thai omelet & Thai fried fish (can't get any more traditional than these two) and can't skip dessert- mango & sticky rice with homemade coconut ice cream on top!", "business_id": "kaeF6dd_f_Hd7raszKWAWg", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-12-26", "type": "review"}

The walls are plastered in crayon pictures addressed to the lady owner, and the dining area is lightly decorated and filled with soft and appropriate music. I love it for its quaintness and neatness, I love it for its owners, several dishes are excellent, but the portion sizes tend to run small for the price and often times the dishes are bland.\n\nI think every time we have come here it has been very, very dead. There is usually one, maybe two other parties dining in, and sometimes a customers or two comes in to pick up a take-out order. That probably explains the portion sizes. However, if you come here for a quiet atmosphere and pretty authentic Thai food, then it's just the place.\n\nThe mini Thai egg rolls are probably one of the better appetizers, as are the soups; very flavorful and full of herbs. The curries here are amazing and definitely my favorite (mussaman is the way to go). Some of the noodle dishes do stand out as well. You need to specify if you want something more spicy or more mild as they do not ask. Main dishes are very light, meaning they are not drenched in sauce which is refreshing compared to some heavier Thai cuisines in the area. I would however recommend asking for extra sauce or a little extra spice to bring the plate to life.\n\nThey try to keep the ingredient combinations as authentic as possible, so if you ask for any substitutions they are happy to oblige but you may receive a weird look in return. No salt, pepper, or soy sauce at the table, but if you ask they will bring out whatever you need. The husband is not as talkative as the wife, but they are both very kind, very hard workers, and are constantly running back and forth to the kitchen.\n\nI come here for the quiet dining experience rather than exceptional Thai food. It is close and convenient, but if you want more variety or are wanting to experience Thai food for the first time, I'd recommend sampling some other places first as you may not be blown away here.", "business_id": "kaeF6dd_f_Hd7raszKWAWg", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-12-21", "type": "review"}

Green bell pepper (part of the nightshade family of plants and contains solanine, a glycoalkaloid that can trigger pain) is an inflammatory food, and since I'm allergic to many foods, I try to stay away from as many pro-inflammatory foods as I can.  Perhaps my slight aversion to green bell pepper (though I do like the flavor this item delivers in many recipes) mars my enjoyment of this dish since it plays such a major role here.  My only complaint with SC for now is that the entrees are a little too salty.  Otherwise, I'm a fan!  \n\nBTW, deep-frying greatly decreases the glycoalkaloid content of nightshade plant foods... french fries and fried green tomatoes, anyone?
