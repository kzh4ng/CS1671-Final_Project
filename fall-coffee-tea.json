It took me far too long to come around and love Tazza D'oro. A horrible ex of mine loved this place and I admit that this soured me. I regret the time I wasted not going here. The dark wood inside comforts me. The small tables outside are a great place to spend the summer. \n\nTazza D'Oro brews Batdorf and Bronson beans (amazing), provides Enrico pastries (amazing) free wireless (amazing) and one of the most talented and friendly staffs I've ever met (amazing). Everyone who works there is *so* nice and *so* good at what they do. \n\nThey have a small menu of local/fresh food that looks amazing, but I have never actually eaten it. The espresso served here is actually better than the average shot served at Batdorf and Bronson locations in Olympia, WA. I talked about this with one of the barristas at TD'o and they were offended - \"we calibrate our machines the same, we use the same beans, the exact same blends and milks and everything, it can't be different.\" Sorry, Tazza D'oro, you are better. \n\nThe lines get long on weekend mornings, but they move quickly. There's a sense of community nestled here, just off the \"main drag\" of Highland Park, between Bryant st. and the reservoir.

Tucked away in the middle of a charming old residential neighbourhood, you'll likely miss it the first drive by. Turning around is worth it.\n\nYes the staff tends to be the typical hipster, bike-riding sort that so commonly seems to staff indie coffee shops, but they're friendly and unpretentious, so don't hold it against them.  The patrons are almost exclusively college students (anyone else tends to drive by and take their coffee to go), though hipsters are actually in the minority here.  Anyone under the age of 25 will fit in perfectly, and no one 35 and under will feel uncomfortable.  \n\nThe noise level is perfect.  Most students are on their laptops with headphones, a few are chatting quietly, and the background (indie) music is just that.  You don't need headphones to concentrate here.\n\nDecor is decent without being great.  The ceiling is crossed by beautiful wooden beams, and the floor is a pleasantly bland creamy ceramic tile.  So is the wallpaper, though the original modern paintings tend to help make things interesting.  Where it loses points is in the furnishings: the mixture of wall lamps, hanging fixtures, and pot lights doesn't work well, the serving bar itself is an ugly cheap laminate, and the touches of plastic greenery dribbled around the place fails misserably.\n\nIced water is provided, which is decent (plastic cups are a minus), but inferior to the mineral water other places serve. We tried their richly brewed Ethiopian to rave reviews, with the party split on whether the thick ceramic mug was a plus (hefty and warming) or minus (hard to drink from). Truly fantastic coffee, but the lattes were rather disappointing: Beautifully steamed milk in every cup, but a rather bland espresso shot left the latte rather lacking in the nuanced flavour one finds in a 5 star establishment.  The medium latte (12oz, with 2 shots of espresso -- the steongest ratio they offer) should have been far better.\n\nThe food looked worth having, but we'd just eaten. Homemade pastries and fresh sandwiches looked tempting, and we certainly will come hungrier next time.\n\nA solid four stars, held back a bit by decor and a lot by espresso.", "business_id": "83_p9vIqOq1TUIf3_GD7bA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-09-05", "type": "review"}

The kitchen is unfortunately very inconsistent, and an attentive & caring cook is a very different experience here than the apathetic, distracted or exhausted cook. \n\nThis used to be The Place to Brunch, and I'm sure it's still busy on the weekend mornings, but I had to quit when all these SUV families started monopolizing my fave tables -- apparently the QS made it into some kind of \"VISIT PENNSYLVANIA\" travel guide as a great brunch spot. I hate to be that \"I liked their old stuff better\" kind of a person, but, well... \n\nDon't be caught unawares- in my cashless world, dinner at the QS means making a special ATM run. \n\nThe QS is super kid-friendly. Books, magazines, and children's toys accompany the wireless internet (which sometimes works, and sometimes doesnt, and no, the staff can't help you). The menu is kid-friendly, the staff is used to dealing with kids, and if you really hate children, you might not want to go there since their peals of laughter and joy might melt your wicked black heart. I wouldn't hesitate to take the 2 year olds or 12 year olds I know. \n\nThe drip coffee is good and bottomless- soy creamer is available. The espresso drinks are really really hit or miss. You may have the tastiest drink you could imagine, or you might be left choking down a $5 drink made by someone who has never drank a cup of coffee. No liquor license but you can BYOB for a nominal charge. \n\nThe service is sometimes swift, but more often lacking. I would never take a date here again --- getting the totally wrong order & waiting half an hour for it to be even acknowledged by the staff is an embarrassment when you tell your date the restaurant is one of your faves. Fortunately, if you are dating me, you probably aren't there for the dinner. \n\nIf you have plenty of time to kill & self-esteem strong enough to weather the whithering glances of the hipper set of pgh's east end, this could be your new fave spot too. I do wish the hours were a little different - I operate on the schedule of a late-nite diner, though.", "business_id": "PzG0XmAmtXFs6Fdnubf41g", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-09-09", "type": "review"}

Surrounded by a desolate urban landscape, I never would've expected this colorful, creative coffee shop to have such impressive food.\n\nMy dinner here consisted of an apple panini and a \"shampoo\", a strange (but delicious!) cherry and almond cream soda. It very well might have taken me 20 minutes or more simply to decide on my beverage of choice - their list was not only long, but offered more innovative choices than I could have ever dreamt up. Among them, an impressive array of Italian sodas (lavender & lemon, mango & lime, white choc & mint, etc.), an enticing selection of lemonades (ginger lemonade, lavender lemonade), and some excellent-sounding tea combinations. To top it off, almost all flavors were available in the form of vegan milkshakes. How they concocted all of these culinary ideas is absolutely beyond me. (I apologize to the coffee drinkers. As a tea drinker myself, I hardly paid attention to that half of the menu.)\n\nThe apple panini I ordered came out quickly and was complemented with a side of tortilla chips and salsa. My panini included granny smith apples, apple butter, sharp cheddar, cream cheese, and seisage (vegetarian sausage) atop sun-dried tomato bread (though it seemed more like raisin to me). Never in a million years would I have come up with this strange combination of flavors, but it definitely worked. As described in the menu, indeed it was \"highly addictive\".\n\nTable service was great, nothing took too long and it seemed pleasant and casual. No overbearing waiters, no frills, etc.\n\nGiven the fact that I live about a mile away, I think they should be expecting yet another regular in the very near future.", "business_id": "PzG0XmAmtXFs6Fdnubf41g", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-10-29", "type": "review"}

My girlfriend is a veg-head aka vegetarian and had wanted to visit Quiet Storm for a while.  When we finally visited this week, I was pleasantly surprised.  There is definitely an old-time diner feel with a bit of arts and crafts mixed in.  If you're reading this, chances are that you have some notion of the crunchy/hipster/longhair reputation of this place and that perception is certainly accurate to a degree but I did not find the service pretentious or slow at all, as some have noted.  Our server was attentive, although there were only about seven folks in the place (it was off hours, about 4 PM on a Monday.)  I enjoyed the apple panini with seisage (a maiden voyage for me), apple butter, cream cheese and cheddar.  The apple butter, which seemed almost an add-on when I looked at the menu, was actually the star here and the sandwich comes on sundried tomato bread that really adds a lot of flavor to a very simple idea.  My only complaint is about the size of the sandwich.  It could have been larger.  My girlfriend ordered a burrito that was honestly huge and she found it tasty and worthy of a doggie bag.  I would definitely go back and would like to try their weekend brunch, which is supposedly quite good.\n\nAccording to the menu and reputation, Quiet Storm goes out of their way to use local products and makes quite a few of their products in-house.

They have good music, but unfortunately we were seated right below one of what looked like two speakers in the place.  Its a large restaurant so in order to make it the right volume for people far away from the speaker it has to be too loud for the people close to the speaker.

I'm looking at the menu and its a vegan/veggie place so we're never going to be good friends but I'd like to think that there's something that looks halfway decent but it all looks awful.

It comes with a salad that is not bad, but who wants a salad for breakfast.  As we're leaving the waiter, who's been fine the whole time, asks us where we're from and my girlfriend answers \"D.C.\"  The waiter replies, \"Oh, I'm sorry about that.\"  Now, neither of us is actually born in the D.C. area, nor do I even particularly like living there.

This place has been here for years, and as I sit drinking my bitter, bitter coffee, and smelling the overwhelming scent of (I believe) dog pee, I wonder how it's even possible.  \n\nThe three times I've been here, I'm greeted as if I'm a colonial space marine trying to fish a child out of a vent.  They always sit in the corner peeking over the top of the counter as if I am terrifying to them, then duck out of the way.  Then grudgingly come when I peek around the counter at them.  If I didn't, I'm convinced that they would just sit there, as if they're not certain of what position they hold in this place, or what the next step should even be.  This is what I like to call, \"The Dance of Shitty Customer Service.\"  \n\nToday (and I write this longingly looking over at Square Cafe) I decided to give it a chance because it never is crowded, and I figured the quiet would be a good thing.  The girl at the counter was on the phone, and that's the way it stayed for two minutes until I said 'excuse me?'.  The charming reply: \"Yeah?\" She grudgingly got off the phone, and after accomplishing the Herculean task of handing me a cup, I pumped this swill that I'm currently drinking.\n\nShe's currently muttering under her breath back in her corner.  I'm not sure if maybe she's having a bad day, or she's just an asshole, but...if I had to bet, I'm going with asshole.\n\nThis place has pretty expensive coffee for how awful it is, and the food...Just don't eat the food.  \n\n(side note: this place isn't quiet at all when somebody orders something.  She stomps around like she's being sent to her room.  Then continues muttering)\n\nOkay, so this place is a travesty.  Bad coffee, bad odor, bad lighting, unbelievably bad, grudging service.  I would beg the owners to put any effort into this place.

The kid at the counter was nice enough, so service was not an issue. The atmosphere inside pretty much sucks though...and you have to work pretty hard to make a cute little neighborhood coffee shop have zero atmosphere. \n\nThe first thing you see when you walk in a sign alerting you of the \"RULES\": to not use your cell phone at the counter, and that you must pay for something to sit inside, use the restrooms, or use the WiFi. Now, I understand the sentiment of these rules, they are common sense and fair. But it's a rather negative note to start off your experience being yelled at by a sign assuming you are there to steal their interwebz. It just doesn't feel warm or welcoming somehow. The front counter is poorly organized and rather unattractive. If it ever gets busy in there I'm willing to bet it gets rather chaotic.\n\nI ordered an iced vanilla latte, so I was quite surprised when the kid pulls out a pitcher from the fridge of what I can only guess was refrigerated espresso. That was rather disappointing; there's no reason an iced latte shouldn't be prepared with fresh espresso shots. Not surprisingly, it tasted bitter like...old espresso. Then I finished the drink to find the cup was 90% full of ice. I mean, come on. My lemon almond biscotti was delicious. The rest of the offerings in the pastry case appeared pretty underwhelming though; standard prepackaged muffins and cookies. With the number of excellent bakeries in this area, I don't see why they couldn't partner up with someone to provide some higher quality foods.\n\n\nI think this place could learn a lot from Square Cafe as far as decor and atmosphere go. It needs a little pep, a little warmth, SOMETHING. And they need to learn how to make iced lattes correctly. And they could also use an upgrade on their website...it's pretty amateurish and has a 1992 flair... Basically they just need to show a little effort.\n\nI love to support local businesses, but there should be more of a reason for me to return than the fact that it's the only coffee shop in town.", "business_id": "D9sHwmqlNkrVxmX-057i1g", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-11-19", "type": "review"}

I turn around and look to my friends confusedly, wondering where I had went wrong.  The barista notices this and gets my attention:\n\nBarista:  That's why I asked you whether you wanted OUR macchiato.\nMe:  Oh...ok...\n\nThe barista, clearly frustrated, takes my cup, pours it out and makes me a caramel latte.\n\nAlright all you avid coffee drinkers, laugh all you want that I had no idea that there is a difference between a Caff\u00e8 macchiato (espresso macchiato) and the American replicate (Latte Macchiato???).  I'm not even sure if what I just said is correct.\n\nFor the drink I got, I can't complain about the price (Did I over- or underpay the actual price of a caramel latte?), especially given the prices at Starbucks these days.  Also, given the fact that I made such a stupid mistake means that this place must be a good coffee shop.  Beyond that, unfortunately, I can't make any judgment -- hence my modest rating.

The counter, which used to be against the wall on the Negley side, is now across from the main door on Walnut. I think the new layout is a lot better and more intuitive.  While the space is bright, clean, and welcoming, it's quite small, only containing six tables plus a few lounge chairs inside.\n\nI ordered a small cinnamon-cardamom herbal tea, and it was served nice and hot.  I didn't add anything to my tea, but condiments and napkins can be found across from the barista's stand where you order.  I also wanted a snack, so I decided to get a potato chip cookie, since (1) it looked the most appealing and (2) it sounded interesting!  It was saltier and crispier than a regular cookie, but was still also sweet, and had a drizzle of chocolate icing on the top.  While I liked the sweet-salty combination, I would have preferred for it to have been a bit sweeter to offset the extra salt--if there had been more icing, it would have been perfect.  It was definitely different and interesting, and worth a try, though!\n\nBefore I ordered, I overheard the barista saying to other customers that she didn't know where the baked goods that they sell come from, which didn't sit well with me.  (If you read the other Yelp reviews, you'll see that they come from Prantl's.) Employees should be informed about the product they're selling.

Upon arriving I immediately didn't feel welcome. There were four baristas there and I had to wait over a minute before one of them even greeted me. After ordering I decided upon a mocha. It tasted like hot chocolate. Where was the coffee flavor? All the while I noticed the four baristas standing in a corner laughing with one another while giving off an \"exclusive high school club\" vibe. Geez!\n\nAND....when I left (mind you there was only one other customer in the lobby) I took up my dishware, as well as some others on a nearby table and the dude working just gave me a look and didn't even say thank you! Things like that really bother me. Let me tell you, as somebody who has worked in retail and food it can be a PAIN to be friendly towards customers, but it's just something that should be done in that business.\n\nBottom line: Not terrible, but very underwhelmed by the coffee and service.

I really liked the scones, but I didn't like the fact that they didn't open until 7 which usually made me a bit late.  I didn't even consider that they might have more than bakery goods, and every time I had stopped the place seemed empty.  This was of course due to the fact that it was 7:01 AM and I was the first person through the door.  So this weekend, based on Chris & Kelly's recommendations, I stopped in for a nice leisurely breakfast before heading into the office.  I found out that all this time I was seriously overlooking a great place right in my neighborhood.\n\nI was a bit taken aback by the number of people inside.  The place was pleasantly crowded, with the warm buzz of morning conversations and a relaxed atmosphere.  I walked up and ordered the breakfast special - I was used to just picking out scones so it took me a minute to get my bearings and find the menu board.  The price was OK, not under $6 but not more than I would have expected anywhere else.  I was given a number and found a nice table along the bookshelves.  I'd never really taken the time to look around the place before, and I was really impressed by the decor.  I got a cup of coffee from the self-service area, which is a great idea - I love diners where your cup is constantly refilled but I tend to keep drinking so long as there's coffee in the cup, leading to the over-caffienated jitters.  The coffee was excellent, truly delicious and fair trade to boot.  I savored it while I read a magazine and waited on my breakfast.\n\nAfter a bit of a wait the breakfast special came out.  The wait wasn't especially long considering the amount of people there, but I was into my second cup of coffee by the time my food came.  It was served on a fairly large plate, so my first impression was that there was not much to it, but this was a mistake.  The special, which was basically a Denver scrambler, was completely satisfying, filling but not heavy.  The wheat toast was much better than the average bread you get with breakfast, quite possibly highlight of the food.  I was pleasantly surprised by the whole breakfast experience here.  I wasn't planning on finding such a great place for breakfast in the Prairie Cafe.

I've gone there to get work done on 4 occasions in the last couple of weeks and have wound up just leaving after a little while because of the flies landing on me constantly.

The end product is packaged on site. \n\nThat said, I took all of that with a grain of salt until I tried one of the finished products: the Ethiopian Sidamo Fair Trade.\n\nWow.  Blew my socks off.  The Ethiopian Sidamo Fair Trade may very well be the best coffee I have ever had.  Unbelievably complex bouquet and flavor: I detected floral and cinnamon notes followed by a crisp, refreshing finish.  On that alone, I ended up buying another four different types from JBC (have yet to try, but cannot wait to do so).  \n\nAs a good blend will run you $18-$24 a pound in the Bay Area, I consider JBC's prices down right competitive.

And they wear gloves when they make your sandwhiches.  And cute garnishes.

I come here in the morning on the way into work because its close to my job and its good reliable coffee.\n\nI've been going to Starbucks for years, and I'm starting to become a regular here.  It's not my favorite one, for a variety of different reasons.  First, seating here is awkward.  Inside, they have one really long table, a couch, and like 2 small tables.  More of a group oriented seating arrangement then bunches of individual tables.  They do have ample outdoor seating, but I don't always feel like sitting outside.\n\nThe service here is fine, but nothing exceptional.  I'm not moved by it, especially since I'm here in a very regular basis.  The staff is nice, but not as nice as others I have been to.\n\nMy only formal complaint is that half the time I go in here, thier out of half and half.  At 7AM.  I get tired of having to walk the container back and forth to the counter at least 1 day a week, usually more.  I know the baristas are busy, but there's nothing worse then waiting in line twice.  Once for your coffee order and another time while the barista finishes waiting on 3 other customers before he can get to the empty creamer.\n\nI mean, I do have good days in here, but its always the same 2 or 3 issues that they fail on when I'm in here.  Generic service, running out of essential supplies, and limited seating indoors.

Then, I took my first sip. Yum. Of course, can you really mess up a double shot of espresso? God, I hope not. \n\nIn any case, this place is \"nifty.\" I use that word because it's situated next door to The Gelato Spot and is a bit crammed for space. A splattering of like 4 people at the tables near the door made this place look a bit too crowded to me. Then again, if I had been at one of those tables, I probably wouldn't have noticed, or even cared. \n\nThe girl behind the counter was very friendly. I appreciated that. It's not often I joke around with baristas. She managed to make me laugh, too. To me, that's sweeter than an extra pack of Splenda. \n\nHava Java is a great location. I wondered over here after stuffing my belly full of wonderful sushi at Zen 32. My cohorts were immediately pulled into The Gelato Spot while I ordered my beverage. 66% of 'em wound up with gelato. Having already ordered and flavored my double to taste, I went hunting for them. That's where I found 2 of them cozied up to gelato and another teasing herself with the idea. I sampled a couple, but was very content with my coffee. So, if you plan to drop by Hava Java, just make sure you walk right up to the counter and order, or you may be sucked next door where you'll succumb to your sweet tooth. \n\nThen again, if gelato isn't your thing, I did see ridiciously huge muffins and bagels on display at Hava Java.

The cheerful barista asked what she could get for me and when I said I wasn't sure, she not only told me to take my time, but pulled out laminated sheets listing their syrups and teas. That intuitive customer service set things off right from the get-go. I noticed they had one of my favorite (yet hard to come-by) flavors- praline, and ordered a decaf iced praline latte. The barista made the drink quickly, in spite of her accidental initial pull of regular espresso, which she noticed right away and fixed. She also asked my milk preference which I liked because let's face it girls, some days are skim days and others are 2% days and it helps to have someone remind me of that. :)\n\nThe latte was satisfying. It wasn't mind-blowing, but it was made well and wasn't overwhelmingly sweet like the lattes they usually serve at Starbucks (this coming from a sugar fanatic!). The pitcher of water and water cups they have out with the cream and sugar is a nice touch that I'd like to see in every coffee shop. \n\nThe decor is sort of rustic with burlap coffee sacks above the door and local art on the walls.

The first was the mess of a baked goods display. I'm sure it looked great at opening, but by the time I was there, it was disheveled, half empty and didn't look like it had been tidied up all day. Typically I ignore the food offerings at coffee-shops, but I skipped lunch today and could have been persuaded to drop a few dollars if I'd seen anything remotely interesting. The other thing is that they have a drink refrigerator containing water bottles, juices and other bottled drinks for sale. It's so loud!! It cycles on and off, but when it's on, it can be pretty distracting. \n\nI will definitely come back to this place, especially as the weather improves and all the outdoor seating becomes a viable option. Now I just need to silence those evil thoughts that tell me it's acceptable to get a gelato within the same hour as getting a sugary latte...", "business_id": "2h9LsLPdJ7OvZrYJZhVdAw", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-09-09", "type": "review"}

I left the state for 6 years and was excited to try it again on my return. To my surprise it was better than ever! Best loose leaf tea selection in town and everything is brewed to order. The espresso is also first class! Pumpkin muffins and chocolate croissants are out of this world too. But the real kicker is the frozen java... I'm convinced there must be crack or something equally addictive in them as I have craved them daily for years and years. Finally the service... Lance and Megan in the mornings are amazing. They know names and drinks and this really helps to move the inevitably long line through quickly. And if you're in a hurry check out the scruffy happy guy at the cart. And Season in the afternoon must be my favorite barista in town! She too knows everyone's names and drinks and does a great job making you feel right at home.

The warm cozy feeling is impossible with the floor the ceiling glass windows out front.  Aside from a few pieces of art on the wall, the atmosphere (including the decor and lighting) seemed pretty pedestrian and forgettable.  It's on the opposite side of the spectrum compared to Three Roots, Lux or Copper Star in that respect.  If you don't luck out and snag the sofa or easy chair you could be subject to the most uncomfy cafe chairs ever.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I appreciate an independent coffeehouse like Mama Java's that supports the arts, local performers and functions as a community center.  But this seemed like this could have been \"Generic Coffee House, Anytown, USA.\"\n\nI'm not a coffee drinker, so I opted for iced tea -- wild strawberry black tea over ice, to be exact.  But that's not what the barista thought I ordered here.  She gave me hot tea, which was decently brewed and tasty, btw.  I went back up to ask for it over ice and proceeds to give me a small ramekin of ice, before she finally clued in and realized I wanted iced tea.  She was really cool about it and we shared a laugh.  No big deal, but worth mentioning.\n\nThe crowd of patrons was diverse this Friday night - streaming in steadily all night.  Some dude straight up ordered a bowl of cereal, sat down, slurped it up and left satisfied.  Hey, whatever floats your boat, right?", "business_id": "Mb46iSlA4qmTwXf-WrqtQA", "stars": 3, "date": "2007-11-18", "type": "review"}

Here is my problem.... \n\nProducts take on the name as the product, i.e Band-aid, Levis, Q-tip, Duck Tape, ect. I think it is VERY rude to correct a customer when you know what they mean. This happened to me - I should have stated Medium however I forgot and said Grande - OMG shoot me now, the look of disgust and the correction. I wanted to take my $4 back and go to Sbux, at least they don't correct you and the customer is always right \n\nThis become more evident when I was at Tuesday morning with a friend and I told her we should grab some coffee, but I actually had to tell her before we went in to not say Grande. She laughed her light hearted self and rolled with it. Really though, I have to tell a friend make sure you order correctly. \n\nAnyway, the last straw was yesterday when my boyfriend asked for cream in his ice coffee and they stared at him like it was crazy. I get wanting to be a liberal elitist, I think of my self as one sometimes. You just can't forget the customer is the business. If you know what they mean roll with it - DONT correct them.

The donuts are soft, the inside is moist and doughy, yet light at the same time.  The glaze on the outside is sweet, but not sickeningly so like at Krispy Kreme.\n\nand WAIT...

The interior is nothing to right home about .  It is nice enough for what it is and that is just a nice little cafe style restaurant catering to the surrounding businesses.\n\nNow let's start talking about what makes this restaurant great and that is the food.  It's simply a nice little restaurant that proves if you have good food it will be successful.  I am saying that on the basis that everything I saw served looked put together right.\n\nI had the Mediterranean Vegetarian Sandwich.  The bread was nice and fresh which was the start of a really tasty  meal. It didn't taste like the bread at some places that give you a variety of 8 different kinds but they all suffer from a bland sameness. There was plenty of hummus, feta, roasted peppers, all in about the proper combination so as not make any one overbearing.  There was also plenty of it, enough to fill you up but not enough to make you feel like Jabba the Hutt.\n\nI am looking forward to going back to the Blue Saguaro and trying their breakfast sandwich.  I was ten minutes to late to get one but boy did the ones I saw look yummy!  This is a real compliment from me.  I am not a big breakfast eater and am likely to end up at MacDonald's just be cause their big breakfast is usually consistent.  I admit if I am going out for breakfast, usually the place I go is going to be fairly expensive.  Not at the Blue Saguaro.   The prices are quite reasonable. \n\nThis is one of those reviews that really has been writing.

I knew that my favorite coffee shop in Minnesota, Caribou Coffee, didn't exist in the desert southwest.  Tired, a bit intimidated, and craving coffee, I find my first local Starbucks about 2 miles from where I live.  I park my car and walk up to the store, and from the moment the coffee aroma hit me, I knew I had found a place I could get away, drink great coffee, and relax reading my book, just like I had done back home.  The baristas (at least 2 or 3 of them) are extraordinarily friendly.  I had an extended conversation with one about Near Eastern and Asian culture and languages, which blew my mind. That had never happened to me before, and it brought a profound joy to my heart.  I had spent nearly 30 years in MN and I had never encountered such friendly staff *anywhere*, not even in the coveted \"uptown\" area of Minneapolis (known for being down to earth, organic, open minded folks).  I felt immediately welcomed in a strange land, one in which I wasn't yet comfortable.  I don't have much money, but this Starbucks gets what little dollars I do have; it gives me an escape, a feeling that I am \"home\", and that sense of community I so dearly miss.  I've spend many hours in their cushy chairs, either applying for jobs on my laptop, or reading a book out of my favorite series.  I don't know what I would've done if I hadn't found this Starbucks in my first few days in Arizona.  I know, many of you would say, \"Gee, Starbucks?  Really?  Couldn't you have found a more local coffee shop?\"  No.  I couldn't have.  I'm broke, and I have no internet access where I live.  To stumble upon this shop was awesome; I was never a fan of Starbucks when I lived in MN, but now, I'm a huge fan.  At certain hours of the day, you can't find a place to sit, but that makes it all the more warm and friendly.  People here don't seem to mind if you sit directly next to them when it's busy (Minnesotans apparently really like their personal bubble).  I give it 2 thumbs up, but you'll have to see it for yourself.  I may be merely a lonely traveler looking for something familiar, but I was impressed with the service, the friendly faces, the product and the cleanliness of this coffee shop.", "business_id": "1FkRvL3fj2ERBoddXwanTQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-11-28", "type": "review"}

I tried many kinds of drinks, each were nothing special but certainly up to standard. I loved the lakeside vibe, and was glad to have a coffee shop nearby that wasnt a Starbucks. Each time I visited with one of my friends (all of whom were female) the staff treated us courteously and served us very quickly. \n\nSo I started to suggest this place whenever I had a meeting with a friend, including my male friends. This is when things changed dramatically. Each encounter I had with the staff from then on was beyond horrible. I had a staff member yell at me repeatedly for \"stealing\" the honey to use in my tea (apparently 2 minutes was too long for it to remain at my table before it was reported stolen). I had one give me a dirty look when I asked why they only allow debit cards on orders over 3.99 (which seems ridiculous to me considering how many customers use debit or credit now and how few stores even have a minimum charge). Then there was THE incident.\n\nOn this particular day it was early in the morning and I was without cash, and so I brought my own tea with me to Coffee Rush. The friend that I was with bought coffee and every other time I had been there I had bought something so i didnt think it was a big deal. Boy was I wrong. It wasnt long before the guy working stormed up to our table and sputtered out the phrase, \"Can you read!?\" Having no idea what he was talking about I just looked at him blankly as he pointed angrily at the microscopic lettering on the door that read: \"No outside food or drink\" . I apologized and offered to go outside and he snorted and stomped away. While I was still in shock, my friend was very upset by the rude way that the barista had treated me and as I walked outside he decided to inform him that if he wanted to keep customers he probably shouldnt yell at them and be so rude and that I was a regular customer and didnt had brought my tea from home and meant no harm.\n\nAfter this my friend and I continued to chat oustide. About 10 minutes later, the guy COMES BACK OUT and starts berrating us, asking us sarcastically how what he said could have possibly have been construed as rude. My friend told him that he thought that this whole thing was over, and he is sorry if we offended him, but we felt that his approach of informing us of \"company policy\" could have been seems as a bit rude. He paid no heed, instead continued to repeat the same phrases over and over again until finally asked him to please go inside because NOW he was DEFINTELY being rude. To which he responded, \"Well NOW...I am TRYING to be rude.\" and then stormed back into the store.\n\nNeedless to say I am never coming back here again, and I would advise you to tread very lightly even if you are regular customer here, as you never know when you might severely offend the server and then  never want to come back again.", "business_id": "l1MZjZK2tLxfFRB62lQmsg", "stars": 1, "date": "2009-09-22", "type": "review"}

I know how customer service can be kind of annoying when you have to deal with annoying rude customers i have worked with people like that for over 8 years so honestly i know. I HATE IT. I always try to treat people the way i would want to be treated and i would never put any pressure on someone preparing my food or drinks! rudeness will never get you anywhere.\nNow my favorite mocha by far...im not sure they are all good but just so you know the tiramsu mocha might be my favorite once i get the non fat milk or soy. i was hoping someone would have been adventurous and told me how it tasted. all i have to say is that it is good. All the mochas seem overpoweringly sweet except the black and white is perfect right in the middle but too thick of milk where i feel like im gaining 10 lbs per drink. bleh. tomorrow i will try the cherry mocha with the pecan baklava. im crossing my fingers i will love it too... or i might just get the tiramasu again but with nonfat milk...hmmm the choices!\n:)", "business_id": "l1MZjZK2tLxfFRB62lQmsg", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-11-16", "type": "review"}

The barista, Stepheno, was wonderful. I let him know it was my first time in and he explained their menu and how to order and what not. It was SO nice not having to deal with that smug hipster attitude you find at a lot of the local coffee shops in the valley. He also asked my name and my sons name. He let me know he made my sons chocolate milk at \"kids temp\" which was wonderful. Also, he told me you can get 1 or 2 shots of espresso for the same price. Awesome!\n\nYou can buy beans to take home. And if you buy 1 lb you get a free frost drink. Nice!\n\nThe barista also seemed to know pretty much everyone who came to the counter and their order. I was definitely impressed by that. \n\nMy coffee was pretty good. I'm sort of a coffee snob so I could tell they don't roast the beans, but that's just me being nitpicky. The coffee is good, just not the best I've had locally.\n\nI love the location. Patio in the back with a nice view of the water.\n\nReasonable prices\n\nDiverse crowd - young, old, moms with their young kids, people working or studying...no one will feel out of place here.\n\nNegatives:\n\nNow for the great customer service I received today, they have some policies I find totally anti-customer and irritating.\n\n1) You have to spend at least $3.99 to use a debit/credit card. I never carry cash so this is absolutely irritating and inconvenient. I hate it when businesses cheap out and pass this cost unto the customer. Look I get the there are fees, but at least hide it and raise the prices a bit to make up the cost. \n\n2) the wifi policy is ridiculous\n\n3) the patio is overrun with smokers so my son and I could not enjoy sitting out there.\n\nSo...I don't know.

The first trip, my wife and I just went in for coffee - and unfortunately we had already eaten dinner and dessert.  I had a cappuccino which did not disappoint, and required no augmentation - and my wife got her usual decaf americano with splenda and milk.  The desserts we saw looked fantastic - and apparently we were there for one of Joe's friend's birthday and they had these fantastic looking cupcakes (how did I know?!)\n\nSecond trip was with my brother, mom, and step-dad for dinner.  I ordered the farmer sandwich (veggies + goat cheese) which was delicious, and a perfect size.  Not too large, not too small.  Bro ordered the sloppy joe extra spicy - it was good, but not knock your socks off.  Mom and step-dad ordered pizza (1/2 cheese, 1/2 pep), I tried a small piece, it had a great sauce, fresh cheese, and a crisp + chewy crust.  They also split a mixed greens salad which looked fantastic.\n\nWe ordered dessert which was a granola bar (awesome), brownie (great reports, but alas, no walnuts for this nut), and I got a slice of pumpkin-apple bread to go (eventually tried this at home and was yummy).\n\nThe decor is really nifty - there is an open kitchen that runs almost the entire indoor portion of the restaurant.  There is a wood-fired pizza oven and it looks like a prep-kitchen in the back.  The drinking glasses are actually glass, and all of the tables are nice dark wood with very comfortable chairs.\n\nI over-heard Joe talking to another table about not advertising just yet to make sure that all of the kinks are worked out.  He also mentioned later when I was ordering coffee that the cupcakes were a special event dessert and might not be a regular item.\n\nThe entire staff is incredibley friendly and made the experience that much better.  It's too bad that Gail W. had such a bad experience - and also too bad that there is no real detail in the review.\n\nGive it a try - you won't be disappointed.", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-11-17", "type": "review"}

My wife and I tried Liberty Market last December as a dinner and a show deal paired with the theatre next door.  The rain was pouring and as we dashed in the warmth of exposed rafters and good ambience reassured us we had made the right choice. That was where the fun ended.  For such a fancy looking place, the stand in line ordering was a little bit of a letdown.  We ordered a margherita pizza, unaware that the pizzas are barely a snack for a single person.  The pizza was good, though a little scorched, but the wood fired oven gave it a very nice artisinal touch.  We filled our drink cups at the oversized soda fountain and sat at a table that afforded a picture window view of Downtown Gilbert, and the feeling was cozy until the hardwood bench began to cramp my backside.  The food didn't take long to arrive, and the wait staff was friendly and helpful, if a little unnecessary. Apparently their only function is to serve the food and refill drinks, from the self serve fountain.  The real mystery came after our meal when we made our way past a very clean, completely empty kitchen.  It seemed extraneous, but must see more use during breakfast hours.  Then, arriving at the unisex washroom with highly decorated closet toilets providing little barrier between myself, my wife, and a fairly loud and smelly gentleman next to me, I was forced to flee screaming into the night.

They should read it, and then disavow it if need be.\n\nSo we've been to LM a bunch of times.  I famously said that I'd eat myself to death on their red velvet cake (more on that later) but had marginally less success with the rest of the menu.\n\nWell all that changed two visits ago.  My wife ordered the italia salad, which is sort of like an antipasto salad with garbanzo beans, kalamata olives (the lone blight on the salad, but I can appreciate that that's only my opinion), and italian meats with lettuce and tomatoes and all.  Totally delicious.  And I ordered the italian sausage pizza which is actually amazing.  Totally delicious.  It comes with ricotta cheese and onions, the ricotta being delightfully creamy and the pizza, on the whole, being perfect in every way.  Thinish crust (but not too thin) and just really flavorful.\n\nWe got all that last night, too, and it was amazing again, but the trip was marred by...\n\nthe worst customer ever to live.  If you see a mushroom-shaped woman probably in her mid 40s, wearing a visor on her mushroom shaped head, and a t-shirt with \"talk to the (paw print)\" emblazoned on the front, look out.  You'll recognize her by her disconsolate husband/significant other, who carries around with him the ethos of a beaten pet.\n\nWOMAN: I'll have the (five thousand different desserts to go) and the pecan bar.  But NOT the pecan bar that was cooked on the side of the pan.  I HATE that.\nHAPLESS EMPLOYEE: Okay... what about that pecan bar right there.\nWOMAN: NO! Not that one.  Look. You can tell that that one was cooked on the side of the pan.  No, I want that one (the one predictably buried under thirty others).  That *should* be all right.  It looks okay.\nHAPLESS EMPLOYEE: Uh.  Okay.  Sure.\nWOMAN: (orders fifty more things)\nHAPLESS EMPLOYEE: (rings up woman. she pays.)\nWOMAN: And MAKE SURE that I don't get the pecan bar because (points credit card menacingly at HAPLESS EMPLOYEE) I am *very particular* about this.  If it doesn't look right, I will send it right back.\nHAPLESS EMPLOYEE: Okay (reassuringly).  We will.  Thank you.\n\nSo I roll up behind her and give her a withering look as she turns away and commiserate with the homeboy at the bar.  Then we order, etc.\n\nA couple of pointers.  One) if my wife thinks you're an asshole, you are.  She's got a pretty long fuse for this sort of thing.  And yes, that's how come we're married.  Two) if you're fat, why would you act so... fat?  It just reinforces the fact that you're a great big fat person and what the hell?\n\nFat person code: (I am an authority)\n1. Don't act like if you don't get the exact pecan bar you want, that your life is OVER.  It may be true, but for fucks sake.\n2. Don't order a disgustingly fatty triple-super-size quadruple burger with extra mayo and then a large diet coke.  You get laughed at when you do this.\n3.  I would say DO diet and exercise but I'm fat and I think those two things are profoundly boring.\n\nAnyway, I know this has dragged on but I talk so that I can hear myself talk, and the same generally applies to my writing.  BUT: If you are from LM, I HOPE YOU READ THIS BECAUSE...\n\nOur red (please see updated below) velvet cake last night was (sorry about the parentheticals but the yelp-bots are to blame.) terrible**.  TERRIBLE!  We got it to go and whoever served it to us either grossly misunderstood the quality of what they were serving, or they should be fired.  I have (albeit indirect) experience with Joe (the owner/conceptual mastermind) and I am certain that if he knew that this five day old, dried up piece of cake were being given to customers, he would be upset. \n\nThere were even two people in line ahead of me trying to decide between the carrot and red velvet and I told them they should get red velvet, hands down.  YOU MADE A LIAR OUT OF ME, LIBERTY MARKET!  And for this, I won't forgive you unless I get a free slice of (do I even need to specify \"fresh\") red velvet cake.\n\nHaving said all of that, every restaurant has it's moments, bad or good, and I forgive that and on the strength of the usual red velvet perfection and the deliciousness of everything else, I give LM five stars.\n\n__________________\n\n**Red Velvet Update: I have been in twice since and this most recent time, Kiersten (one of the owners) gave me a new piece of red velvet cake.  And a pecan bar, from the middle of the pan no less!  But I want to make this clear, just in case it isn't: I love liberty market--it's exceptional.  And I really want everyone to know that I've had the RV cake many times before *and since* and it has, every time, been amazing.  I still hold that it is the best piece of cake I've ever had.  So it clearly was an aberration this time.  And the carrot cake is almost as good.  Really.  The bread pudding is totally sublime.  If you get a dessert there, you won't be disappointed.

The work that has been put into this space has payed off, and the pride the owners take in their business is evident.\n\nI've been here four times, once for lunch and the other times for dinner. They have a good menu that has expanded from my early visits. You order and pay at the counter. The pros of counter service far outweighed the cons every time I've visited. Joining a group of friends is as simple as saying hi, placing your order at the counter, and sitting down. This style of service really shines when I attend with #evfn. Very few restaurants handle our group of 40+ with so little hassle. This makes for a great place to hang out and meet up with people.\n\nWhen I had lunch here I had soup and a half size farmer's salad, the combo was on special. The minestrone hit the spot, and the salad was full of crisp, fresh vegetables. The salad and sandwich selection is good enough that I'd eat lunch here a few times a week if I lived or worked closer. For dinner the burger is my recommendation of the things I've tried. It was juicy and came with a good selection of condiments. I haven't had the opportunity to sample much of the new dinner menu. The grilled chicken pasta is pretty good, and I'm looking forward to trying the steak or the apricot glazed chicken on my next visit. I also hope to try their breakfast soon, I hear good things.\n\nMy only complaint is that the brewed tea by the soda fountain usually tastes old to me.

The bathroom is unisex sinks with separate doors for each stall.  Each room has it's own theme and music.  I love the creativity in something so often overlooked by most restaurants.  \n\nI've been here twice and had a great experience both times.  The first time I got the Italia Salad.  It was very large with lots of meat and cheese.  It was very tasty.  I followed that up by an ice cream sandwich which was at least 4x too big for me.  The cookie was fresh and warm with the ice cream wedged in between.  I say that baby is fit for 2 large adults or 3-4 people that know their limit.\n\nThe 2nd time I got the Italia sandwich.  It was fantastic.  The potato salad I chose as a side was good too.  Too often places overcook the hell out of the potatoes and it turns into mush.  Theirs still had some texture which was nice.  It was a very satisfying meal.  We chased our dish with their signature espresso which is a micro latte (two baby lattes). \n\nI love the uniqueness of the original brick wall, and the exposed wooden trusses that make up the roof.  Even the seemingly simple light bulbs are unique with a hoop-earring looking filament within them.  They have a brick oven for pizzas and a huge display for those tempting deserts.  In addition to the espresso bar they also have a nice selection of beer and wine.  This is a great lunch spot in an area of town not known for independent and unique dining options.  \n\nWorth the drive from Tempe.

Its hard to pick my favorite part but the homemade biscuit that I drizzled with honey was to die for.  \n\nI also loved my perfectly mixed carafe of mimosa.\nReally can't wait to visit Liberty Market again!", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-09-21", "type": "review"}

When they take your order, if you don't order a drink they give you a complimentary water glass. Not a plastic cup like most other restaurants. This is a legit glass that they use for fountain drinks. They bring your food to your table and come back regularly to check on how you are doing. Then on the off chance that you get to meet Joe while you are in there, he is the definition of working patron. He checks up on everyone, customers and staff alike, and is always willing to answer questions.

They have Mr. Pibb-marinated steak, burgers, pizza, sicilian pizza, salads, and even a chef's special paella with mussels, shrimp, scallops, chorrizo, a variety of dessert options, and more.  It was difficult to decide, to say the least.\n\nI opted to have the white pizza and bread pudding.  The pizza was one of the most delicious I've had.  It was an amazing pizza.

The whipped cream was good, but the bread pudding itself was pretty flavorless.\n\nThe biggest gripe I have with this place is that it's a cafeteria style setup, but the prices are more in line with a sit down restaurant.

It looks as if it is family owned and some of them work here, which gives it a small town feel, yet it seems to be a pretty popular place in old Downtown Gilbert. We've been here a few times for Sunday b-fast. The styling of the place is true old-meets-new theme, which is pretty cool. \n\nEverything on there menu that we've had seems to be made of quality ingredients and cooked to perfection. The service is generally pretty good, we've had less-than-perfect service a couple times, but it's usually pretty good. They source there sausage products from Shriner's locally, which is great sausage. Their biscuit's and gravy are seriously some of the best you will ever have, the Turkey sausage is excellent and if you didn't know it was turkey, you would still think it is excellent sausage. The cheesy-potatoes (can't remember what they call them!) are usually amazing but we have noticed some times they are better than others.\n\nMy wife enjoys there espresso drinks, but they don't offer anything besides whole milk, and early on a Sunday we try to keep it light. Their brewed coffee is good as well. The only limitation they may have is the menu, there is not much other than basic breakfast combos and omelets, which are all great, but it would be nice to see sandwiches and other options. They do have an assortment of baked goods, which look amazing. They only offer scrambled egg's, which I like, but my wife likes her egg's over easy and she doesn't get that option.\n\nOverall, for a great breakfast experience, Liberty Market is one of the best, EVER!

Passing the al fresco dining area, the kitchen, and subsequently the store and pastry counter to take my place in a line six deep I grabbed a paper menu on the way in to browse though in all reality it was not really necessary; I knew what I was there for and the pastry case had already tempted me with any number of appetizers.  \n\nStanding in line while others made their decisions, some a full meal and some merely pastries to go, when I eventually reached the coffee bar I was greeted by a young man with spacers and sleeves to fit his blas\u00e9 demeanor and placing my order the price was recited and a number was handed to me with any number of seats to choose from both inside and out.  Opting this time for the indoors and filling a glass with water and ice I took a seat with a full view of the room and placing my number on the table was left to wait for perhaps 10 minutes while reading a local guidebook detailing Liberty's history as well as  the other restaurants in Joe Johnston's stable.\n\nSipping my water while watching a small boy barely make a dent in his enormous pile of eggs my first course of the meal at Liberty would arrive hot from the pastry case in the form of the largest Cinnamon Roll I've eaten to date - a squared off yeasty pastry nearly filling the 12\" by 12\"plate and inundating what I can only imagine to be a 6 foot diameter with the smells of butter, cinnamon, and sugar.  Large yet impressively light with wispy dough sandwiching layers of cinnamon and butter and the entirely lacquered in a thin sugar shell the Cinnamon Roll wowed in flavor as much as it did in size and without being the belly buster of Cinnabon was a perfect size to share as an appetizer - or, if you're feeling truly ravenous (gluttonous) to enjoy on your own.\n\nWith the cinnamon roll easily dispatched of and now wishing I'd have gotten coffee but not wanting to withstand the 10+ deep line my second dish would arrive approximately fifteen minutes on the heels of the cinnamon roll and given all its hype I truly expected the Griddled Bread Pudding to be mind blowing, but alas it was merely very good.  Served with real maple syrup and approximately half the size and twice the weight of the cinnamon roll the bread pudding was in reality nearly flawless French Toast - a caramelized exterior and a moist custard interior, but what he had in texture it unfortunately lacked in taste.  Largely eggy but also with slight notes of cinnamon and vanilla that perked up with the syrup perhaps part of my disillusionment with the pudding was actually how sweet its predecessor had been but overall it just felt like something was missing - perhaps some fruit, whipped cream, or caramelized nuts to add a bit of texture and nuance (this is apparently how they serve the dessert, non-griddled, bread pudding.)\n\nOverall a very nice spot and a place I'd definitely return to for the baked goods as well as to try the pancakes, plus perhaps the griddled bread pudding with a side of fruit as a starter and one of those incredible looking Sticky Buns or scones as dessert.", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-10-12", "type": "review"}

It was also kind of dry, and would have been much better had there been some sort of spread on it or simply more goat cheese. \n\nI tried my husband's margarita pizza with roasted veggies and that too was just okay. The roasted veggies once again were very sparse and definitely not worth the $2 extra they charge for them. \n\nI also ordered a raspberry Italian soda - cremosa style, which tasted like half and half with sparkling water and no raspberry flavor. More on the disgusting side of flavors compared to everything else. I'd say skip this one if you are even considering trying this. \n\nFor what I had expected of this place for their food it was just okay.

It's in our rotation of restaurants so I'm not a stranger, but usually like more ethnic foods.\n\nLast night I had the pizza special of Wild Mushroom Pizza. It had no tomato sauce and no mozzarella cheese(a first for me). It was light, another first for pizza, with a thin coating of Parmesan cream sauce.  The crust was crisp and thin, and the mushrooms were tasty, if a little meager. I'm sure that the truffle oil added a certain something, and although I didn't sniff it out, my daughter did. \n\nShe had the Chicken Pasta with the same Parmesan cream sauce that was on my pizza. It was handy for me to dip the end pieces of crust into the sauce. I thought it was a bit salty. Her Caesar Salad came without any dressing, but with chicken, which she hadn't ordered. My husband had the Sausage Pizza, which tasted like sausage pizza. He liked it. I had Stella Artois Cidre which was very good. Neither bitter nor too sweet. \n\nFor dessert I bought a Lemon Bar, and I thought I would share it three ways. It was that big. I really wanted a Cream Cheese Brownie, but, alas, there weren't any. The lemon bar was good, but not the best. The crust was too thick in proportion to the lemon curd.\n\nWe were able to sit outside, the temperature was perfect and it was quieter than inside the restaurant.

Ask to get something like fruit or whatever instead of the potatoes but you can't do that either.

Really, nobody is even out here.  If 5 tables worth of people show and your packed inside then we'll move.  So we kept sitting and waited for our food, a girl came out, offered water, we told her what we were doing and what the guy said, and she said not to worry about it.

We originally planned on going to The Farmhouse next door but the wait was out the door so we walked in to Liberty Market where the line was long but at least it was inside.  We were very happy with our experience. We were both super hungry  after waiting in line next to all of the fresh baked goods.  The sticky buns, cinnamon rolls, and sweet potato muffins were very inviting but we decided to wait and see what the situation was after we ate breakfast. \n\nI got the chilaquiles with chorizo. I was somewhat skeptical when ordering as I have been to places that basically put enchilada sauce on regular tortilla chips. These were the real deal!  The chorizo had that extra little kick of heat I look for in Mexican food. The cotijo cheese was a nice touch but my favorite part was the sunny side up eggs bringing it all together.\n\nMy wife had the biscuits and gravy with an egg over the top. Of course I had a few bites and enjoyed it. The biscuits were hearty and the sausage in the gravy was plentiful. It had a great flavor and we enjoyed it but would have liked the temperature to be a bit hotter. This was the only downside of our whole experience and the only thing that kept us from a 5.\n\nUnfortunately we didn't have enough room for any of the goodies we saw while waiting in line, not even to go since we planned a couple of other grub sessions in the day.\n\nGO HERE!", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-10-25", "type": "review"}

We waited in line for about 15-20 minutes.\nI had ordered their burger of the week which was a Philly cheese steak burger with the garlic smashed potatoes, and my husband ordered the 6 alarm burger with fries.\nThe Cheese Steak Burger was very yummy, although it lacked the cheese steak flavor I was looking for. The potatoes were to die for!!!! I love some garlic mashed potatoes, but these were probably one of the best I've ever had.\nMy husband love hot food. He is the guy you see adding hot sauce to everything!!! Well he said that this was almost too hot for him! He took his first few bites and his eyes went wide with delight, then after letting the heat settle in, he realized how hot it truly was. His fries were not that good. He had said he would rather have fast food fries. I tried them and I was disappointed as well. They were cold and didn't have much flavor to them.\nBy the time we left we were both super full. We usually share a meal, but wanted to try  the things we wanted for our first time there. \nThe one thing I will say is that we had to run to the bathroom when we got home.... Im not sure why, but the food didn't settle well. But boy did it taste good!!\n\nA day later, I'm regretting every delicious bite.

This time though, when we walked in the front entrance, we were greeted and really liked the the vibe so we figured we would wait. It took only about half an hour to put in our order which was less than expected looking at the line. The best part was that even though we had to order prior to sitting, we were given a number with a designated table so we didn't need to worry about others holding tables, etc.\n\nWe ordered the Crab Cake Po Boy with a side of roasted sweet potato salad ($1 extra for the side as their sandwiches normally come with chips) & the Pancakes with blueberries ($1 extra for the blueberries). Everything came out quickly & it looked great!\n\nThe blueberry pancakes were really fluffy & delicious with an ample helping of blueberries in each pancake. I think it's a bit of hit or miss when it comes to pancakes but these were so spot on! The Crab Cake Po Boy was also delicious; the crab cakes themselves were really light and seasoned well. I also really liked the chipotle aioli that was served with it. The portion size of this sandwich was really large, way too big for one person to finish. The accompanying sweet potato salad was also so so good! The reason why we got it is because when we were walking through the line, we passed by a case that had all the cold sides ... tricky tricky!\n\nThe other items in the pastry case also looked really good.

I love you iced. I love you hot. And I love you blended.  This is easily the best coffee drink I have had in Arizona.  I'm sure there other coffee drinks are delicious, and maybe if they run out of Mexican Mocha I will try one. But for now I'm hooked.  It is a perfect blend of coffee and spicy chocolate flavor.  Jolta Java is also a super comfy caf\u00e9,  the salads and sandwiches are delish, and the staff is super friendly.  I also just signed up for their frequent customer program, and it's great that they use your phone # as your ID instead of having to carry yet another card on my key ring.

First, this store is not perfect whatsoever. However, this store is the busiest store in the state of Arizona in terms of revenues so in light of that, I'm cutting them some slack with the 5 stars. Second- The clientel that this store deals with is sometimes less than pleasant and they do a fantastic job at turning around bad situations. So lets begin! \n\nAvg Visits: twice/week\nPartner Friendliness: 2 Partners smile, cheery, initiated conversation, although there are a few bad apples \nPartner Appearance: 3 All looked professional without exception\nPartner Knowledge: This crew is very experience and knows coffee and Starbucks well\n\nStore Appearance (decor): 1 Could use some work\nStore Cleansliness: 3 despite being the busiest store, it is always clean from my experience\nStore Comfort:1 This is by far my biggest complaint. I used to frequent this store every day for lunch when I worked in this area. 3 out of 5 times, I could never get a seat and during Arizona's summer's, there was no chance I would sit outside. I often either had to give up finding a seat or wait 15-20 minutes to get a seat. \n\n*Either 1 or 2 for this section. Its either right or wrong*\nBeverage Taste: 2 Iced Single Venty Hazelnut Breve Iced Coffee\nBeverage Consistency: 2 Never had funny tasting drinks\nBeverage Temperature: 2 Always ice cold or steamy hot.\nBeverage Preparation (I watch): 2 No health hazards, shortcuts, etc.\nBeverage Mistakes: 2 Never had a wrong drink made. \n\nWill I return?: YES\n\nI personally don't care for Starbucks food and do not believe that is what Starbucks is about.

It happened to me when I least expected. I was sitting at my small cubicle during my first job. Birthday cake graced the break room practically everyday but today was different. When I walked inside to sing an out of key version of the birthday song to my coworker, I noticed a masterpiece in front of my eyes. A white cake topped with the freshest of fruit and the creamiest of white chocolate morphed into a piece of artwork. One bite into the white cake filled with fresh strawberries and I was in lust. It later turned into love and I've been happy every since. \n\nI silently thank the coworker who introduced me to Honey Moon Sweets because I can't imagine life without knowing about this sweet Phoenix treat. Over the years, Honey Moon Sweets has been my go-to bakery for a special occasion. I've purchased the \"basic\" cake for birthday parties. Let me just note here that a basic cake from Honey Moon Sweets is practically a masterpiece in any other bakery's mind. When planning my sister's baby shower, I knew exactly where to go. I wanted the perfect cake and a work of art to grace the baby shower table. And behold the Honey Moon Sweets baby cake. It was three tiers, blue with rattles, pacifier, building blocks, a crib, a teddy bear...you name it filling the top. Some of the pieces were frosting creations and some were real toys. It was almost too gorgeous to eat, but we couldn't resist it so enjoyed every bite. It was just as good as it looked if not better. Honey Moon Sweets does a fabulous job of using the freshest of ingredients and you can tell upon the first bite. The scariest part of this cake adventure was the travel time from the bakery to the Biltmore for the baby shower. One wrong move and the cake would have been toast so be prepared to move lightly with this cake in hand. As you can imagine, cakes from Honey Moon Sweets are not budget-friendly, but for what you get from the cake, it's reasonably priced. Just save your coins for a special occasion because it's worth it. I promise.", "business_id": "YgqexscIgNoMBAO__J97zA", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-10-06", "type": "review"}

Even the most basic options are beautiful.  The price quote I got for one such \"basic\" cake was a bit cheaper than what I was quoted for similar designs at the other places.  Once I started to look at some of the fancier options the price goes up a bit.  It seems like they charge a little more than some of the other places for sugar roses and stuff like that.\n\nService:  Knowledgeable, friendly, accommodating, informative and overall great, great, great.  \n\nFYI: the other little pastries they sell are very very good.  Its worth a visit just for that!!!!\n\nEveryone! my wedding cake turned out great.  The guests loved it.  It was exactly what the groom and I ordered.

It was beautifully topped with fruit and chocolate shavings. There was even a little chocolate banner wishing her a happy birthday.  It was the most I've ever spent on a cake and well worth it. My aunt was so surprised when we brought it out after dinner. But, when she found out she could eat it, she actually cried. She hadn't had cake in over 20 years.

I asked for a coconut cake, and really just said \"do what you think would taste best.\" It had a whipped cream that was okay, the pi\u00f1a colada mouse inside the layers was good but in general, the cake inside was bland and dry.\n\nI may be back to pick up their smaller treats in the front and give those a go, but I don't think I'll order another cake again.", "business_id": "YgqexscIgNoMBAO__J97zA", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-11-12", "type": "review"}

Honestly, it's only because they've got the only game in town.  That's right, America's largest public university is served by exactly 1 coffeehouse that is open to midnight.  Cartel recently pushed their ridiculous 8pm close to 10pm.  But no one else does the late night thing except Xtreme Bean.\n\nIn fact, the extended hours and generous sizes are still all I can recommend.  As ASU has grown, XB gets more and more crowded.  Good luck finding a table any night after 9pm.  Plus, all the extra people also slow the wifi to a crawl.  \n\nSo why am I going?  It's coffee.  It's a place to study.  It's the only place open after 10.  \n\nNote to entrepreneurs-- want to make some money?  Open a decent 24 hour coffeehouse a few blocks away from the nation's biggest university.
