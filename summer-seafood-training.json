Why would you come to Mitchell's if not for the fish/seafood? You probably wouldn't. But you can swim in the Great Lakes beer on tap here and have some nice oysters while enjoying river view. Not many places in Pittsburgh offer these types of views while dining (and that's a Pittsburgh mystery to me). The restaurant is never to crowded and you won't get packed in like sardines in a tin can. So you can enjoy a fairly romantic dinner with your loved one(s).  \nThe food is very good but you may have to shell out a few clams of your own ($$$). If you have deep ocean like pockets put your hook into the  sea bass which is always moist and scrumptious at around $29.99. They will cook your food one of several ways. I like my fish broiled, their signature is too salty for my liking. Bread is mmmgood and hot (free). Staff is very  accommodating ie you can request to sample a soup and the servers are pleased to do so. I recommend you try their soups like the seafood gumbo. A bowl of this creamy delight goes a long way...bonus they toss in those little hexagonal oyster crackers as  reminds me of my youth on Long Island's south shore (but that's another story). Salads a bit skimpy and somewhat pricey (approx. $7.95 for basic house salad). Bottom line is Mitchell's at the Waterfront is well worth taking the splash for if you really like a nice seafood dinner.", "business_id": "usSROUMiAgPcxV3Ym0OxMQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-06-09", "type": "review"}

This made a ridiculously expensive restaurant cost about as much as it would cost us on an average night out. We skipped drinks and dessert (we were really too full of other stuff anyway!) and our bill still came to $114 before tip. I was surprised that the dress code was so casual for such a nice place; my husband and I dressed up (hey, it's not every day that we eat so fancy!) but we saw folks there in shorts and flip flops, too.\n\nWe started with the delicious bread, and calamari. The calamari was spicy, and it would have been better with some sort of dipping sauce, but I guess that isn't classy enough for the Capital Grille! I just squeezed lemon juice all over my plate and it was delicious.\n\nI ordered the citrus-glazed salmon for my entree, with a spinach salad and warm bacon dressing on the side. The salmon was a very generous portion that was very well done. I'm very picky when it comes to salmon and I found this to be fresh and delicious. The salmon also came resting on a generous bed of asparagus, onions, etc. which was an unexpected surprise as we'd been told that all sides were a la carte. I definitely could have skipped the spinach salad, just because I already had so much food and we were staying in a hotel without a mini fridge. But the salad itself was delicious- more of a dinner portion than a side, actually.\n\nMy husband ordered the steak and lobster. At $49 it was one of the more expensive entrees on the menu, yet is was a LOT smaller than my salmon (which was $33). He was disappointed at the size for that price, actually. But it still managed to be large enough that he couldn't finish it, with the bread and calamari he'd already eaten. The steak and lobster were both delicious, though.\n\nThe service was impeccable.

However restaurant week and the meat-eater's friend being a chef at Upstream led us to visit this week. We showed up around 7:30 during restaurant week, expecting a bit of a wait. The hostess was very pleasant and offered seating outside on the patio right away or suggested a drink in the bar while we waited. We chose the bar. \n\nThis seems to be more of an older 50+ crowd with a few exceptions. Mostly business casual attire but I didn't feel out of place in dressed up jeans. The d\u00e9cor is traditional Southpark - dark woods and colors. \n\nThe bartender greeted us promptly, presented the wine list and gave us a few minutes to decide. They have an extensive (and pricey) wine list and a handful of specialty cocktails and martinis. Drinks were served and that was the extent of our bartender interaction. He seemed to get in the weeds a bit with all the server orders coming in. Not a big issue as we didn't really need anything else but could be a problem if we were trying to order at the bar.  \n\nOur wait was as promised - approximately thirty minutes. The dining room is a bit smaller than I anticipated but nicely laid out. You have a glimpse at the open kitchen but not enough to gawk during your whole meal and enough privacy at the tables and booths that you don't hear your neighbors' conversations. Our server greeted us, got our new drink order and came back to discuss the special. I must admit, I enjoyed freaking him out by dropping the \"I'm a vegan\" on him. I doubt this is a normal request at Upstream and I wouldn't dream of showing up without advance warning (which we'd done via the friend).  He consulted with the kitchen and came back looking much more relaxed and surprised with how easy it would be to accommodate me. I had the Shaved Athena Melon salad sans ham, tomato risotto sans cheese and a lovely sorbet sampler with warmed peaches. The sorbet, while really good, isn't made in house. Meat-eater had the Smoked Cod Cake and Lobster cakes, Snake River Ranch Wagyu Flank Steak and French Macaroons. He's still talking about the cod and lobster cakes and how good they were.  I really enjoyed all my courses. The salad did need a little \"oomph\" to make up for the lack of salty ham but overall very happy with our meals. \n\nI was impressed with the service. Our plates were removed quickly, our server was present in the dining room but not in the way, courses were served promptly and glasses kept full. \n\nUpstream isn't my normal type of preferred dining or cuisine but I appreciate any place that has excellent service and chefs that know their food and are willing to make accommodations in a gracious manner for special diets.  I know Upstream is part of the Harper's Group but I thought it had enough personality to not be classified \"just another corporate place\".", "business_id": "BOp3jcpYy31M85H1DLnEEw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-07-27", "type": "review"}

The fish itself was so flavorful and not too greasy, although she did report that her portion had a lot of really small bones, and the rice side dish was good. I would recommend avoiding the basil tomatoes, though - even though the tomatoes themselves were fresh, they were absolutely covered in black pepper, which made them inedible.

My normal concerns with such eateries--will the food be maintained at a proper food-safe temperature, is this seafood fresh, how long has the sushi been sitting out, will I be able to make it home before my intestines rupture--dissipated because Hoa knows good Asian cuisine. She is, of course, born to Vietnam and world traveled. \n\nLet's start with my happiest aspect about HKGB: the sushi. No, it's not the best sushi in the Valley, but they make it fresh for you on site. You can stand there and watch it being make, grab a soup or something else to munch on, or just sit at your table and chat awhile. Afterwards, you can head back for more sushi or veer over to the more traditional offerings of a Chinese buffet: sweet and sour chicken, fried rice, crab legs. \n\nNow let's review the not-so-shiny aspect: the price. Yes, it seems a little steep that we paid about $25 per person with tip (and I made only two rounds) but when you factor in the 2 hours we spent there, grazing, catching up, grazing, passing Lisette's daughter around, grazing and making plans to keep in touch, it's really not such an outrageous amount to pay. \n\nIf you find yourself in this part of town, craving Chinese and are wicked crazy hungry, give HKGB a shot.", "business_id": "-Ogv7rpcgUHkFaSy3vD8Sw", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-08-13", "type": "review"}

My husband had a Mai Tai and wasn't overly thrilled with it. It was all yellow and not overly tasty (just pineappley). We each ordered a glass of wine to take with us for dinner ($5 vs. $15 on the dinner menu...getting it there was much more cost-effective). \n\nThe staff was very friendly. They surprisingly got very busy all at once, so there were some delays in service but we were in no rush so didn't mind. The seafood was very tasty. Portions are on the small side though. One item in my seafood sampler was not as it should have been (stuffed shrimp arrived empty!). The waiter asked the chef about it and tried to convince me it was really there but just on the outside which was irritating because it clearly wasn't. So, the chef gave me a blob of stuffing on the side. A little odd, but at least some effort was made to make it right. \n\nThe Chocolate souffle is certainly worth the $10.50 and 20 minute prep time. THE BEST. \n\nIf you want a little tropical getaway, it's a great place to go.

Now back in Phoenix, we went to the Roy's at the Marriott where we have been before.  The food was very good.  My wife had Salmon and thought it was the best she had ever had.  I had the Ono and it was good, if not a bit overcooked.  The service was way, way below par.  Normally at Roy's you are showered with greetings from everyone as you walk to your table.  This night....crickets.  We sat outside and since our last visit (6 years ago), they have formed a large, informal seating area to augment the dining tables.  So, as we are beginning our meal, about 8 people plopped themselves down - all having just come from the pool.  A few were very loud and instantly, Roy's became a Pub.  They ordered pool-side food and the atmosphere was shattered.  Roy's invited this by setting up this seating area.  We finished our meals and the plates sat on the table for nearly 10 minutes as the wait staff disappeared.  This is 180 degrees different from how Roy's used to be.  I spoke with the manager and reminded him that we were there to celebrate my wife's birthday and that we wanted to move indoors to have our dessert and coffee.  They obliged us and were apologetic.  \nSo, all in all, the food remained good, if not overpriced, but the attention, service and outdoor atmosphere took a big bite out of the experience.

The answer here is yes.  Especially the way that push-cart servers call out the food which make you feel like you're in a rowdy tourist market full of cheap knock-offs they're trying to get rid of.  \n\nBut all would have been forgiven if only the dim-sum being served was any good.  However the dishes we ordered reflected a sloppy kitchen that was focused solely on putting in minimal effort and taking every possible shortcut on the food. \n\nDishes that made me ashamed to be Chinese (yes, the level that C-Fu dimsum brought it down to was that bad):\n\n-  Fried glutinous rice:  The preserved meat that was supposed to flavor the dish was MIA. We complained to one of the waiters who replied that \"they probably forgot\" (um are you sure it's not cost cutting for those who don't know any better?).  More over, the proper way to cook this classic dish would be like risotto where you're constantly stirring and gradually adding water just a little bit at a time (except of course everything is being done in a wok)...Here the C-Fu kitchen obviously just shoved the whole thing into an electric rice-cooker and try to stir fry the huge sticky mess at the end by adding in gallons of oil.   \n\n-  Glutinous rice with chicken steamed in lotus leaf:  Once again that electric rice cooker in the back of the kitchen must be working real hard cause the dish lacked the aroma that it would have had if it had actually been steamed in lotus leaf.  Just tasted of sloppy topping of minced chicken and last minute wrapping in the lotus leaf.\n\nDishes I was amazed by (and no not in a good way):\n\n-  Deep fried taro dumpling:  Have never quite had it in that simplistic way before where the filling literally was just mashed taro held together by a prodigious amount of oil\n\n-  Steamed bok choy:  How the heck do you get oil into steamed vegetable?  C-Fu managed to accomplish this amazing feat of greasy steamed vegetable...unbelievable\n\nOn a good note, the Siu Mai was decent.  We did keep on ordering more dishes hopping that something good would pop up...but nope that was it,...so if  you must go to C-Fu for dim-sum...just order order a lot of siu mai and be careful of all the other dishes.  Dinner here was much better. 1 star is for dim-sum only.\n\nNext time I have a dim-sum craving, you'll be finding me across the valley at China Chan's (Glendale) where the short & sweet dimsum offering is cooked by a man who doesn't cut corners and it shows.  That's where I'll be sticking to from now on.", "business_id": "z4KFTJQsAdxqMZA7Fx0A9A", "stars": 1, "date": "2007-08-27", "type": "review"}
