I would eat here more often if it was more convenient.  To me, the gyro here is the best in Pittsburgh.  Better than ANY other.  Until someone can point me at a Gyro place that makes them like they do in some of the larger cities in the U.S., or like in Greece or Turkey, where they hand make the meat on a spit, it is lamb sliced thin, and placed in layers on a skewer, then slow roasted, and sliced and served while you watch, then Salonikas will remain the best.  \n\nSeriously, every single Gyro place around here just buys that big round slab of processed meat, and puts it on a spinner. Folks that say \"Oh it is seasoned so perfectly at XXXX\" are nuts.  No place around here makes their own lamb gyro meat. If you know of one, put it down, I want to go there.\n\nI like Salonikas because I like the pita, it is nice and thick and chewy, and they fry it on the flat top.  Places that don't heat the pita (like that place on the Strip that sells Gyros for $5 and he don't even heat the pita?!?!) They STINK!  \n\nI like the tszaziki (however you spell it).  It is nice and thick and well seasoned.  It does not go running down your arm when you take a big honking bite of your gyro.  \n\nI like the meat, it is seasoned so perfectly!  (!?!?!) Actually, they cook it long enough to make it a bit crusty, and they slice it nice and thin.  And they put on a LOT of it.  \n\nAnd all the veg is just right.  I wish they used hotter onions, but oh well.\n\nAnd best of all, they have a bar, that is VERY fairly priced.  Especially considering it is located so near the theatre district.  I also absolutely like all the other stuff they have, the spanakopata, and the moussaka, and the grape leaves.  Pretty much anything they sell.\n\nAnd keep this in mind, this place is inexpensive.  I mean seriously, the negative reviews this place gets all seem to say \"the prices are cheap, and tastes it\".  Well, bull.  The food is inexpensive, and what you get for what they charge, is way above what you expect.  Like, instead of ground lamb in some dishes, you get ground beef.  Still tastes good to me.  Not as great as it would be with ground lamb, but it keeps the price down, and it still tastes good.\n\nMy favorite time to eat here?  New Years eve, or Pittsburgh Light Up Night.  I have been here every one of those the past three years, they are packed, you get to have a gyro and a beer.  It is just a nice fun time.  And considering how busy they are, the staff are all way happier that at some of those pinky-in-the-air joiunts in the theatre district.\n\nOh, and the customers are all friendly.  Nice mix of blue collar and cops and folks getting a bite before or after some event in the cultural district.  I REALLLY like this place.  \n\nNow, next reviewer who throws down some ignorant review about how some other gyro is better, first, is it a REAL gyro, made with REAL thin sliced lamb, slow cooked on a spit and sliced off fresh and juicy, then PLEASE put the name of the place in your review.  I have tried EVERY gyro spot in the city, and quite a few outside it.  And I am STILL looking for a REAL gyro made like that.  Until then, this place is the best for me.", "business_id": "WXpi9z1bqF9raZSW8z70Ow", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-08-16", "type": "review"}

DO NOT GO HERE.\n\nMy family was visiting my sister in Pittsburgh and we had our eyes set on a specific restaurant, not Christos. A gentleman, I presume the owner of Christos, saw my family and I as we walked down the street. He flashed us his menu, pitching to us why his restaurant was the best and why his food was the best. I could barely tell if he was selling food or used cars. I kindly told him we were not interested. My family, however, was indecisive when it came to getting a restaurant. We ending up wanting to go eat at the restaurant next door to Christos so we backtracked. Again the owner flashed us his menu, sensing our touristy indecision. I again declined and pointed to the restaurant I was heading to. He then ignored me and pan-handled to my two sisters, mother and wife. They gave in to my dismay. As they said \"sure...\" I looked inside the restaurant of Christos at peak dinner hours.  No one was inside.  Absolutely no one. As my family walked in and I rolled my eyes, I thought, well let's give them a chance...my whole family seemed to feel bad for the guy and I like Greek food.\n\nAs we got in, it seemed nothing was going on. We had just came back from kayaking so we needed to wash our hands. They didn't seem to have a restroom but they took my sisters and mother through the kitchen and downstairs to find one. The silence was broken when they finally put music on and suddenly a couple of kitchen helpers came out and looked like they were warming some of the kitchen equipment up.  Were we their only customers tonight? I bet we were. Before I could settle in, he casually asked if I liked pita and hummus. Obviously I said yes. He was asking me so casually when I didn't even have a menu, I assumed it was complimentary when he said he would get me some, but as I waited I found his restaurant on Yelp with my phone and the first review gave them one star and mentioned how the owner didn't tell him the pita was extra.  Great. \n\nThe rest of my family later came back from the restroom (akin to going to a restroom at a grocery store where you're around stock items...except you need to go through their kitchen). They started with salad. The waiter asked if I wanted anchovies or something else on my salad. I was going to say \"sure\" but my wife stopped me and said it could be extra. The waiter, looking like he got caught, verified he was offering all extras to me even though earlier the owner said salads came with dinner. I had to say,\"I just want the standard salad, nothing extra.\" I couldn't let my guard down.\n\nWe ordered some food, priced about what you'd expect.  The pita and hummus I ordered earlier was just barely average so I don't know why they thought it was worth $4. My sister ordered \"leg of lamb\" so I expected to see a leg of a lamb. Instead when her plate came out, it looked like sad slices of ham. Really. We all got vegetables but they were soggy and unappetizing. I saw them earlier in the kitchen sitting in a big pot when I had used the restroom. Nothing here is fresh. My lamb was on the chewy side. My sister's \"leg of lamb\" was left uneaten and she asked if I wanted some. I \"tried\" to eat it but it was too chewy. They then asked for dessert. I wanted to say no out of my discontent but again my family members all said yes, even when they were telling me the food was not great.  I don't have their sense of pity. The desert and salad were the best things of the night, which was kind of sad. \n\nWhen we got the receipt and my wife insisted we check it.  Surprise. They overcharged us $7 from two mysterious items. Their receipt doesn't even list what you ordered. I went up the the cashier to ask them what the two items were. He tried to explain one but he really couldn't. He scratched out the $3 item. I then questioned the $4 charge. Again he tried to explain it but he really couldn't. Again he agreed with me and scratched out the $4.  On top of all this we still gave them a normal tip out of pity. I could tell the waiters were just following orders. I could tell the owner had trained them what to say and how to make extra money.\n\nYou've been warned. There's a reason why this place is doing so poorly.  There's a reason why the whole hour between 7:30pm and 8:30pm we were the only ones in the restaurant. There's a reason why the owner is begging customer to come in. They're cutting corners on customer service and food quality in exchange for salesman tactics, overcharging and tricking you to buy things you don't even know is extra. DO NOT GO HERE.\n\nOwners like this will say,\"But I have to or else I won't make it.\" You know what? Restaurants like yours shouldn't make it. Not to be harsh but it was a poor experience. Change your food, your sales tactics and your fake receipt items strategy. Maybe a long time ago when they started they were real but now they are doing every dirty trick in the book to nickel and dime you.  \n\nWARNING.

You are going to feel uneasy, is what I'm trying to say. \n\n- They overcharged us, probably intentionally. They don't have itemized receipts. \n- The waiter kept giving us options as if they were... free options that you're supposed to choose. We caught on when we specifically asked if they cost extra.\n- The elusive bathroom felt like we were descending down the staircase to hell. Better than nothing, I suppose.\n- The food.... oh my god.

It's a cliche to say dishes have layers of flavor, but there's no more accurate way to describe this thoughtful, absolutely delicious cooking.\n\nThe restaurant isn't fancy, but it's like eating in someone's living room, and those are some of the best restaurant meals I've had. The takeout gyro was great, with buttery pita and a potato-garlic spread that goes with frankly everything. But the souvlaki eaten in, while considering the scrapbook-worthy collection of paintings and memorabilia on the dining room walls, was sublime - a little char and a lot of flavor in every bite.  I have eaten a lot of Greek food cooked by a lot of Greek people who are very good cooks, and this stands up to any of it.

The fries were not as crispy as I like but that too was a relatively minor offense. Then I tasted the chicken finger.  Gone was the flavor and little taste of spicy burn at the end. Major disappointment! Might as well have been eating the frozen tenders served at all the other locations.\n\nI asked WTH and they told me, management change. Told me the recipe was the same but my tastebuds tell me a different story. Boo! That makes me so sad knowing I will never experience that wonderful flavor again. Sure wish someone could tell me what that spice was and I would try to duplicate it at home. And what was that wonderful honey mustard sauce brand?

Anyone who works the downtown area knows this place and goes there once in awhile (they will admit it) for a quick AZ/MEX fix.", "business_id": "Y293fHh5SZ0_9BZm4M6BCg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-08-09", "type": "review"}

I have to admit, the area seemed a little weird to me, but maybe its just because I'm not familiar with the area.  We entered, and were immediately greeted and told that there is a hearing for the liquor license on the 28th...so that should definitely be a plus for this place.  There was a gentleman playing guitar which was very nice, but just a wee bit too loud for ambiance - we had a hard time hearing each other.\n\nTwo of my meal mates shared the hummus to start, I tried it and it was awesome as were the dolmas served on the side.  It all looked fresh and was presented very nicely.  I ordered the Champs de Elysee' sandwich which was TO DIE FOR...if you like brie, I highly recommend it.  The soup of the day was crab bisque.  When I asked our server if it was a red or white bisque he told me \"neither\" and then let me know that most of their items were nontraditional.  He wasn't lying.  I don't think there was a piece of crab in my bisque.  It was more of a broth, with large potato chunks and pieces of grape/vine leaves.  It wasn't bad, I just don't think I would get it again.\n\nEveryone else enjoyed their food.  The two downers that prevent me from being able to give it 5 stars are the lack of parking - some stupid macho man twit in his white Dodge Ram was blocking most of the driveway then almost runs me over trying to get a spot in the parking lot when he could have just as easily parked where he was sitting on the side of the road (which is where I ended up parking btw) and the soup.

Well, the good news is it's a full bar, and yes you can buy a PBR or Schlitz...but on Saturday afternoon no juices for mixing, and yesterday was very very hot. I think the wine and beer menu are varied, but it just seems the liquor menu is all top-shelf. I think Smirnoff vodka is just fine, same with Dewars scotch,etc. Take a tip from Carlys, Palette etc. and find a way to keep a varied price-point. Two drinks plus a sandwich was $22. plus and I tip 20%. I think I would have made this a five-star day if it had been a $16.00 to $17.00 meal and drinks. \n\nBy the way, the drink we finally created was a \"John Daly\", an alcoholic version of the lemonade/ice  tea classic Arnold Palmer. Due to a lack of materials, it was improvised by with some sweetened tea and sweet tea/lemonade vodka.

I can just order the side of Greek salad, which is like $2.80 and I feel pretty full after that.  But I usually also get a side pasta salad or side of hummus also.  The other stuff on the menu is not that great, nothing spectacular -- oh except for the chocolate cake!

After the wife and I had placed our order, we filled our fountain sodas, gawked at the impressive selection of hot sauces, selected a table to sit at, and before my butt even hit the seat the food was on its way to the table.  Impressive!  Finally a place to grab a quick, hassle-free lunch.  And, well, since they aren't open past 5:00PM or on weekends at all anyway, I guess this place has figured out its niche - the downtown lunch crowd.\n\nThey offer a huge variety of subs, pitas, and salads, most of which are your normal deli standards.  Most of the actual Greek offerings aren't even listed on the regular menu but as \"sides\" - falafel, spanakopita, dolmades, hummus.\n\nWe ordered a gyro and a falafel platter. Be forewarned, the \"garnish\" that comes with the falafel pita is essentially a side salad, I made the mistake of getting the side salad instead of one of the other sides and had two big mounds of veggies.  Not a big deal, just something to know for next time.  \n\nThe food itself wasn't spectacular by any means.

Now, I will always be a big guy (not \"two fat twins on their matching motorcycles\" big, but you know, not little) but I definitely am eating more appropriately. However, I work in an office, and around 11:30, people start to double-think their lunch choices. Yes, the night before, a breakfast bowl from Jimmy Dean sounds like an excellent lunch selection, but all that pushing of buttons and watching your meal spin in the microwave? Forget it; one \"What are you doing for lunch\" from a buddy and I was out of there.\n\nAthenian was a prime lunch spot for me for awhile, and just fell out of favor. No time like the present to return, plus SB had never been there before today. We took the 2 minute drive to Central and rolled in to a 1/3 filled Athenian Express. Happy to have missed the rush, I immediately ordered my favorite dish, the gyro feta (no tomatoes/onions, add lettuce) with fries, and SB got a chicken sub and potato salad.\n\nFirst issue, no fountain soda? If I can't destroy myself with aspartame in my free refills, it's not a great lunch. Plus, I don't like drinking out of cans unless its a more adult beverage. Fix yo machine, Athenian!\n\nOutside of the $1.50 soda, the meal was as good as always. It was a bit lighter on the feta than usual (and LOVE me some feta goodness), but still had quite a pile. The meat was thick and cooked through, definitely filled up the pita to an overflowing Greek party. The french fries weren't overcooked, which is good because burned fries suck fully. Add in a side of tzatziki sauce to poor over everything, and times were well spent. It's a ton of food for what you pay, and one of the best deals downtown.\n\nMy coworker didn't fair quite as well, but it was more his preferences than issues with the meal. His chicken sub came with a huge breast, which I would think is a good thing, but for him caused the sandwich to be overstuffed (like I said, weird preferences). He demolished the entire thing, so it must have not been too bad, along with the potato salad, which he was a fan of as well.\n\nAll in all, very good lunch experience. I usually get take-out, but the Greek team had their World Cup game, so it seemed appropriate to hang out and watch the \"exciting\" 0-0 match-up. If we can get some fountain sodas up in there, Athenian will likely jump back on my radar (and I may even get a salad.....maybe).", "business_id": "odhXwWaYZvD_icIN6f_DbA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-06-22", "type": "review"}

Platter of big chocolate chip cookies, brownies and lemonade were calling my name but if it were not for my diet, I would have given in. I had the usual falafel plate with french fries and my other diner had the steak sandwich. The fries were thick but tasted a little old, and some were brown like they were old.

The food is amazing, the people intriguing and the scenery incomparable!\n\nThe closest I've come is visiting local greek restaurants. Years ago ( 1989 to be exact) a new restaurant opened and sent mail coupons to advertise. Taking a chance I ventured out to find the most welcoming, friendly atmosphere with greek food that made me feel as if I had been transported to a greek island! A place where the owner greeted each patron upon entry and gave them a hug or a handshake to say goodbye...what a treat.\n\nSadly, I've only been back a handful of times. No particular reason, just living life and business.... \n\nSaturday, I was thinking of belly dancing , food and good company. My companion and I decided to head out to The Bacchanal restaurant in Phoenix. \nI was hesitant as it had been eight years since I had eaten there.\n\nMy heart leapt and a smile crossed my face as Yoryos, the owner ( a bit grayer yet he had the same spring in his step and welcoming smile on his face) greeted us and seemed genuinely happy we arrived. The live greek band had begun to play and already it was feeling like home.....\n\nWe were seated quickly and promptly ( I recommend reservations on Friday and Saturday nights). The wine list is not extensive but has enough greek wines to interest a connoisseur. The atmosphere was dimly lit with candles, white linen tablecloths. Mirrors added the aura of more space and allowed one to see the dancer from every table.\n\n\nWe started with one of the appetizer variety plates ( Tiropita, spanakopita, dolmades, feta, kalamata olives,\nstuffed mushroom, and tzatziki dip ) The Spanakopita was cheesy, delicate melt in your mouth. The stuffed mushroom ( bacon) was firm not mushy and the bacon was delicate not in your face.\nThe Tiropita was gentle with a buttery crust and delicate cheeses inside. All in all a lovely dish as a good introduction to greek food.\n\nOur entrees arrived. The traditional Moussaka looking lovely in it's red sauce paired with lightly salted potatoes and a mixed vegetable. It was meaty, hearty , tomato flavor that tasted as if your greek mama slaved over it all day. Just enough mix of onion and egg to bring the flavors of the lamb alive. \nThe Veal Bacchanal was served in a creamy white sauce with mushrooms and artichoke hearts! It was tender, juicy and subtle yet very tasty... one bite combined with the artichokes and mushroom made me close my eyes and just say \" AH'. fewdgasm! \nIm usually not a fan of mixed veggies but the spice and tenderness made them quite tasty.\n\nAs we ate and enjoyed our wines, Alexia , the belly dancer began her moves. She is Yoryos' wife. She was very fluid, beautiful skilled and playful! She moved around all the diners....collecting a few dollars along the way :).\nThe restaurant was full with many birthday groups ( the largest being 25) Yoryos and his wife invited many diners on the dance floor . One beautiful older lady ( 90 if a day) was up doing her own belly dance moves.\nIt was as if one were in a greek home partying until the wee late hours!\nOf course we hit the dance floor a few times !\n\nAs we left Yoryos spoke with us about our evening, my children, his children.... and after I received a kiss , hug and admonition to not wait eight years to come back.....we went home with soul and stomach happy and content.\n\nI give this restaurant 4 of 5 orchids! The service was adequate but not exceptional.\n\nIm ready to go back and next time it will be for MY birthday ! \n\nThe Bacchanal \nBacchanal\n3015 E. Thomas Rd.\nPhoenix, Arizona 85016 \nTelephone: (602) 224-9377\nBelly dancing Friday and Saturday night ( 8-1 ) Live music 8-1 am\nOn Friday and Saturday they have special performances of Folk dancing and traditional Shoe dancing.

The food was spectacular, and as a vegetarian I had a lot to choose from (although the menu needs some help; things marked with an asterisk are supposed to be vegetarian, but there were asterisks dotted all over fish dishes). The array of desserts was to die for. My main complaint? Pricey like woah. And it was sneaky pricey. There were three of us; our main dishes were $10-$12 each, with a $9 appetizer, 3 desserts, cocktails, etc. and the bill was over $160!!! I thought my poor boyfriend was going to crap himself.  I honestly don't know how it got that expensive. The drinks? The desserts? Were the baskets of pita $8 apiece? I mean, a Greek meal costing  more than a steak extravaganza at Cork and Cleaver?

I used to live in the area for about 4 years before moving back to the midwest and Greekfest was a place I could come to, to treat myself for any celebration I deemed necessary. My wife and I had our first \"business date\" here and the rest is history. We were in the early planning stages with Susan to have our wedding here, but certain circumstances had everything move to the east coast. \n\nOn my first visit here back in 2006, my parents and I learned that Tony brought all his herbs from Greece and transplanted them here. You can taste the difference in the food and realize that this is not your run of the mill Greek restaurant you can find just about anywhere in the US. Tony thought about the texture and taste to each dish on the menu. I believe I have just had about everything on the menu during my 4 year residence there and everything had a unique and distinct taste from the last meal. My Yiayia always used to make me, my brother and my cousins beautiful food and I always would set the standards by her TLC cooking. Tony, does the same. The amount of TLC he puts into his food is unmatchable.\n\nThe decor and atmosphere of the restaurant is beautiful. We also learned on our first visit, that he brought back as much copper and tin items that he could when he immigrated over. The restaurant is beautifully decorated with the items and the white table cloths and walls bring you to the islands of the Agean sea. I could always feel transplated when I would step through the door.\n\nDuring your meal service from the exceptional serving staff, Susan makes the rounds to the each table getting to know everyone on a personal level. Over the four years, we have gotten to know each other as well as we could from those 5 minute conversations, but she is able to recall what we spoke of the last time. That is hard to find these days. Someone that listens.\n\nI wish this place much success and when I am back in Phoenix, I can not wait to give them another visit and feel like I am sitting in Yiayia's kitchen eating the food I grew up loving.\n\nBy the way, ask for a bag of kourabedis before you leave ;).", "business_id": "KLaxBc83JnxyGf7GP7enYA", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-06-27", "type": "review"}

The question should have been answered just by that. The fact that I and anyone in ear shot could hear her was calling undue attention. Whatever the health codes etc are the ADA is VERY CLEAR and this restaurant is this/close to violating that act. \n\n----review and response below.......\nThe restaurant service and food were really good. Everything tasted fine and was presented beautifully. The drawbacks were just minor but they added up...as did the bill. Our waiter was friendly efficient and left us to our devices while we ate after he checked on how we liked things. He did however take a long time to bring the bill. The drawbacks were as follows: We have a service dog and they made a bigger fuss than necessary. We could hear a woman (I am assuming the owner) asking repeatedly if the Maitre d'hotel checked to make certain she was a service dog. He assured her several times, yet she loudly asked him again to verify it. Had the restaurant been crowded it would have been embarrassing enough for me to consider leaving. It is really no one's business besides mine that I have a service animal. Not that I can hide it, but the woman made it seem as though she doubted my disability and or need. The prices were pretty high for what was served. I think 2 people should be able to leave a Greek restaurant for under $60 a person even with wine appetizers desert and coffee. We didn't order the most expensive wine either. Just a Greek Rhoditis. Ultimately I would probably go back but I might try other places first. Being a former Chicago resident a lot of places I go to for Greek food end up being compared to the phenomenal restaurants one finds in Greek Town there. \n\nThe establishment replied to this comment on 06.28.2014:\nWe regret that you felt the response to your dog was \"over the top\" - however, as the Health Dept is adamant about no dogs other than genuine service dogs in a food establishment - it was necessary to determine that the server had the correct information.. Your server was not a maitre d'hotel and as there have been language barriers that resulted in miscommunication in the past it was important to ensure there was no misunderstanding. There were other issues that unfortunately you were not aware of. We have had many, many diners with service dogs and as well, we have had guests who have \"laughingly\" called their pets \"service\" dogs. In the interests of meeting strict health code parameters it is better to err on the side of caution. We are here to provide a healthy environment and will continue to strive to surpass these expectations regarding both the environment and of course the food.

No matter how it happened, I have been all about Greek food the last few days. Following up my delicious gyro feta on Tuesday, I decided to try out Cyprus Grill, right around the corner from my stomping grounds. The place is right next to Trader Joe's, so I am not sure how I missed it before tonight. Walking in, Cyprus has a smallish set-up with hardwood floors and some outside seating (with misters, thankfully). \n\nI was immediately greeted by the hostess/cashier/etc with a huge smile, which always lets me know I made a good choice. With all of the complaints about customer service on Yelp, I would think more restaurants would train their staff right, and Cyprus certainly has do so. From an earlier Yelp review, I knew exactly what I wanted: the Spartan Club (a pita sandwich with grilled chicken, gyro meat, lettuce, tzatziki, feta, and hot sauce) with greek fries. My new friend offered an upsize in fries, but they were bad enough as a side, so I was fine with the normal order. After about 8-10 minutes, I was on my way.\n\nSimply put, the sandwich is fantastic. I love pita bread, and this was soft and tasty, but strong enough so it wasn't breaking with the weight of the sandwich. The chicken was excellent, if not overcooked just a touch, and the gyro meat was as good as any I have had. The tzatziti sauce was lighter than I like, but it and the feta certainly added to the meal. The one issue I had with the sandwich was my own fault. The hot sauce seemed like a strange addition for it, and even though it added a little bite, it eventually overcame the Spartan. Don't get me wrong, it tastes great, but I would probably go without the hot sauce next time.\n\nThe Greek fries were fantastic as well. Sometimes with Greek fries, the lemon overcomes the rest of the meal, but it was a perfect compliment to the melted feta and seasoning.\n\nAll in all, another great Greek meal and well worth the solid price you pay for it.", "business_id": "Rg3INE2p4zQYvfMvJduEOQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-06-24", "type": "review"}

I chose the house dressing -- garlic, lemon, and olive oil -- and it was a great choice -- it was awesome.  This big ass salad comes with pita bread, but I'd get an extra, so you can sop up whatever dressing is left.  \n\nThe service was lovely as well.

I was very hungry and this was quite good, but not memorable.\n\nDessert is where everything goes downhill. The baklava was good, not as moist and flavorful as it should have been. But the Turkish Coffee was a disaster. It wasn't Turkish Coffee: There was no sugar, no cardamom, the coffee was poor quality and so was the water.

Aside from access to light rail the one thing I had been missing most was access to great Mediterranean food.  I'm always game for a good kebab or falafel sandwich.  A coworker mentioned Saba's and I was there just a few days later.\n\nI stopped in after work and picked up dinner for me and the roommate.  The place was busy and almost filled to capacity.  Saba's is one of the places that lacks width but stretches back kind of far.  Looked a bit cramped but I can handle that style of seating for good food.  The waiters brought out plates of flaming dishes and yelled \"OPAH!\" each time.  Not sure if anyone working there was actually Greek but it makes for a good show and adds some to the atmosphere of the place.  My order for two was ready to go in about 5 minutes (not too fast or slow).  I was out the door and headed to home with the fantastic aroma of sheesh kebab sandwich filing my auto.\n\nMy roommate had the Rolled Baba sandwich, a veggie dish made with baba ghannouj.  She liked it a lot but I didn't try it so I'll take her word for it.\n\nI had the lamb sheesh pita.  It was served with an ample portion of delicious meat and they were generous with the veggie toppings and yogurt sauce.  Fantastic sandwich.\n\nThe menu has a fine selection sides, salads, burgers, sandwiches and entrees.  They serve Greek beer and I think they have one from the Middle East as well.  One day, sooner than later, I'll venture back and dine in (even if it's a bit crowded) and take in the atmosphere and a great meal.\n\nSaba's was very impressive all around.  It's on par with my two favorite locations in Tempe.  This place will be getting a lot of my eating out money.  If it wasn't for other favorite kebab locations in New York City, Philadelphia and Toronto that were a tad better I likely would have given Saba's a solid 5 stars.  It was that good.

The place is fairly small and it was packed, we did have to wait a short time for a table, not more than 5 minutes. The hostess was very friendly and welcoming, offered to bring us tea while we waited for our table. I was pleasantly surprised there were many Gluten Free items to choose from. I ordered the Sleepy Gyro Salad and my friend ordered the Chicken Schwarma Pita. We both really enjoyed our lunches. As busy as they were the service did not suffer. And our order came out pretty quickly considering how busy the place was. It didn't let up the entire time we were there either. Our server was nice and attentive. I do want to mention that the small Sleepy Gyro Salad was huge and I had the leftovers for lunch the following day so I would only recommend the larger size if you have an appetite to match. My friend's pita came with fries that I had to taste being a fry fanatic, and they were pretty decent, sprinkled with feta cheese. Mmm cheese. Yeah. I will definitely return.", "business_id": "qXQ3ZBdwI3GlbR5-eYWqNA", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-06-02", "type": "review"}

Only reason we stopped by was because it was the closest and we were short on time . Their fries were good though.

The decor is simple and unpretentious. Then my husband ordered the mint iced tea, I had a sip, and I knew we were in for some thing special. I ordered the chicken shwarma salad. Order the smaller size because the portion sizes are generous. It was so easy to eat healthy. \nThe garlic fries were crispy and addicting. The beef shwarma in a pita kept my partner in crime wordless until he finished it. \nThe service was great. Another table ordered a flaming dish and it was served with flare and OPA!\nIt's so hard to find a good Mediterranean restaurant these days. \nWe have to come back.

My vegetarian sister had a Starter combination with 5 different appetizers, all equally yummy.\nWe were not let down! All was good.
