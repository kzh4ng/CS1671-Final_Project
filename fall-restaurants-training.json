I've eaten here and stopped in for drinks a couple times over the years and I just haven't been super impressed by the place.\n\nThe food has been decent - a few years back I splurged on an enormous fried chicken sandwich and definitely enjoyed it, glutton that I am - but their meals and appetizers alike have admittedly never \"wowed\" me. And while I enjoy their cocktails and would consider stopping in just for drinks more often, the problem is that things are way overpriced here. Even during the happy hour drinks are pretty costly, not to mention that I think most of the drinks I personally like don't qualify for the happy hour discount, which is disappointing. Once I stopped in with friends after a movie and one drink cost me $10 here. Not even a large one, either! Sorry, but I find that to be kind of ridiculous, especially since there's cheaper places to get drinks in the area.\n\nStill, the food and drinks are definitely a-ok albeit overpriced, so this place would be rated 3 stars in my mind IF I could hear myself think when I eat here.

Things turned around for me once I got a car (or made friends with cars), but I was seriously hurting for a while.\n\nTasty was one of the places we found. Back in the day, it was owned and ran by a typical restaurant-owning Chinese family. They had the works - pushy lao ban niang (boss lady), chef slash dad, and, during school off-hours, junior high school daughter manning the cashier. If they were in NYC, they'd only be missing an ami.... a bus boy. The food was pretty good, and if you order in Chinese, the lao ban niang hooked you up with extras because \"your parents teach you good to talk Chineees\". \n\nI'm pretty sure Tasty is under new ownership now. The food isn't as good as it was, but the restaurant still gives off the home-style look and feel. It's a small restaurant with enough seating for about 25-30 patrons. Cheap tables, cheap seats; after all, restaurant extras are just a waste of money. The customers should come back for the food, this *is* a restaurant.\n\nThe new waitress is not friendly, but she gets the job done. The food is still good - so if you're craving a home cooked meal, you'll be somewhat satisfied here. Don't expect grandma's cooking, though. Order the vegetables, the mapo tofu is good, beef/chicken chow fun, etc. They have a lot of other staple items on the menu too. Don't get the salted pork chops - save that craving for Orient Kitchen.

We were treated extremely well from the second we walked in the door.  They even had a menu printed with a \"Happy birthday Jennifer\" message on the top!  What a nice touch.\n\nWe were seated in the area near the door with a view of the kitchen.  There is also a small room (three tables) on the same floor.  The upper floor has a dining area and bar, but they are often booked for private events.\n\nWhen you arrive, there are three accompaniments for your fresh baked bread.  The \"holy oil\" that is an olive oil and banana pepper mix.  It lives up to its name because it was divine.  There was also a goat cheese spread that had red peppers and olives.  I'm a huge goat cheese fan, so I could have eaten this by the spoonful.  There was also a bean and cheese mixture with three types of cheese chopped up.  It was incredible as well.  You may be tempted to fill up on these delictible delights, but don't, becase as good as these items are, it only gets better from there.\n\nWe were having a hard time deciding whether to get the meatball appetizer or the hand pulled mozzarella.  The waitress steered us towards their meatball since it is one of their signature items.  It was a wise decision.  The meatball is the size of a fist and it was perfect.  I don't usually like meatballs or red sauce and I found myself devouring every last bit of both on this plate.  The meatball is stuffed and topped with an excellent mozzarella and then drenched with an amazing red sauce with bits of garlic.  If you order this, make sure you are sharing because it is huge. \n\nThe salad course was very tasty.  It as a mix of field greens, an olive oil dressing, gorgonzola and other incredibly tasty things.  I could have eaten the entire plate of it myself but wanted to save room for the pasta and my entree.\n\nThe pasta course is a house made spiral pasta in a vodka sauce.  It was extremely tasty.  So much so that my husband said he would have been happy if that alone had been his main course.  It had such incredible fresh taste.  \n\nFor our main courses, I got the veal chop prepared in the milanese style.  It was HUGE, pretty much the size of the plate.  A nice surprise considering how small portions tend to be at other fancy restaurants in the area.  It was served with a lemon butter sauce and had large chunks of crab on top.  It was tender and you could cut it with a fork.  I savored every bite (and have leftovers to enjoy at home).  My husband had the filet and loved his choice as well.  A lot of flavors and extremely tender.  It was served with a leek cream and I would love to know how they make it because I have leeks at home that I need to use for something.\n\nI swore I didn't have room left for even a single bite more, but when I learned that pumpkin gelato was the dessert, I had to try it.  It was so smooth, sweet and reminded me of the amazing gelato I had when I was in Italy.  A house made limoncello completed my incredibly amazing meal.\n\nYes, it is expensive, but it is worth it!

Though I liked the different varieties of bread, it was nothing special. The relish and apple butter were a nice touch though.\n\nOur waitress was busy with both waiting tables and tending the bar, but she managed to check on us pretty frequently. Our food also came out relatively promptly. I order the Wiener Schnitzel with Potato Pancakes and Spatzle on the side. The Wiener Schnitzel was amazing -- by far the best I've ever had! The veal was tender and the fried surface was perfectly crispy. However, the sides sadly did not match this main dish. The Potato Pancakes were oddly bitter, and I did not enjoy them with either the sour cream or applesauce. I only ate two or three bites and completely stopped eating them. (I must add that Hofbrauhaus's potato pancakes are delicious and something that I order every time that I go there.) I also did not enjoy the Spatzle, but I am accustomed to eating cheese Spatzle.... So I may be reviewing this harshly since I'm just not used to plain Spatzle, but in my opinion, it was terribly bland and watery.\n\nOverall, Max's Allegheny Tavern served one incredible item (Wiener Schnitzel), but everything else was merely mediocre.

I didn't really know anything existed on Troy Hill aside from Penn Brewery until I went for a ride through the area this past weekend. While passing through I noticed Billy's, it was open, the steeler game was about to start.... Why not check it out?!\n\nThe interior is dated, but clean and has some character. You enter though the bar and the dining room is on your right, this being a Sunday afternoon though, the dining room was not open. No biggie, I'll saddle up to the bar which seats about 12 people. The bartender was very nice, introduced herself and wanted to get to know me. \n\nThis seems like a mostly locals only bar, but they are very happy when people from outside the neighborhood stop in. One thing I heard several times while I was in there was \"Troy Hill is getting better, more people should come here and find out.\"\n\nI tried the soup of the day, chicken and corn chowder, and an order of their wings, $.60 during the Steelers games. Both were very good and made me want to come back to try more of the menu. The beer selection is a bit limited, they mostly stick with the big name domestics, but that being said, the beer is pretty darn cheap. Sam Adams Octoberfest was $2.50 a glass or $12 a pitcher! \n\nI'll certainly be back to Billy's and I think you should go too, turns out there are things on Troy Hill!", "business_id": "6AnorAMPkTdSDbUkOoV1Rw", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-10-14", "type": "review"}

What I heard was true after dining here- food is really good, service leaves a lot to be desired. Two of us were the first to arrive for a party of six. We waited a good 10 minutes at the \"please wait to be seated sign\". No one even acknowledged us standing there until two other members of our party finally arrived. They were semi busy but cleared out quickly since it was a 4:25 steelers game and several tables there looked like they were heading to the game. Anyways, a server came over about 5 minutes after we were sat. To get our drink order. She was pretty slow getting our drinks out to us. The other two members of our party arrived by then and when she came back she said the kitchen was running 30 minutes behind and we should order appetizers now if we wanted any. Ok so we ordered 6 old bay wings, 12 thai chili wings, and 2 orders of the cheese sticks. The cheese sticks were the best cheese sticks I have ever eaten! They are huge-3 to an order but these are so thick and gooey....and the marinara served with them is a sweeter marinara, it's very good. I didn't try the old bay wings but they were quickly devoured by the rest of the table. The Thai chili wings had a very nice sweeter flavor. And they were large wings too. Very tasty. She came to take our food order prior to our appetizers coming out. They did take awhile but she did warn us they were slow. Entrees came out quickly however. I had ordered the BBQ pulled pork sandwich. It had a horseradish BBQ sauce that sounded really interesting. The server came over halfway through the appetizers and said they ran out of the pulled pork. I was disappointed but I ordered a turkey Rachael with sweet potato waffle fries instead. The sandwich came on marble rye with coleslaw Swiss and thousand island. The fries weren't great and we're kind of soggy. The sandwich though was excellent. Real rotisserie turkey and lots of cold slaw which is how I like it. A steak and egg hoagie was ordered with chips-she said it was really good and it was huge portion wise. Another ordered the pastrami sandwich and another ordered the pastrami salmon blt. Both were said to be tasty. The quesadilla burger and the bacon and blue cheese burger were also ordered and were quickly eaten and said to be delicious . 4 of us took home half of our sandwiches - portions are huge! Our server didn't check on us and it was us who had to flag he down for drinks. This is a great place to watch a game, lots of beers on tap, good food.

I'm going to go ahead and play my \"I Waited on Tables in High Volume Restaurants for Several Years\" card just so I can say that even during lunch rush, no, that level of absence is not acceptable. They take up to fifteen minutes to even greet the table, which leaves you looking around wondering who will be serving you, or if you can at least have a water. If I were serving, I'd at least pop over and say a quick, \"Hi, my name's Ali. I'll be with you in just a few minutes.\" No matter how busy you are, there are a few things you just don't let slip: greetings, drink refills, and a speedy check. If it's busy, communicate that delay by saying \"thank you for waiting,\" or \"sorry for the wait.\" Honestly that's all it takes. That's it! Primanti's servers were lacking in all of these things, and from the customer perspective, it really does make a difference in the experience.

Frankly they take these ready-made empanadas and microwave them before serving them to the customer, so i don't understand why they coudln't have just gotten some more from the huge mound of empanadas i saw in the store just minutes before. but i was too lazy to ask. also, they microwave the empanadas on styrofoam plates....no comment.\n\nthe 1 taco for $3/ 2 tacos for $5 was probably the best deal that I could find in pittsburgh for some close to authentic mexican tacos as i coudl find.  They indeed pack your taco with a lot of the fixings, but in doing so, they don't realize that all the juicyness that comes from the meat (especially the lengua) causes the little corn tortilla to rip very easily.  i have not been any other mexican joint that serves these style tacos with only one little corn tortilla: they're always made with two corn tortillas with the presumed purpose of protecting rippage.  one star off for that.  The salsa on the side that was left out that was the perfect consistency of the type of salsa i like (non chunky) was somehow too dry.  this may have been due to lack of freshness.  if only it were fresher, it would have been a nice complement to my tacos. on the upside, they prepare the meat from scratch, putting a little blot of uncooked meat on their grill, while they prepare it in front of your eyes. that was a welcome difference for this joint compared to other taco joints.\n\nall in all, compared to the other place in pittsburgh i've tried for tacos (Mexico City), I'd much rather come here.  closer, cheaper, and tastier. mexico city does not do mexican food justice.", "business_id": "buVALudg30kgkDusqB3yJw", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-10-17", "type": "review"}

Best thing is that most combinations or menu items will only run you at about $8-10, with tip and tax about $13. Pretty awesome.

It truly is a throwback to what I imagine old neighborhood bars were like where yes, everybody did know your name and you always left with a smile on your face.

Well, as alluded to above, the quaint neighborhood feel of the restaurant itself goes a long way and its impact cannot really be done justice by words--you just have to go there! The staff is welcoming and friendly, and you most certainly are made to feel like a regular (even if you are not like this guy). The few times that I've been here, the tavern is always filled with jovial conversations, laughter, and a real community feeling. \n\nThe food is typical American pub food fare but done extremely well. I've never been disappointed with anything that I've ordered here, nor has anyone that I've come to Al Michael's with. In terms of starters, the spicy crab soup is excellent and the black bean hummus also hits the spot. For your main grub, the ruben, half pound burger, London broil, and quinoa black bean vegetable burger (did I mention they have a surprising number of healthier options?) are staples when we go. The side dish options also bring the goods with choices such as fries, Cajun fries, spicy black beans, or a big ol' baked potato (this option probably gives you the best bang for your buck!). \n\nRight now your taste buds are most likely waking up but you're concerned about what you're going to wash all that delicious food down with. Well, stop your fretting because this spot has a rotating line-up of high quality draft beers with a huge emphasis on North Carolina beers and an even greater emphasis on Charlotte specific brews.

I was planning to catch a movie at the Epicenter and wanted some grup nearby.  It was a toss-up between Hooters and Champions and since I'd never been to Champions I decided to give it a try......\n\nWhen I first entered the place I stood by the hostess booth for about 5 minutes and nobody came to greet me or show me to a table...... or anything.  Then, some more patrons arrived and were waiting in line behind me.  This is when a waitress who was taking orders at a nearby table told is we could sit wherever we wanted so I decided to sit downstairs since the upstairs was crowded with kids.  So I make my way downstairs and sit a a table for about 5 minutes and no one notices I'm there.......  So I make my way over to the other side of the room and sit at a booth literally 3 feet from the bar and no one notices me........  The guy that was waiting on the booths was busy watching a college football game with some patrons..... So I get up and sit at the bar where the bartender quickly got my drink and took my order.  I got the classic burger with bacon, lettuce and tomato along with a side of fries.\n\nThe food came out fairly quickly.  The burger was very good!!  And so were the fries.  I really have no regrets about the food or the bartender, but the place is kind of dark and relaly is a '90s relic, I mean, they have a mural of LJ with David Robinson and BJ Armstrong among others.......  I understand having LJ on there but Robinson?  BJ?  Shouldn't Kemba and Big Al be on there?\n\nOh well, I thought the bill was fair.  I think it was $10 and change for a very good burger and fries with a pepsi and refill.\n\nI might visit again if I'm in the area and want a good burger, but I'd also like to see what else is out here.\n\nHappy Yelping!!", "business_id": "vIXUw1cLG84-m8LzOg3f-w", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-10-11", "type": "review"}

However, while I have found that perfect BBQ joint I dreamed of, I had not yet happened across the quintessential place for good ol' Southern cooking...in particular fried chicken. Well, that is now a thing of the past, for I have found Merts.\n\nYou could tell just from walking inside that it was going to be a great Southern food experience. The interior of the restaurant is colorful and eye-catching, and the art and decor screams Southern. The interior was full to capacity, but we were able to snag a table outside. The outdoor area is a mixed bag. While it's nowhere near as crowded as inside (with only four tables or so) the Charlotte pedestrians take it upon themselves to walk through the outdoor area. It was a bit disruptive to be eating a nice meal while people constantly walked right against your table. \n\nI wasn't a fan of the beer list since Merts does not carry any drafts, so I stuck with unsweet tea. After placing our orders the server came over with a small loaf of cornbread for each of us. This cornbread was spot on for me! Not gritty, a little sweet and extremely crumbly. You could tell it was fresh from the oven, and that made it super awesome!\n\nFor dinner I ordered the beef ribs and leg quarter fried chicken combo. I wasn't crazy about the ribs themselves, as they were a bit tough and chunks of bone kept flaking off. I did enjoy the sauce, as it was a sweet and tangy sauce and not vinegary. Now the chicken was THE BOMB! I've been searching for fried chicken down here, and have been disappointed time and again. So far I am confident to say that Merts has the best fried chicken (though I haven't made it over to Price's yet, so don't jump on me for that yet.) The battered skin was light and crisp, and not greasy. The interior was that moist and juicy you expect from fried chicken. I was in heaven scoffing that chicken down, and I wish I had more right now! \n\nThe miss' ordered the catfish and fried chicken breast combo, and that was also pretty dang awesome. The catfish was a huge filet just plopped on the plate. The meat came right off and was so light and tasty. The batter was also perfect, with not too much that didn't take away from the soft flavor of the fish. They serve it with this spicy sauce that was a good compliment to the fish. The chicken breast was just as good as my leg. Even the white meat stayed juicy and tender! The miss' didn't eat too much of it after filling up on the fish, so there are plenty of chicken leftovers in my future!\n\nThe other thing that Merts does damn good is sides. One problem I've had at BBQ and other places down here is that the meats are perfect, yet the sides are extremely lacking. Merts has some of the best dang sides money can buy. We both ordered the mac & cheese and it was simply the best I've had down here. Some places I've been to make it watery or oily or just not flavored right, but Merts had it all. It was a firm consistency with a great cheesy flavor, and the cheese crust on top was awesome. I also tried black eyed peas for the first time and loved them. They were cooked perfectly and were served in this kind of gravy that was also tasty. The miss' ordered the collard greens and I have to say that I liked those too. I'm generally not a fan of collards as they are bitter, but these were cooked in such a way that the bitterness was taken down a notch or two. They had some citrus flavoring to them that helped tone it down and added a different level of flavor to. All in all, the sides kicked butt! Unfortunately we were so stuffed from this massive meal that we did not stick around for dessert.\n\nI have to say, when I think home cooked Southern fare, I will always associate it with Merts. They can fry up some mean chicken and fish, and their sides and veggies are top notch. It's a busy place but it is definitely worth the trip.", "business_id": "mpDxBBGywUE6GRRKja3sBA", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-10-06", "type": "review"}

The chicken wings were just okay, and the cabbage and rice didn't have enough seasoning for my tastes. \n\nBut this last visit was much better. \n\n\nWe started with the Soul Rolls which come stuffed with chicken, rice, greens and black eye peas. They come topped with a spicy honey mustard sauce and were very good. They were crispy and packed with the filling. I'd recommend them. They also bring out some cornbread and that was definitely a highlight for me! It was warm and with some butter....it practically melts in your mouth. \n\nFor my meal I had the pork chops, macaroni and cheese and mashed potatoes. I was impressed with the amount of food you get!

However more modern interpretations like Houston's/Hillstone or J.Alexander's score higher and feel better. \n\nThe service was knowledgeable, but rushed, and not attentive.Not bad in any way but not what I would expect from a place that seems so polished, pretentious and more importantly so expensive. Lets just say I have had much better service for half the price... ( recently Acme in Chapel Hill but I have yet to get to that review)\n\nFood ... OK $40 an entree  ala carte, $10 sides, those are NYC, LA, SF  prices. I expect it to be of comparable quality......

In fairness I understand this happens occasionally and it and the dessert were comped, however I see a trend of sloppiness with the food that should not be happening at this price point.\n\nGrilled Asparagus ($10) it was ok ... but just ok. \n\nDessert creme brule, ......nothing special...  thin  not very crisp carmel, made worse by too many wet berries, and a strawberry fan garnish which even in the darkly lit dining room (as opposed to the kitchen) I could see was past its prime.\n\nit was a $50 dinner for more than $150, so I think that \n\n\"Meh.

When we finally ordered and got our food, the quantity and price looked okay, but the quality was seriously lacking. The duck in the duck spring roll seemed to be prepared well, but there were none of the other subtle ingredients and flavors that one would expect - no rice noodles, carrots, mint, basil, ect. - just iceberg lettuce and cucumber! And the dipping sauce was overly thick, way too sweet and tasted like something that came out of a jar. The wonton soup broth was bland and oily, and the wontons were okay but tasted like something I could get out of a box from the frozen section of a store. The pineapple fried rice was okay, but didn't have as much chicken or pineapple as we would have expected, the chicken was a bit dry and again - none of the subtle flavors that we're used to in this dish that make it so tasty - cilantro, raisins, cashews, ect. The beef rendeng was terrible - a pile of beef bits in a disgusting looking sauce with a side of unseasoned brocoli and cold canned pineapple. The sauce actually had a decent flavor, but it looked so unappetizing and the beef was so dry that I sent it back.

Their menu is timeless as is their history in the South park area.  Yes but try telling that to the hostess who greets you by chewing gum and texting on her phone.   Yeah, I get it, sometimes you just got to get your tweet on, I agree, OMG LOL, I can't believe this guy who just came in here to get his to go order, #LMFAO.   Now don't be discouraged to dine in and sit in the bar area, where if you truly want to feel disconnected from your date, then the touch screen monitors are perfect, for you or the hostess.  After all who sits and talks with each other at dinner any more? The food is on par with an Americana type mid level restaurant, however the service leaves a bit to be desired.  When my salad came with a dried up crusted chicken breast on it and no dressing, I called to speak to a manager, but they were busy. Apparently a Tuesday night is busy for the manager (not the hostess).  The veggie burger tastes like cardboard, although the bun gives it a sort of layered cardboard effect which is not bad, if you're washing it down with tequila.  The filet even if ordered med. rare, comes out med. edible, and asking the wait staff for a refill is like asking the DMV for an estimated wait time; you're probably not going to get what you're looking for.   This is particularly sad because I used to love this restaurant, but even with prepubescent couples or online match dates who sit in the bar area to have the touch screen monitors mediate their awkward conversations,  it's still probably not the right fit.   The ribs are good, but the sides aren't.  If I was going to take anybody here, it would have to be my next door neighbor who lets their dog crap all over my lawn and never picks it up, or my grandfather who doesn't have any taste buds left and isn't bothered by slow service, because it takes him two hours to finish a bowl of soup anyway.

The crust was awful, and had the tell-tale pattern of a machine-made pastry.\nReally?!\nI am disappointed that a high-end steakhouse does not have a pastry chef.  I left The Palm in L.A. with a piece of carrot cake that was worth fighting over (or at least arm wrestling).  \nYou are not getting out of The Palm for less than $75 per person.

Not only did my belt \"adjust\" on its own, but hubs and I took home a combined box of leftovers that fed us for a few meals afterwards, too!\n\nI was craving hibachi like crazy, so we drove on up to the University area to score some tasty Japanese grill cookin'. Nakato is a pretty standard looking Japanese hibachi grill but also expect super high ceilings in the foyer/bar area and expansive rooms with the traditional grills. Both our server and our chef were very friendly but no overly so. Hubs and I still had enough quiet time to chat or just watch our chef flip and twist the shrimp & rice in peace. \n\nSo, where does Nakato really shine? Through the boatload of food that they dole out. It's almost ridiculous. My shrimp & chicken hibachi combo ($18.25) came with: Nakato onion soup, salad with ginger dressing, shrimp appetizer (literally two chopped up shrimp), a bowl full of rice (I paid $1.75 for the Hibachi fried rice), a hearty helping of noodles, grilled vegetables, shrimp and chicken. ZOMG. All of the food was truly tasty, especially when you added a bit of the \"yummy\" sauce that the chef provided. It.Was.So.Much.Food. I think my favorite was the shrimp, veggies and noodles. Nom. \n\nMy only mini gripe about Nakato is the flavor - I would have liked to have a little more heat or spice in my meal, but otherwise it was exactly what I was looking for.

Most days the food is tasty if unimaginative, they can accommodate groups, and they usually can get you in and out pretty quick despite the lobby being packed to the gills on weekend mornings. \n\nFor the last few years I've avoided Perkins on the whole because of sub-par food and service from another location (an annual stop after a camping music festival due to their being open on holidays and ability to seat 10-12 of us with no reservation), but my man friend really likes their breakfast and, more specifically, not having to wait for breakfast like you do at most places downtown. Over the summer I had an avocado/queso/english muffin creation that actually really surprised me with how good it was and breakfast potatoes that were clearly deep fried but similarly surprising in how much I enjoyed them. The breakfast combo price was right ($8ish dollars), and for some reason one of the available sides was a muffin, so I came away with breakfast the next day, too. \n\nFast forward to a couple weeks ago when we stopped back in. Sadly, my breakfast find had disappeared from the menu and they appear to have done away with the bonkers muffin side. Nothing was really striking my fancy on the most recent menu, so I decided to pick one of the most ridiculous offerings, an apple cinnamon muffin that was sliced into thirds and turned into french toast. I'm sure it was terrible for me, and while the flavor was surprisingly good, muffins just aren't stable enough to hold up to being battered and so it was kind of mushy mess. Compounding my meh meal was the fact that it took close to 40 minutes for our food to arrive, tracking down our server was difficult, and my appetite was put off by how dirty the ledge under our booth was. We were seated in one of their tiny (but cool) two-person booths along the window and with the morning sun pouring in I could see all the crumbs, bits of paper, and rusty bobby pins on the window sill. If anyone from Perkins happens to read this, please, please clean that up. The fact that the pins were rusty tells me it's been awhile since a vacuum has made its way to that area. Yuck. \n\nWhile my most recent visit was definitely a two-star experience, they've been just fine on other visits so I'll leave my overall rating at a three.

It's sort of scaled-up-diner-food-meets-comfort-food, then add a fair share healthy options.  And great prices.  And great service.  Although it's not on Willy St. it still has the same friendly neighborhood atmosphere.  \n\nSo I've been to Monty's twice, both times late morning, and was seated and served quickly.  The first visit a friend and I split the spinach and feta omelet which was great and large enough for both of us, and a third friend had the salmon hash.  After our meal Monty himself (well, not sure if it was the Real Monty, so lets say the chef) came out to ask us how our meal was.  The second visit I went with a lunch item and ordered chicken fried steak, also great and the portions were easily enough for two people.  Once again Monty came out and greeted his diners!  Ordered a piece of Fat Elvis cake to go, which is banana cake layered with peanut butter fudge icing and topped with chocolate icing.

It took me almost 5 months to get here which is kind of unfortunate, because it is GREAT!\n\nThe first thing I was told about Monty's was that it is like an upscale diner that serves vegan and vegetarian food.  This is kind of true, because it is a diner, it is nice inside and not super divey and you can order lots of dishes as vegan, vegetarian, or gluten-free.  However, I would definitely not describe Monty's as a vegan/vegetarian restaurant because half of the items contain eggs or bacon, as any good diner should.\n\nThe first time I went I ordered blueberry pancakes, the short stack, and a simple glass or orange juice.  I passed on the free bottomless cup of coffee that you get when you check in because I had already had my coffee for the day.  The pancakes were good, nothing fancy, but solid.  Two was plenty for me as they were a large-ish size.\n\nSecond time I ordered the Monty's breakfast sandwich which had bacon, avocado, fried egg, herbed goat cheese, and something leafy I think on cheddar jalepeno bread.  It was served with their American potatoes which remind me of the potatoes I got at Grampas brunch.  The sandwich was tasty, though I was disappointed a little by the bread as it didn't have much jalepeno or cheddar flavor and mostly tasted like toasted white bread.\n\nThird visit I went with the Blue Plate Special Omelet that had bacon, avocado, and cheddar inside with salsa on top served with American potatoes and a biscuit.  I also finally got one of their mimosas that are very popular among Saturday brunch goers.  The omelet was really tasty, only needed a little salt and pepper on top and as always, the potatoes were awesome.  I also had an outstanding biscuit, warm, moist, flaky and crumbly at the same time with a nice crust on top.  Nomnomnom.  \n\nOverall Monty's is an excellent choice with solid diner food, friendly service and fairly reasonable prices.

Chevys was just down the street, so we decided kick off our weekend of constant food and alcohol consumption by getting some drinks at the bar.  At 5 pm on a Friday night, the place was amusingly empty, with the occasional random quiet man alone at the bar drinking margaritas (awkward) and a couple other tables of folks in Illini gear (and Steelers gear, for some odd reason.  They followed me here?)\n\nWe saw that on Fridays they have a $4 frozen strawberry margarita special.  That deal was calling our name, so we each got one.  They were all right - good texture, decent taste, we got a little buzzed, but nothing special.  The chips and salsa, however, were totally blargh!  Watery salsa, weirdly textured chips - like, the chips were really weak and flimsy, not the good sturdy tortilla chips that can hold up to good salsa.  They weren't even worth eating.  Also, the bartender was visibly perturbed when we asked for the check.  Sorry, but we had dinner plans at Papa Del's, and didn't want to spoil our appetite!\n\n....why go here when you could drive a mile and go to Dos Reales?", "business_id": "WgmAx4SWy-71daxakDNd1g", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-10-05", "type": "review"}

Him more so than me. He's actually called me at 12:30 at night, from a bar, talking about how he wants Indian Food. It's as though he can already feel the hangover coming on and wants to make sure his priorities are in check. 1) Get home (or wherever) safely 2) Indian Food. I may have mixed up the order.\n\nThis Indian Delhi Palace is apparently under the same ownership as the Tempe location, but I like this one much better. For several reasons:\n\n1) The Chicken Tikka Masala is AMAZING. Like, I've never had buffet food this good before. I don't really like Tandoori Chicken. Honestly, the color kind of freaks me out. I know it's from the sauce or whatever, but chicken, on the bone, with a kind of fluorescent pink glow is weird. I'll pass. But boneless chicken in a delightful red curry sauce? Don't mind if I DO!\n\n2) This location has a much larger variety of dishes, especially vegetarian dishes, which are usually my favorite offerings at an Indian lunch buffet (see above about tandoori chicken freaking me out).\n\n3) Um, hello? It looks like a freaking palace. These guys did not hold back and I freaking love them for it. I actually think more places offering a lunch buffet should treat its patrons like the hungover royalty that we are. I wouldn't mind if Souper Salad and Sweet Tomato hopped on this trend already. I mean, how hard can it be to add a few fancy door arches and some gold plated silverware? Not that hard really. Up your game, guys.\n\nHowever, the only complaint I have about Indian Delhi Palace, and the primary reason why Flavors of India remains my favorite Indian Lunch Buffet has to do with the atmosphere. Yes, I appreciate the super sexy high-class water goblets, but Delhi Palace doesn't have any booths. And when I'm hungover, I need a freaking booth. I need my own little eating sofa. I need to be able to kick off my flip flops under the table and sprawl out like I'm enjoying their delicious naan on my own little loveseat. That's what I need, and that's what Flavors of India gives me.

I have been in Phoenix for over a month now and have not eaten any GOOD Mexican food!  I was craving some tacos so I decided to try this spot out.  I was glad I drove down!\n\nI walked in and was told to sit wherever I wanted.  I grabbed a table and a nice lady came over to take my drink order and deliver some chips and salsa.  I placed my order for 2 beef tacos and a cheese quesadilla with green chiles in it.  I had a large Diet Coke to drink.  Here is how the food was...............\n\nChips and Salsa-  They bring you out a large basket of chips and a little thing of salsa.  I took a bite of a chip and had a flashback.  They reminded me of something.....I took another bite and then it hit me.  These chips tasted exactly like the chips at El Tarasco in Manhattan Beach.  That is definitely a good thing.  El Tarasco serves up whole fried tortillas.  Juans cuts them into chips but the taste was identical.  I was impressed!  The salsa was tasty too.  It was pretty mild and refreshing.  The chips were so good that I ate 2 baskets full!\n\nBeef Tacos-  I got 2 of these bad boys.  They are a bit small but they were awesome.  These also reminded me of somewhere from back home.......Titos Tacos!  Similar taste, texture and size.  Titos uses more cheese,  but other than that, they were pretty similar (Titos are a bit better but hey...Titos makes the best hard shell beef taco ever...no shame in never being as good as Titos).  The shredded beef was seasoned well, the shells were perfectly crispy. I would have liked a bit more cheese, but it was still enough the way they came out.  It was a fantastic beef taco!\n\nQuesadilla with Chiles-  When I bit into this, it ALSO reminded me of somewhere from CA....... Sombreros!  I would always get a beef taco and quesadilla combo at Sombreros.  This quesadilla was an exact replica!  It had nicely melted cheese, tons of green chiles and it was folded up into a nice flour tortilla.  I dipped this in the salsa and it was a winner!\n\nDiet Coke-  Nice to see they serve Coke products.\n\nTotal for my meal was $11.12.  Not too shabby for a grip of food.  I ate 3 different things and each one reminded me of some of my favorite Mexican food places from back in CA.  You simply cannot beat that!  Service was very friendly and it felt like you were eating in someones house kind of.  I can't wait to go back to try out some of their other offerings.  I can see this place becoming our families go to Mexican joint.  It's a bit of a drive from where I live (its way closer to work), but I was very impressed and will be back soon.

My friend and I were going there about once a month for a year and a half while we were in school. I had never been here so she introduced me. I have now been there several times and this is my favorite of the locations. The tasters I've tried are the toasted ravioli espaniol, boom dip, guaca tony, and Lawrence's stuffed mushrooms.  The ravioli is divine with a nice kick in the cheese and the marinara is my favorite of all of the the marinaras I have tasted.  The boom dip is rich and creamy and the chips are actually a thin crust pizza with cheese on top, there are no words to describe how absolutely wonderful it is.  The guaca tony has the same thin crust pizza to smear guac on and from what I hear the guac is phenomenal, stupid allergies prohibit me tasting.  The stuffed mushrooms are more of a meal than a taster and are a lot meatier than I had imagined but was rich and delicious.  If you get tasters just know that they are huge and that if you plan on dessert it is important to have plenty of people to share with unless you plan on not eating lunch/dinner. \nIn regards to the wings my husband has thoroughly enjoyed the wings of fire and says that they are a different kind of hot more black pepper than hot sauce hot.  He says that they were surprising but that they were a good change.  \nThe salads are like everything else on the menu huge and a little different.  The Julius Caesar has a dressing that is Caesar with a little bit of a different kick.  I normally ask for extra dressing but there was flavor in every bite.  When you add chicken it is finally sliced and you can never get a bite without the chicken, I usually share this with my daughter because it is just to big for one person.  My husband has said that the big beefstro and the antipasto thing are both the best salads he has ever had.  This is high praise since he tends to not like going out.  Every time we have gone out since he compares every salad he comes in contact with the salads from Oregano's and so his taste for other salads has become ruined.  My father-in-law says that the southwestern shrimp caesar is better than he ever imagined.  The shrimp was so tasty that even I liked it and my daughter started trying to steal salad.  \nWe have tried two of the sandwiches sort of on accident.  The Italian stuffed and the fresh grilled Italian sausage.  My mother-in-law meant to order the fresh grilled Italian sausage but accidentally said the Italian stuffed and when it came out she said it was delicious but that she wanted the sausage and mentioned it to the waitress.  The waitress reordered the sausage sandwich and wrapped it up for her to take home and didn't even charge us for it.  I think this really says something about the level of customer service that I have seen every time we go.  We all tasted both and my mother-in-law who is rarely impressed has suggested this place numerous times based on this, oh and dessert. \nThe pizzas are great. I normally don't like the thin crust but feel that they pack a lot in. I read in a review that the Aunt Margarita had no flavor which I thought was odd. It definitely isn't as greasy as some of the pizzas but it has some darn good flavor. The tomatoes are always done just right to give you that juicy tomato quality.\nMy daughter always gets the pasta with the pesto sauce.  She loves the pesto and enjoys the pesto penne bake.  I truly love the ziti since it is flavorful and huge enough for three meals.  I don't really like their Alfredo the dark but it isn't the worst alfredo that I have had.  \nFor dessert I have only ever had their pizza cookie and don't see any reason to change this in the future.  I have had pizza cookie at many places but non that are even close to as yummy as the ones her at Oregano's.  \nYou will definitely find me at an Oregano's again soon.", "business_id": "ML1RJdeZ7bbfMrHvJ7m99A", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-11-06", "type": "review"}

We called to make a reservation and when we came in we were seated without menus. Now working in restaurants this is almost un-heard of but like I said we were hungry...\n\nThe waiter came over and asked if we would like something to drink (A little rudely) but like I keep saying we were hungry. Since we didn't have any menus including a wine menu, we asked the waiter to see some menus. He proceeded to only bring a wine menu...\n\nAfter we made are choice we laid the menu down in clear vision of the waiter (A definite sign to come back to the table.) He then proceeded to take the other tables' orders. (Perfectly fine). Oh and they had both food and drink menus as this comes back later in the story.\n\nWe waited for a solid 10 min before trying to flag down the waiter....NOTHING. We decided to try to flag him down and he was having none of it. We then got up from the table and left! Walking right passed the so called manager (Older lady with short brown hair) she told us to have a good night as if we just had a great dinner.....\n\nWe were so hungry we needed to go somewhere else!! On the way to a much nicer and hospitable establishment. I called Cristo's and asked to speak to the manager. The lady who told us to have a good night answered and told us she was the head manager and then proceeded to tell us that not giving people who sit down at a restaurant menus unless they ask...

It was very slow and yet it took forever for our server to come to our table. The decor was a throwback to the 80's, and probably that was when it was done and never updated. The menus came with dried up food on mine. They eventually came and brought us typical chips and awful salsa. It was served in q maple syrup dispenser and had the consistency of tomato paste. You couldn't pour it so you had to remove the top and scoop it out with a spoon. It tasted a little like flavored tomato paste as well. When our server came by we asked for a drink menu and he pointed to his head, as if to say all we needed to do is ask and he would recite it to us from memory. We asked what is good here and he grinned and said \"margaritas\", to which we asked what kind. He began to recite flavored, and we said we wanted a top-shelf, he really didn't know what we were talking about so we ordered the non-flavored with salt on the rocks. It came out and was perhaps one of the most typical standard margarita mixed drinks with very little tequila. We mistakingly at that pint decided to stay and ordered a combination plate, split. They split it, but instead of splitting both items they gave my wife one and me one and only one set of utensils. He asked what kind of sauce, we said green but on the side. The green sauce came later when we were ready to leave. The food was really diner fare and while not awful, not something to write home about. We chose not to finish and instead took our check to the counter and paid with Apple Pay, which was the only redeeming part of the visit.

We pretty much O.D.'ed on the place.  Yeah, it's that good.  What some might call, \"A heart attack on a plate\", I call \"Redneck Paradise\" (minus the boots, Bermuda shorts, wife beater tee, and cowboy hat, of course).  Texaz grill serves the best Chicken Fried Steak and Chicken Fried Chicken I've ever had.  Be forewarned though.  If you come, bring your appetite.  If you leave Texaz hungry, it's your own fault.  \n\nThe portion sizes are more than generous; I think \"Obscene\" is more accurate.  The mashed potatoes are mashed with the skins on and smothered in thick white gravy, as was my chicken.  The corn niblets are nice and buttery and the chicken was nice and crispy.  My co-workers had the chicken fried steak and the steak was larger than the plate.  You also get a biscuit, although I'd prefer a roll, I just forgot to ask.\n\nThe Chicken Fried Steak and Chicken were both $7.00 and the Iced Tea was $2.00.  I feel it's a pretty fair deal for lunch.  The Texas and Arizona memorabilia that adorn the walls and ceiling are fitting for this place.  I remember when you could smoke in restaurants and it was very smokey too.  I'm so glad the smoking ban passed.  I've heard the place can get busy for lunch, so we went early and didn't have any problems finding parking and we were seated right away and served promptly.

Spoke with Sheldon beforehand to reserve the private dining room for \"20-25\" people.  After some hesitation on his part, he agreed to not requiring a set menu, and I agreed that my party would be patient with the service (which did not end up being a problem at all).  He also did not require a deposit, which was fantastic.\n\nI got there later than I wanted to, as I wanted to arrive a little before my reservation, but I got there exactly at 7:00 p.m.  After saying hello to some friends who had already arrived and were waiting in the bar, our table in the private dining room was ready after just a few moments.  We went in and began sitting down - the private dining room is off to the side of the restaurant (beyond the bar area) and was great for our party of 20.  There is a men's and women's restroom at the end of the dining room which was great as well, and the tables were organized well enough that it felt like we were eating at a single grand dining table.\n\nService was very good, especially considering the amount of people we had and that they were willing to do separate checks.  After getting our drinks ordered and delivered (which took about half an hour), we ordered. \n\nFor appetizers, the table had the hummus, but a few others ordered the green chile queso (very unique and good), the fried eggplant bites (I was hesitant about the goat cheese as I'm not a big fan, but there is not that much and it just enhance the flavors of the whole dish, which was good), and the bacon-wrapped shrimp (YUM).  All of it was good.\n\nPersonally, I also had a cup of the black bean soup (very good, especially if you cannot get enough black beans like myself).  My entree was the surf n' turf pasta, which was really flavorful.  You get two shrimps, which were decent sized, and two medallions of beef, which were cooked well but not overdone.  The fettucine was not al dente but still had a good texture, and the sauce was not buttery/overwhelming.  Everything felt/tasted complimentary, which was a good thing!\n\nWe finished things off with their version of chocolate cake, and they had a pumpkin cheesecake which was interesting, but I would have preferred regular cheesecake.  \n\nAnyways, I wanted to thank the staff here for a great birthday dinner.  Everything tasted great, the service was good and prompt (I don't believe there was a single issue, which is amazing considering they had 20 people all ordering something totally different, without a set menu), and we all had a great time.  We got started a little after 7:00, and we were done a little before 9:40 (from what I can remember).  For 20 people all ordering drinks and food, that was some efficient service!\n\nI would definitely recommend PCG for a big dining party.  They were courteous, professional, and accomodating.

From the prices he charges to the way he pushes the higher priced menu items, you can tell he is a sucker for the bottom line.\n\nI admit I am one of those people who is all into going to places featured on TV, especially DDD so this place was on my list.

If you do sit at the front patio you will hear the traffic along Indian School Road especially during the midweek rush hour. There is definitely better French cuisine in town, but if you want a little French place that is centrally located, Sophie's is decent selection.", "business_id": "PuHucejs4LG3hSXnrwi9-g", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-11-03", "type": "review"}

Everything is A la carte, but the portions are huge.  Don't feel embarrassed about splitting a side - they won't look at you with disapproval.\n\nYou don't always get what you pay for, but at Ruth's - you do.  I would contrast it with Morton's where I had to pay $150 (for two) and had the second worst experience of my life (see Michelangelo's-Tucson for worst).\n\nI've dined in several Ruth's and all three were extremely consistent.  I'd like to tell you what the menu has to offer, but I don't have much of a clue, because...\n\nIT'S ALL ABOUT THAT FILET BABY !!   (med-rare please)\n\nHands down the best filet I've ever had.  They sear those things at extremely high temperatures in what has got to be an entire stick of butter.  Add salt and pepper and that's all she wrote.  You don't really need a knife for it - yep...it's that tender.  Pay attention to your servant regarding plate temps.  These things come to you IMMEDIATELY after being placed on a plate taken from a small furnace.  You WILL get burned if you attempt to touch the plate early on.  Aside from the fun sizzle factor, it keeps that gorgeous hunk of beef warm till the last tasty bite.\n\nI do get the lettuce wedge on the side.  Picture an entire half of a nicely pruned AAAAA head of iceberg lettuce covered in bacon/bleu cheese crumbles.  Cover this in a side of bleu cheese dressing (what else?)...and you'll have the picture.  If it were any crispier, it would shatter.  As opposed to the filet, you will need both knife and fork to cut this; I defy you to find any blemishes in it.\n\nI discovered creme-brulee at a Ruths.  We had some Cabernet left and were feeling like some sugar might be a nice accent.  Geez, I don't think they do much of anything mediocre.  I've never had a finer Creme...and I've been trying hard.\n\nYou will NOT be disappointed at Ruth's - but don't forget your wallet.", "business_id": "iDoigI3605ixHl_qHly3Tg", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-11-04", "type": "review"}

Even though I am a thorough carbivore, it was a bit too much bread for my pref and I tend to like less dense bread for my bruschetta. Nonetheless a great deal for $14!\n\n2. Autostrada Panini - I am not one to pass up on any meat, on meat, on meat, on meat action (yes, 4 types of salty cured pig parts...especially in regards to the Soppressata, LOL!)! And the spicy pepper relish was a nice added zing to bring together all that goodness. LOL!!\n\n3. Bella Postino (warm artichoke dip and white bean hummus with assorted MJ breads) - Probably...no...definitely could have done without this given the amount of food we already ordered but still a good staple to order if you're here with more than 2 people! Haha!\n\nAnd then on to the best part! They have a great happy hour where their wine by the glass and PITCHERS of beer are just $5!! Loved that there were so many options! You seldom see that here in San Francisco. So it was quite glorious! There was definitely some remorse that I stuffed myself so much I didn't have more capacity to fully take advantage of it! \n\nSD also introduced me to a locally produced beer, I believe it was the HopShock? Pretty freaking delicious!\n\nGood food/booze and wonderful company certainly made this a very memorable meal! If I ever find myself in AZ again I will definitely revisit this place. Especially now that I have learned from my mistake of not properly allocating my stomach capacity for happy houring here! ^____^\n\n\"I am not a glutton, I am an explorer of food\" ~ Erma Bombeck", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-09-25", "type": "review"}

She knows me well - I like clean tasty Mexican dives and this was perfect. Note that when I say dive, I still want to eat on a real plate and sit at a booth with a modicum of cushioning. \n\nWhen you walk into El Bravo, don't be fooled by the window you see and the line of people standing there. (I was - until a nice woman standing in line told me there's table service.) Those people like the place so much they're picking up tortillas and meals to go. \n\nThe food was tasty and cheap. A winning combination in my book! The chips were thin and crispy with just the right amount of salt.  The salsa was chunky and fresh-tasting.  They're definitely not opening up jars of Pace in the back.  We both ordered the chili relleno dinners.  My friend loved the rice.  I thought it was fine but he really liked it.  So you might really like it too.  The beans were creamy with the requisite melted cheese on top.  I like my chili rellenos a bit plumper with more egg coating but the benefit of the size of these rellenos is you could finish your whole meal and not feel like a total pig.  \n\nWhen you pay, you look directly into the kitchen and they run a clean, tight ship there.  \n\nAll in all, a great place to grab two dinners with chips/salsa and one soda for $25 and change.

We headed north toward the Harkins North 16 Cinema and stumbled upon Denny's.  We still had plenty of time before our movie, or so we thought.\n\nThe entryway was warm and crowded with people waiting.  Only a ten minute wait was indicated, so we decided to stay.  When we were seated, we noticed the restaurant itself seemed a bit warm as well.  We waited a very long time just to have our presence recognized by a server.  Eventually, beverage orders were taken.  Coffee was delivered without an offer of creamer and we labored another five minutes just to make eye contact with anyone who could bring us some.  Food orders were finally taken and were served in a reasonable amount of time, although there was a significant amount of time between when the first person in our party and the last was served.  Not a big deal, but it's awkward to postpone eating until everyone is served and awkward when they insist that you go ahead and eat.\n\nWell, it's Denny's.  The food was fine.  Uninspired.  Just what you'd expect.  Given that you can eat at a really good breakfast joint just a few blocks away, however, I'm just not sure why you'd want to settle for this.  I'm pleased that the Original Breakfast House treats their employees well with the day off, but I doubt that I would ever head back to Denny's anytime OBH was open.\n\nBy the time we were finishing, we had used all of our available time and felt as though we'd been eating in a sauna.  The restaurant never cooled down.  Not revealed to us when we checked in was the not insignificant fact that their air conditioning was broken.  Not all of their air conditioning.  Only the part where their patrons were seated.  Revealing this tidbit of information to customers when they came in the door would have been the honorable thing to do.  Yes, we probably would have elected to go elsewhere, but it's what any good restaurant would do for their customers.  But not Denny's.      \n\nThis Denny's is nice in appearance and some employees seem well intentioned.  When you are serving \"average\" food, however, it's critical that employees and managers go above and beyond to compensate. That did not happen on this day.

Yelp says its good for kids, but we felt like maybe that isn't exactly correct when we walked in, there were no other kids at all.

Nestled in the crossroads of three of the largest gang's territory in the state, Wong's To Go has been a firm establishment in what can be a very chaotic environment. I personally love the southside... it's tension, it's colorful characters and colorless buildings are beautiful to me.\n\nOpen primarily for lunch, Wong's has been open for along as anyone can remember. A serious hole in the wall needs to be approached with serious caution - not because of it's surroundings... but because of the curt and often moody cashier. \n\n\"WAI!\" screeched the elderly Chinese woman as she slid the take out window open. \n\n\"Nee Hoy Sha Yin-Wah-ma?\" I asked to the amazment of my good friend Jackie who has never heard me say a word of Chinese in her life. \n\n\"English?! YES! You speak Chinese?!\" She said as her face brightened up. \n\n\"Wahhh hoy shwah id-yar.\" Indicating that I only spoke a lil bit of Chinese. \n\nWe quickly ordered from their very limited menu with limitless flavor. One order of 4 pieces of chicken wings (the entire wing btw) and a quart of beef fried rice. \n\nStanding around in tiny parking lot talking about whatever, I noticed how there was a small fridge displaying different energy drinks and sodas. and my friend explained how there used to be picnic tables and even shade for ppl to wait under while their food was being prepared. After the riots between rival gangs, during which one gang used the tables as a randez vous point - the city had asked the Wong's to take out the tables. She described to me how there used to be an open window like in fast food places and how after getting robbed on evening - the wong's changed their hours to closing during the early evening and now have large bars over their windows. \n\nI really felt for the Wong's to put so much into their business only to have the tremultous neighborhood love them so much and at the same time be the cause of much of their woes. Just as I was beginning to wonder off into oblivion - our order was up and it was gooooood!!\n\nThe chicken was crispy and simply fried. No batter, no dredge - nothing... it was delish! As was the beef fried rice that boasted sprouts and a lil char that Jackie requested. Burnt bits are good!  yum! Our entire order was $10! We drove away as a gagle of teenagers hungry after their last class walked up to place their orders. \n\nTo my fellow yelpers: The southside is a place that is special to my heart. Perseverant, rough and colorful... there are places where it can be scary to venture into... but stay on the main roads and be a polite driver and you should be alright. Go and pay the Wong's a visit but don't be surprised if Mrs. Wong isn't exactly a happy camper. lol.

We visited this restaurant when we traveled to Arizona this summer for a family reunion.  After seeing it on the Food Network my expectations were a little high.  First of all, the camera angles made me think the restaurant was big when it was about the size of a Subway restaurant.  We almost had to leave because there were no seats available.  There were about 8 of us and we did not want to have to take our food to go.  Fortunately, two tables ended up leaving and we were able to sit down. \n\n I got the three taco meal. I guess I should have realized that \"hot sauce\" meant hot but I was just thinking \"oh it'll be a little spicy\" NO! I took maybe two bites and couldn't finish.  I had to trade food with my niece, I ate her quesadillas which were pretty good and she didn't seem to be phased by the hot tacos.  I definitely was not satisfied when I left, I basically ate off of everyone else's plates.  If I ever return to Phoenix, I probably won't be back here.  There are several restaurants in Atlanta that are Food Network worthy, in my opinion this was not.\n\nThe customer service was very good, the ladies were very nice and excited that we mentioned the food network.", "business_id": "rDvz5jX65gpfONFu7er9Tw", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-09-29", "type": "review"}

I honestly probably would have liked it if it hadn't marinated in my bitterness for 30+ minutes, but I wasn't impressed.

Southern Ave\nMesa, AZ 85202\n480-964-5577\n\nHaving never eaten Salvadoran food before, I decided to try it, and am so glad that I did. This is totally different than Mexican food.\n\nThis is a relatively small restaurant, with a tiny kitchen, but don't let the size fool you - that tiny kitchen turns out some wonderful food. I noticed that I was the only gringa in the place - a good sign that the food is muy authenitico.\n\nThe waitress brought my drink along with a nice, crisp cole slaw type salad with some greens in it that I was not able to identify, but which gave it a nice flavor. Service is a little slow, but I attribute that to the fact that every dish is cooked to order - no steam tables here.\n\nNext, was the main course. I ordered the Lengua Guisada ($9.95). Nice, big slices of tongue braised in a wonderful mild tomato type sauce, served with rice that had veggies in it, and small dish of liquified black beans along with two of the most succulent corn tortillas I have ever eaten. Instead of being crisp and crunchy, these were firm on the outside, and soft and tender on the inside. For the more adventurous, there is also hot sauce on the table. The flavors were all wonderful, and I used the corn tortillas to mop up all of the sauce on the plate. I would be lax if I didn't mention the fact the that food was served steaming hot.\n\nI had to try the Pupupas, which are stuffed corn tortillas which are then grilled. I tried two different ones, and although I was entitled to get rice and bean with them, I opted not to have them because I was already getting full. The first Pupupas was stuffed with shrimp and cheese, and had a lovely texture and flavor. They have a tomato based sauce on the table that you can slather on your Pupupas if you so desire. I found that it really augmented the flavor and ended up using it on both Pupupas. The second Pupupas was shredded pork and cheese, and while tasty, wasn't up to the flavor profile of the camerones.\n\nUnfortunately, by this time I was stuffed and had no more room to try anything else, but I will be back to try some more. Next time I want to try the Sopa de Pata/Mondongo, which is a hearty soup of heart and beef tripe, along with the Ensalada de Camarones Asados, which is a grilled shrimp salad.\n\nIt's hard to leave here hungry - you really would have to work at it!\n\nSanitation was good and the place is handicapped aware.

I ordered mine with a lot of extra stuff on it, because I love taste and spice (I had a chicken burrito with green chile sauce, tomatoes, cheese, beans, lettuce, and sour cream). I asked for pico de gallo, but they didn't have it. My husband got a regular chicken burrito. He asked for guacamole, but they forgot it. Everything was BLAND, BLAND, BLAND! Although I could see the green chile sauce, it didn't taste like anything. The chicken was tasteless, the tortilla was soggy. All of the ingredients tasted like someone went to Walmart, bought a bunch of bulk canned food off the bottom shelf, and then slapped it into a factory tortilla without adding any kind of flavoring, not even salt. Absolutely disgusting. I've eaten better hospital food.\n\nWe paid $13 for a plate I took home and fed to the dog.

Having grown up in New Mexico, I am a huge fan of New Mexican food and research suggests that chile may be addictive so I'm generally grateful to find a place to get my fix in the Valley. \n\nI had the huevos rancheros, which is two eggs any style over corn tortillas and smothered in red and/or green chile (in New Mexico, we do both and call it \"Christmas.\" i.e. Question: \"Red or Green?\" Answer: \"Christmas\"). It was served with a side of refried beans and rice. (I liked the rice.) \n\nSi Senor uses the New Mexican red and green chiles but it didn't really scratch the itch, if you know what I mean. (The bean dip was spicier than the \"hot\" green chile. The bean dip was really good, by the way!) \n\nI just really don't have anything compelling to say about this place. Bottom line, after a 20 mile drive to check them out, I just don't think their chile delivered. \n\nThe chips and salsa plate they start you with was nice. It included a fiery bean dip, green chile, salsa, and a sour cream. And, the fact that you get sopapillas at the end of your meal is a nice memory of my days in NM (but I don't remember ever having the option of a cinnamon and sugar one?!) although the texture of the sopapillas was off. \n\nI drove a long way to check out Si Senor and, truthfully, I would rather drive back to Albuquerque for some Carne Adovada (not even on Si Senor's menu) than back to Chandler; however, if I was IN Chandler already I would probably give them another visit - you know, research suggests chile is addictive...! I mean, I'm already wondering how I would have felt if I had gotten the stuffed sopapilla...", "business_id": "s8cHXeSlX_aPI2x49UkCCg", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-10-19", "type": "review"}

When the hostess you're making reservations with asks for your name, last name, your dates first and last, whether your celebrating anything special, and if either of you have any food allergies, you can't help but think, what a class act, the hostess alone seemed to put in more effort to assure us a pleasant dining experience than the majority of restaurant servers in service today. \n\nI chose Kai, based on high recommendations, which is honestly revered in an almost mythical capacity. If you are nitpicking though, which I was (everyone wants to see behind the curtain at some point), the minor hiccups are easy to see. \n\n*the hostess mispronounced our name. The server began to flounder when I derailed him slightly off his rehearsed prose, improvisation definitely not being his strong suit. Typos littered the cocktail list, showing what appeared to be last minute adjustments for the nights menu, and finally...the \"ambiance\" of  what seemed to be a very basic modified hotel lobby room (ugly carpet and all) was, well... less than magical\"\n\nThis all said, If i could give Kai 4 and a half stars, I probably would have. The service as others have said IS nearly impeccable, the dance of waiters circling your table to place plates down in synchrony, each dish arriving slightly incomplete so that the server can perform his oratory introduction to each plates construction, (and on top of this, I am now placing a delicate basil herb foam, blah blah, molecular gastrognomy, etc.) Like I eluded to earlier however, try not to interrupt the shpeal with too many questions or the server might get a slightly annoyed deer in headlights appearance until he finds his way back to where he left off.

If I had to choose between Wildflower and Paradise, it would be Wildflower hands down.", "business_id": "U9iWs_XQ88IEj_Cgawyz4w", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-10-03", "type": "review"}

The food was very pricey which I am willing to pay for high quality food but this just wasn't it. I ordered the grilled cheese and it was really just a greasy mess. The bread wasn't grilled enough and I think they used oil instead of butter on it so it was just greasy instead of crispy on the outside. Hubby got the Mixed Grill which I liked better than mine but still wasn't great.", "business_id": "U9iWs_XQ88IEj_Cgawyz4w", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-11-26", "type": "review"}
