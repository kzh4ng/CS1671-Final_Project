Most of the churches are so beautiful that it's such a great use of space.  This is no exception, as it's just so unique inside! \n\nIf you're looking for that nontraditional hotel that's NOT a Marriott or Hilton, this is the place you'll want to stay!  It's fashioned like a European boutique hotel, plus all the amenities you'd be looking for like WiFi, a shuttle and continental breakfast (score!). \n\nIt's also a really lovely place to have an event.  For smaller events you can rent out specific parlor's for a reasonable cost and you're able to bring in your own caterers.  I really like this option because you're not boxed into one choice that may be out of price range.  If I would have gotten married in Pittsburgh, this would  definitely have been my first choice for the reception.  The Grand Hall is just gorgeous!  It has the original church organ and stain glass windows.  When it's all dressed up for the event it's just a stunning place for a magical affair! \n\nThe Northside of town, where it's located, has walkable access to the Andy Warhol Museum, The Mattress Factory Museum, The Children's Museum, The National Aviary, The Carnegie Science Center, PNC Park (home to the Pirates, go bucks!) and Heinz Field (home to the Stillerz, as we call them in the burgh).  Some are farther than others, but there's always the shuttle if it's in our frigid winter season.  In the summer, go for the walk so you can take in the sights!\n\nThere's also a lot of cute restaurants and bars on East Ohio River Boulevard, which is two streets up from the hotel.  My suggestions would be Bistro to Go and Bistro Soul, Rita's Italian Ice (personal fave) or The Priory Bakery for dessert!  There's also Legends North Shore not far on E. North Ave. about two streets up from E. Ohio and Amani Coffee Shop and Cafe for a quick stop for coffee or a great panini for lunch.   \n\nIt's really a fantastic time to go in the summer because EVERYTHING is within walking distance.  Plus they have a great farmers market in the park right along E. Ohio and they have kayaking in the park right by the Aviary.  The big kayaking organization, Venture Outdoors is right under the 6th St. Bridge next to PNC Park.  You're able to kayak around the three rivers for only $15 an hour!  It's a great way to see the city!\n\nThis is your place for one unique stay, I wouldn't steer you wrong!", "business_id": "hBAcj7X5JHeX2hvmptwH-w", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-04-29", "type": "review"}

It's also free for me as a Pitt employee.  \n\nHowever, my main complaints are\n\n1. The buses are way too crowded during rush hour.  Not only are the buses almost always so full that the standing room is occupied, but bus drivers some times even have to drive by peeved people at bus stations because the bus is completely full.  \n2. Irregular intervals.  Buses have a tendency to bunch.  This some times results in having to wait at a bus station for a long time before seeing two buses together.  The lead bus is overcrowded and the second bus is usually pretty empty.  Note:  Bus bunching is a well-known phenomenon.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_bunching\n3. Waiting outside in the cold for the bus.  Because of irregular intervals, you some times have to wait outside in Pittsburgh weather for significant time.\n\nPittsburgh needs to install GPS on their buses!  This has been implemented in Washington DC and San Francisco already.\n1.  People could check online or on their smart phones when the next bus was about to arrive so they could wait in the comfort of their homes or offices, rather than cold Pittsburgh weather, and   \n2.  Bus drivers could adjust their driving speeds to avoid bunching.", "business_id": "1n0n_-Iz0e3iVpH8sereiA", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-04-03", "type": "review"}

Avis turned out to be the best deal on top of being located in an easy-to-find location (in addition to being easy to return the car).\n\nI was aware of a 29-minute grace period before being charged another day (or hour). The clock/timer on the parking garage entrance was 6 minutes fast, and me being me, this mattered. It said I returned at 8:47 even though my cell phone showed 8:41am. I immediately took a photo, intending to use this in case I were to be overcharged, even though the location doesn't open for business until 9am and wouldn't be able to rent the car out to anyone for another ~20 minutes anyway.\n\nI was back in Pittsburgh on October 9th and made it a special point to get back to the place so I could resolve the situation in person. It turned out that it's hard for the particular store location to make adjustments if it's been more than a few days. The guy there, Francis, said it's not a huge deal to make the adjustment but that it's out of his control and that if I call the 800 number, it should be fine.\n\nPause for ~6 months.\n\nSo yeah, today I finally made time to pick up the papers and phone and make a call.

Avis needed to authorize a $200 deposit in addition to the rental, and while I had that much cash, they don't take cash. My wife had more on her own debit card, but she doesn't drive, so they couldn't rent the car to her. After a few minutes of stress, the staff suggested that we shorten the rental to 1 day, charge that (and the deposit) to my debit card, drive to a branch where I could deposit the cash, and call back to extend the rental to its original length. We did exactly that and it turned out great.\n\nI sure wish a debit card weren't such a hassle to use, but I'm glad Avis was able to find a solution that worked for us.

I ran away from NJ (long story) after a really bad week. \n\nThe hotel has a great location to PNC Park, the convention center and restaurants. Everything is walkable. That's really important for me. I don't like driving around new cities or trying to figure out public transportation if I am unfamiliar. (I am fine in Chicago & San Fran with that but their infrastructure is great). \n\nThe rooms have 17 foot ceilings so you really feel luxurious for what you are paying. My deal was under $100 for the night and it was well worth the expense. This Marriott had free wifi throughout the hotel and a free business center for printing baseball tickets! That was very helpful. I love free wifi. Data is expensive now that Verizon killed the unlimited plans. \n\nThe hotel has modern decor and a lounge in the lobby. Since it's playoff hockey season they were featuring the BlackHawks game. (you're killing me hawks!). There are also sitting lounges on a couple of the room floors. \n\nI am not too sure about food options other than breakfast. But there are plenty of restaurants near by and the \"strip district\" is a couple of blocks over. You will not go hungry staying here. \n\nThe staff here is excellent. I am not sure why others are making derogatory comments about them. I was pick pocketed at PNC Park and they were helpful in sorting out my mess. They also calmed me down when I was YELLING angrily about how Pittsburgh is literally the worst city I have ever visited for that reason.  They also suggested a craft beer bar for me to try which I really enjoyed. Great people. Thank you. \n\nWhat I did not like was valet parking. But I'll get over that.

I've taken the trip to and from Washington, DC via train 3 times now, and it's proven to be a super painless way to travel every time. \n\nThe very first train trip I ever took, back in 2009, was wonderful, because we had splurged on a sleeper compartment. So cute and tiny! But very convenient. There are definitely a lot of perks, including avoiding the rush of coach passengers pushing each other off the train. First class gets off first! You have your own personal attendant that will get you anything. You can eat your dinner privately in your cabin if you don't want to go to the dining car, and your seats and the ceiling transform into bunk beds! It's magic! \n\nCoach is not all that bad either, the seating is very spacious, with plenty of room for all your stuff. We had a very full train this latest trip, so the largest drawback is that it was a little loud. I was getting annoyed with the guy behind me singing out loud (and for several hours straight) to music only he could hear. But I had headphones with me too, so I used 'em. \n\nThe observation car is very nice, and can give you a break if you're being driven crazy by your fellow passengers. It can be pretty peaceful, especially when you're passing through some nice country. \n\nOn this latest trip, we encountered some delays on our way back, mostly from freight trains being in our way, which could not be helped. \n\nMy only real warning is to NEVER EVER get a meal on the train if you don't have to. It's senselessly overpriced, there's only about 3 or 4 choices, only one choice if you're a vegetarian, and the food is not even that good. I was all in favor of grabbing some food in Union Station to eat on the train later, but because my husband had never been on the train before, he really wanted the whole dining car experience. So for dinner we paid over 50 bucks for a bland steak and a tiny short rib, with frozen veggies and a glob of mashed potatoes for our sides. Plus if you don't have 4 people in the party you're traveling with, they'll stick you at a table with strangers, even though the rest of the dining car is empty.

I could be wrong.\n\nOne plus over the last time I stayed here is that the old analog style, CRT-based TVs are now gone - at the least in the room I stayed in had a newer flat panel HD TV set.\n\nAs before in my previous review:\n\n- If you are staying here - please note the hotel does not have a convenience store - they have a very limited number of items for sale down by the front desk. If you are in need of toiletries, beverages, snacks and other items - there is a 7-Eleven down the street - and a CVS and a Rite Aid an additional block or so further - BUT - be forewarned - none of these three options stays open very late.  We attempted to visit both the above 7-11 and CVS - but it was after 10:00 pm and three years later they ar still keeping the same limited hours.\n\nAnd you can't get any food at the Braddock Bar in the Hotel lobby after 10:00 pm or so. Very annoying.", "business_id": "A38wziZJdYoijhC5S6uWCQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-03-24", "type": "review"}

Not kidding, right across from the Clemente bridge, you can go and get slizzed up before, during, after the game and walk right back\n\nParking- 5 bones for an all day pass at the self-parking garage across the street. May seem a little sketchy inside, but you are fine. Come on, $5, really?! It's $35 for a 3 hour baseball game at Yankee stadium..... I digress\n\nAmenities- Very clean, very cozy, very charming. Seems like this hotel has been there for quite some time, but has steadily been maintained and updated. Great overall feel to it. Free Wi-Fi too, tough.\n\nFood- The Braddock (probably not spelling it right) restaurant downstairs is a little pricey. You can walk around the area and find a really good food place for alot less. I'd say this may be the only con.\n\nLBD Scale- 9, very impressed with the place. If the food wasn't so expensive, I'd be back tomorrow.

The room itself was a great size, was very clean and decorated with modern flair.  \n\nWe were really pleased with the Renaissance's location: walking distance to many of Pittsburgh's best attractions including the aforementioned sports parks, Point State Park, The Strip, Station Square, the Inclines and Grandview, Heinz History Center, the National Aviary and the Spanish War Streets.  \n\nRates are competitive, and parking is available at the garage across the street for $5 each in-and-out.

Some are laudable like requiring a keycard to turn the lights on, but get real...they're offering people $5 off their next visit if they don't have their bed remade between nights. This is a hotel....why not suggest saving me $5 if you padlock the bathroom door? About as logical. Hotels = Bed with fresh sheets every night.  By the way, they obviously discontinued the minibar fridge because the power goes out when you leave the room. So why not take the fridges out of the room? Very amateurish to leave them sitting in rooms.\n\nThe hot tub/pool facilities are the kind where you have to sign in, show your key, and walk all the way through the locker rooms before you can enter the pool area that looks like it's a Mexican hotel in the 80's. Not the greatest. I don't care to look at old man ass on my way to the hot tub.\n\nThe location is good for catching a game downtown or for a night on the town.

My name is Ben. The name of the Steelers' quarterback (beloved perhaps even more in 2007 than he is today) is also Ben. As a result, there seemed to be a lot of not-quite-trademark-infringement merchandise in the Steel City, and much of it had my name all over it.\n\nBut I couldn't find a \"Ben At Work\" sign, try as I might. I asked Monica, who was working at the front desk, if she could help me figure out where to buy one. I figured she'd just tell me if she happened to have a few suggestions.\n\nSome people, it seems, just like a challenge.\n\nWhen I saw her that evening, Monica had walked up to the Strip District to canvas all the tchotchkie-mongers and tourist traps. She had come up empty-handed. I was astonished that she had gone to such trouble, but I accepted that there were no Ben At Work signs for sale between the Allegheny and the Monongahela.\n\nSome people, it seems, just like a challenge.\n\nUndaunted by such silly little things as the complete and total nonexistence of the desired merchandise on store shelves, Monica got creative. She remembered having given a magnetic \"Ben At Work\" sign to a friend and called that friend up to ask whether she might be able to get it back.  The friend said \"Oh, that? I gave it to my mom.\"\n\nSome people, it seems, just like a challenge.\n\nThat's when Monica called up her friend's mom out of the blue and asked if she still had the sign, and whether it had any sentimental value. No, it doesn't, why do you ask? Well, you see, a guest at my hotel asked if I...\n\nNext time I saw Monica, she had (after finishing her shift at the most popular convention hotel in the city) driven across town to the house of a friend's mom to retrieve the precious artifact.\n\nHere's a photo of her handing it to me. http://j.mp/BenAtWork\n\nAnd when I offered to pay her what she had once paid at the store, she wouldn't take a dime.\n\nAnd when I offered to pay her for the gas she'd burned driving across town, she wouldn't take a dime.\n\nI assume, based on the letter I wrote to the hotel's general manager and copied to corporate (back in November 2007), that she has since been promoted far higher than the front desk. But it wouldn't surprise me a bit if I found out that she had declined to be promoted to a position where she couldn't surprise and delight her customers.\n\nSome people, it seems, just like a challenge.", "business_id": "bWWrrsPWuoHuAGUCgH8Tyg", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-05-24", "type": "review"}

We are not downtown, and charging $17.88 to park is a lot at a $129 a night hotel. They do have a shuttle that you can use to go to areas within a few miles and its a good thing because there is not much to walk to in the general area.  \n\nThe closest things in waking distance are about a 1/2 mile away--but it is higher end chain-shops like the Apple Store and Athletica. I'd certainly walk a half mile for some unique, non chain shopping. But this was not what I had in mind. \n\nThe room was a good size, clean and mostly ok. With 2 queen beds there was not much leg room for other seating options. \n\nThe HVAC unit was very loud and it rattled. The toilet had a hard time and required 2 flushes per visit.  The shower was weak, but had a Speakman head. \n\nBut the bed was a big disappointment. The mattress was borderline uncomfortable. The linens were not very substantial, and the pillows were cheap and sponge like.  \n\nThe nightstand was unstable. When the drawer opened fully it toppled over. Poor design not helped by the heavy bibles--one regular and the Book of Mormon always present at any Marriott. \n\nAlso of note is that the hospital across the street must be, like all hospitals, a no smoking campus. With a Starbucks in the lobby of the hotel, there were always 4 to 10 smoking-slobs in and around a bench next to the hotel entrance giving the Courtyard a  flop-house like feel. \n\nI will say that the staff was great. Nice, helpful and ever present. \n\nI was not expecting the Ritz, but the actual accommodations were more like Holliday Inn/Hampton Inn and those properties are less money--again, we were at 129 with a big discount, so most customers are paying 150 per night and this was not in that price range in terms of quality. \n\nSince this location (and Pittsburgh's lack of an easy to use public transit system) requires a car, this was not a cheap hotel stay. We are normally Starwood people, and Marriott did little to sway my view that Starwood is a better brand, if for no other reason than the Sheraton mattress at every property--even Four Points which is equivalent to Courtyard. \n\nFor reasons that are unclear to me, Pittsburgh in general is expensive for hotels. All the Sheraton properties were more money, but given the reality on the ground I can see why.", "business_id": "DiPbxquQQHSgz123I27Drg", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-04-08", "type": "review"}

Our suite was essentially a small apartment in a decrepit, tacky building across the street from the main facility. After somehow making it up the steepest driveway of all time, and somehow stumbling across our rooms in the completely unmarked hallways, we actually found that they were quite nice looking.  Felt very much like college dorm rooms - but they were serviceable and clean.\n\nToo clean - it turns out. After we had barely settled in, my cousin came running into our room screaming like a banshee holding out hands covered in soap. \"IT'S NOT COMING OFF! IT WON'T COME OFF!\" Turns out every single piece of brown furniture in all of our suites was covered with furniture polish that stained our clothes and stuck on our hands.\n\nWe called the office, and were put on hold for ten minutes.  Finally went over across the street, and the staff ended up being very gracious. Apologized profusely, offered to pay to have our clothes cleaned, and removed the guilty furniture from our rooms. Everyone received an apology letter explaining the oversight. We received special attention as the first guests to fall prey to this cruel trick, and received a handwritten apology from the management and two bottles of cheap merlot.\n\nEverything else went smoothly until check-out day. We were heading to a college graduation ceremony and intended to drive, but were forced to walk due to the Pittsburgh Marathon route.  When we called the office to ask if it were okay for us to leave our luggage in our rooms until slightly after check out time (HALF AN HOUR ONLY), they flat out refused to allow it.\n\nAfter shit-fits were thrown and our varnish-debacle resurrected, they allowed us to leave our cars in the lot with the luggage in the trunks, which they initially tried to refuse permission for us to do.\n\nNeedless to say, we did not leave happy campers.", "business_id": "uXuiI-Y998JChGn-ebcSdw", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-05-16", "type": "review"}

Seems like an oversight but when hunting for a middle priced hotel in pittsburgh, you would have thought by price range of the larger chains pittsburgh suddenly morphed into Paris. Major chain hotels  near downtown are ridiculouly priced and mostly all cheaper hotels are out the way for dirving purposes. Also most hotels offer no free parking, Shadyside suites did.\n\nPrice seems great, but for one thing the comfort level... see further in review,\n\nFairly clean, and renovated, cheap renovations but acceptable for the price of the hotel.\n\nNo issues with service or housekeeping.\n\nNice large space in room for the price, cable tv, and fully stocked kitchen.\n\nGreat Location close to downtown, oakland and the east end.\n\nCons:\n\nNoisy, they cannot help this but the cars whizzing by on fifth ave will not allow you to sleep well in the living room.

Because after hurting out backs I suspected the thing had not been manufactored in this decade or possibly last decade and I was right. \n\nHave you heard of a Serta 99z? no me either so I dubbed it the 0 z and moved on, they had placed a memory foam pillow on top of it, which didn't help matters and when we complained it was too soft. We were told oh if you take the memory foam thing off that makes it less soft, and we could have asked for that. Sorry genius at the dront desk but that wont help matters. \n\nI understand hotels cannot always know your preferance of mattress firmness but they can provide sleep number mattresses, or newer mattresses.

On my quest to be a refined English lady I've been on a hunt for the cities best high tea service.  Probably not the most popular past time, but you can't knock it until you've tried it!  And... You MUST try this place!\n\nThis is a proper setting for such an event, you almost feel like you need white gloves and a parasol!  And surprise, the Inn is actually an Inn!  Apparently it dates back to the olden days of yore (late 1800's) and is one of those old Shadyside mansions that was converted into an Inn at some point.  But if you have relatives who want something more unique in the heart of a vibrant Burgh neighborhood, I'd suggest here!\n\nLet's get to the tea service though!  It's served from noon to four daily, which is nice for a \"ladies who lunch afternoon\" or a Saturday or Sunday outing for mom.  It's in a parlor, which is small but charming.  There's also an outdoor patio that would be nice if it's not too hot out (drinking hot tea in 80 degrees isn't too appealing).  There's a full High Tea Service for $20 per person, which seems a little steep, but for tea service isn't too bad.  There's also other combo's for around $12, but I'd say go big or go home!\n\nThe tea menu is VERY large and there were tons of choices. They give you the main choices between black, green and herbal, but you can also blend them together too.  I chose the caramel vanilla, which I guess is being taken off the menu sadly.  It was delish though... so maybe they'll bring it back at some point.  There were honestly a lot of different ones I would have been more than happy with too!\n\nThe one thing I think is very cool and very different is that they offer you a different tea selections with the different tiers of food.  I've never heard of them doing that before.  Usually you get one tea choice and that's it.  I love that you can pair the foods together with different teas for no up-charge.  Very unique and a definite perk of coming here.  \n\nI've been to several High Tea Services and this one would definitely be on the light side.  The portions were small, but surprisingly filled me up for the entire afternoon until a later dinner.  I mean, it's tea service, not a five course meal!  There was a chicken and egg salad sandwich and a mushroom and cream cheese on a crisp baguette.  The winner was absolutely the mushroom and cream cheese choice.  It was amazing and I definitely could have eaten ten of those!  \n\nThere were two scone choices of blueberry/peach and lemon/lemon ginger.  Those were actually surprisingly tiny.  I thought they were both moist and fresh, but I would have loved them to be a bit bigger because they were so good and I love to slather clotted cream on them!   Oh, and there was also fresh fruit.  Which is great and all, but more scone please!\n\nThe last tier was the desserts.  Forgive me for not being accurate enough, but there was a delicious chocolate piece, cheesecake with lemon curd and blueberries.  Loved the chocolate, but I like my cheesecake plain.  While it was good it wasn't life changing.  BUT, the coconut macaroon was honestly thee best macaroon I had EVER had.  Again, ten of those in my possession would have been scarfed down in like 5 seconds.  I would buy a batch of those if I could!  Seriously, can I??\n\nI can't wait to bring my mom here, total mom place fo sho!  But I also love it for myself too!  Or for a bridal shower... If I could do another one (since I'm married I don't think that's proper).  But it's a great place, that's what I'm trying to say and I'll for sure be back to get my proper English lady on!", "business_id": "rUQfZOengMpXFkLvJrNJ3g", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-05-16", "type": "review"}

I have gone twice for Sunday brunch and both times have been absolutely amazing. While the food is delicious the experience of a eating a 4 course brunch  in a old Victorian home is worth the price. For $23 a person, the brunch includes a starter, pastries, entr\u00e9e, dessert and unlimited tea, coffee or juice. The tea list is extensive and I recommend the mint chocolate-tastes just like the ice cream.  On our last trip we started with a small bowl of fruit followed by the pastry selections-these are always fresh and made in house.  This time it was lemon poppy seed bread and cranberry muffins. They were both absolutely scrumptious and I was wanting more as you only get a small sample.  Next up we got to pick our entr\u00e9e-they don't have a menu and usually have 4 choices and then eggs any style. I went with the goat cheese, asparagus and leek omelet with potatoes and turkey bacon (loved that this was an option).  My date ordered the hash with poached eggs and regular bacon.  The omelet was amazing and had such great flavor.  For dessert we were all given extremely cute lady bug sugar cookies.

We were then brought a fruit cup and a small plate of muffins/bread. The morning glory bread was full of good for you stuff and resembled a zuchini bread. The banana choc chip mini muffins were so yummy! We were then read the menu of the day which consisted of a french toast topped with berries and granola or an egg dish with veggies. We were also informed that we could request eggs any way we liked them with toast and breakfast meat. I went with the French toast and a side of bacon. The main course took a little longer than expected but, we enjoyed our conversation and sipped on coffee that was never left empty. When the French toast arrived, it was well worth the wait. Cooked perfectly and topped with yummy berries and granola. Yum, yum. After we were finished with our main course we were given a small lemon bar for dessert.

I went there for the first time today, for Sunday brunch ($22 per person, prix fixe).  The dining room is quite elegant as is the library in which the buffet is set out.  The ambience suggests that the year is 1900.  The waiter was very good, but they seemed to be understaffed.\n\nThe yogurt with fruit, the warm brie with strawberry, the hummus and toast, the chicken, the cinnamon pastry triangles, and the tiny eclairs were all quite good.  The quiche was cold, tiny, and not particularly flavorful.  Orange juice was served in dainty little glasses, causing anyone with a good thirst to order at least two.  The wait for the entrees was excessive -- about 25 minutes from the time we ordered them.  I got french toast and my kids got strawberry pancakes.  Both were dry and unremarkable.  I've cooked better french toast and pancakes at home, in my opinion.  We didn't try the sandwiches or salads; perhaps they're better.\n\nOverall, it's not a bad place, but I think you can do better.

Definitely an old school hotel, there is internet and basic TV, rooms are spotless and quiet and speckless. The place  has a certain charm to it. If you like your hotel to be quiet, quaint and a little quirky this is the place to stay. Located next to Carnegie Mellon University and within walking distance of the University of Pittsburgh. The surrounding neighbourhood is filled with similar old well kept mansions from 1880's and makes for pleasant walking. I will return to this hotel on my next trip to Pittsburgh.

They no longer do easter brunch, but they do have their martini bar - which many people seem to rave about. I should have stopped to think twice upon seeing that all 5 reviews here on yelp are at least 2 years old, but I threw caution to the wind and arrived early on a Friday evening.\n\nJust getting off work, I came alone. The location is a historical landmark, a mansion built in 1889, and is the reason they deserve their single star. The mansion, from the lobby in the bar appears beautifully kept. The walls are dark and decorated with wood and stained glass. The furniture is elegant but not stuffy, and the bar was obviously once a den or a library that was converted. The bar is rather small, housing four 2-seat tables, a 4-top, and about 8 spaces at the bar. Behind the bar, light shines through a small collection of liquor bottles. The top of the bar and tables are inlaid with tile patterns and candles are spread throughout.\n\nI browsed the martini menu, not finding much that would suit my palate as it all sounded sweeter, or too far from a martini(tequila, cointreau, and orange juice is closer to a margarita than a martini - and that Jose Cuervo on your top shelf doesn't send a good impression of your margarita). I stuck with the classic, then, and ordered a basic dry gin martini without garnish. \n\nIt was made quickly and without love, shaking instead of stirring, and putting it in an un-chilled glass. Not that there was much to love, while the bottles on the shelf could be called mid-range, the bottles used for my drink and for others were right out of the bottom of the barrel. Banker's Club is the gin of choice here, and Burnett's flavored vodka is the base of most of the drinks on their menu. The martini came(Not filled to the top, seems they measure precisely to include garnish), strong with little vermouth, but given the alcohol, devoid of any flavor but ethanol and a hint of citrus.\n\nI found as I drank that food is no longer available at all in the hotel as they no longer served as a restaurant, even though signage was still in place throughout the building. I quietly finished my drink and closed my tab. How much did my room temperature Banker's Club cost? A cool $9.\n\nIt appears that somewhere between the last two years and now, this hotel must have come upon hard times or new management. If you are staying at the hotel and need a drink, hop a cab to Walnut street. At least your hassle will be eased by a much better drink.", "business_id": "rm1hBa1HPcLhUSwuincX2Q", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-04-13", "type": "review"}

Overall experience was adequate...specifics follow.\n\n1)  Room quality - 4 stars.  Most rooms have Sleep Number beds, which actually kept me awake on the first night as I spent 45 minutes trying to find the perfect setting for me.  The second night I just reset the bed to Sleep Number 50 (median) and fell asleep in short order.  Room was clean, not too dated, and nothing stood out as being in need of repair or cleaning.\n\n2)  Internet access - 2 stars.  All rooms have both wired and wireless access included in the room cost.  The wireless access is a peer-to-peer network, so my corporate laptop was prohibited from connecting (our IT group smartly limits connections to secured networks).  The wired connection is very slow during the day, and at times during mid-day would return connection timeout errors.  Late at night it was adequate.\n\n3)  Services - 4 stars.  Housekeeping was daily, and the only negative was that somehow each new bath towel that was left had single, long black hair on it.  Once I could forgive, but three times in four days?  Service call to address a clogged toilet was dealt with promptly.  Room service is not as expensive as expected, and our server was prompt and friendly.\n\n4)  Restaurant - 2 stars.  The in house \"Rivers\" restaurant is not worth going to.  The $12 breakfast buffet consists of scrambled eggs, sausage and bacon, bad French toast, horrible home fries, bad fresh fruit, and decent (store-bought, I imagine) pastries.  A la carte breakfasts are not much better...the pancakes were pretty bad.  Dinner is the same...food is bland, overpriced, and usually either under- or over-cooked.  The pizza bar next door is not always open, and is not as good as your usual neighborhood pizza place.\n\n5)  Facilities - 3 stars.  The exercise/pool room is decent, although during our stay the hotel was overrun with hundreds of teenagers and the pool water was so cloudy that we avoided it entirely.  The banquet/conference catering is really well done, very accommodating and professional.  The current manager is very friendly, present, and professional.\n\nOverall this is a solid if unspectacular place to stay if you are on a business trip or need a place to host a gathering.

We had scheduled a team-building group event at the US National White Water Center and so I searched for hotels around that area. When I saw this hotel featured as an airport hotel I figured it would be in a safe enough location with some close-by eateries and quick highway access, etc...\n\nWe booked a total of 13 rooms with them and checked in individually. I had been in contact with one of their hotel managers. I was a little dissatisfied in how poorly I welcomed to the hotel. \n\nThe front desk clerk seemed \"oh-so enthused\" to be working that night, and when I let her know that I had been in contact with the manager and just wanted to make sure everything was in good standing, she went in the back, he was there, and never even came out to greet me.\n\nNow I didn't expect any VIP treatment. But usually when you organize a group event at a hotel you are give a very warm welcome. I know this because this wasn't a first for me.\n\nI had requested a room with a crib (only two months in advance, with a reminder the day prior), and when I requested one that night, yes the same clerk, took over an hour to get it. At first I wasn't even sure if she was going to because she never did give any indication she was paying attention to me at all.\n\nThe cable and internet did not work our first night there. No apologies were issued.\n\nThe room had a musty smell to it. I have a family of five (2 adults, 2 kids, and one baby) but they only had 3 towel sets in the room...even the next day after housekeeping came.\n\nThe hotel was not in the best of locations, it was secluded and not close to anything, and price-wise you could find better closer to downtown. I am not from Charlotte, NC and had only been there once...and again I figured \"airport\".\n\nThe hotel interior was nice and they did have a complimentary hot breakfast from served until 0930 am (another fact of information I had to PRY out of the front desk clerk). \n\nThe staff working the morning shift were much more pleasant and inviting. \n\nThe hotel was very quiet at night which we appreciated. The doors did not slam, thank God, as our baby girl is a very light sleeper. The hotel itself is clean and kept nice. It was not superior by any means but very nice for the average express.\n\nI rated poor because of the customer service but overall I would give it a three (average). However, I would not book here again not mainly due to my experience but due to the location. There are better hotels averaging the same distance from the USNWC but in better areas.\n\nIf anyone from management every reads this, please take a look into \"Deborah\" the front desk jerk...I mean clerk.\n\nStayed July 2011, traveled on business", "business_id": "ZOQAQe2n3lAihLLsTmS1aQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-03-31", "type": "review"}

While 9 out of 10 are good experiences this one takes the cake.  Based on yelp reviews we knew ahead of time about the parking fee (it is unavoidable in the center of the city)At least it is only a 1 time fee and they validate it for your stay.  After parking we go to hotel lobby to check in and were greeted by a very nice and helpful receptionist (I wish I remembered her name).  She told us that we had the best room in the entire hotel, and I truly believe it. Our room was 15th floor room 1534.  It was on the corner so we got 2 walls of windows, one side had a great view of uptown (not the arena which is behind the hotel), and the ceilings were over 12 feet high. Our king bed was comfy as always, and I always fall asleep quickly on them.\nThe hotel itself is furnished in a contemporary style, and will appeal to 9 out of 10 people.  It is located one block from the Epicenter, and only a block or two from the lightrail system for easy commuting.    The one time we had to leave parking was to travel about 3.5 miles to go to an auditorium (we saw Wicked, and it was fantastic).  Other than that there was no reason to drive anywhere since you are close to everything in uptown.  \n\nIn the beginning of my post I said that my boyfriend and myself always stay in a variety of the Holiday Inn brand hotels.  For anybody looking into hotels, I suggest you sign up for their rewards system, whether or be this one (priority club) or another chains version of it.  Hotels reward loyalty, and will do a lot to keep you loyal.  We did our research and liked the IHG brand (everything from Holiday inn express to Intercontinental)for a few reasons; they are literally everywhere so we knew that when we travel we can stay with them and continue earning points, and price-wise they stay competitive.  Our room preferences are already saved to our account (free to create).  So as a tip to everybody do a little research into hotels rewards programs, then stick to it.  If you stay with a hotel chain ten times a year, they will do a little more to keep you happy, and make up for any bad experiences you might have along the way. When I first started out with my Priority Club membership I highly doubt they would have upgraded me to the 15th floor with some of best views in the whole hotel, but because of my loyalty to them they rewarded me (at no additional cost).  The room was only $97, and that really can't be beat  for this location.", "business_id": "Fi5sQxROyTLp5qDuYKz6bQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-04-09", "type": "review"}

The rooms were spacious and clean and everything was well kept.  The staff was friendly every time we walked past the front desk.\n\nOur flight didn't arrive to Charlotte until 11:40pm on Friday night. That meant that we didn't get to the hotel until 1am Saturday morning.  As we pulled up to the hotel we quickly realized that we were smack dab in the middle of party central.  The restaurant across the street was apparently a night club as well.  There was a line out the door and around the corner and down the block to get in.  The hotel was crawling with both police officers and security (kudos to hotel management for making sure the place was safe at least).  Once we made it to our room on the 15th floor we spent the next hour listening to screams and yells from drunk club goers 15 floors below us.  Cars would drive by with stereo systems so loud that the glasses on our night stands would vibrate.  Every 10 minutes it seemed like someone felt the need to either over rev their motorcycle and bounce off of the rev limiter (I guess showing people that you can twist your wrist on a throttle like EVERYONE ELSE in the world makes you some sort of hot shot?) or do the same to their car.  This would usually be followed by that same vehicle attempting to peel out from the stop light at the corner.  All of this while drunk club goers are undoubtedly stumbling only inches away on the sidewalks.\n\nFast forward to the day on Saturday.  We awoke to grab some breakfast then hit up a bicycle store to get a part for my bike since I was going to be racing a major national race that evening at 6pm.  Our plan was to eat a big breakfast then go back to sleep in order for me to be well rested for my race.  Little did I know that when we got back to the hotel and climbed back into bed around noon we would be kept up by what was apparently repairs being done to the plumbing or other piping on the 14th floor, right beneath us.  Workers were banging on pipes constantly for hours.  We tried to nap but simply couldn't.  We left a couple of hours later to grab an early pre-race meal and made it back around 3pm.  The banging didn't stop until 4-4:30.  So much for any form of a nap.  I thought I would get some rest being in a hotel?\n\nFast forward again to Saturday night/Sunday morning and the same events from the previous night were far, far, FAR worse.  Apparently some DJ decided to set up on a corner or something and proceeded to play dance music until 2am, on the dot.  More screaming and yelling than the night before.  More vehicles with motors bouncing off of rev limiters and, no doubt, blowing speakers in a vain attempt to show others how cool they are by playing overly distorted music through craptastic sub-par car audio equipment.  All to be up at 4am on Sunday morning in order to catch my 6am flight back home.\n\nI will never, let me emphasize this: I WILL NEVER stay at this hotel or at any hotel in the vicinity again.  Annoyed doesn't even begin to describe my level of irritation.  Hotel management should be ashamed that they A) let this happen right outside of their doors B) put paying customers on an exterior part of the building where they are subjected to this kind of noise.", "business_id": "Fi5sQxROyTLp5qDuYKz6bQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-04-12", "type": "review"}

Upon arrival, we were promptly greeted by plenty of construction for the new Knight's ballpark, making getting there a challenge. Once we found our way to the entrance, the clerk at the desk decided that the phone call - possibly a personal call, possibly a take-out order - was much more important than our business. Regardless, we eventually made our way to the room, and it was nice in appearance. Not over-the-top or anything, but nice for a Residence Inn, and nice for our night out.\n\nUnfortunately, the thermostat is the \"hotter and colder\" variety - not much different than the kind that used to be mounted under the window, it's just now on the wall. Is it really that much more to have the kind you set an actual temperature? It means that throughout the night, it gets way too hot, or way too cold, and makes for an uncomfortable night.\n\nThere are two televisions - one in the living area and one in the bedroom. The one in the living area works with the lineup card, while the one in the bedroom has the digital assignments, such as 76-0010 and whatnot, meaning you can't find anything (including HBO), so if you want to actually watch a show, you'll probably end up watching on the hard-as-a-rock sleeper sofa in the living area.\n\nIf you have to flush the toilet (and many people prefer this option), you lose all water in the bathroom. Not most, or even a particular temperature. It's gone. Not forever, so don't be completely alarmed. But for a few seconds, water completely stops.

It's about 2.5 miles to the center of Freedom Park -- a 5-mile roundtripper!\n\nWhen I asked the front desk for a good running route, they had nothing to suggest. Which is a shame, since this is one of the finest urban trails I have ever run!\n\nEnjoy.\n\nFor more on the greenway, visit: http://bit.ly/IHHB4o", "business_id": "cBoFcjuNaWDQ2MP7GgeSBA", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-05-03", "type": "review"}

I have lived through their growing pains, their remodeling, and their re-birth. Right now, the HGI is at the top of their game.\n\nThe lobby was recently redecorated and has a crisp, modern feel. I liked the old wood-heavy look, but this open-space, airy look is also quite nice. The front desk staff is very friendly although I would love to see the check-in process streamlined. (The Hyatt Andaz has you check in with a personal concierge, and other hotels are completely done on iPads.) \n\nThe rooms are spacious enough; I usually get a 2-room suite with a jacuzzi. While I rarely use the jacuzzi, I like the second room for the extra space. The hotel maid staff is fantastic. Day after day they do an amazing job of making my place look fresh. On occasion, a maid does forget to replenish coffee or leave conditioner in the bath, but a call to the front desk fixes that.\n\nUnlike some who complain, I like the location of the hotel. It's off the main strip, but only takes a 5 minute stroll in this very walkable and safe city. Within minutes I'm at the Mint Museum, at the Epicenter for a movie, relaxing on the Green, or in a number of great restaurants.\n\nSpeaking of restaurants, the HGI on-site restaurant is quite good. The selections change several times a year and everything is delicious. A giant helping of hummus for $5? Yes, please. Fresh fish? Excellent.\n\nThere's free on-site laundry which is worth staying here alone. The fitness center is small, but this is a hotel (and a budget one at that), not a Gold's Gym (which is a few blocks over.) \n\nRegulating temperatures in the room can be tricky depending on what kind of thermostat your room(s) have. The WiFi issues seem to have been resolved, thanks to lots of complaining and that the Democratic National Convention came through last year. Yes, the street can be a little noisy with a siren from time to time, but I'm from Cleveland. I sleep better with noise.\n\nTip: Ask for a room that looks over the NASCAR museum. The lights on the building coupled with the lights on the Duke Energy Tower are a lot of fun.", "business_id": "cBoFcjuNaWDQ2MP7GgeSBA", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-03-06", "type": "review"}

I'm giving it 3 stars for the great customer service. They definitely had that down. But that's about it. This hotel is highly overpriced and the valet sucked! One night cost us $183 altogether with tax. Almost $200 to stay in a hotel in CHARLOTTE, NC? You've got to be kidding me. I pay less than that per night in Miami and Vegas and the hotels are better.\n\nThis hotel is old but you can tell they've tried to do some renovations. However, we had to literally SLAM our bathroom door to get it to close. The beds in our room reminded me of something from middle school...very juvenile looking. Double beds don't have to look that juvenile...geesh. The rooms are also pretty small. \n\nAND valet sucked! One evening there was a lot of traffic and my car was parked in their overflow lot. Okay...I can understand this. But I wonder how far the overflow lot was because they returned my car to me on E. It was getting close to E but was definitely not close enough to where it should have been returned on E.\n\nUpon checking out, valet service was the worse! They literally lost my car. They could not remember where it was parked. I would say the evening before it took them 20 minutes to bring my car...this time had to take around 30. The valet attendants even kept saying, \"You're still here?\" I'm not sure how many times I heard that.\n\nOn another note...housekeeping did come by with a complimentary bottle of water the evening we were there. It was a nice gesture...but maybe they should check and see how many guests are booked for each room because there were 2 of us and we were not about to share that one bottle of water. \n\nOn an end note...some creeps were staying on our floor. They must have watched us walk into our room late that night even though we tried our best to make sure they did not see which room we went into. And it didn't help that our room was back in the cut on the 14th floor. You would have definitely thought our room was a housekeeping room due to where it was located. Anyway, the creeps started doing the creepiest knock on our door at around 2am. It sounded like a knock off a horror movie. They left and came back a few times so we had to call the front desk and ask them to patrol our floor. My best-friend told me while I was in the shower the next morning, the creeps came back doing the same scary knock...glad I made it out of the Omni okay! \n\nAll in all, I truly appreciate their great customer service but I would never stay here again unless it was for free.", "business_id": "QThlnQ7AvzZwXHKD5DjdCw", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-03-22", "type": "review"}

Even we have updated our toilets in our 90's home.  Not only slow, but also looked like it was going to overflow every time.

Charlotte is an outrageously overpriced city for hotel accommodations, so we wanted to try a B&B to get away from the expensive chains. The Inn is an adorable home in a residential area of Charlotte. We stayed in the Solarium and I would highly recommend it. The room was decorated like Blanche's home from the Golden Girls and the some of the furniture may have been falling apart, but that only added to the charm. If I expected cookie cutter perfection, I would have stayed at a chain. Our room was very quiet even though it was next to the parking lot, front desk and lobby!  The breakfast was nothing to write home about, but suitable for the price we paid.  The Inn was also just minutes away from all of the attractions we wanted to seen I would absolutely stay here again!", "business_id": "tGpSzj-PX3yD5DIbOFhkPg", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-03-28", "type": "review"}

I repeat, THIS IS A STATION REVIEW! I don't care if a train is on-time, late, or not running at all. That's a problem for another review. What I want to tackle here is the ode to modernist architecture that is the Charlotte Amtrak Station. This thing, oy. \n\nLet's start with the fact that it's a station with multiple overnight passengers, but they maintain one vending machine and one coke machine that sells--get this--Pepsi. Foul language may have tumbled out of my mouth when I stumbled into the station past midnight to see that sorry sight. Bless their little hearts. \n\nThen we can turn to the actual lobby of the station. The imposing (?) concrete (?) walls (?) that tower two whole stories up and are finished with thrown gravel both inside and out do bring to mind a certain era. It's like the 1960s municipal architecture experience has never been reconsidered. The thrown gravel panels inside the building are an odd choice, but I understand that we don't all have the money for good taste. \n\nThe benches are hard and of a certain era when people were meant to slide off them, I think. I certainly did. There was some sleep to be had, and I appreciated that it was quiet and safe inside the station...even though the station was ugly. And it is ugly. Don't visit hoping to see one of the great humanist temples of old. But consider taking a nap on the benches...provided you are a ticketed passenger, of course. \n\nAccessibility notes: Doors open in. Ramps are plentiful. Well-lit. Braille signage.

I've been to several USO's at airports, and this is a very impressive one. Although it doesn't have showers and beds like some of the other ones I've seen, this one has this feel like it's one of those red-carpet airport clubs because it has the big fancy leather recliners with a large flat-screen TV, and another room in case you don't like what's playing in the main room.  It's got 3 computers for internet access, a couple of large round bar tables sitting just across a counter full of free food, sodas, hot dogs, baked goods, etc.  There's a section of 2 small TVs for PS2/xbox, and a small room for young toddlers to keep busy.  The USO is always a place I go when I have time in between flights, even if I'm not traveling on official Army duty.  It's typically operated by volunteers, so I make it a habit to go sign in to show that it's being utilized.  Even if you're not in the military, you can still go up to the 2nd floor where the USO entrance is at, and usually find some free seating even when the downstairs chairs are all taken.\n\nOne funny thing about the Charlotte airport is how busy it was one moment, and then how deserted it was the next.  Our flight must have arrived some time after 9pm. After a quick stop at the Tequileria restaurant, we went to the USO and milled around a bit.  Then we came back downstairs right after 10pm, and most of the stores and the food court were closed.  It must have only been about 10-15 minutes where before the airport was bustling with people, to what seemed like a twilight zone episode.  \n\nThis airport is pretty nice because most of the shopping/food places are centrally located.

Most of the flights out of here are USAir, yet the security gate by the USAir counters don't seem to staff accordingly.  The wait times can differ by 30 minutes.\n\nARRIVING:\nBaggage will always be late here. If you're being picked up at night, have your ride pick you up on the top level where the departures are. There are very few flights departing at night and this area is usually empty.\n\nCONNECTING/WAITING:\nThere's enough to keep you occupied during a connection here. Most of the stores are lame and I don't know how you can have multiple outlets of Lids under one roof but they manage.\n\nThe livelier bar is the Bacardi bar on Concourse D towards the international gates. It looks to be the airport singles scene.  There's also a locking 'family' bathroom right by it. This is sometimes used by boozy travelers who are looking for an easier alternative to the mile high club. I am certainly not promoting it but just letting you know it happens. I prefer the atrium bar for the people watching.\n\nSome of the public restrooms are staffed by attendants who solicit tips and maintain order, so bring your 1's and don't expect to run into your senator here. \n\nIf you want to nap, the rotunda around the D gates again are usually the most vacant and should give you some space to spread out.  You also don't get the annoying beeping carts down here as much.  They do sweep the airport at night and make you leave the secured area so don't expect an overnight stay.  The airport is not in a nice area of town so all decent hotels are about a 15 minute drive.\n\nEATING:\nThe restaurant lineup is constantly changing for better or worse.

It's not like there's a better airport in town for me to fly out of.  I also doubt that the owner of Charlotte-Douglas Airport is going to read my review and send me an email apologizing for his business' poor service and terrible product like a restaurant owner would do.  Writing an airport review is as futile an effort as catching wind with a net, but I'm going to do it anyway.  \n\nParking here is cheap and shuttle service from the various lots and garages is good.  The airport is quite clean; especially the restrooms.  To me, these are the airport's only redeeming qualities.  \n\nTraffic flow at the arrival and departure gates = pure misery.  \n\nThe TSA force here is unfriendly and inefficient.  Large airports like LGA and BWI run their security efficiently and I find that the lines move much more quickly than they do with the hapless crews they have in this town.  I have to disagree with my friend Nicole W. about Checkpoint A.  Standing in this never-ending line is like eating a misery cookie that's been dipped in s#@%.  A couple months ago the line from the Delta counter nearly ran out the doors while those of us not checking bags were forced to wait in this line rather than being able to use a kiosk to print our boarding passes.  \"What was wrong with the kiosks?\" you ask.  One of the three was out of order, but the other two were simply out of paper.  I suppose that one of the Delta representatives sitting on his thumb behind the counter couldn't take care of it.  Par for the course at CLT.  \n\nThe food selection here is miserable (are you sensing a trend here?).  I tend to always end up at Tequilaria, but the place smells like damp Clorox rags and fruit flies buzz around the bar.  There seem to be a lot of positive reviews about there being a Bojangles at the airport, but I can say that a Cajun chicken breast and a biscuit is not what I'm looking for when faced with the proposition of sitting in front of screaming children on a cross-country flight.  I give the food options a D-.  \n\nThe only airports I hate more than my hometown airport are Memphis and Kansas City.  Memphis looks like a prison and Kansas City is just really weird.

I went to the Caribbean via US Air and had to transfer here twice. The first time I was able to sneak onto the early flight in the adjacent gate, so I didn't spend much time here. The second time though, I had a 3 hour layover, so I was able to do some wandering.\n\nCustoms and Immigration was about average in terms of time and service. When I got through, I had to go through security again. This was the main weird part for me. There was a VERY high tech security scanning system that was not your typical metal detector. You have to stand and turn and then they scan you. JFK is my main airport, and nothing there even comes close to the CIA system in place here. And it's safe to say JFK has a much higher demand for an elaborate security system than CDT. \n\nMy next complaint was that the result of this security system, the line moved verrrryyyyyy slowwwwly. It was not streamlined at all, and it took much longer than necessary because the employees were just really laid back and not in any rush. This didn't affect me because I'm a lunatic who leaves exorbitant amounts of time in between airline connections, but it IS a US Air hub and some people need to make their connections! Pick up the pace guys!\n\nOnce I got through, there was a nice central atrium with Adirondack chairs and then dated low-ceilinged hubs with generic seating areas. The central atrium was actually pleasant to spend some time in. As far as food goes, there was typical stuff, but also a Papa John's. It's nice to not have to rely on Sbarro and Famous Famiglia, and my Papa John's was pretty tasty.

Just in the past 5 years, CLT has expanded the terminal, added new parking decks, and refurbished the baggage claim area (which is MUCH better than it used to be). In the next 5 years, CLT is planning to expand the roadway outside the airport, add an extension to the E terminal, add another security checkpoint, build 2 new parking decks, and make various improvements to the airport including many new restaurants. \n\nFlying through CLT is extremely easy. The airport is layout is like a hand--1 terminal with 5 \"wings\" if you will. Concourse A belongs to Delta, airTran, American, United, and Air Canada Jazz. Concourses B and C belong to US Airways domestic travel. Concourse D is home to US Airways international travel, some US Airways domestic travel, jetBlue, and the daily Lufthansa flight to Munich. Concourse E is home to US Airways Express. D and E are the newest concourses, and are very nice. Concourse D was just redone, adding a lounge area complete with sushi and Pinkberry, which is delicious. \n\nSecurity wait times are usually manageable, and with the new addition coming in June of a 5th security checkpoints, security should be a breeze. I have found staff to be pretty friendly all around. Delays are usually not bad at CLT, and runway congestion is nearly absent with the addition of a 4th runway at Charlotte. Charlotte offers a wide variety of destinations, including European cities such as Frankfurt, Munich, and Rome. Overall, an airport that's rapidly improving. Another nice touch is that WiFi is free. They also have volunteer piano players in the atrium on certain days, which is really fantastic to listen to.\n\nTo read more about the expansion, head over to the airport's web site.

So I walked up to a goodwill ambassador named Dottie. \n\nI've always admired the airport goodwill ambassadors, or courtesy hosts.  I remember seeing the guys and gals in Denver with the cowboy hats and western glow in their faces... and tags that read \"volunteers\".  Volunteers!  Gotta love folks like that.  They just stone-cold love their city that much, and want to share their enthusiasm.  Sometimes I look at them, and their eager faces, as they scan for someone who might want to know why the Rockies are wonderful or why Colorado is a great place to send your kid to study minerology, and I see them identify a potential convert but then watch them walk by, and I think how sad it is when someone full of love wants to share it and is not granted the chance.  [I know, it's kind of a bit much that I read the sometimes-sadness of the human condition in the gazes of a Stetson-bedecked airport welcoming committee.  But still.  You get me.]\n\nBack to Dottie...  \n\nI approached her.  She identified me as an in-bound inquiry on the verge of happening.  So she launched into Phase One of her professional routine... \n\nShe smiled at me.\n\nOk, wait, that previous sentence didn't do the trick.  I wrote it wrong.  What I'm trying to say is that she SMILED at me.  High wattage.  Mega dosage.  Not too much, but also not nearly too little.  Splendid.  Brightness.  Warmth.  Like a force of nature.  But a force of nature that cared for you (like a breeze in the tropics), not a tsunami.\n\nMan, it was one helluva smile.  You want to talk about feeling welcome someplace?  I didn't just feel welcome in Charlotte.  I felt welcome on Planet Earth.  \n\nPeople talk about aptitude for certain kinds of work.  Whoever thought up the idea (perhaps it was her) to have Dottie deploy her radiant smile as a greeter or goodwill ambassador was just simply very skilled at career suitability identification.\n\nHaving encountered something so special, I felt funny asking something so mundane: where to get a cuppa joe.  But she rocked it.  And I walked away.\n\nAnd I thought... Christian, you can't just walk away from a gift like that.  You gotta acknowledge it.  So I went back and I did.  And I learned something interesting...\n\n\"Dottie, I'm Christian.\"\n\"Nice to meet you.\"\n\"I just want to tell you that your smile is really something wonderful and I'm glad I encountered it and its owner.\"\nIf you can believe it, the smile intensified.  \n\"You have no idea how much I needed to hear that today.  Thank you.\"\n\nAnd as I walked away, I marveled at what she'd just said.  Here she was, a professional and sincere dispenser of human warmth, who needed some herself.  I guess guardian angels sometimes need guarding, too.", "business_id": "3Q0QQPnHcJuX1DLCL9G9Cg", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-03-02", "type": "review"}

This is my fourth time at this airport, and overall my feels on it are 'meh'- not good but not bad. \n\nThe Good:\nSecurity was fast and friendly. I was through the line in about 10 minutes, and cleared to go in about 20 total. I opt out of the body scanners, which takes a little longer but lessons the radiation I'm exposed too. I'm all about saving my future self from slowly dying of radiation poisoning after 20 years of going through body scanners. \nThe airport itself is pretty- one of the prettiest I've been too. They have a tree lined terminal with giant windows on one side, risking chairs to sit and reflect, and lots of shops and even a spa to visit if you're laid over here (or misread your flight time and arrive three hours early like me). They have free wifi, clean facilities, a variety of food choices, and an overall friendly atmosphere. As I write this I'm seating in the waiting area by my gate, and the chairs are surprisingly comfy. Not your standard cold, hard, awkwardly uncomfortable chairs. \n\nThe Bad:\nThings are EXPENSIVE. By things I mean food and beverages. I know they jack up prices in airports, but $18 for two breakfast tacos and a sprite is absurd. That's like end of the world pricing. \nAs I try to save this draft, I notice that their free wifi wont let me continue without an error message. I have since turned off my wifi and am on my phone's 3G instead. No problems anymore, but I think the wifi is useless if you can't navigate pages online. \nThe woman who did my opt out patting down was a moron. Apparently she just couldn't grasp the concept that I was traveling with a laptop, a laptop bag, and a carry-on suitcase. I spent a good three minutes trying to make her understand that all three of the boxes/tray/item holders that people use to put their stuff through the X-ray were mine. A sample of our conversation:\nMe: 'I have the laptop, the next container, and the black suitcase' :points to all three:\nHer: 'the laptop is yours?' :points to laptop:\nMe: 'yes, and the next two items' :points again:\nHer: 'so not the laptop, this bag is yours?'\nMe: 'the laptop IS mine, and the bag, and the suitcase. All of them are mine' :points again:\nHer: 'so just the suitcase?'\nOH. MY. GOSH. Are you an idiot???? How many ways do I need to say this for you to understand???? And you're supposed to be 'protecting' citizens from terrorists?? You can't grasp the concept of traveling with three items, what the hell are you good for? Unfortunately, I can't really curse out a TSA agent without facing potential black-listing, and as much as I enjoy the airport ('they have chairs....') I don't want to become a real life Tom Hanks and live in the airport. So I just shut up and let her figure it out, with the help of a coworker. \n\nI think airports should have a resident MD on staff at the ticket counter to dispense Xanax to make the flying process less stressful.

I'm not sure if that was organized, though...\n\nOutlets:  I've never noticed any, but I'm sure there are some somewhere.  Not optimal.\n\nFood/Drink:  Pretty much anything you could ever want.  Junk food, fast food, sit down, coffee, dessert, booze.  Off hand I can think of TCBY, Jamba Juice, Bojangles, Starbucks, Seattle's best,  and hundreds of other places.  Good haul.  Definitely one of my favorite airports to eat in.\n\nCliental:  Most of the people connecting here seem to be on their way to the beach.  That being said, there are so many of the world' SLOWEST walkers.  So annoying when you're trying to make a connection in less than 10 minutes.  I could walk faster than the people standing on the moving walkways.  Giant pet peeve.  The airport needs to post signs or something.\n\nGates:  As this is a US Airways hub, don't assume your gates will be close.  The express terminals are located in the E terminal.  B and I believe C now are the large US Airways flights.  I have almost died of a heart attack running from the far end of B to E.  It's not a small feat.\n\nMoving Walkways:  Many!

Without an excuse to leave the gate, my opinion of CLT would have remained justifiably low.\n\nHeading towards the terminal building, a few things became apparent:\n1) Some parts of the airport haven't been touched in years. Others are just fine.\n2) US Airways is the dominant carrier.\n3) Rocking chairs make for happier passengers.\n4) Security checkpoints are at the front so passengers don't have to go through multiple checkpoints to connect between concourses.\n\nThe terminal itself is reasonably modern with adequate signage, moving sidewalks, a variety of shops and restaurants, dozens upon dozens of the aforementioned rocking chairs and scattered power outlets.

Between 4/4/2009 and today, I've departed from or arrived at this airport over 100 times. I've also gotten a couple of gate passes to escort my daughter through security.\n\nCLT is still a good airport for layovers. Lots of restaurant options from a fancy wine bar to a sit down burger joint, plus a full spectrum of fast food. The main atrium even has a pretty good barbecue spot if you're looking for Carolina 'cue and can't leave the secure zone.\n\nFor those departing from CLT, you can use *any* of the security checkpoints. Unlike some airports (Newark), once you're inside Charlotte you can go to any gate. The line at A is usually pretty long, so feel free to wander up to B or C if they look shorter.\n\nSouthwest, United and Delta are in the A concourse. American is also there but might be moving as a result of the merger. JetBlue and Lufthansa are in D, I believe.\n\nTips:\n- Rental car franchises are not located in the terminal - you do have to catch your company's shuttle bus.\n- There's not a smoking lounge inside the secure area. You have to go outside and follow the signs.\n- B and E checkpoints have TSA Precheck lines. Other checkpoints have \"elite\" security queues which are not specific to just US Airways. Any elite passenger is allowed to use it!\n- There are TWO US Airways Clubs. With US moving to the OneWorld alliance, American Airlines folks who have Admiral's Club access can use these clubs.\n\nConsider trying Park 'N Go instead of Business Valet.

I may understand people to complain how this once humble and low-key airport has grown into this major hub, but it's honestly a great airport.\n\nFrom a functionality standpoint, this is actually one o the best airports I've ever been to. Betwen the moment I lzft the plane and got my suitcase, barely 20 minutes had passed. Talk about efficiency! This resulkts in this airport being actually great for layovers. I have not been through border controls here, but from what i've heard it's astonishingly swift. Also, the staff members here are honestly some of the nicest, most courteous people I've seen at an airport (and given that many were US Ariways employees, that's saying a lot). Finally, there are so many eateries here. I got to the airport early for a morning flight, and got a stunning breakfast there.\n\nBut I do indeed have two concerns with CLT. First off, there are far too many constructions going on, which ruins the scenery. I understand that it is a rapidly growing airport (it's US Airways' largest hub) and that it is expected to grow even more in the near future with a large increase in European destinations, but the management of the airport should be more organized with its growth. Then, the different piers/terminals are ridiculously laid out. This is the kind of airport where you may have to run from one end to the other to catch a connecting flight. \n\nIn general, CLT is an amazing airport, and certainly the BEST I've seen in the US. This is an airport with a promising future, and with the rise of Charlotte as a great American city, I'm looking forward to seeing it again in the coming years.", "business_id": "3Q0QQPnHcJuX1DLCL9G9Cg", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-04-19", "type": "review"}

Having arranged for the car to be towed to a dealer for repair, I contacted Hertz Car Rental to arrange a rental to be picked up at the airport when my flight arrived in Charlotte at 11:00 pm on a Sunday evening.  I made the reservation using the Hertz 800 number and requested a mid-size car for 3 days.\n As I felt under some duress, I accepted the discounted rate of $ 350.00 for the 3 days.  When I arrived in Charlotte, I was assigned a two year old VW Jetta that had 50000 miles on it and no cruise control.  I also discovered the following morning that despite the fact that the car was registered in Pennsylvania, it was not equipped with an ice scrapper - which I needed.  In addition, I later discovered that there was no manual with the car and no indication of how to open the fuel hatch - I asked my mechanic who figured it out.\n After I had returned the car, I contacted the Hertz customer service people in the hope that they would make some adjustment - because I felt the rate was unreasonably high and the vehicle provided was well below what I think is the industry standard.  The customer service agent was unsympathetic and made no adjustment to my final bill of $354.00.\n The bottom line is that I paid almost $120.00 per day for a substandard vehicle - this does not include any of the extras such as cdw all of which I declined - it is just the rental fee.  If you think I should have done some comparison shopping for my rental, you are correct but I was far from home and worried about my damaged car.  You may be sure that I will do the comparison shopping when I next need a rental vehicle and the Hertz will be excluded from the set of candidates.", "business_id": "eThu9hCL8NOjOxswQ-cFSg", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-03-21", "type": "review"}

I have been a gold member since 2012 and had switched over to only using Hertz for all of my rental needs. I went to Las Vegas once and was given an upgrade to a convertible from a midsize sedan as my first experience with the company. I had always been treated like a VERY valued customer of theirs... Until Tuesday night at 12am... First we were waiting for the shuttle on a night where we had been in airports, and cramped up airplanes all day. And I mean all day. We were told this was the last night that the shuttle would be operating because all the rental companies were relocating to the actual garage across from the airport. We were asked to move 3 times while waiting for the shuttle and because of this drama we missed two shuttles and finally got the third one. Once we walked up to the shuttle the driver seemed very upset and overall just plain angry. He didn't say a word to either of us as he grabbed our bags and pretty much threw them in the luggage bin. Once we were sitting down and he started driving away I asked him how his day went and he very loudly states that after that night he would be getting fired since there will be no more use for a driver when all the cars get moved over to the garage. Then we sat in awkward silence until we arrived at the Hertz location by the airport. Once inside there were 3 customers in front of me, but there seemed to be a lot of people working, just nobody else decided to lend a hand with customers. It was about 12:10am when we first started waiting for the shuttle by the time I actually was being waited on it was almost 1am. The woman working that night was rude to me from the moment I stepped up to her counter. She was talking to me like I was an idiot and was being very short with me. I simply asked her how her night was going and she shoots me this look and says \"how do you think it's going?\"... I'm like wow, ok. Then she starts being rude about me purchasing the car off of a third party website and how I cannot have my free upgrade that I was offered in an email sent to me from my Gold Membership. Then she asks me how many bags I have and I tell her, she laughs and gives me keys to the smallest car I've ever seen in my entire life. When I walked out to the lot and I saw this tiny car that was seriously smaller than a smart car... I walked right back up to the office and asked her if it was a joke. She said she would give me a bigger car if I paid more money for another car. I said no way. I showed her the picture in my phone of the car (or similar) that the email I received from Hertz told me I would have and I told her that the car she gave me was half the size of the car I should have had. She basically told me too bad and I flipped out. I told her my luggage would not even fit in there and she said to me, \"next time you need to buy a bigger car\"... I mean WOW!!!!! I had been on planes ALL DAY and I did not need some woman telling me what I need to do in the future. The level of poor service was ridiculous I was in total shock standing there at that desk. She was such an awful person, I cannot believe Hertz would hire such NASTY people to work there. After pretty much begging she finally gave us a bigger car. A car that actually fits our things and us Comfortably. I should not have had to beg for something that I was promised, that I had paid for months prior. Even though we got the car we needed for our stay here in Charlotte I'm so disgusted with my experience. It seriously was an awful day/night before I even went to get the car. I was so stressed out after dealing with the car situation with little miss nasty attitude that I cried my eyes out all the way to my hotel. I even got up the next day, called my mom in Oregon to tell her how awful this rental experience was and started crying again. What a fabulous way to start a vacation. Mind you, the first vacation I've had in 3 years. Never again Hertz... You as a whole company have disappointed me and would have to make a miracle happen to gain me back as a customer. I even cut up my gold membership card already.\nSincerely,\nYour once very happy now non-existent customer...I\n\nLaura,\nI appreciate you replying to my review I hope that you do try to make this right because to be completely honest with you our drop off experience was not as bad as our pick up but very close.

There is also a  Cracker Barrel restaurant across the street and McDonald and a couple other fast food places close bye. (2) Staff is very friendly and welcoming.

Processed scrambled eggs, a pork product, hard  stale biscuit, a crock pot of sausage gravy, dried cereal, and your choice of stale pastries/bread.  \n\nCONS:  (1) Hotel is very old and grungy looking (2) Our room was very very run down and dirty.  It truly needed a paint job, new carpet, fixtures and furniture.  The two chairs provided in the room where heavily stained to the point of being unusable.   (3) Size of the bathroom.  I don't think i have ever seen a bathroom that small before.  I would imagine bathing small children extremely difficult because turning around after getting out of the shower was tough!  (4)  Cleanliness.  As stated above this place is grungy.  (5)Lack of amenities.  For a hotel located within close proximity of a major theme park, one would think they would invest in amenities but no.  The pool was empty (no water) mid may.  So glad I didn't send the kids on ahead to the pool.  No one bothered to tell us that the pool was out of commission.  I should also mentioned that it was not roped or taped off.  Anyone could just walk right up to that empty pool and fall in.  \n\nHowever, it is in the process of being renovated. In its current state, I would not recommend it.

Our bed was SO COMFORTABLE, i think i actually miss it.  Since our room didn't have a shower (which we knew when we booked - well worth it to have that awesome bathtub!), I used the shared bathroom on the second floor which was also very nice and cozy.  Breakfast the next day was so nice.  Craig made homemade cranberry orange muffins with a cheesy kale egg dish - so yummy!  Everyone else got delicious smelling bacon, and Craig very awesomely made me veggie breakfast sausage.  There was also pineapple, juice, and a really great tea selection.  The conversation was also really nice - I like that we all ate together (me, my boyfriend, Craig, and the 5 other guests who were staying there.  Great people and great company.

I thought initially it was going to be an amazing hotel, since I totally screwed up on the reservation (made it for the wrong day) and the girl at the desk was so cool to work with me and get me a room when the whole place was fully booked.  \n\nExcept, the place was fully booked for the \"Little Miss Junior Miss\" Pageant, or some other stupid name like that, which meant HELL for Andy and I as the entire place was infested with pre-teen beauty queens, their scary domineering mothers, and other random siblings that came along for the ride.  Can you say O. M. G.  \n\nNow, normally this would be a non-issue, as we are rarely in our hotel room except to sleep and once in the room you couldnt hear a lot of hallway noise.  But this 10 story hotel had a grand total of 2 elevators, which were packed at all hours of the day with girls in gowns and tiaras, groups of girls in heavy makeup, or wet children dripping from the hotel pool. This made getting in and out a bit challenging since we were on the top floor. \n\nI realize this is hardly Marriotts fault that the Junior Misses had descended upon Middleton, since they are just trying to turn a buck in this economy, but the design of this place was not user friendly in the slightest.  Also, hey brilliant idea guys, put the pool across the hall from the elevator and then make that whole area tile so people track water out and the floor is slippery!  Nice.  And also understaff the dining area so noone can get in and eat because there is noone to clean off the tables and take your order.  Nice planning!\n\nMan, that whole experience left a bad taste.

It's disturbing that Parent's lives are so unfulfilled that they have to dress their children like Cocktail waitresses at a seedy bar. \nThe hotel was totally booked. You had ten floors worth of rooms, but yet the hotel only had two elevators. It was pretty annoying to wait 15 minutes every time you wanted to go up to your room. \nAnd the kicker was on Sunday morning when we wanted to have breakfast at the hotel restaurant. The hotel had nobody on duty to bus tables, so while it was obvious that the restaurant was half empty, but there was a 15 minute wait to be seated. Of course the hostess acted like an office temp, with a bad attitude. That was a perfect ending to our hell stay at the Marriott-Madison West.

So we messed with it... nada.  So we changed rooms, not a big deal.  We went right next door.  That room was the same as the last.  Downsides to this room though, the phone was dirty... I knew this cause the phone was tan/beige colored.  It was yucky.  Also, the tub liner in the first room was filthy.  Another thing I wish this hotel would change is installing fans in the bathrooms!  My boyfriend also pointed out that the sheets on the bed were super starched.   If you moved it sounded like sandpaper on sandpaper.  Madness.  I did have a odd triangle shaped hole in the sheets on my side of the bed...so that was less than plesant too.

I recently attended an evening Board meeting and a one-day conference at this hotel.\n\nThe majority of the sales and catering staff at the Marriott were wonderful to work with.  This was the first time we hosted at event at this location.  The responsiveness of the staff was superb in setting up the event.  There were proactive in keeping our group on track with logistical issues leading up to the event.  On the day of the event, they checked in on us frequently and promptly addressed any concerns our group had.\n\nWe had some problems with the reservations agents indicating that no rooms were available at the conference rate.  The other problem has to do with the layout of the conference rooms.  There is one conference room (the Monona Room) located by the front desk, far away from all the other meeting rooms.  On the day before the event, you guessed it; the Marriott staff moved us to that room.  The calendar of events is not conspicuous, so on the day of the event, all the conference attended entered the facility through the conference center doors and wandered about searching for the Monona Room.\n\nLike most conference facility, the food was a mixed bag.\n\nThings I liked:\n* I enjoyed the caesar salad served with lunch with fresh greens (no iceberg lettuce), tangy dressing and herbed croutons that did not go overboard with the salt or garlic.\n\n* Other than the overcooked noodles, the penne pasta with mushroom, spinach, goat cheese, pine nuts and roasted red pepper cream was a well-executed dish.\n\n* While the filling had a bit too much citrus flavor, kudos to the kitchen staff for serving us a cannoli with a crunchy shell, a rarity on the conference food circuit.\n\nThings I didn't:\n* The rigatoni with fennel sausage, roasted peppers and arriabiatta sauce lacked the finesse of the aforementioned penne pasta dish.  With its mushy noodles, overcooked sauce and under-seasoned sausage, there was little to like.\n\n* If you enjoy a heavy does of garlic powder on bread with the texture of a teething biscuit, you would love the garlic bread served with the pasta course.\n\n* My least favorite dish was toasted cheese sandwich served during the planning session the day before the conference.  For $14.95, I expected aged cheddar served on gently grilled slices of artisan sourdough bread.  What I received was very different.  Served barely warm, the bread was soaked in butter and toasted to a brick-like texture that left cuts on the roof of my mouth.  The institutional grade cheddar and provolone cheese had started to congeal by the time the staff served it to me.  The server did not check in with us because she didn't want to interfere with our meeting, preventing me from sending this dish back for a replacement.  The roasted tomato soup, though cool, was the redeeming feature of my meal.\n\nOverall, the experience with the Marriott Madison West was A-OK, based on the positive interactions with the staff, which offset the spotty food quality.", "business_id": "ckLRf3lYn9DxmNxd-mu2yA", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-05-04", "type": "review"}

Four hours later, I found a maintenance worker myself who immediately came to the room and replaced the lamp. There is no fan in the bathroom, but that's not much of an issue because there isn't much steam since the water only gets lukewarm at best. On 4-21-14, at 3:44am I was unpleasantly shocked awake by a very loud alarm somewhere in the hall outside my room. I later found out that it was thought to be due to a dirty smoke detector. That increased my confidence in the overall cleanliness of the facility. On 4-22-14, I was appalled that a housekeeper walked into the room without even knocking. That was very frightening to hear a key card clicking in my door when I didn't have any guests!  There are six pieces of fruit put out on the front desk each morning.

The guest area, or as they call it, the \"gathering room\" is very warm & inviting.   Here you can sit to meet with others, read a book, select a wine, or enjoy complementary drinks such as coffee, tea or soda with some light snacks available as well.

There is a king sized bed, a gas fireplace, nice sized TV, with good cable channels, or use of a DVD (you can borrow DVD's from the gathering room), free wifi, a small fridge, sink, and two comfortable chairs to melt into.

Around the far there are several trails to use, winding you past the barn, sheep, a lama and various beds for wild flowers, herbs and vegetables.   \n\nAs my wife and I walked the grounds and headed back to the Inn, we passed a good sized gazebo which seemed to beckon us in for a look.  Inside there are a few comfortable chairs, wine cooler,  a DVD player (with aux connections) and some wine glasses just waiting to be used.   We sat in there for a while and we actually had plans on going out on the town.  However, this entire scenery before us was extremely relaxing... the woods, birds singing, farm animals grazing about, all made for an extremely, wonderful  relaxing environment we simply could not walk away from.

The breakfast freshly made by the Inn Keepers, Pat & Bob, is made up of several courses; fruit, scones, beacon and eggs, all of which was eaten with delight and a perfect ending chapter of our stay at the Speckled Hen Inn B&B.  \n\nThe attention given by the Inn Keepers, Pat & Bob is perfect.  They have really taken care of many of your needs in advance simply by setting up the Inn & Grounds really well.  They are both attentive and engaging while at the same time not being overbearing.   They really do have it well balanced!   \n\nObviously, my wife & I will be checking back in here again.  So, if you are looking for a place to get away from to unwind, (which is only a short drive from the Capitol Square) or in need of some quite time, then this is the place for you!   \n\nThanks Speckled Hen, for such a relaxing time and creating some wonderful memories!!!", "business_id": "FrT0OQFkUZBtfoW3V1Wpfw", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-05-20", "type": "review"}

No one has come even close to Bob & Pat's place. My husband constantly says \"every other B&B either does the 'bed' part really well, or the 'breakfast' part really well, but never both.\" Well, The Speckled Hen does everything perfectly. Upon arrival, there are 3 different types of cookies to choose from, different coffees, teas and sodas to grab for the room, and a wine cellar if you want to purchase inexpensive (but yummy) wine. The rooms are all huge with large bathrooms with jacuzzis. We've stayed in the Token Creek and Starkweather rooms - both are beautiful and we love the gas fireplaces to keep us cozy and warm. The location is perfect if you want to get away from the college kids. Its about a 15 minute drive outside of Madison, but secluded on 40+ acres with a full farm with chickens, sheep and Happy (the nicest dog in the world). The breakfasts keep me up at night in anticipation. They are each 3-4 courses of both sweet and savory options. The fresh smoked bacon with homemade maple glaze (Bob taps his own trees to make homemade maple syrup) is outstanding, the scrambled eggs look like simple, nothing fancy eggs, but they have so much flavor! I love the homemade grape sorbet they usually serve at the conclusion of the meal. You cannot go wrong at The Speckled Hen.

A touch of Victorian but updated. Our room was the Cedar Creek room with a bathroom and whirlpool and double shower and gas fireplace. Extremely clean throughout. Very quite.

Fresh squeezed orange juice, eggs, Bober bread, bacon with maple syrup, baked tomato with pesto. Absolutely fabulous!

The Grandstay was perfect and well under neighboring Staybridge, Residence Inn and others.\n\nWe had never heard of the chain before and found it on Expedia. It was perfect.

In general I've found it quite pleasant and worry-free. The cars have been in good shape, and only occasionally completely full. Amenities include at least a snack car (fuller food service on the City of New Orleans route), electrical outlets for use with your favorite electronic device, and large comfortable seats with plenty of leg-room (I'm over 6 feet tall, and probably wider than I need to be). Additionally, the terminals at either end of the line are clean and pleasant, although the waiting area in Chicago's Union Station can be a bit hot and crowded.\n\nThe only downside is the occasional delay, especially with the long-haul City of New Orleans northbound leg. The station personnel in either terminal are not very good about keeping passengers informed, with explanations and announcements being rare; on-board delays fare better, getting announced/explained roughly half the time. I consider travel delays inevitable in any form of transportation (Chicago by auto at rush hour? fuhgeddaboudit!) given right-of-way  and general operational conditions, but even so they seem somewhat too common, especially on northbound segments.\n\nStill, the price and convenience is a great bargain. I wholeheartedly recommend the service, with the caveat that your schedule needs to be flexible to accommodate the usually-modest delays.\n\nSeptember 2011 update: \nI've been using Amtrak from Champaign more often, most recently in conjunction with CTA to get to and from O'Hare. I continue to have very good experiences in spite of  the usual expected short delays.\n\nI will add that the pricing seems to have changed-- popular times and days have increased in cost, and as usual the City of New Orleans route continues to be the most expensive option.

What really irritated me was the pricing. A king bed is $10.00 more than two beds. Doesn't it make sense that two beds require more labor to launder and make up than one? Whats more, the two beds that are $10.00 less than a king and not queens but doubles. Have you ever tried to sleep with your mate in a double bed? \nI would like to liken this to extortion.

I stayed for four nights while attending a conference at the University of Illinois, and the price was reasonable -- not a fantastic deal or anything, but a fair value.\n\nI'll start with the good stuff.  First of all, their free breakfast is the best I've ever seen at this kind of hotel; they have the standard cereals and pastries and stuff, but they also make custom omelets and hot dishes like home fries, bacon, and sausage, and the coffee is totally decent.  They have a free shuttle to and from the airport, and if you ask nicely, they can sometimes be convinced to shuttle you to other places, like your conference venue.  The rooms are pretty spacious, and they have soaps and shampoos and stuff from Bath and Body Works, which is a step up from the usual.  Oh, and I saw another reviewer complain that there was no wireless in the rooms, but there is now -- I had no trouble connecting.\n\nNow for the not so good.  The walls are apparently paper thin, as I could clearly listen to my neighbors' televisions, discussions, phone calls, and erotic encounters.  The bathroom is incredibly tiny.  And what the hell is up with the water pressure?  I get that they're trying to be green and conserve and all that, but it is not possible to thoroughly wash and rinse one's hair with what amounts to a fine mist spraying lightly from the shower head. \n\nOh, and one other thing.  This place managed to screw up my reservations TWICE, despite the fact that I was travelling for a conference that had a whole block of rooms reserved, presumably for the correct dates.  I called to confirm a few days before my trip, and they had my dates all wrong.  I had them fix it, but I was suspicious, so I called to confirm AGAIN the day before I left, and guess what?  Wrong again.  Seriously.  I'd probably give the place four stars, honestly, if it weren't for the difficulty making reservations.", "business_id": "cKeTgzjvNvLuDTK8R7Ttlg", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-03-07", "type": "review"}

We were a part of a Road Scholars event so we had no choice of hotel. But I have some good news for others who have read the old reviews  -  the place has had a gut rehab.

In the sink and shower the water does eventually get warm  - not hot, but warm enough for me. The bathroom is still small and there is limited counter top space.\nBut a wonderful new thing to brag about. The vanity (you know the counter with a sink in front of a big mirror) is at a wonderful new height - so when I shave I don't have to bend in half to get down to the water.

I have never noticed this in any other hotel. \nThe most outstanding feature of this hotel is the complementary breakfast - I don't say free because it is included in the price of the room.

We have stayed in many different brands and this hotel had the greatest selection I have ever seen - including the made-to-order omlets mentioned by others. Our group had our own breakout room so we could take our food there. But, as others have said, space is limited. Seating is very limited given the size of the hotel.

We soon discovered that we both forgot to bring our toothbrushes and toothpaste and the front desk had some sent up to us right away.\n\nIf you appreciate historic buildings, old school charm, and ghost stories, you have to check this place out, it really is cool.  The value for our room was incredible too!  We only paid 99 bucks for a very large and comfortable two room suite.

While the hotel has a lounge, it's dimly lit and looks like a run down lounge, rather than an upscale destination. \n\nOn St. Patrick's Day, both the lounge and the Irish bar next door throw a big St. Patty's Day party. If you're there for important business, it's not really where you should be staying. If you're there for a sports trip to go to a Suns or Diamondbacks game with a bunch of guys, then it's fine.\n\nThe wireless signal in room 607 was non-existent most of the time, unless you positioned yourself near the window or in a very specific spot on the bed.\n\nThe first night I brought my MacBook Pro down to the lobby to see if I could get a signal. While I could get a signal, there was no where to sit and plug-in, so that option was out. I went over to the brand new Westin Hotel across the street and used the free wi-fi in the lobby lounge. Truth be told, I'd rather have stayed at the Westin, but I was trying to save the company a few dollars. That's a decision I will think twice about in the future.\n\nThe second night, frustrated, I called downstairs to the desk and the woman told me that I should bring my laptop downstairs to see if I could connect, then go back upstairs. What she didn't know is that I've been in the Internet industry for 16-years. When I pleaded to switch rooms, she continued to try and tell me to come downstairs, even though I'd already tried that the night before. When I insisted that she find me another room, she told me the hotel was overbooked. She also started down the road of blaming the customer, saying \"why are you yelling at me?\" I said, I am not yelling at you, I am frustrated because your hotel advertises free wi-fi, now you're telling me I have to come downstairs (which I did the night before) and try to connect, then go back upstairs.\n\nAfter that call, I took my laptop over to the Sheraton, another Starwood Hotel, which is a bit longer of a walk, but it was nice out. I sat in the lobby on their free wi-fi while watching a bit of March Madness on the big screen and enjoying snacks from their convenience shop.\n\nIf you need a wi-fi connection, then stay far far away from this hotel.\n\nNow to the roach. So, I went to take a shower the morning of my departure and found our not so little friend in the bathtub. Gross. I called down and that sent a bell man up to check it out, but it had scurried somewhere by the time he arrived. I took a very quick shower (which took some time to warm, maybe because of the age of the hotel and it's old water system), checked out, and will never go back.\n\nSorry Hotel San Carlos. While you are a charming little old hotel, you're not for me. I can't recommend you.\n\nI will say that the only benefit to this hotel is the barber shop on the ground floor. They were really nice I got a great haircut, but it was $18. And, the hotel is directly on the path of the light rail from the airport, so it's pretty easy to get to. Although the Westin is now right there too, so I'd prefer to stay at the new Westin in the future, given it's proximity to ASU Cronkite School.", "business_id": "_yfprBETaYgySkKyl8ZWMQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-03-22", "type": "review"}

The accommodations and staff of the San Carlos failed to live up to my excitement about staying in a hotel with such a storied past.  The decor of the rooms isn't just dated it is downright tired.  The furniture was chipped and the walls were dingy. \n\nAt home I'm used to a cramped 100 year old bathroom.  However, the peeling paint on every surface including the tiled shower walls felt unclean. Taking a shower was a truly horrible experience with defective plumbing switching the water temperature between scalding hot and freezing cold without warning.\n\nI understand it is an old building with little insulation and the hotel cannot control the noise level of it's guests.  However, being awoken by the cleaning staff's very loud walkie-talkies just outside our door and banging around cleaning the room across the hall was unacceptable. The staff should make every effort to be unobtrusive and quite.\n\nEDIT This was all capped off by being over-billed for each of our two rooms.

Overall though, nice staff, mostly clean but could use some updated carpeting in the rooms and hallways as you can tell stepping off onto one of the floors that they were a bit outdated and not heavily upkept. The bathtubs although not filthy could of been maintained a little better as well. Beds (which to me are the most important) were clean. Nice flat screen TV units. Decent cable and local channels, free Wi-Fi and located right in the heart of downtown Phoenix in walking distance of City Center mall, United Airlines arena and some cool lounges, bars and restaurants.\n\nWould I stay here again...well if my budget was better probably not, but that's just me being high maintenance when it comes to vacations but if I am on a tight budget as I was on this vacay then sure I would most likely stay here again if needed.", "business_id": "_yfprBETaYgySkKyl8ZWMQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-03-15", "type": "review"}

I was sharing a room with two other female colleagues and were appalled at the service we received during our stay. We were already upset with being relocated from the Renaissance Downtown Hotel a few days prior to attending the conference and the awful customer service provided by the hotel added to our negative overall experience with the Marriott franchise. \n\nEarly Tuesday morning, two men came pounding at our door at 2 a.m. They identified themselves as a security guard and a worker at the hotel. They stated that this was our second warning and demanded that we open the door. This was quite alarming being that we never received a first warning for anything and were sincerely concerned about our safety. \n\nWhen we called the front desk to inquire if the two men standing outside were part of the staff of the hotel and to explain to guest services that we should have received a phone call from guest services in the first place, a guest relations worker by the name of Caroline asked us if we planned to continue with the noise level and responded with an unwarranted attitude that there was laughter heard from our room and someone in the room next to us called to complain. We were taken aback by her attitude because while we would have been more than happy to bring our noise level down, we did not expect a representative from guest services to be the one to talk back or respond to us in a matter that was rude and unnecessary when all we wanted to do was to explain to her about our concerns because we did not feel safe. We were extremely alarmed by the way the hotel handled the situation because we felt like our privacy was violated and our safety was jeopardized by these two strangers demanding us to open the door at 2 a.m. To make matters worse, when we brought this issue to the attention of the Front Office Manager, Camille Cobos, she simply made no effort to be apologetic or explain to us why this situation occurred. She simply brushed off our concerns and nonchalantly thanked us for bringing the matter to her attention.\n\nOur office and many of the administrators and faculty at our work frequently travel to various locations across the United States in our line of work. We often choose the Marriott as a top hotel choice for our stay. However, this awful experience at the Phoenix Airport Marriott hotel has made us question the quality of customer service their staff provides to their clientele.  Several of my colleagues also expressed other concerns regarding their stay at this particular Marriott as well. We wrote a letter to the Marriott corporation as well as to the hotel and we have they can take this important matter into consideration and provide positive experiences for current and future Marriott guests as we would not want them to have the same experience as we did. There has not been a response from any Marriott representatives so far since we sent in the letter early March.", "business_id": "_yGo2ubkwQPXcKrdcURSNw", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-04-04", "type": "review"}

So, the General Manager, Jeff Bhatti, replied to the letter that me and my colleagues sent to them about their associate interaction and they basically told us that they received the letter, apologized for any inconvenience.\n\nHe also wrote in the letter:\n\n\"It is our objective to provide each and ever guest a comfortable stay with utmost respect and privacy. Your comments play a critical role in our success and progress. I appreciate the time you took to bring it to my attention. Based on you comments, I have shared my concerns with the staff and emphasized review of our training and procedures. We shall implement and improve any steps needed to ensure that our guests have a positive experience at the hotel. We are grateful for having had many opportunities over several of past years to successfully take care of hospitality needs of our guests while in Phoenix area. We look forward to continue with such relationship and will do our very best to prove our commitment to our objective.\"\n\nWhen we read that letter, we just looked at each other like that was just BS and were not satisfied by the half ass letter we received from the General Manager. First of all, there were spelling errors in the letter, and second of all, for them to say that they provide each and every guest a comfortable stay with the utmost respect and privacy. The two words he used, \"RESPECT\" and \"PRIVACY\" were two elements that the Phoenix Airport Marriott hotel did not demonstrate to us during our time at their hotel. The guest relations worker did not show us RESPECT when she was talking back at us and asking if we planned to make any more noise after I expressed my concern about her sending strange men up to our room w/out any warning or notice to bring down the noise level (which there weren't any, we were just talking in our room. \n\nThere were no music on, no tv on, no blow dryer on, we were just talking our normal tones but I don't know if the walls are just SUPER thin or what but regardless, we should have received a phone call from them in the first place.). For her to say \"So you plan to make more noise next time?\" I wanted to be like \"No B****, I'm not! Stop being so fresh with me because I wasn't even trying to say that!! I was just bringing up my concern that there were two large men standing outside telling us it is our second warning and to OPEN the door when we haven't even received the FIRST warning in the first place!! Now, THAT is wrong and that is a violation of our PRIVACY!! Additionally, my friend told me that when we got into the hotel room, she noticed that those two men .. the SAME men that asked us to open the door, were checking us out at the hotel lobby. They were looking at us up and down which creeped out my friend. Since, we have 3 young ladies staying in the room, WHY THE HELL WOULD WE OPEN THE DOOR to TWO STRANGERS who were checking us out and Open the door for them?! We aren't even sure if they are hotel security. But regardless, the hotel did not make us feel SAFE or COMFORTABLE at all and again, me and my colleagues are extremely disappointed in how the management has handled our concerns.\n\nBasically, the letter that was sent to us was BS BS BS! Our company will never stay at their hotel again and I will make sure to spread the word to all our friends and family because when I do inform them about our horrible experience, they are absolutely appalled that the hotel made no efforts in making up the experience for us in any way. The \"thank you for bringing this up to our attention\" is BS to us and we will make sure that everyone who is looking for a hotel in Phoenix will never come to this establishment again. \n\nThank you for letter but we would rather give our business to another hotel that actually cares about their reputation and their guests!", "business_id": "_yGo2ubkwQPXcKrdcURSNw", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-04-17", "type": "review"}

However, I will not be renting from this location again. This office is cluttered and disorganized, their parking lot is dirty like you'd find at an adult video store, and the service is pretty juvenile. When I called for my most recent rental at about 1:30pm on a weekday, I was told that the office was very busy and no one was available to pick me up.  As I'm in good shape, I decided to simply walk the 2.25 miles to their office.  But imagine my surprise and frustration when I arrived on foot about 45 minutes later to an office that was devoid of customers, and all four male employees were sitting on the edge of a desk talking casual BS among themselves.  When I walked in, they just looked at each other for a moment, obviously none wanting to come to the front counter to assist me.  After one finally came forward, the conversation among the remaining three continued with one of the employees using the F-word at least twice in the story he was telling. Then that employee realized what he'd done, and very awkwardly yelled two apologies at me from across the office (neither of which I responded to), before nervously shuffling his coworkers off into a private room.

Rooms were very clean & pretty modern (except for the dated wallpaper). I think the hotel's located about 10 minutes from downtown Phoenix.\n\nSuite had:\n- Small counter w/a microwave, mini-fridge (actual fridge, not a mini-bar fridge, so you can store your own beverages in it), 2-cup coffeemaker (with coffee, tea, Half&Half creamers & sweeteners) & a teeny-tiny sink\n- Living room w/leather couch & fabric armchair, kind of flimsy coffee table & a flatscreen TV (Note: Remote was reaaaaally annoying to use b/c there was a 2-3 second delay each time you changed the channel)\n- Bedroom w/very comfy King bed, nightstands w/an alarm clock on one, a dresser & another flatscreen TV\n- Very clean bathroom, with 2 doors: 1 leading to living room, 1 leading to bedroom. Oh & must mention that this is also where the closet is. Yes, you read that right: The closet is in ... the bathroom. Huh?? (Closet had ironing board, hangers)\n\nEveryone at the hotel was very nice & accommodating, I was always met with courtesy & top-notch customer service everywhere (Front desk, lobby shop, bar/grill, valet, etc).\n\nHotel also had a lobby store (which sells beer & wine, for anyone who'd prefer to have a quick drink or 2 in their room without hitting up a bar), a lobby bar & restaurant, an indoor pool (which I didn't get to try out because I forgot to bring my bikini with me).\n\nMy only complaints (really minor):\n- Good yet Cheap Eats: Only place to eat at the hotel (without driving somewhere) was the hotel restaurant. Wasn't very happy with paying $15-$20 for mediocre (but edible) food each time I wanted to get a quick bite to eat. The lobby store had some snacks & Cup o Noodles, but that's about it.\n- Noise: Since the rooms face the atrium of the hotel, noise sometimes traveled up from the bar area & I was able to hear some loud laughter constantly at night. It wasn't crazy loud & didn't keep me up, but even from the bedroom, I was able to hear it a little. I guess my own stupidity was that I didn't shut the bedroom door, but I guess the comfy bed made me too lazy to do so.\n- Parking: Is $11/day, which luckily my man & I were exempt from due to a special deal he booked.\n- Elevators: Only 2 out of the 3 seemed to be working, for the most part they ran ok, but sometimes were a bit slow so there was sometimes a line of people waiting in the lobby for it.\n- A/C: It was kind of on the cold side in the room, even though I kept raising the temperature, it kept blowing out cool air.\n- No Safe: Didn't see a safe in the Bathroom Closet (feels weird saying that! haha).\n\nOverall though, would definitely stay here again!", "business_id": "urBWfXQjyyWIO5B7FvnOpg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-04-13", "type": "review"}

I stayed at this hotel for a work meeting held at the convention center in Phoenix. Our group had a discount at the Hilton Suites.

The bed was comfy and I liked that the bedroom was completely separate from the living room and bathroom. It had a spacious bathroom, but the closet is in there too, so bummer if you're with a roomie who likes long showers and/or bathroom time.

The hotel is right off the light rail stop, so it makes it easy to get down town. They also had a shuttle to take you anywhere within 2 miles of the hotel.

In fact I was so surprised, I waited to write this review until I'd been here twice. Reading the other reviews, I think their fault lies in their night staff. Try to get there before 6ish to avoid the change-over.\n\nMy boyfriend and I live in Tucson and like coming up to Phoenix for the weekend.  We usually like to stay at the PHX airport Hilton since most of the time one of us is flying out somewhere. This time, since we were in town for an event, we elected to stay closer to the city. Bad choice. My boyfriend has been an Hilton Honors member for years and stayed in Hiltons all over the world. He said that this hotel has been the worst in terms of service.\n\nWe got there late Friday night and faced surly staff who mocked us when we asked about parking.  My boyfriend went to park, and I tried to begin the check-in process, but since the reservation was in his name they said they couldn't check us in without him being present. Fine, but by the time he got back (all of 5 minutes), the staff had scattered, and we wound up waiting for another 15 minutes just to get someone to get our key. (The front desk phone had also rung for about 5 minutes with no answer while we were standing there).\n\nWe finally got our key and got up to the top floor where we were staying.  The hotel has a great view with the open atrium, but the top floor was quite warm compared to the rest of the hotel.  I'd suggest a lower room, especially in the summer.  Unfortunately our room key didn't work. Twice. Three trips to the front desk later we finally got the manager to issue a working key. (The first time I went down, but since the reservation wasn't under my name they wouldn't give me a replacement key even thought I had just been down there 5 MINUTES EARLIER checking in.  Also, they have handy phones each floor next to the elevators, but apparently none of the 3 staff members standing chatting at the desk could come up to give us our third key of the night, even after they couldn't manage to get two working ones.)\n\nBy the time we finally got in our room, we were too tired to mention the sticky bathroom floor (it looked like someone had spilled a drink of some sort across it and it wasn't cleaned up) or the lightbulb out in the bathroom.  Our second stay we had a great room, but more poor service as we asked them to call us a cab to take us to our dinner reservations, but after 30 minutes (the last 15 standing in front of the hotel after they told us the cab would be there 'any minute') found out they'd 'forgotten' to call it in. Their shuttle would have taken us there, but they never mentioned it. Their bar/restaurant also closes quite early most nights since they shut it down if it is slow, so don't trust the hours they have posted.\n\nThat being said we did have a lovely experience with their buffet staff going out of their way to help us. The manager there as well as one of their servers not only bent over backwards to get us food and drink (even right at the end of the buffet), but got us brochures and discount coupons for area attractions they thought we'd enjoy.  5 stars for them and 0 for the night staff.

My God!  I was gonna coin the phrase \"Phoenix 5\" for the weight I must have gained staying at this hotel for a week, but apparently it's also the name of a prostate cancer support group or something.\n\nAnyway, first the pros - rooms are huge, as usual.  If you've stayed at an Embassy in the past, more of the same.  The shower and toilet are separate from the sink, which is in the bedroom.  I'm kind of split on this arrangement, but what can you do?  Unusually large mini-kitchen with a double sized minifridge and microwave.  I was able to get a code for free internet and there technically is Wi-Fi in room, but the signal was so poor that I ended up using the wired.  Open atrium with fountains are relaxing.  Reasonably sized pool and spa area.  The Precor Fitness Center was outstanding - Ellipticals, Treadmills, Freeweights, and Weight Machine - with the sole exception that the ceiling was way too low.\n\nI had an issue with my room - I think someone smoked in it in the past and they either didn't or didn't do a good job cleaning it out.  It had a muggy, smokey smell.  I kept the window open for as long as was reasonable and by the end of my stay it finally cleared up.  And yes, it most definitely was a non-smoking room.\n\nRegarding the complimentary breakfast - I'm disappointed.  I was there for a week and they had bleh sausage, decent bacon,  bleh hash browns and made to order pancakes, french toast, or omelettes.  Pancakes and French toast weren't bad, but the omelettes were kind of gross.  Only by Thursday did they put out buffet trays with help yourself scrambled eggs, sausage, home fries which were much tastier sides.  Fruit salad was fresh.  The two chefs were very friendly.\n\nActually, all the staff here was very friendly.  But the sad breakfast at the beginning of the week, the smoky room, and inability to get Wi-Fi the entire time are marks against.  I think 3 stars is fair.

The staff did not seem to take seriously my assertion that there was dust and bedbugs.  \n\nNext, I went to get my complimentary breakfast.  I have a medical issue and must not have any gluten in my diet.  When I entered, there were no other people at the omelet bar.  I asked the chef if he would be able to clean the grill and make me something without gluten (there were already hash browns on the grill).  He said no.  I asked if he might have a frying pan or something he could cook me an egg in.  He said no.  I asked, \"So, you won't cook me anything for breakfast then?\"  He said no.  I left, but returned a few minutes later and asked to speak with a manager.  Luckily, a sweet woman was there and explained that the two bozos on the grill were only temporary workers and didn't know what they were talking about.  She walked the main chef through cleaning the grill and using clean implements.  And, after two eggs and some veggies had been fried and served, the idiot put hash browns on the plate.  Luckily, the woman took off the potatoes and the vegetables they had touched and wiped the plate down on that side.  I credit her with not becoming ill that morning.  The regular chef was a gem.\n\nThat evening, someone was smoking, probably in the suite below me, and the bathroom was full of cigarette smoke.  I called the front desk, and they called the suite below me to tell them to stop smoking.  The smoke smell did not occur again.\n\nThere were no bedbugs in the second room.  However, it was also dusty, and there was a full cup of coffee in the microwave left from a previous guest.\n\nAnd what the hell kind of roach motel charges $10 per night for internet?  I haven't paid for internet in a hotel since the 90s.  They seriously expect a guest staying there for 5 days to fork over an additional $50.  Stop being such cheapskates!  \n\nIf I had not been here on business, I would have left.  I would never, ever, in a million years, stay in this hotel again.  How dirty, disgusting, and rude!!  I had a horrible stay!  The only upside was the shuttle service. Those guys were all perfectly nice and funny.  The owners and manager should be perfectly ashamed of this hotel.  I have already told my company about this horrible experience, as well as my family and friends who live in AZ, and I will make damned sure people know what kind of experience to expect!!", "business_id": "-nWigG5EhFLjdSgGZthS3Q", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-05-05", "type": "review"}

Nope was our reply. The room was nice if one is in to the look, I guess many from the mid-west are. The room was small as was the bath. There was no space outside for sitting other than a chair next to the room beside us. Yes it was nice, but only to a point. That point dropped when I found out how much she paid for this room, I almost pooped my pants. I am accustomed to paying silly prices for rooms as I like nice. But my God my home is much nicer than this hotel and a whole lot more room. I have no idea what she was thinking, but I am happy she thought so much of me.

Am I wildly, madly in love with everything at the Royal Palms resort? Absolutely!!! Do I want you to go there?? NO! But only because I want this place completely to myself! Located off Camelback at the base of the beautiful Camelback mountain, this boutique resort is a little slice of heaven in the middle of Scottsdale. From the towering palm trees to the lush green foliage to the heady aroma of flowers everywhere you go, this place is an oasis of beauty and relaxation. \n\nMy favorite time to go to the Royal Palms is at night, when the twinkle lights wink at you from hidden corners, and candle glow from the various secluded tables light your way from nook to nook. I recommend going around 8, when the live music starts. Listen to the bluesy singer's sultry, melancholy voice as you enjoy a glass of wine on the garden patio. Or perhaps take a romantic stroll across the grounds until you come across a secret garden tucked away, waiting for you to find it. \n\nThe restaurant and bar are top notch, and have a great happy hour that lasts until 6pm Monday through Thursday. Or, if it's a hot summer day, take a little stay-cation and relax by the gorgeous pool in your own private cabana. \n\nThe entire property is enchanting, and makes you feel like you've stepped into a place where time stands still, and the only thing to do is enjoy the tranquility that surrounds you.

The wait service was friendly and catered to every whim.  One of the bartenders gladly offered to make me a mimosa when I was hesitant to go for champagne.  \n\nI also got a 90 minute deep tissue massage (current rate is $200) by Evan on a secluded balcony with a beautiful view of the mountains.  I mentioned that I thought I had pulled my piriformis so he worked every muscle in my a$$ (yes, that's where it's located!) and even told me the names of all of them, hahaha.  He asked about the amount of pressure, how I was feeling, etc.  I felt extremely comfortable with him and he definitely fixed my piriformis!  We had nice conversation until the pain ended and the relaxing began and I started to doze off.  \n\nWe also received gift certificates for the shop in the spa.  They have the usual type of products you would expect: body lotions, facial masks, candles, etc.  I bought a strawberry and kiwi shower gel and lotion set which smells insanely delicious.  (I think it actually put the idea of happy hour into my head...)  I also loved one of their perfumes, but for a tiny travel size bottle I believe it was $50!  \n\nEverybody is very attentive and pretty hands off at the spa and you can relax indoors or out before or after your treatment(s).  They provide big, comfy bath robes and slippers as well as lockers.  The only complaint I have is they don't have a nice, private place to change your clothes.  I changed mine in the restroom which has tile flooring, slats in the door so you're paranoid somebody can see in, and nowhere to hang up your clothing.  But maybe I just missed private changing areas.  \n\nIf you ever get a chance to spa here, do it!", "business_id": "rLAeltELaGdQKh_LYIllEA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-04-27", "type": "review"}

From the moment we arrived we were greeted with authentic kindness and care. We were whisked from our car, straight to a simple check-in area [complete with delicious iced tea and lemonade] and given a tour of the grounds as we were shown to our room.  \n \nAll the rooms in this resort are 'casitas.' Basically, you get your own little house with a kitchen, sitting area, big bathroom and lovely bedroom with plenty of storage space and dressers for each person to have their clothes.  Turn down service happens nightly and the cleaning crew seems to sneak in and out of there anytime you are gone.\n\nThe pool is lovely, and again, the staff is welcoming and remember who you are after meeting you only once.  Also, they could gouge you on the prices there, but guess what THEY DONT.  [Especially in terms of resort standards]\n\nWe also had a couples' massage at the spa which was incredible. Before the massage you can hang in your separate locker rooms which have a eucalyptus steam room that leads to an outdoor jacuzzi and shower, as well as lounge chairs to chill in the sunshine before you have your service.  When our awesome massages were complete, we were handed champagne on the way out and instructed to take a quick steam and shower to help pull out the toxins brought up by our massage.  Again, the staff was incredible and caring and I love them!\n\nOne cool thing about this resort is that they provide an environment where you don't need to feel obligated to tip at every turn [except at the restaurants] by instilling a very reasonable daily resort fee [$28].  This included unlimited valet parking, which was worth it alone!\n\nAll of this and I never even mentioned how gorgeous the grounds are. Immaculately kept, thoughtfully designed landscaping surround these historical grounds, and the rooms are lovely as well.   This is also a fairly small resort, which is nice because you end up being a part of a nice, intimate community of vacationers.  And on our trip, it was 95% adults. We saw one child the whole time we were there.  [Not that I don't like children, but it's nice to have some peace on vacation :)\n\nAll in all I can't express how enamoured we both were by our stay here.

Set against the backdrop of Camelback Mountain, the setting is simply stunning. We had our wedding reception in the Estrella Room with the cocktail hour in the courtyard in front of the room. \n\nBefore getting married here, I was told by anyone I spoke to that the wedding food is by far the best they've ever had anywhere else. I completely agree with this statement. The food is a culinary masterpiece. It doesn't taste like your typical catered food. It tastes like the food they serve in T Cooks, if not better! Everything you eat, down to the bread and pesto dip is extraordinary.  \n\nThe service is about as extraordinary as the food. I worked with Suzanne who was extremely helpful from start to finish. Each bride and groom gets a \"shadow\" for the wedding day. Our shadow was the fabulous Christy and followed us around while we took pictures and throughout the whole night and made sure we had cocktails, food and any other help throughout the night. She even helped me in the bathroom with my large wedding dress! I can't say enough about Christy and how helpful she was throughout the night. She was calm, comforting and helpful throughout the whole night. \n\nI will end this review by saying that \"you get what you pay for\" and while the Royal Palms is on the pricier end, it's worth every penny and they make sure they work for their money. Everyone is kind and helpful and I couldn't imagine getting married anywhere else.\n\nBesides the wedding experience, I was also lucky enough to stay at the Royal Palms the night before and the night of the wedding. I highly recommend staying in the Valencia Casita #125. It's got an adorable courtyard, little sitting area, a small kitchen and a nicely sized bedroom.

The staging site near 4 Peaks was easy to find and the company provided all the gear we'd need-- helmets, goggles, water, confidence, you name it. Luckily it had just rained the night before so instead of dust flying everywhere, we got splashed with mud. I'd rather get muddy and have some great views of the Valley sans pollution than ride through a constant cloud of dust, a la Pigpen.\n\nThe guide was super experienced and he let some of the faster riders up towards the front and the slower riders in the back so people could go at their own pace. We of course managed to get squashed in the middle behind a couple who couldn't decide whether they wanted to be speed racers or terrified school girls. That kinda put the kibosh on us really letting loose, but we still managed to pick up some speed along the way and really enjoy the trail. Since we weren't allowed to bring anything with us, the guide provided water and even took our pictures so we could download them later. \n\nAll in all, I'd definitely recommend Stellar Adventures if you're looking for a little half-day trip or want to treat some out-of-town guests. It's a little pricey though, even with the groupons, but worth the splurge if you're up for a little action.", "business_id": "pLIEBQRP9hDG9T2OWDX04w", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-05-05", "type": "review"}

Secondly, the accommodations are better than you'd expect for the price. The rooms are super clean and updated. The beds are comfy and the shower is nice. I got a Jr. suite and it has a pull out bed from the love seat and the bedroom is closed off by a door for privacy. There's a mini fridge, microwave and coffee station.The hotel is small enough that you could call it a boutique. None the less there are kids and morons who also stay there and wake up early making a racquet, but again this is a budget friendly lodge.  There's a lovely pool and BBQ area though I didn't try it. Also, they have a pretty legit breakfast with eggs and waffles and all that delicious biz...and it's free.

A big piece of information that would have been helpful to know without having to go to the website.\n\nI said that I needed airfare hotel and car rental information for my destination and I was told that's available online, here are your pictures thank you. Her lack of patience continued ending with I would just give $200 to the courthouse and cross my fingers as to when you will get your  passport. \n\nIt gets worse however the punchline to this joke of customer service, is that on my way out I told the receptionist that I had someone who must have had a bad day, her answer was but it's Friday and you're our client.", "business_id": "vBRJWnMaAqUyZ1CbwnJXLQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-05-30", "type": "review"}

We weren't planning on staying over in Phoenix, but with many flights getting canceled due to the snow in Philly, we decided to delay our flight and spend the night. \n\nWe just spent a wonderful week at the Hilton Waikoloa, and my husband stays in Hiltons for work several days each month-- so we really trust the Hilton brand. Sadly, however, our experience at the Hilton Phoenix Airport hotel was an exception. We were quite surprised by the poor quality of the hotel all around. \n\nFirst, our flight arrived at 9 AM, so we knew we had several hours until our room would be ready. We asked the front desk if we could check in early (before 3), and they said that they would try to have a room ready early but that there would be a charge for early check in. We realize that there is probably a policy that states we should be charged for early check-in, but we have never, at other Hilton properties, been told we had to pay extra for that. We elected not to pay extra, and as there is nothing really in walking distance, we spent the morning and early afternoon in the common space of the hotel. There is an outdoor patio/pool space that has the potential to be very nice.\n\nHowever, the hotel property is dated, and is not kept up. Some examples of things that made us cringe: There were drink cups left laying around for the entire day, there was a big pile of cigarette butts sitting on top of one of the umbrellas by the pool (see picture), the room, when we eventually got it, smelled like bad body odor, there were (ketchup? coffee? blood?) stains splattered on the curtains in the hotel room (see picture), and the balcony facing the freeway and parking lot was tiny without enough room to sit. One of the worst -- the toilet seat in the bathroom was way too small for the toilet (see picture), so needless to say, it was not an enjoyable experience for me to go in to use the toilet after the boys in the family had used it and got the rim of the toilet dirty. The toilet was not even properly attached to the wall so the whole toilet would rock and bang against the wall when someone sat down. \n\nI had a terrible night's sleep because every time someone on the hall closed the door to their hotel room or the executive lounge, the whole wall shook and the sound echoed loudly down the hall. \n\nThe pool was nice for the kids to play in, but the hot tub was broken. \n\nThe wireless internet was so slow (slower than dial-up), it was hardly worth my time to sit there and wait for it to load anything.\n\nThe executive lounge was average, with a nice sitting area and TVs. The food was below average-- lacking in variety, and the service was grouchy. The internet on the computers  was not working the entire time we were there, so no chance to print boarding passes.\n\nThere is nothing within walking distance besides a bunch of other hotels.\n\nWe ate at Rennick's restaurant, with some eager anticipation because we were hungry and the menu looked decent, and it was our only option. We sat outside in the lovely and peaceful courtyard by the fountain. The waitress was very earnest and sweet. I ordered a Tuna MELT with sweet potato fries. Everything on the plate was cold, though the plate was warm. There was a sprinkle of cheese on the top that looked like it was broiled for 20 seconds to brown, but even that was cold. I asked the waitress to have them re-heat the sandwich, and maybe put a little more cheese on the top. She returned with the cold sandwich and cold fries. She told me that the chef said 'that's how the sandwich is supposed to be'. She even came out with another waitress that affirmed that the tuna melt is supposed to be cold: \"it's a tuna salad and comes cold\". I pointed out that my fries were cold. The waitress reached over and grabbed one from my plate and said \"yeah, it is cold! I'm sorry.\" She came back later and said that the manager was running to a meeting but would take 10% off for me 'for the inconvenience.' I would have rather had some warm food! I tried to be a good sport and eat it, but it was unappetizing so I left it uneaten. Having to (mostly) pay for the food I did not eat, with not even a token attempt from the restaurant to try and fix it or get me something I liked? Total let down.\n\nThe best part of our experience at this hotel was the transportation to/from the airport. Both of the drivers were prompt, courteous and helpful.\n\nI'm sad to report all these issues with this hotel that are clearly inconsistent with the Hilton brand. I was disappointed to say the least, and I hope that Hilton will do something to bring this hotel up to par.", "business_id": "KnRRMCqQQqlyMphif6cTaA", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-03-09", "type": "review"}

For people like me who prefer to stay in after a long day working on the road, I was absolutely thrilled that they've made these additions.  You can also take the food / drinks back to the room with you, as I don't believe they have room service yet.\n\n* The lobby area in general is nicely furnished with lots of comfy seats and a few computers with Internet access and printing.\n\n* The courtyard has a nice outdoor pool and a bunch more chairs for hanging out and relaxing.\n\n* The Market is still there with snacks and beverages available 24/7, with beer and wine sold until 4 AM at this location.\n\nMy only complaint about this place was the speed of the wi-fi.  Granted it's free but it was embarrassingly slow.  I couldn't even play a video on YouTube at the lowest quality setting without it constantly having to pause and rebuffer.

Dispatch is a huge problem and nobody seems to care. I was a driver for discount and told management numerous times about problems and i was told \"put a complaint on their website\". Now I had specific fare numbers, times, names of people who screwed up by management that I had access would not take action now would they pass it on. Most problems of not being able to get a ride at odd hours/early morning is that drivers don`t wanna get a \"no show\". Basically drivers must pay a $2.45 \"dispatch fee\" for any fare we take, if the passenger is not there, to bad pay up to discount cab. This is another issue I raised to management that was ignored. I have seen saturday nights in old town or tempe/asu and there would be 30-50 fares pending, lots of cabs available, but nobody would log in to take calls because no show fees add up quick. In the end, all you passengers complaining don`t get a ride and discount cab does not get their dispatch fees either, yea I know, stupid. \n\nI have seen first hand vomit clean up. The biohazard chemical cleanup used by discount cab yard guys.....WINDEX!! I was told, \"yea the ammonia in there will kill bacteria/virus\". I returned a car after 12 hours that had front shocks blown out, I mean the car was riding like an old whoopty bouncing down the road. I told the yard guys, only to be told isn`t wasnt time for service and they sent it right back out with another driver. \n\nManagement says they are \"in the business of leasing cars\", they don`t care about passengers. Most drivers avg $10/hr after all the fees but many drivers have lost money after driving for 12 hours, BUT discount cab still gets every penny they are owed or you don`t drive again. All the decent drivers went to drive for uber, now its bottom of the barrel left there. How much do they care about drivers? Look up the driver that was killed feb of 2015 by old town. His family set up a \"go fund me\" account to pay for his final expenses. DC put in NOTHING! Really Craig, you can`t part with $3k for a guy that died driving for you to lay him to rest?

Then this shuttle takes you to the new multi-million dollar Rental Car \"complex\" which is NOT located at the airport, but about 10 minutes outside of the airport.

Mine was $72. Not sure how much it is for shorter rentals, but everyone at EVERY rental car place HAS to pay it regardless. \n\nThe line at Budget was not too bad...about 5 of us. But it took 20 minutes for me to finally get up to an agent. They only had 2 agents working so maybe that is why. My agent was very nice but he kept trying to offer me a bunch of extras and upgrades.

I declined and did just fine with the AC in the small car. \n\nAfter I got my car I went over it with a fine toothed comb and documented all of the scratches, dents, repair marks, etc... Well, the elderly gentleman at the check-out booth was not thrilled with this as he had to fill out a form documenting it all. I apologized and told him it was nothing against him, it was just me being safe. He understood but told me not to worry about \"every little ding\". \n\nCar rental return was EXCELLENT!! Fastest return I've ever had, ever!! You just pull up, the girl looks over it real fast, hands you your receipt, and you are on your way! Just head straight for the shuttle pick-up area. No returning back to the rental desk. \n\nNOTE: Make sure you get on the RIGHT shuttle bus for your airline terminal.

First things first the budget staff were helpful and got me my cars pretty quickly. Firstly, getting to and from the facility is an ordeal. Best bet it is 15 minutes each way to get to the rental facility for this place. At worst I waited 10 minutes for the bus then 30 minutes to get to the terminal on the bus (traffic for some reason) and almost missed my flight. Most of the airports I go to are under 5 minutes to the facility or on site. Since budget doesn't run the buses they can't really help the situation but they signed on to this project. Also the buses come way less frequently off hours and there's 2 places to line up so if you're in a hurry you have to have your head on a swivel for where to go. \n\nThe other issue with renting a car in Phoenix is all the taxes and fees. After a four day rental my taxes and fees were roughly $90. Which came to an effective tax rate of 57% on my rental car for four days.

The washer fluid was out, so we couldn't clean the windshield.

I always try to book unlimited miles and a full covered insurance packeage. That`s what I booked here as well. \n\nMy voucher stated as a car type \"standard / intermediate\" similar to a Dodge Avenger. \nI don\u00b4t knew this type of car, but the key facts were right. I needed this car to drive from Phoenix to Sedona (1.5 hours) and just a bit around to discover the area.\n\nWaiting time was super, just 3 numbers in front of me. \n\nThe guy behind the counter was very nice, but now I know he was it just to trick me!\n\nHe tried as usually to sell me an additional insurance, but I told him to look at my booking which covers everything. He confirmed friendly \"Oh, yes, your are right. What I am talking about\".\n\nHe asked me what car I want. He has an Impala and a Malibu?\nBecause I didn't know the cars I said to him that I don' t care, as long as the car has enough room. \n\nHe told me the Malibu would be nicer because it has a 6 cylinder engine and this would be better for my drive to Sedona.\n\nAt this point I was still impressed how kind and service orientated he was.\n\nWe went to the paperwork and he explained me everything what will popup on the touchscreen which I had to sign. Of course (unfortunately)  I was not reading every line in this contract.\n\nFinally he gave me the papers and explained where the car was located. So far so good. I found the car and had a good time with it. I told my wife about the nice guy and the service.\n\n4 days later, when I came back I did the checkout. The guy who scanned the bar code gave me a paper strip with the words:\" Everything is ok, there is nothing exept your upgrade\"\n\nUpgrade???

I told him that if I would forced to read every line in a rental car agreement it would proably take hours. Nobody would do that. Customers have to trust the companies and the employees.\n\nHe explained me that he would read everything before he would signed it. He then said something to his employee and left without any further word to me. She started to enter something into the computer, without telling me. \n\nShe handed me a new printout.  I asekd her if everything has been credited now so that there is a zero balance. \n\nShe took the paper back, looked at it and confirmed \"yes\".\n\nI looked at the paper and in deed the last line showed \"Your total due: $0.00\"\n\nI thanked her and went to the airport to get my flight. I was lucky and hoped that the employee would have to explain it to his manager with some consequences.\n\nAt home I checked my account and saw that I have still paid  $115.56 for the upgrade.

We went next door to thrifty and they had no wait and met the price for a minivan that we got from budget. So we went back to budget and the snippy \"customer service\" lady said it was our choice - we could wait for our budget rental or pay for two cars...REALLY!! Meanwhile a person in our party went downstairs to the fast break area just to check it out for himself and they were ready right then to check us in.

He even put his hands on my car to tell me again - I said \"fuck, fine... \" and pulled forward. He comes to my door and says I tried to run him over and starts taking my license plate. What?! I wish I had run him over. \n\nAnyway - this airport is just as annoying as all airports are... unless you know of one where they don't give you a cavity search when you want to go to Hawaii. I am honestly not worried at all about terrorists. I feel no safer and no less safe now than I did in 2000. I would feel just as safe if they let us bring samurai swords and shotguns on board. I can rest just fine knowing the guy next to me might have 4 ounces of hair gel rather than 3. I'm more worried about what kinds of lice and shit live inside the pillows and blankets on the planes (they rarely clean them just so you know - only when the plane is serviced if at all).\n\nYou don't need to xray my bag or boot up my laptop. I'm not hiding a switchblade or a bomb in my shoe. I don't care if anyone else is. If I die, I die. That's the risk I take. It's a miracle enough the fucking things stay in the sky considering Airlines let these things fly when they're held together by duct tape. I've tried to duct tape a pair of shoes and they didn't even last for 2 hours of light walking.\n\nHey, the events of you-know-when were tragic... whether you believe it was an inside job or a straight up act of anti-American hate-fueled terrorism, I think we've suffered enough already. I say we lighten up on it. More people have probably died from second hand smoke they inhaled while on routine red-eye business class flights than have ever died from hijackings.", "business_id": "hW0Ne_HTHEAgGF1rAdmR-g", "stars": 2, "date": "2008-05-05", "type": "review"}

It's one of the highest volume airports yet it's reasonably well organized. I've heard that about 75% of the air traffic flows through Terminal 4 (that's where US Air and SouthWest fly out of). \n\nIf you've going to fly out of Phoenix very often my advice would be to start using US Air or SouthWest because a) it's a hub for both of them and b) you'll have much better flight choices and c) because of the competition, the prices tend to be better. The other terminals, by comparison, are nearly deserted. Terminals 2 and 3 have very limited food choices. Terminal 4 has improved a lot in that regard. \n\nThere is a lot of parking available, both on site and off site. The off site parking, naturally, is cheaper but you have to wait for the buses to bring you to the terminal. Compared to other airports of comparable size the on site parking is not that expensive. If it's a business trip and you are getting reimbursed for the parking, just park on site and save yourself the hassle. Honestly, the best way to get in and out of Sky Harbor is not to drive at all but to use a transportation service. I'm not talking about Stupper-Shuttle - don't get me started on them - but a real sedan service that will drop you at the curb and meet you at the security gate when you arrive back home. \n\nIf you can, print your boarding pass at home rather than waiting in line at the airport. The airline clubs, in my view, are a waste of money. As another reviewer pointed out, the wi-fi access is now free at Sky Harbor. I used to belong to the US Air club but let it lapse. The snacks are not that good, they were charging for drinks. Unless you are regularly connecting through Phoenix how much time are you really going to spend in the airport? Now if you're connecting and have a long layover then it might be worthwhile but otherwise I'd skip it. \n\nI got a laptop stolen here once so a word about security. If you have a laptop computer, put it through the x-ray machine last and don't take your eye off it for a moment.

I had to circle around and almost ended up back on the 202, all while dodging the rude taxi and shuttle drivers that LOVE to cut me off.  Disastrous when your precious cargo is about to miss their flight.    \n\nThe signs to get back on the 202 aren't very clear either.  I need arrows.  I need signs that say \"left lane 202 E\"  or \"right lane 202 W\" (disclaimer:  I have no clue if the right or left lane take you east or west).  How in the world they twist you around each side of every terminal and loop you through to the highway, I have no clue.  \n\nObviously, I don't enjoy coming here.  But the hope of enjoying my destination city keeps me coming back.  Plus, I have no other choice.  Unless I buy my own jet.  Even then I will probably still have to deal with the crazy taxi drivers.", "business_id": "hW0Ne_HTHEAgGF1rAdmR-g", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-03-31", "type": "review"}

Perhaps this is due in part to Sky Harbor's \"America's Friendliest Airport\" marketing ploy, but in any case it's certainly something to remark about.\n\nI doubt Phoenix will turn into any sort of true travel hub in the near future, but more non-stop international flights would certainly be welcomed. But until the demand is clearly defined we'll have to be content with a few flights to Europe, Canada, Mexico, and the lone wolf to Costa Rica.\n\nI am very excited to see the Sky Train completed and operational with Stage One scheduled to be up and running in 2013. This will allow connections from the light rail and offer a new mode of transportation from the east economy lot to terminal 4.\n\nI've seen previous reviews complaining about having to go back through security when changing terminals, which is actually the case in many airports throughout the world. The terminal is the secure area so whenever you leave it you naturally have to be screened again. There are a few exceptions, but the easiest way to circumvent this is to fly the same airline from point A all the way to point B. If you're connecting at Sky Harbor you should only be flying US Airways/United or Southwest so as to avoid a terminal change. If you're not flying these carriers then you're over-complicating things for yourself and you should look for different routing.\n\nThe central location of Sky Harbor makes it extremely accessible for people living in most parts of the valley, which is a huge plus considering the location of other airports outside of their corresponding metropolitan areas. All in all, there's really nothing significant to complain about Sky Harbor.\n\nP.S. The Fox Sports Grill at Sky Harbor is a true embarrassment, not that one should expect a great deal from airport restaurants, but if Kraft Mac-N-Cheese (this is probably a poor example as KMNC provides a perfect vehicle for some truly delicious creations) is far superior to what you're serving, then you should just end it all.

Denver: nightmare. Spokane: heaven.\n\nPhoenix/Sky Harbor falls in between those two. SH is definitely not as hard to navigate as Denver. If you get lost in SH, you're pretty pathetic. No offense, but there are signs everywhere and you don't have to take a train. Also, there are moving walkways everywhere too. And, when I've been there, those skycap guys who drive you around (if you ask) are always around too.

Picking up and dropping off people is a nightmare.  The cell phone lots have made this a little easier but they are so hard to find.

Leaving Hohokam Park around 9PM (about 6-7 miles from SH), I didn't get to the f'n car rental center (a whole different story) until 10:30.  \n\nWho's genius idea was it to close the airport exit and re-direct traffic from a 4 lane to a one-lane bottleneck into the airport?  That could have been the dumbest, most inefficient thing I have seen since DC shut the interstate near RFK.  Traffic was unbelievable.  And I didn't realize it took another 15 minutes to get to the car rental \"center\".\n\nAfter finally getting to the terminal, check in was slow, considering the amount of people they should have been expecting (they had red-eyes going to CHI, JFK, and ATL, amongst other places).  Getting to security was ridiculous- I would have rather gotten a handy from TSA then the circus they were running.  Apparently, waving my sunscreen in the air \"who's is this?\"  I should have told them it was my buttplug.   I told them, they said I could check it, but I couldn't let it go.  Cya, sunscreen.  \n\nAnother fascinating aspect was I had my cough syrup, hand sanitizer, and my lighter on me.  They could care less about the lighter.  The hand-gel - gone.  And my syrup, they made me take my stuff, and open it, they were testing it for God-only-knows. They didn't care about checking my ID to make sure the contents were mine though, just to make sure it wasn't on their list?  Is that not ass-backwards?\n\nFinally getting through, there wasn't shit open to eat or shop, a big no-no for people trying to get the hell home- I mean after taking 2 hours to go 6 miles that gets you hungry!\n\nThe actual airport itself was dated in some parts, but it was clean, its only saving grace.\n\nIMO, this place has a long ways to go to be a well oiled machine, which is a huge disappoinment being a gateway to the west.", "business_id": "hW0Ne_HTHEAgGF1rAdmR-g", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-03-07", "type": "review"}

If it's a heavy traffic time (Monday morning, holidays, etc.) then 2 hours is a safer bet. \n- Terminal 4 uses the body scanner so expect to go through it. You can always opt out but then you're at the mercy of TSA pat downs, etc. Just be advised and know what to expect.\n- There are many variety shops all over the airport, but again, terminal four has the most selection- easy way to kill time if you're on a layover or arrive super early. Everything from jewelry to sports fare, southwest souvenirs to kids shops. Of course you have the meda stores with plenty of reading materials available and snacks as well.\n- Terminal 4 is pretty large and you can expect some walking from baggage claim to security to your terminal- depending on your airline and gate number of course. Just saying, be prepared for a walk if you are in the C concourse (high number gate).\n- There are TV's all over, mostly tuned to CNN or an NFL game on Sundays. \n- There are kids areas located in some of the D gates terminal 4 - they have a kids level table with dedicated TV to cartoons or some kids variety show. Pretty cool for families travelling with young ones that need a distraction as I know how stressful the flights can be with the kiddos.\n- Sky Harbor is very business traveler friendly - you'll see numerous suits in this airport as there are connections from Southwest and US Airways (major connection destination for both airlines)\n\nAlways remember to be prepared to WAIT at any airport.

It has been a while since I've been at this airport.\n\nThis time I flew US Airways which pretty much dominates Terminal 4 - A & B Gates. The almost 60 gates are spread out into four wings connected by moving walkways.\n\nOn my way west, I arrived in the far A gate and my connecting flight was in the far B gate. I had an hour in between flights. This allowed me just enough time to casually walk the six or so moving walkways, use the restroom and grab a bottle of water. I must mention that I was also wearing heels, which slowed me down considerably since I haven't worn heels in a long time! So, if you are traveling with children, aren't fast on your feet or want time to grab some food, I would recommend booking flights that have a longer connection time.\n\nOn my way back, I had an hour again but was in comfortable shoes; so, I was able to quickly walk between the wings with time enough to grab a snack. The only issue I had was that my departing gate was in the end of the wing. The gates are closer together and the waiting area is smaller. Out of the four or five gates within view, at least three of them were attempting to board at the same time. This caused some confusion amongst the crowd. I think it would be smart to stagger departing flights or at least have the announcers say the flight number every time they make an announcement.

One day I stopped to gaze at the map noticing there is no Terminal 1. Hmmm, this is odd.

Well, it depends on time of day and day of the week; but, 20-30 minutes is a bare minimum. I know there's a Sky Harbor train somewhere, but it's not connected to the rental cars.\n\nWho runs the airport? Oddly, the City of Phoenix v some airport commission.\n\nAre the Southwest terminals (Doors A,B, C and D) connected after going through the TSA line? Yes!....an undocumented feature is Terminal #4 is shaped like an inverse letter \"c\" in terms of layout. I suggest you enter semi-close to your flight, but if the line is crazy, simply switch entrances. A to D is the longest walk, but there are moving sidewalks.\n\nThere's free wifi and lot's of choices on food and drink.

If your looking for which one of the 4 terminals your plane is leaving from you better know before you get there because your not going to find a sign that tells you. Luckily i know the airport well but its just a terrible system. THough they are now doing some construction to try and fix things (I hope).\n\nParking is a mess with the spiral parking garages and getting in. The one nice thing is the cell phone waiting lots that are actually really useful and pretty accommodating for a large airport. Parking cheap is just a good distance away on washington and is worth it if you have the time and AAA discounts. \n\nInside the airport needs updating but is still better than many of the other airport in the country. Overall the inside is one of the best part of the airport with a good amount of places to eat and drink and alright walking between the different gates.

Since 1998, I've been in and out through Sky Harbor because I use to work in Phoenix.  Back in the day, this airport was one of the better airports around (i.e. free wifi, clean, big, easy, stress-free, etc).  I think this airport could use additional terminals and gates.  Even though this airport looks like Vegas' McCarran, it's nowhere near as stress-free as them. Sky Harbor is known for their layovers and this means a ton of inside traffic.  This airport is so busy that all you hear is people, beep beep from the golf carts, and a ton of intercom messages from flights being delayed, cancelled, etc.  Try taking a nap at Sky Harbor, ain't happening. Try finding somewhere to sit while you wait for your plane, good luck with that. \n\nAnother issue with the fact that this is an airport that has a ton of layovers is the travel between gates.  Usually layovers are around an hour which seems like plenty of time, but calculate the half hour early boarding time, rest room break, quick snack, and no concourse.  This leaves you rushing to your gate and hating life. I guess that I never noticed these issues in the past because Phoenix was my destination.  \n\nThere are some pros to this place like free hi-speed wifi, plenty of snack kiosks, and all the phone charging stations.", "business_id": "hW0Ne_HTHEAgGF1rAdmR-g", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-03-07", "type": "review"}

I'm not sure how one is selected to work for the TSA, but I don't think it takes much - at least not for some of the positions. \n\nDepending on what gate you are departing from - here are some tips:\n1) Starbucks is right after security - get it there\n2) Food - eat before you pass security as selections are slim after that\n3) Don't check your bags if you want them at your final destination with you\n4) Don't expect much from TSA\n5) Don't argue with anyone in the airport\n6) Drive whenever possible\n\nI really believe that the best picture for this airport would be a lot of TSA folks standing around doing nothing with huge lines behind them!", "business_id": "hW0Ne_HTHEAgGF1rAdmR-g", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-04-14", "type": "review"}

Wir hatten k\u00fcrzlich zweimal das \"Vergn\u00fcgen\", diesen Airport zu erleben: bei der An- und bei der Abreise unseres Urlaubes. Ich fliege gern, und ich sch\u00e4tze viele gute Flugh\u00e4fen. Phoenix geh\u00f6rt nicht unbedingt dazu.\n\nPhoenix Airport ist wie so einige amerikanische Flugh\u00e4fen gigantisch gro\u00df. Und liegt dennoch sehr zentral in Phoenix. Die Wege ziehen sich hin und hin und hin. Vom Ankunftsgate bis zur Immigration gingen wir gef\u00fchlte Meilen.\n\nDie Immigration-Prozedere war ok, wenn auch ein wenig lahm. Das haben wir schon weitaus besser erlebt. Die Koffer waren auch da und nach einigem Suchen fanden wir auch Trolleys. Dann hie\u00df es, Transport zu unserem Hotel finden. Es gibt hier diverse Ausg\u00e4nge, alle gut beschildert, aber sehr viele mit Taxi- und Shuttlehinweisen, so dass wir rumr\u00e4tselten, welcher denn nun der richtige sei. Drau\u00dfen angekommen ein Gewusel an Bussen und Taxis. Aber keinerlei klare Infos, wo was wie l\u00e4uft. Shuttle zu unserem Hotel fanden wir nicht, passendes Taxi nur mit Hilfe eines Taxieinweisers.\n\nBeim Abflug standen wir mit unserem Gep\u00e4ck an einem der vielen Eing\u00e4nge vom Terminal 4 und suchten verzweifelt Trolleys f\u00fcr unsere Koffer (immerhin f\u00fcr 6 Personen). Nichts da, weit und breit nicht zu finden. Nachfrage ergab, dass es diese in der Ankunftsebene g\u00e4be - auf die Idee muss man als Abreisender erst mal kommen. Aber auch da waren irgendwie alle weg. L\u00f6sung fand sich dann \u00fcber einen Koffertr\u00e4ger mit gro\u00dfer Karre, der die Koffer zum Abfertigungsschalter transportierte. Und wir waren bereits mit ersten Schwitzflecken gekennzeichnet. Bezahlung erfolgte \u00fcbrigens: Pls pay what you mean I deserve\" - tja, da eiert man rum, wieviele bucks man z\u00fccken soll.\n\nDer Terminal sauber und \u00fcbersichtlich (und wieder irre lange Wege). Da unser Flug Versp\u00e4tung hatte, hie\u00df es mehr als drei Stunden zu \u00fcberbr\u00fccken. \u00dcberraschend wurden wir von einem Herrn im roten Jacket angesprochen: Ehrenamtliche Helfer, die wartenden Paxen Informationen geben, wie man am besten die Zeit verbringen kann: Museum im Airport besuchen, mit der Schnellbahn mal kurz nach Downtown fahren, wo es was zu essen gibt etc. Tolle Sache - sehr amerikanisch.\n\nAlles in allem aber gewinnt dieser Airport meine Seele nicht.

Always great service everywhere you turn here and very user friendly. I love it here and maybe I'm a bit biased now that I live here but I lived in Las Vegas for 24 years and I really don't care for that airport so maybe not biased?! Even before I lived here in Phoenix I always appreciated it here because once you're past the security checkpoint, EVERYTHING is connected. People complain about the long walkways but really I'd rather have a long, air conditioned connector with a moving walkway then have to leave security and comeback through just to have a shorter walk! I've never had to connect flights at this airport but I know how much of a pain that can be if you have to leave a secure area to get to another set of gates. \n\nThe roads in and out of the terminals are great and simple to understand with a cell phone lot on each end which I think is a big deal, makes things simpler. They also just finished the PHX Sky Train (see review) from Metro rail and parking so getting in and out of the airport core is now even simpler. Also has a future extension being built to T3 right now so just in case you do need to switch terminals, this will greatly simplify things for you as well. It really seems like in general they are always trying to improve Sky Harbor and that's what I love about it most. My biggest complaint is that things were becoming run down and old but even that they are changing quickly by remodeling restrooms, laying new carpet, replacing all old signs with new, easier to read, streamlined blue and silver signs. \n\nMyself I know that I can't wait for friends and family to fly in or me fly out just so I can use this great airport we have here. With all the new improvements there is little not to love here, especially once the Sky Train is complete and serves T3 and the Rental Car Center, all bus shuttles will be eliminated and T2 will eventually be closed and things will be simple, cool, and efficient at Sky Harbor.

This helps because you can hop on just 1 shuttle instead of each company's specific shuttle.  Cuts back on a lot of time.

Lots of natural light.  And, this is a decidedly un-stabby airport; i.e., getting stabbed for no reason is highly unlikely here (which to me is an important criterion when I am evaluating airports and other public accommodations). \n\nTSA people here are friendly; like they are in the Southeast. Prechecked line is as easy as it is at John Wayne, even.  This is a different world, I tell ya.\n\nSignage is clearer and better positioned than at many airports, so that new visitors and rental car returners don't make a bunch of wrong turns. Note that the closest gas station is a block away from rental return so you don't have to fool with all that until the last minute. \n\nThe gates are somewhat bunched up so seats in the lounges go fast.  The greeters are helpful and friendly so that you immediately realize that you are not in California.  \n\nI do believe that it is high time that recharging stations go with each seat and along the walls rather than a little four foot long counter every 100 feet or so, although I do appreciate that being there.  \n\nThe car rental facility is as big as some regional airport terminals and clean and modern.   It is not really on-site, so you have to ride a shuttle to get there, which I don't like (MEM and SNA handle rental cars so very well) but PHX has its very own rental parking structure so you get in and out very easily.   The shuttle, however, is fast and the drivers will give you the lowdown on all events in the city, plus instructions on which shuttle to board when you are flying home. This place is so not California. Kudos on that.\n\nThere aren't really other choices in the market but we should say it when people are doing things right.  \n\nAlso they have a La Grande Orange in Terminal 4 and Cartel is excellent coffee.\n\nNow if we could just remove the middle seat and about 10 rows from 737s, we'd enjoy the flying part too.", "business_id": "hW0Ne_HTHEAgGF1rAdmR-g", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-03-05", "type": "review"}

Bei Ankunft am Phoenix International Airport suchten wir zun\u00e4chst verzweifelt nach einem Hotelshuttle f\u00fcr das Best Western - ohne Erfolg. Zwar fuhren permanent Shuttles zu den gro\u00dfen Hotelnamen/-ketten, aber keiner zum Best Western.\n\nEin Anruf dort brachte nichts - besetzt. Also nahmen wir ein Taxi und waren in wenigen Minuten im Hotel. Ein Anforderung des Hotelshuttles - den es gibt - h\u00e4tte keinen wesentlichen Vorteil gebracht. Sie haben nur einen, der dann auch gerade frei sein muss, und wir h\u00e4tten - da wir keine Detailortskenntnisse vom Flughafen hatten - angesichts der unendlich vielen Ausg\u00e4nge gar nicht beschreiben k\u00f6nnen, wo wir sind.\n\nDas Best Western hat klassische Hotelzimmer in einem Fl\u00fcgel auf zwei Etagen. In einem anderen Fl\u00fcgel ist es in Motelform gestaltet, d.h. die G\u00e4ste k\u00f6nnen mit dem PKW vor das Zimmer fahren.\n\nUnsere Zimmer waren sehr gro\u00dfz\u00fcgig, gro\u00dfe Betten mit gef\u00fchlten unendlich viel Kissen, ein gro\u00dfes Bad mit Shampoo und Seife in gro\u00dfen Spendern an der Wand, sehr angenehm im Vergleich zu den kleinen proportionierten Packungen in vielen Hotels. Kaffee-/Teemaschine, gro\u00dfer Flachbild-TV, Klimaanlage, freies WiFi. Da unsere Zimmer am hinteren Ende des Motelfl\u00fcgel lagen, hatten wir eine durchgehende - aber nicht wirklich st\u00f6rende - Ger\u00e4uschkulisse von der nahe liegenden Interstate. Von Flugl\u00e4rm war nichts zu h\u00f6ren.\n\nIm Innenhof des Hotels ein Pool in gepflegter kleiner Gartenanlage. Im Durchgang eine Getr\u00e4nkeautomat, den man auch f\u00fcr Kleinbetr\u00e4ge mit der Kreditkarte f\u00fcttern kann.\n\nDem Hotel angeschlossen ein Restaurant und eine gro\u00dfe Lounge, die an einen britischen Clubraum erinnert. \n\nDas Ein- und Auscheckprozedere war routiniert ohne besondere Aufmerksamkeit. Hilfreich war allerdings die Anfrage, ob wir am n\u00e4chsten Morgen den Shuttle zu einer Autovermietstation ben\u00f6tigten.

So bad that I had to cancel my reservation for my stay on the way back.\n\nI stayed here with my two children for one night in March. We got in kind of late and checked in around 9:30 pm. Check-in was fine. We let the clerk know we needed a ride to the airport in the morning and it turns out that you can leave your car there if you're planning to stay on your return trip and the stay is 14 days or less (I asked after a friend informed me you can do this--beats paying for airport parking!). We were flying to Hawaii and would be gone for 10 days, so this was a good deal.\n\nOur room was on the ground floor and was not nicer than a Motel 6 as far as I remember Motel 6s being from when I was a kid. It was hot and humid in the hotel so I turned on the AC. That clanky piece of crap managed to wake me up every single time it went on during the night. A HORRIBLE night of sleep.\n\nTo make matters worse, there were a bunch of college-aged drunk kids staying in the hotel who showed up around 10:30 pm. They hung out right outside of my door and were up and down the stairs laughing and being obnoxious until 1 am. I typically am not shy about sticking my head out the door and telling people to be quiet, but since I was alone with my kids, I didn't think it was the best idea. I called the front desk around 11 pm and they said their driver (who doubles as security) would drive back there when he returned from the airport, in about 20 minutes. It was not 20 minutes, that's for sure. Considering we had to be up at 5 am, waiting ANY amount of time was infuriating. They should have had someone on the premises who can act in the capacity of a security guard or something. I heard the van drive by around 1 am and that's when the inconsiderate a-holes finally went up to their rooms.\n\nIn the morning (at 5 am) I couldn't help myself and as we were heading to the front desk to catch the shuttle, I knocked loudly on one of the doors of the worst offenders and called them jerks. Passive aggressive, I know, but whatever. In the lobby, while waiting for the shuttle, I heard other guests complaining about the loud jerks, too.\n\nThe shuttle ride was fine; the driver was a nice guy. There was no way in hell, though, I'd be staying there on our way back. I was worried about my car the entire time we were gone and I didn't cancel my reservation until the day we were supposed to leave HI and stay there again. We got into PHX around 10:30 at night and we waited for the shuttle with about 5 other guests who were staying there. Shuttle after shuttle came for other hotels and ours didn't show up until 11:20 pm. I didn't want to draw too much attention to us since we weren't planning to stay so I didn't complain much. When we got to the hotel, I tipped the guy well and we booked it to the back of the hotel to my car. Thankfully, my car was fine and we made the 10-15 minute drive to a much nicer place--the Hilton Garden Inn. That place cost about $80 more and the AC was still not very quiet, but the hotel was quiet and I turned off the AC and surprisingly wasn't hot. Anyway, that's another review.\n\nI will NEVER stay here again. Ever.", "business_id": "iKZmLsqTcqnl2iE3xfyGfw", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-04-19", "type": "review"}

The coffee maker was more of a water boiler and the microwave was available in a small cabinet in the lobby, which looked to be dated from the 80s.

Also there is no free breakfast, but provide room service dining from their restaurant out front.\n\nThe only cons are the lack of microwaves in room, safe didn't work, inefficient coffee maker, noisy AC that rattles while it's on and has a touchy thermostat.

I then asked for a bottle of water and was told that a vending machine was just down the hall and that I could purchase one if I liked. At every other best Western that I've stayed at, bottled water was complementary. This may seem an inconsequential thing, but frankly these small courtesies are the reason I stay at Best Westerns when I travel. The final straw was the overall smoking policy; not only is smoking not allowed in the rooms which is fairly normal, but it's not allowed in the parking lot outside your room, nor anywhere else on the property except for designated smoking areas which are near the office. Damned inconvenient since my room was at the far end away from the office. This involved a bit of walking on my part, if I wanted to avoid a $250 penalty.

We were going to rent a car, but picking up in Phoenix and dropping off in Tucson for 5 days was over $600 at one of the cheaper rental car agencies. That seemed crazy, so we bought one-way tickets on Greyhound for 3 passengers for about $40. \n\nWas there a better deal online? Interestingly enough, the internet special costs more. \n\nWould we save money on our tickets if we purchased ahead? No, but Mr. L bought our tickets a week ahead anyway, since the 2:30pm Sunday bus was the only time that actually worked for us. He printed out our tickets, which said we were confirmed. That Sunday would be Daylight Savings, but it was Arizona, which didn't have a time change.\n\nThat Sunday when we showed up at 2pm for our 2:30pm bus, we learned that they'd changed the time to 1:30pm. The Daylight Savings in other states affected the schedule. We should have confirmed our \"confirmed\" tickets. The station agent changed us to a 5:30pm bus, and we were bummed that we'd have a few hours to kill and miss out on time with Mr. L's parents. And they'd have to find the bus station in the dark - shoot.\n\nLesson learned? Buying tickets ahead with Greyhound isn't the best idea. If you do, confirm them, as the schedule may change.\n\nWith hours to kill in the Greyhound Station, my son started playing video games at $1 a pop, and Mr. L and I gathered our thoughts. There was some scary looking food sitting under heat lamps in the Cactus Caf\u00e9. We rented two lockers to stow our luggage for $3 each for 3 hours and split in a cab for a while to go anywhere but the bus station.\n\nWhen we returned closer to our new departure time, the lines for the buses were confusing. The line for Tucson was not the line for our bus. It seemed like everything was backwards here. Luckily we asked, or we might've missed our bus again. By the time we boarded our bus, many seats were taken. Ichabod headed to the back of the bus, and a kind gentleman cleared the 3-seat rear spot for us. \n\nThere was a bathroom near the back, which Mr. L suggested I avoid entering. He said it was a basic hole (outhouse style) with an empty jar of hand-sanitizer. Good to have the bare-bones bathroom if you really need it, but ick.\n\nThe driver made a bunch of announcements in English, then in Spanish. He meant business. I was glad when he told passengers to use headsets for their music, since initially a nearby passenger graced us with his music. Now we only got to see his seated dance moves, which were actually pretty good. \n\n+2 affordable prices\n+2 capable driver\n-2 changing the schedule after had a \"confirmed\" ticket\n-1 for only one agent working the line \n+2 having a bathroom on bus\n-1 condition of bathroom\n+1 lockers in Greyhound station\n-1 for the clusterf*ck of confusion of lines to get on buses - advanced degrees don't help here, be ready to ask questions\n\nGrand total: 2 stars\n\nOverall, we were glad not to spend over $600 on a rental car or inconvenience our friends or family by asking for a very long ride. We learned that we need to confirm or buy tickets last-minute like most Greyhound riders. Hanging out in a Greyhound station is not my idea of fun.

It took 2 hours for anyone to come get us. In my communications with them (throughout the 2 hours), at the 1.5 hour mark i just point blank asked how long it would be. I did demand this. They said if I continued to be the way I was, they wouldn't send anyone. I just shut up realizing I was stuck in a bad part of PHX and needed a way home. What happened after was worse. My brother left his laptop bag in the back of the cab, with a digital camera, iPod & my marriage license. By 6am my brother was calling the company to retrieve these items but they said the cab had checked out already. 2 weeks later we have no idea where these items are. They were absolutely in the trunk of the cab, but the cab company says they don't know who picked us up (they have multiple company's under their umbrella). They said they would put a hold on the cabs they thought it was/were. For some reason, even though they did confirm we were a certain cab's last run, they cannot attribute a cabbie to who took us home. They ultimately said after that they had no idea who took us home, and we were SOL. I have filed a police report but they said without serial numbers there's no hope in hell to find our stuff. Basically, the cabbie stole our stuff, and there's nothing we can do. The items were in the trunk, it's not like another patron would have access to it. Also, they charged my brother $100 to go from Phoenix to Scottsdale (20 min ride, and we needed credit but a cash only cab came) which was why he was so pissed off and forgot about the stuff in the trunk. And the cabbie obviously didn't give a shit enough to get the items out of the trunk for him either. Nightmare. $2000 nightmare that no one seems to be able to help with. (you would think they could search for the ride amount or destination in their files????? no?). One cab ride has amounted to so much pain in my life. I needed the marriage license to apply for citizenship, my brother needed the music on his laptop because he dj's (and family photos). The whole thing makes me sick. It's incredible, and on top of that they were the rudest cab co. I have ever dealt with. Thieves. There has to be SOME way to find out via the amount of the run WHO took our stuff.

I was considering using this hotel to book out of state employees so thought I would test it out first with a little staycation for me and the kids.   We got there only to find that it showed that we were booked for Sunday and not Saturday.  Their version of accommodating me was to offer to charge me for a suite for Saturday.  Since we had booked through hotels.com, I called and they very graciously offered to contact the hotel, saying that most times it wasn't a problem to change.  I stood and watched hotels.com talk with a trainee by the name of Sun Ye who said there was nothing she could do and no manager was on duty.  Hotels.com apologized and said it was unusual for a hotel not to cooperate but that there was nothing they could do.  We finally gave up and paid for an extra room and were told that we could keep the same room for Sunday night rather than have to move.\n\nSo, Sunday rolls around and I have to take the kiddies home and get a babysitter since they have school the next day.   We take them home, pay for a sitter, get them settled and then head back to the hotel room only to find that despite putting a \"do not disturb\" placard on the door, the room has been cleaned and all of our personal belongings are gone:  toiletries, food, drinks, phone chargers, etc.  We go marching down to the lobby to report the issue only to be told that housekeeping is locked and there is nothing that they can do.  Since our belongings were gone, we elected to go back home since we had to work the next day.  Because there was no manager on duty again, Jessica was very nice and said she would get our information to the manager and see what they could do to make things right.\n\nFast forward to Monday.  No call, no email, no contact.  We go back to the hotel (yes, this is three trips now) to see manager and find out about our missing items.  The manager, David, proceeds to tell us that housekeeping didn't report anything in the room (even though they went in and cleaned after being told not to.... and we were checked in).  He also says we can have 25% off another stay.  REALLY????  Let me get this straight.   Holiday Inn refuses to help us correct a reservation, charges us full price for a suite, makes us stay an extra day, costs us additional gas for driving, a babysitter, goes into a room that we are checked into without our consent, takes our stuff, pretty much calls us a liar and then says \"Hey, we'll give you 25% off to subject yourself to the experience all over again!\".  Yeah, sign me up coach!\n\nIt gets better.  So, David, after telling us that nothing was missing, says he was going to call Hotels.com and get back to us.  Funny.... when Hotels.com called on Saturday, Holiday Inn said they couldn't work with them.  Now that there is a problem, WHOLLY caused by Holiday Inn, it's time to pass the buck to Hotels.com.  He sends us on our way.   We then get a voicemail telling us that WE need to call Hotels.com now and see if we can get refunded.  Good... now we can do their job too.\n\nSo, we call Hotels.com at 7:30 at night (a time when Holiday Inn doesn't seem to be able to afford to staff management)  and get an example of what great customer service should be.  They apologize for the poor experience and credit us for the room, all in less than 5 minutes.\n\nIn the meantime, Holiday Inn still has our stuff, still has crappy service and still has yet to call us back.  This has been an absolutely lousy experience.  I'm only glad I found out the complete lack of customer service before I booked this hotel for traveling employees.   Not only did they lose out on any of my future business, they have lost out future company business as well.  In this day of customer service being king, Holiday Inn somehow missed the memo.", "business_id": "cvQ1wNSFaBTzrxB5fMLc3Q", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-04-13", "type": "review"}

The building is aging.  The rooms are showing wear.  It's not dirty... but if you're expecting new furniture and modern design, best to look elsewhere.\n\nThe location is fantastic.  Highway 143 ends right next to the hotel and there is incredibly easy access to I-10, both North and South.  Getting to the airport is equally easy.  There isn't much nearby in walking distance - there is a strip mall about a block away from some food and shopping and, if you're an Anaheim Angels fan, their Spring Training stadium Tempe Diablo is a pretty easy 15-20 minute walk away.\n\nThe parking situation on site is iffy, but the way the hotel is shaped (into a L), there are three entrances, so if you park to the entrance closest to your room, it breaks up the parking crowding.  Be warned, though, that the elevators are all at the corner of the L.\n\nThe rooms are pretty spartan, but clean.  LCD TVs in each room, which are not locked out so you can plug in a game console or other entertainment device via HDMI.  None of the stations are in HD, however  Work desk, minifridge, microwave.  The in-hotel Wi-Fi was on the slower side - 0.4Mb/s down, roughly the same up - and the signal for both Verizon and AT&T were fussy and affected by the proximity to traffic on I-10, especially at rush hours.\n\nThe complimentary breakfast is more of the same, but the seating area is small on busy mornings, I had to take my food back to the room.  Food options are the 3 hot food items (usually some sort of entree paired with some combination of sausage, bacon, eggs, or potatoes).  Waffle station, toast/bagels, yoghurt, juice machine, hard-boiled eggs... if you've done breakfast at Hampton, you know what you're in for.\n\nOverall, it's a perfectly fine hotel.  It's further from downtown Phoenix, it's older, and it's not in the greatest area, so rates tend to be on the lower side.  Staff here is largely friendly and helpful.  For what it is and it's proximity to areas east and south of Phoenix, it's a solid place to stay while in town.", "business_id": "lnr7NDMDLTewL57x0pk1Aw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-04-02", "type": "review"}

Meaning refrigerator, there should be plates, pots and pans, dishes, and utensils. \nRefrigerator never got any of the water we brought cold. It took two days to get the freezer to freeze ice cubes. By day three, the refrigerator began to stink. \nNo pots, pans, dishes, utensils. How are we to cook? if we are not wanting to go out to eat. \nAs stated earlier office desk was a small table. You have to pay for high-speed internet or the wifi never worked. \n\nAbsolutely brutal place that needs to just be put out of its misery. Never will I ever stay at this location.", "business_id": "rI7d_L0BCKemotT9XD5wAg", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-03-22", "type": "review"}

I would have rated 4 if I paid regular price of $60 plus per day. Since I got it around $37 to $45 per day on Priceline deal, I'm giving rating 5 for the money I paid\n\nPROS\nHuge parking lot. Quick access to I-10. Close to Tempe downtown\n\nFront desk employees were very pleasant and wonderful people. I was discussing with other guest that they must be out of coffee cups during breakfast, I guess someone overheard the conv and went in immediately and replaced the coffee cups. \n\nPretty safe neighborhood. Nothing that would warrant any kind of suspicion\n\nCONS\nThe bed is a twin size. Really small. This is the first time I ever saw a bed this small.\n\nMissing Iron board. But when I reported, I was given a new one\n\nInternet speed was never more than 0.75mbps. You need to pay $4 per day extra if you need 2.5 times this speed but still it's really slow.\n\nBreakfast gets (muffins, Oat meal, Bananas, Oranges, Apples, Milk and Coffee only) over really fast and they take their sweet time to replenish the stock.", "business_id": "rI7d_L0BCKemotT9XD5wAg", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-05-09", "type": "review"}

The outdoor seating by the pool was nice to be able to get some work done in a nicer setting than an office but had to get a maintenance man to go behind the bar and get us an iced tea. He did offer when we asked if the bar was open so 5 stars to him for understanding hospitality! The bed was okay but the noise was awful. Couldn't believe how many doors I could hear slamming in my hallway and how clearly I could hear the walking above me. Barely slept while I was there. In spite of the basics I would stay there on a future trip as its very convenient to the airport and other attractions in town.\n\n***Much better than the location in Austin, Texas (downtown). The Austin location's valets dented my bumper on my Jeep when I valeted my car on my wedding night and refused to accept responsibility.

It's not a bad hotel but just a little worn. The carpet is old in the halls and my room.

And the pool area is fenced in so you have to reach over the fence to pull a lever to let yourself out.
