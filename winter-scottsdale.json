I don't want to sound like a commercial for their curriculum for living, but as adults, we all get stuck in the way we see and do things.... the Landmark Forum provides a dialog that can help people view things in a different way, thus getting them \"unstuck.\"\n\nThe Landmark Forum takes place over three consecutive days and an evening session (generally Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Tuesday evening.) Each full day begins at 9:00 a.m. and typically ends at approximately 10:00* p.m. Breaks are approximately every 2-3 hours, with a 90-minute dinner break. The evening session generally runs from 7:00 p.m. to 10:15 p.m. (in certain locations, from 7:30 p.m. to 10:45 p.m.).\n\nIt is not cheap, but in my opinion, it is worth it. Landmark Education courses are accepted by most employers for CEU credit that is accepted by most professional organizations.  (think tax break AND pay enhancement) \n\nThere are additional courses and seminars offered at very low cost to support the learning from the Forum, but the forum is the way in the door.\n\nI know a lot of people who attended Landmark, and whether they are actively attending classes now or not, all of them are glad they took the course.", "business_id": "2WvCdAlP4Ck1wAb3LpNRwQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-01-27", "type": "review"}

Armed with a menu, I called down to place a \"to go\" order.  You can't begin to imagine my delight when the guy answered the phone in a French accent so thick it was hard to understand.  I placed my order for the \"half sandwich and side\" deal (extremely reasonable at $5.60) and ran down to get it.  I ordered the mozzarella sandwich minus the prosciutto, and the pasta salad for the side.  Regular readers may know that in my opinion, nothing beats a good mozzarella sandwich, so I was absolutely thrilled to find that it was delicious.  Nice crunchy baguette, fresh mozzarella, and flavorful tomatoes.  The pasta salad was also very good... very simple, just cold pasta with some olive oil and seasonings.  I'm not a super adventurous eater, so while I loved the pasta salad I would guess that others might find it a tad boring.\n\nToday I had the tomato basil ravioli soup, which was very good except that it was a little skimpy on the raviolis.  Flavor was delicious, though.  It comes with a few toasted slices of baguette.  Personally, next time I'll just order a fresh baguette to go along with it.\n\nThe entrees and full sandwiches are a little more pricey, but I'm a light eater, so the half sandwich/side deal is an absolute steal for me.  There's not a sandwich on the menu that doesn't sound mouth watering, and the desserts.... oh my god I wanted one of each.

I took it to European Detail (at that time, they were located on Indian School) and not only did they get the acid off, they suggested a GLARE product to protect my paint from further episodes...even bird droppings!

I hit up a few hand wash places here and there in-between my visits to European...but nothing compares (to you!).

About 30 seconds after being sat, a man offered us a bottle of still water to begin with, he was very polite, and I was disappointed to find out he was only the busser/serving assistant because his welcome was probably the best part of our whole meal. Waitress walks up, \"Hello, what can I get you started to drink?\" No name, no suggestions for a bottle of wine or champagne, oh well. We ordered two cocktails along with the mozzarella and prosciutto appetizer to start. We were told that if we separated our order- aka start with the app, then our entrees are going to take a \"very long time to arrive\"... Um, okay, we are now feeling rushed and uncomfortable. Drinks come about 12 mins later, appetizer tasted like store bought cheese with a strip of prosciutto ($19.95 I believe, ugh?!), another \"blah\"... Entrees are ordered, the gnocchi (which was very good and full of flavor) and a seafood dish including some delicious frozen calamari... :/ Dessert and coffee were then offered, we figured it might be best to get a McDonald's ice cream cone on the way home and save the $14. As were waiting for the check to arrive, here comes my favorite server assistant again! He asked how our meals were, if he could clear our plates, etc. ALL while maintaining a smile. The only one I've seen all night. I wanted to give him a hug. All in all, $143 before gratuity for an average meal.

My wife still drives a SC 430 that is the coolest roodster on the road. \nMy SC430 was called in for airbag recall 6+ months ago and have been patiently waiting for \"parts\".  I felt that a 6 month wait was adequate and demanded to either give me a loaner or fix the airbag.  The suggestion of a passenger lawsuit resulted in immediate \"bring it right in\"  (Not a safe situation in a small car).  Why did they make me wait 6 months if they could get the part in 1-3 days after my firm request.\nReceived a call 3 days later from my service rep, letting me know that my car should be ready by the end of day but would call me to confirm, since it was right before the holiday long weekend.  No callback until the following Monday (7 days later) saying return our car or pay us fees?? I was also told my power steering unit was leaking and needed to be replaced...for   a smooth $1750!!  After the threat to charge me for their loaner that I waited 6 months to get fixed, with no return call and making it sound like I'd rather drive their loaner rather than my convertable was ridicules and insulting. \nSince the subject got reversed on the airbag recall to a $1750 power steering unit replacement I decided to take my business elsewhere.

It's hard enough to take your cat to the vet when they're sick or just scared, but subjecting them to an unfamiliar vet office with barking dogs and non-cat smells can be, I imagine, pretty shocking.  At least when you take your cat to this office, they're faced with a bit less stress.  Everyone in the office is friendly, helpful, compassionate, and really knowledgeable about cats.

Many tests can be performed on-site, including bloodwork, urinalysis, x-rays, and vaccinations.  It's a relief to get back your test results while you wait instead of waiting a day or longer to find out what is going on.  Not only that, but each service is itemized so that you know exactly what you're paying for.\n\nI would (and do!) highly recommend Dr. Grant and his wonderful clinic to any cat owner who is looking for a great vet.

I say corporate events because its a good way to break the ice for coworkers and potential new hires.  \n\nIf you purchase a package of 3 you can keep races that you do not use.

The set up is pretty cool during the winter season with a bunch of lights and winter music playing as you train ride through the cold winds of scottsdale,az. \n\nThe train ride is about 5 minutes....our wait time was about 50 minutes. No joke, every kid in Scottsdale must have been at this park. But we had grabbed some hot chocolate from the nearby stand and had a good time just people watching while in line. There's a lot of Disney mascots running around meeting and greeting children...this place is definitely made for families.

It is actually part of a park with a kids' playground. Easy free parking.\n\nSTUFF TO DO:\nFor the \"adults\"-There is a train car that has been restored as a small museum with some artifacts, displays, photos, etc.  Additionally, there is a large building that houses a massive miniature train set that has villages, forests, mountains, etc. It is amazing and I couldn't stop looking! The detail is incredible and it will bring out the kid in you! The kids will be amazed as well! \nFor the \"kids\"- There is a carousel and a kiddie train to ride. There is also a large playground.\n\nVALUE: It is cheap to enter the little museum (under $5 I think?). It is free to enter the building to see the miniature train sets (but donations keep this place going so don't be stingy).\n\nAGE RANGE: Geared towards families or kids, but someone who is into trains/history/really awesome miniature villages would enjoy it as well!\n\nCHRISTMAS LIGHTS TRAIN RIDE: For a few dollars, you can ride a miniature train into a winter wonderland. Borrow someone's kid if you need to; it is pretty fun if you are a kid at heart and like Christmas lights. Might be a fun light hearted date too! Tip- the line gets INSANELY long. Line up at 5:30 to wait in line for the 6:00 ride. If you don't, there is a chance you will be waiting for WELL over an hour.\n\nSOUVENIRS/FOOD: The gift shop needs some more...gifts!! The snacks pretty much consist of ice cream and hot dogs in foil. I think a small cafe would do well in this location.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: If I had kids of my own (and if I lived in Arizona), this would definitely be a place to which I would return...and I would definitely make the Christmas lights night train ride an annual tradition.", "business_id": "X3icXUyW9vS4UXY6V_MR4w", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-12-28", "type": "review"}

We rode the carousel first since the line wasn't that bad and the little one seemed to enjoy it and it was actually fun for the adults too!

It heaves at you a hearty helping of goodness with some bad mixed in, and it's up to you to take from the experience what you choose to. Here's the deal: \n\nThe Pros: I play guitar. And I could burn an entire day in here with all of the toys and instruments that they liberally allow customers to tinker with, no problem. They seem to understand that even if you clearly won't buy the $4,000 Taylor hanging high on the wall that you just have to play it, for atleast a few minutes, and they let you. Most independent guitar shops won't let you even touch guitars like that unless you look ready, willing and able to buy the thing.  In addition to that, despite the name, it's not just guitars they're slinging over there. They have drums and all kinds of percussion, as well as any kind of simulator, sampler or pedal you can think of to play around with. It's like a free Disneyland for musicians. \n\nThe Cons: As I stare at the beautiful, super high-end guitars glowing underneath the harsh lighting, it occasionally occurs to me: I WILL NEVER OWN THAT GUITAR. I WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO DROP $20 G's ON AN INSTRUMENT. That's a bad feeling. On top of that, there is the local shredder. If you have ever been inside a Guitar Center, you know what I'm talking about. At every GC in the United States, I am convinced that they hire someone to play Megadeth solos over and over with the amp blaring just to be sure that a-holes like me won't stay too long playing the instruments they'll never buy. Next time you go in, listen for the obnoxious fingertapped solos coming from the corner. That's him, and he would like you to get going. \n\nIn Phoenix, we are lacking in the way of independent music shops, and those that do exist have limited selections. When I need something music related, I come here. It's as simple as that. It's convenient and there are things I like about it. I just wish I could stay longer.", "business_id": "XF1g7-1TyTMUMG1qMovlRg", "stars": 3, "date": "2007-02-20", "type": "review"}

Okay, the negatives: the negatives all center around price. I paid $10 for a SMALL sandwich and fries. Now, don't get me wrong, I got enough to eat. But that's not the way a Jewish deli works. Half a sandwich and a side should be enough to eat. It is at every other Jewish deli I've ever been to. That way you can share or save the rest for later. Plus, I asked for an extra pickle. How dare I?! Little did I know when I made the request that they were going to charge me $1 FOR A FREAKIN' PICKLE SPEAR!!! THAT'S LIKE AN EIGHTH OF A PICKLE!!! I couldn't believe it! Add to that the cost of my beloved Doc Brown's $2.49 and I'm quickly going broke. But wait, there's more. I dared to order pastry.\n\nNow, there are several reasons I ordered pastry and none of them are particularly startling. First off, I'm never in a Jewish deli so I couldn't let the opportunity pass. Secondly, I'm a real sucker for apricot pastry and they had two different kinds. Third, they had mandelbrot, which is prominently featured in my novel so I wanted to try theirs and see if it's any better than what I get from Simply Bread (it wasn't). Though I only had nibbles of each of the three small pieces, just to try them, I paid $3.30 for the privilege.\n\nWill I go back there again? Probably not. While the food was okay, I feel like I was mugged. Kinda leaves a bad taste in the mouth. One even good Jew food can't get rid of.", "business_id": "TpQMR-JFE5V0UPzTjjuwFQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-12-22", "type": "review"}

I have been a customer of Goldman's since its'. inception. Prices have gone up and up but I have noticed that service has been dropping since SAM (one of the family) has left. I do not mind paying, but Mrs. Goldman seems more mercenary and less concerned about your satisfaction.\nToday I ordered a roast beef sandwich, side of cole slaw and a piece of kugel and a Dr Browns soda. There was no one in the restaurant and a full staff. After washing my hands, sitting down at a table, reading the news on my iPhone, watching a couple come n and order and get served, I realized that no one had an idea what the hell I was doing there or that I had ordered and paid. I asked, at first politely, and they all looked up with the stare I most hate signaling, \" Huh? What? Where? They went thataway . I have not a thought in my head.\" Then they went into a mode scrambling to find the order. ( Tough because there were 3 people in the restaurant and I was the only one who did not get ANYTHING!) Then Mrs. Goldman joined in the \"what.\"  group because up until then she was diddling with a fax machine in plain view and did not have time to help me ( only time to take my $17 plus dollars). NO apologies.NO let me take something off the meal! NO , \"Hey let's snap to it and get this gentleman served!!!!!!!\"  I demanded my money back. Mrs. Goldman gave me the $ less the cost of the Dr Browns she opened for me! What is my point, after all, every restaurant has a lousy evening.  True. BUT, it's HOw the situation was handled that tells you that  the owner could care less about you and the service that you get. BAD SIGN!!!!  It tells me that GOLDMAN's is going down and that is too bad. STAY AWAY unless. you like stopping free falls.

This review is an update, it's been about two years since I first discovered Goldman's Deli. I was hesitant to jump on the Goldman's bandwagon at first, thankfully, things have changed. I eat at Goldman's about once a week. \n\nThere are three major things that make Goldman's wonderful: \n1. They are family owned and operated, Mrs. Goldman is so sweet, she recognizes her regular patrons and knows them by name. The staff is always helpful and friendly. \n2. The food is fantastic and fresh\n3. It is always impeccably clean \n\nTheir soup is amazing, it's always so difficult to choose just one (I strongly suggest the matzo ball, or sweet and sour cabbage!) I know that people love their Borscht. Their sandwiches are to die for, I'm obsessed with their turkey pastrami, boyfriend loves their Ruben's. Their baked goods are delicious, take home a multi-pack of their Rugulach. I usually get the same thing when I go to Goldman's, half a  turkey pastrami sandwich on rye, with a cup of soup (even though I always want to get a bowl.) I always leave happy and full and so will you. \n\nThe only reason I won't give Goldman's five stars is because their prices are quite high (not unusual for a deli restaurant) and the portions are not as large as most deli's, therefore, I don't think that the prices are reasonable. Also, they will nickel and dime you over small things (like charging for pickles) or charging for butter.  Also, they don't make their own pickles...even Chompie's (gross) makes their own pickles! But, I can forgive Goldman's for their high prices and pathetic pickles. I suggest this place to everyone that will listen. I feel like a deli pusher.

I also went on a day where it has been raining and will continue, but for the good of my road trip passengers I thought I'd make it comfortable.  I researched ahead and saw their website, which listed several washes and an a la carte section.  A la carte seemed to have exactly what I needed.  \n\nThere were choices for Interior Dressing ($5) and Interior Dressing (complete) ($10).  Wheel Sparkle was $2.50.  I figured sweet-just what I need and super reasonably priced.  I pull up and am met by some smug d-bag who, after I have told him exactly what I want (focus on the interior and clean the wheels as I realize it's going to rain and don't care about the exterior) he says he guesses he doesn't understand what I want/that I don't want them to clean it.  I am baffled; how much clearer can I be?  He says they don't do interior washes.  I ask him if he has read their menu, which I notice is 30 feet away and identical to their website.  He tells me (in a super smug tone) that the dressing is very half assed and doesn't really clean anything.  Good to know.  He tries to sell me an interior detail for $90.  I am already over this place but was crunched on time and ask what he recommends.  Some wash-I don't know what name-and I ask him how much.  $20 bucks and he gives me \"the talk\" ie we start with a deep vacuum, then we blah blah blah.  Sold.\n\nI go in to pay and the guy (who was actually friendly and capable, no complaints here) tells me it's $30 and change.  Hmmm.  Don't want to interact with previous douche again so I'll pay the extra $10 to get the f out.  I was entertained by Titanic playing on their old school tv while I soaked in the depressing nature of their waiting area.  After becoming bored after 20-30 min I asked him what the status was and it was done.  They didn't do a horrible job, but there were obvious misses inside.  Example: the center console/radio area.  It is the most focal point of the whole interior.  Untouched.  Outside and wheels turned out okay.  \n\nOverall, overpaid to be condescended and lied to, then left with an inferior finished product.", "business_id": "gnBgJD6LYsYhSneYVFDmhw", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-12-30", "type": "review"}

My first impression was not the best, however.\n\nWhen I could not find a product on their website, I asked via on-line chat which was supposedly \"open.\"  No one answered.  No worries, I emailed instead.  Again, I never received a response.  At that point I decided if they could not respond to a shampoo inquiry, I would never buy my next set of $777 bath towels here either.  And so I purchased the shampoo from Saks.

The opposite extreme is far more costly.\n\nFast forward 2 weeks and I need drawer sachets as a gift.  So I did the unthinkable and went back to TLT when I struck out elsewhere.

The manager was in disbelief at the Family Guy price, but approved it anyway without any actual difficulty. Distrust by managers doing a price match tends to annoy me when I'm doing something legitimate that is within their stated policy, but to her credit, the way she stated it was careful to at least appear to state that I'd casually made an error in interpretation of the ad, not that I was intentionally trying to mislead them.

It used to be just another trendy Scottsdale who's who of snob fests but either I'm lightening up with age or Flemings has grown from being just another Scottsdale steak place to being THE Scottsdale restaurant for steak and wine. \n\nWe went to Flemings this week to celebrate a birthday. The reservation process was easy because I could do it right online. I received a call the day before to confirm by a very nice young lady named Perla. She gave very good phone meaning she was polite, not overly chatty, and sounded enthusiastic about our visit. \n\nUpon arrival, our party of 6 was greeted warmly by the hostesses and seated promptly. Our server and his assistant were attentive and friendly without being casual. Even my 8 year old was called \"sir\", which he totally loved. And while the rest of us were having a very nice Napa Valley red wine, our server was thoughtful enough to get my son a Shirley Temple so he could feel part of the big kids crowd. I know that traditionally Flemings is really meant for grown-ups but my kid has good taste and he behaves in a restaurant so he's golden. :) \n\nScott Yanni is the managing partner for Flemings and he made his way to our table to greet us and ensure our satisfaction for the evening. Scott treated us so kindly and was very gracious. Not often do you get to meet the managing partner of a restaurant, much less meet one who treats you like an old friend. \n\nNow, the real reason you come to Flemings is for the steak. I ordered from the Winter Prix Fix menu which is a specialty menu being offered now. I had clam chowder for my starter. The chowder was so velvety and smooth with just the right amount of clam and potatoes. The nicest part about it is that it didn't smell fishy like some clam chowders do when the clams come from a can. Not so at Flemings. And of course, my pet peeve is the temperature of the soup. This soup came out piping hot and ready to roll. Love that!\n\n My next course was a petite filet which came out among the row of plates my table had on the arm of our very skilled server. He had 6 dinner plates lined up his arm and never even came close to dropping them. It was a show in and of itself. Now back to that steak......it was like buttah as they say in the old country. It wasn't overly seasoned which was nice because some places try to mask the flavor of the meat with too much seasoning. This steak was a perfect medium rare and not a shade over or under. The side dishes were wonderful as well. We had mashed potatoes which were creamy and seasoned just right as well as the Flemings' potatoes, asparagus, and sauteed mushrooms. The Flemings' potatoes are definitely one of my favorites and were heavenly. \n\nWe rounded out the evening with desserts that were out of this world. \nWe had a chocolate lava cake that was so rich and moist that it melted in our mouths. We also enjoyed sorbet with chantilly cream as well and it was the perfect ending to a great meal. \n\nNever once were we made to feel rushed or an inconvenience. Our servers were at our beck and call. Our water glasses were never empty and our food was served at just the perfect temperature. This visit was in a word.....Perfect. \n\nThank you Scott and the staff at Flemings for a memorable and wonderful evening!", "business_id": "9AbyBqGWHYZC73GlyAuTrQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-01-24", "type": "review"}

They were very generous with it as well since we each got 2 fillets. I've gone before in Boston and in Los Angeles but never tried the fish. Their steaks (Delmonico is my fav) is delectable as well.\n\nMy only regret with the visit was that we were too full, probably from all the bread, that we didn't get desert.

However, I immediately saw on the way in they don't have a single beer on tap.  Craving a Stella or microbrew or something beerish this was a bit of a bummer but no big deal.  I guess I could suffer through a bottle if I had to.\n\nWe were \"greeted\" by the hostess (I've had more enthusiastic greetings at McDonald's) and then she stared down at her screen to find the reservation.  There was enough of a delay I had one of those airport/hotel/rental car type moments thinking they had lost the reservation and would be turned away or asked to sit at the bar--but luckily this wasn't the case and we were promptly seated.\n\nI started with the vodka martini (not made as specified but fine nonetheless) and LL had some prosecco concoction with elderflower liqueur (delicious).  Service was prompt and attentive, although I had a feeling our server was either brand new or a temp called in.  She didn't even know the dressings for the salad!\n\nAs for help on wine about all she could offer was the intensity of the wine increased as you went further down the list--clearly stated on the menu.  She was also unaware of what was truly vegetarian and didn't offer up any \"super-secret-black-ops vegetarian options\".  For those that haven't had the \"pleasure\" of dating a vegetarian (not vegan thank god!) most decent restaurants will modify dishes or make up something special to accommodate--so with Fleming's it looks like the mushroom ravioli was the way to go for any true entree feel....which is fine, I realize we were at a steakhouse!\n\nLL started with the caesar salad with ranch (traditional dressing has anchovies) and I had the french onion soup.  Both were fine, nothing to write home about.  Mine was even a bit cool of all things.  Our entrees arrived in a reasonable amount of time.  I had the main filet, and our sides included the mushrooms and Fleming's potatoes.\n\nI have to say I was disappointed in the steak.  It was the largest filet offered, but didn't seem very impressive when it came out...and was kind of in two pieces...so not the nicest looking piece of meat I've seen.  After having a few bites I also realized it was a solid medium instead of the medium rare I had requested.  In hindsight I should of sent it back, but in reality I'm just not much of a send it back type of guy.  I guess I'm more of the eat it/don't eat it and complain about it on Yelp type of guy.\n\nTo sum things up, we had a really nice dinner and the server was extremely attentive and cheerful.  It's certainly not her fault she hasn't been properly trained on the menu--although she could of just admitted as much instead of trying to wing it!  However, for $200 with tax and tip you have to at least do what you do best: serve me up a fantastic prime cut of steak and cook it how I want it!  I know I could go to Basha's right now, buy a \"choice\" cut, and cook it properly on my POS grill with better results.  For this I'm feeling pretty generous with the 3 stars.

As good guests do, we called ahead and made reservations.   When we arrived the hostess did not greet us, we had to let her know we were there and who we were, as she was too busy burying her face into the computer screen.   Never looking up at us, she looked at the screen for a bit, waited for another hostess to walk up and then handed her our menus and table location.  It was the oddest thing, she never made eye contact nor did she wish a pleasant dining experience.   We both walked away thinking Wtf?\n\nAfter the initial awkwardness from the hostess, we were sat by a pleasant hostess and greeted by our server.  The service overall was very attentive, but that was about as good as it got.  Our server had very little knowledge of the menu, wine list or what items on the menu were vegetarian.  A previous reviewer had mentioned a fantastic vegetarian platter offered to them that was not on the. She knew of no such thing, nor did she offer to check with the chef.  She just recommended I get a double order of the mushroom ravioli appetizer, or a bunch of side dishes.  Boo! \n\nI started with one of their specialty drinks, a combination of prosecco and elder flower liquor, it was very tasty!  I ordered a Caesar salad with ranch on the side to start, it of course came out with the ranch tossed into the salad.  For dinner I ordered the double order of ravioli, BF ordered their large filet,  and we shared a side of mushrooms and their Flemings potatoes.   Overall my ravioli were very tasty but I could tell the sauce was pretty much just melted butter... so how can you go wrong!  My BF's steak came out at a solid medium, not the Medium Rare he requested. In addition, it had this weird separation of the meat by some sort of tendon or fat that I have never seen in a filet.  For a steakhouse that was very disappointing.  \n   \nOverall, the meal was okay and the service was okay.  If it was a $100 meal I would have given it a 3 stars, but for $200 I expect a lot more in terms of service.

Let me just say, it was like we dined at a totally difference restaurant!

To start us off, our server recommended a new specialty cocktail with vodka, fruit juice and Prosseco which was less than 99 calories.   It was delicious! She also recommended a couple Pino Noir options for Hottie, who was very pleased.  I started off with the Flemings salad.  Really nothing special, actually the dressing was rather bland and it was served over romaine.  It really should have been served over spring mix or arugula... and adding a little cheese never hurts!  Regardless, I was perfectly happy with the complimentary warm bread and infused butter spreads to start me off.  For dinner the server recommended a \"super secret\" menu item for vegetarians.    I'm not sure what it was called, but it had layers of spinach, portabella, asparagus and roasted red pepper served over a very tasty red cream sauce .  On the side, I ordered the chipotle mac-n-cheese, YUM!  I don't even want to imagine the number of calories that were stuffed into that plate of cheesy goodness!

The hostess was rather unenthusiastic.  It seemed was just her job to point us in the correct direction, which was the bar to wait as our table got prepared.  For a 5-star place, a reservation is a reservation, and the table should darned well be ready when advertised.  I expect to wait for a table at Outback, with the little buzzing and flashing beeper, but Flemings isn't Outback.  Right?  And as I will state later, getting the food orders correct was an even larger issue.\n\nFor background, I was part of a large group (11 people) for dinner.  The bread served before the meal was absolutely delicious; fresh, hot, with a crispy crust, tender middle.  Drinks and salads were ordered.  I got a Caesar salad, and all I can say is that it was adequate. I have had a better Caesar salad at my employer's cafeteria.  But, I'm not there for the salad.  Fleming's is all about steaks.  \n\nThe server moved around the table and took orders.  Our server was cheery and tried to make small-talk conversation with the table.  She took the orders where overall there were 8 steak orders (some of the couples got one meal and split it) and various sides.  I ordered the prime rib-eye; whenever I go to a steak place, it is my benchmark meal.  When the food arrived I had a very nice, although I would call it a bit small piece of Filet Mignon in front of me.  A very nice cut of meat, but it wasn't what I ordered.  Also, one of the couples at the table was not brought any food.  So, doing the math, the serving staff has a 25% chance in bungling your order.  The staff re-took the incorrect/missing orders and about 5 minutes later the manager was by to apologize.  The couple who had the missing order was offered a shrimp cocktail; I was not.  Maybe that is why I'm the odd person at the table.  I started munching on the community sides watching my other friends enjoying their steaks.  As for the sides, they were adequate like the Caesar salad; nothing to see here; although the Fleming potatoes were better than average.\n\nAbout 15 minutes later, my steak arrived, a bit rare for medium rare.  Gee that would make it rare.  I was hungry, and I ate it anyway.  The steak was very nice.  Tender and tasty, the way a good rib-eye ought to be.  To be honest it was one of the best rib-eyes I ever had, although slightly undercooked.  Much more tender than ones in those cowboy steak places.  There is something about the flavor of fat from a good rib-eye, and that is why it is my benchmark steak.  I was not alone on the notion under-cooked nature of the steak.  I guess from a management standpoint, undercooked is better than overcooked.  But I am of the school nothing goes back unless I am always within eyesight of my food.  I've seen the movie \"Waiting\".  \n\nWe got desserts, and did them community style.  The walnut turtle pie seemed to be the best liked.  I didn't do the walnut turtle pie.  Walnuts are a bit bitter for my tastes.\n\nThe timing for delivery of food was a bit slow.  This was \"European\" dining.  Reservation at 6:30, offered dessert 9:30.  So, in a way we owned the table for the evening, or maybe the staff realized they were not going to turn the table for another customer, and with a large group tip was set, so there was no need to hustle for the tip.  Slow service is fine, if that is what you expect.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed chatting with my other friends at the table, but this was not typical \"American\" dining service.  On the good side, the water glasses were filled with great regularity.  Water glasses were 12 oz glasses, and these glasses never got below half full.  Service from the bar was not as good.  I ordered a glass of Shiraz before the salad, and the glass arrived after the salad.  So, about 20 minutes to get my glass of house Shiraz.\n\nWith respect to the food errors, the manager did deduct the two meal errors from the bill, and that was very generous from Fleming's management.  But mistakes like this will crush high end places.  From a profit perspective, that's $80 that Flemings management isn't going to get, and a not so stellar review on Yelp.\nSo for me, I give Flemings a 4-star for food, 3-star for service, and a 2-star for value.\n\nAs for me, I'm not a high end restaurant guy, but from the small amount of travel I do for the company I work for, I have seen some higher end restaurants.  I was expecting penultimate experience, and I received an Outback level service experience.  \n\nUltimately, the question is: \"Did you get what you paid for\"?  For my money, it is a resounding no.  But Flemings is in the business to appease business types with expense reports and such.  It is sufficiently snooty enough to impress your customer, so the corporate sales guy can give the impression to his customers that the company he represents \"cares\".", "business_id": "9AbyBqGWHYZC73GlyAuTrQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-02-14", "type": "review"}

I arrived at 6:30 - waiting patiently for my 2 friends who were leaving the country for good, a little goodbye party.  \nMy waitress was the sweetest person I had met and she really cared about her job and the tables she was dealing with.  I couldn't help but love her.  I ordered food and drink off the Happy Hour Menu - and let me stop here to explain this amazing situation: $5 food, martinis and wine - ARE YOU SERIOUS?  (as a heart attack)\nAnyway I was still waiting on my very late friends and wanted to stick in their 2 drinks before happy hour ended - and the lovely waitress ordered them, but waited to bring them, because she doesn't want them to have warm drinks - Can you believe this amazing service? \nLets move into the Burger, with peppered bacon and cheddar cheese.  Huge onion ring, and a little wedge for my burger.  I have no clue what sauce was served, but it was outstanding too.  I scarfed half the burger and could barely save the second half for my BFF (who still wasn't there).  The BBQ Shrimp, Calamari and Ahi Tuna all were amazing and I cannot rave enough. \n\nI really appreciate staff and the restaurants they work at that go that extra mile.  They easily could have made me pay full price for the additional 2 beverages, but they didn't and its those little gifts that earn a review like this and a pat on the back!!", "business_id": "9AbyBqGWHYZC73GlyAuTrQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-01-05", "type": "review"}

Wine list is extensive (but heavy on the CA selections) and I found the ipad wine list hard to navigate. Waiter offered a tasting (quite small, not more than a couple of sips) and we requested a second and third and had to pay (a third of the cost of a glass per taste). Finally we chose a $56 bottle of Oberon after paying about 8 dollars for 2 tastes. Struck me as a bit greedy, considering the menu prices. I ordered French Onion soup -- very good altho not quite the traditional method (melted cheese over the pot) and partner had special soup of the nite -- a type of seafood, overpriced I thought at $14. Partner had the BBQ salmon which she said was \"fine.\" I ordered the smallest fillet mignon \"Newport\"  -- overpriced at $36 for something the size of a bar of soap (not the deodorant size; the kind you find for free in hotels). I ordered medium-well and it was medium-rare, and I found its seasonings/salt most disagreeable -- I kept tasting it again for hours afterward (sorry to say). Steak came with their house potatoes - kind of scalloped with cream and cheese and I did not care for the dish; the waiter was kind enough to remove it and offer french fries instead (which were fine). The waiter tried to be helpful but seemed rather inexperienced and hovered around too much. And the busboys were intrusive coming to collect plates seconds after it appeared we were finished with them. Manager offered a discount card on a future meal because I said we were celebrating an anniversary -- a nice touch but not enough to make up for the less than outstanding service, unsatisfying food and overall feeling that we were in one of a chain of restaurants (which we were) which lacked the exceptional quality I have come to expect from pricey places like this one. The price way exceeded the value of the experience. I must say the bread was excellent (but I was annoyed when busboys twice tried to remove the basket when the loaf was only half-eaten).", "business_id": "9AbyBqGWHYZC73GlyAuTrQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-02-19", "type": "review"}

While waiting, we used the iPad wine menu to explore the many, many wine selections that would be available to us at dinner.\n\nOnce seated for dinner, we had fantastic service from our servers, who were always attentive and helpful throughout the meal.  Their homemade bread and butters were great for a start while waiting for our orders.  Instead of wine, we went with the special Pomegranate and Sage Margarita, which was delicious.  For food, we decided to order their Seasonal Menu, a wonderful 2-course taste sensation starting with Lemon Ricotta Crostini with Fresh Pear Slices for an appetizer, and then an Iron Seared Delmonico Steak with tangy bearnaise butter and spiced blue crab topping.  It also came with a crisp potato cake and heirloom carrots. \n\nUnfortunately, one of our steaks was not cooked as well done as ordered, and had to go back to the kitchen.  The resulting extra/twice-cooked steak was disappointing at best.  This is the only black mark on an otherwise excellent dining experience.  To Fleming's credit, the manager came over to the table to apologize, without our asking, and did offer to remove the entire 2-course meal charge off the bill for the steak preparation mistake.

The bartender was so nice and down to earth and she mixed us an amazing gin concoction off their HH menu. It was potent, refreshing, not too sweet, and went down way too easy. The complimentary freshly made potato chips at the bar are scrumptious and perfect to settle your belly when drinking these strong drinks. \n\nDinner wasn't as great as the bar experience. My husband ordered a filet Mignon and I ordered a few sides, since I'm a vegetarian. Now, I don't mind going to a steak place as long as the side dishes are impeccable. I'm perfectly content with some delicious starches and veggies. I was looking forward to sampling their sides but our server wasn't very enthusiastic when I told him I was a vegetarian. He mentioned what he thought was good but he didn't really seem keen on selling what little they had for vegetarians. Hmmmmm...\n\nOn to the food... I had mac and cheese. It was good, not great. No comparison to the green chili mac n cheese at Roaring Fork. I had a loaded baked potato sans bacon. Again, just okay. Can't really screw that up. I did find the skin of the potato to be tasty... they salted it quite well. Had sauteed spinach too... was good. I ordered a dirty martini and it was awesome! \n\nMy husband was looking forward to his steak since he barely gets to go to steakhouses. He ordered his steak medium rare and was disappointed that it came out medium. He did not want to return it because we had to be at a show in less than an hour. He said the taste and quality was good but he could replicate it at home very easily for a fraction of the price. He had a tiny side of Fleming potatoes which was tasty but it was the exact same sauce they used for the mac n cheese. So don't order both because they taste exactly the same!\n\nOur server was okay. Kind of cold and I felt like he was disappointed that we didn't order more expensive items. I did like that the manager stopped and said \"hi\". I told him I was a vegetarian and he recommended the ravioli appetizer. It sounded delicious. He was very lively and personable. Wish he was our server...\n\nAtmosphere was weird... I expected it to be dark and hyper masculine, after all it is a steak house, but the wood paneling and extreme darkness was unnerving. With that setting you would expect the background music to be jazz or some Sinatra or something wouldn't you? Nope. They were playing top 40 from the last 2 decades. Kind of weird to be listening to U2 while eating steak and drinking dirty martinis.\n\nOverall, I don't think the experience was worth the money. Each side dish was $10. Most of the steaks don't come with sides and they are well over $30. Luckily we had gift cards, but otherwise our bill came out to $105. For under $20 I could have made the same meal and probably make it taste much better. \n\nWe did have an excellent experience at the bar. My husband was drooling over the bar burger the person next to us was having.

I was by myself and decided to eat at the bar.  Upon entering I was greeted by a friendly hostess who I asked if I could go to the bar and she said yes, it's open seating.  She could have walked me over if she really wanted to impress, but hey...\n\nUpon entering the bar, I was quite disappointed with the ambiance or lack thereof.  When you go to a nice steakhouse especially the bar, you don't expect it brightly lit and plainly decorated - plain painted walls and poorly positioned tv's that were not large enough to view from where they were positioned way off to the far corners of a very tall ceiling.  \n\nYou expect hip and fashionable with good music and vibe.  Especially when you ar paying $10 and up per drink...\n\nThe night was more of a disappointment from there.  I was given a menu and a wine menu but never asked if I wanted to order a drink.  I finally had to ask the bartender, a guy on the shorter side, not that it matters, who seemed to be too busy socializing with the waitresses and staff than to consider my drink order.\n\nI will say he was a friendly guy and I can see why he was so popular with the staff b/c all he did was socialize with them over and over again.  \n\nUltimately, he suggested the petite filet over the Scottish Salmon which he said was wild caught.  I went with his suggestion and asked for it medium which he said would be pink in the middle which I said was fine. \n\nI also ordered the tomato salad w/beets and was disappointed with the arugula as it appeared a bit wilted and the tomatoes were not chilled which they need to be to make this salad good.  Same with the room-temp beets.  Dressing was decent.\n\nI was working on my salad when the female bartender came over to me and asked me if I was done with my salad which I clearly was \nnot.  It was awkward b/c my steak was ready as one of the servers had come out and told her as I could see them conferring off to the side of the bar.  I told her I would be ready in a couple of mins and then realized that I should have probably just let them bring it out.  \n\nAfter finally getting her attention back, I asked to have it brought out.  Five mins later I was presented with a petite filet that clearly had been sitting on a hot plate and under a heat lamp as it was quite dry.  It also was a disappointing cut and had some fat on one side which I have never experienced before at a fine steakhouse...disappointing to say the least.  I also ordered the saut\u00e9ed spinach with oil, no butter and that was pretty good.  There were red onions in it which I typically don't like, but these were well-cooked and seasoned to my liking so I ate them.\n\nI had asked for a glass of Pinot Noir to accompany my steak and he recommended a glass of the PREDATOR\nZinfandel Lodi Old Vine, 2012/13.  It was hugely oaky and frankly the most overbearing red I have ever had.  I asked him to smell the bouquet or even try a sip.  It's then that he admitted he had never tried it.  Why would he recommend something he had never tried.  The wine was terrible so he poured me a glass of the Syrah which was much better.\n\nI looked at a menu nearby and saw that Flemings is part if a broader chain and then realized what I was dealing with.  It is their highest end brand I believe and I don't think it is being closely watched from the corporate offices; at least not this one.\n\nI finished my meal and the plates sat there for a good 20 mins without being cleared.  This is at the bar, mind you where the staff is basically on top of you by design.  I finally asked him for a refill on my water and 5 mins later he filled it for me after taking care of several other customers first.\n\nOn the positive side, the waiter suggested I not try the Chocolate Lava Milkshake since I told him I had to be up at 4 a.m. the next morning and had a trip to Hawaii  planned the following month.  With just that advice  I avoided a hangover as well as likely close to 10,000 calories.  He scored back some points for that one.\n\nAll in all, a lot of money for a average meal with no ambiance...likely wouldn't go back and wouldn't recommend it until managment instills a higher level of professionalism in the staff.", "business_id": "9AbyBqGWHYZC73GlyAuTrQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-12-11", "type": "review"}

My wife enjoys a good steak and so, I thought of Fleming s.

We sat at a booth which was nice and comfy. Our server was Nick who was very friendly, pleasant and  was very knowledgeable, but he cleared more utensils that he needed to and forgot to bring the two knives that were removed.

The salad, Lettuce Wedge, you were given a slice of bacon and blue cheese which you had to crumble yourself and my wife's Modern Caesar Salad was excellent. Main course, Newport Filet and Main Filet with a side of sauteed mushrooms were cooked to perfection and the button mushrooms are the ones I like instead of the sliced ones.\n\nWe followed the evening meal with the Turtle Pie and coffee which capped off a wonderful anniversary dinner. By the time we finished our first cup, Nick was right there filling our coffee cups again.\n\nThe manager came to our table several times to check on us, was friendly and gave us an incentive to come back which we will definitely use.

We do eat fish on rare occasions (so technically pescetarian), but I primarily cool entirely vegan at home, which is most of our meals.  We received a Fleming's gift card for Christmas, so made Open Table reservations to check it out.\n\nWe were immediately seated at a large booth.  The service was spot-on for our dinner.  Our waiter was attentive, but gave us our space as well.  We had a couple of glasses of wine, which were fine.  We didn't order anything special, as we have nicer bottles at home which makes it tough to want to spend a ton of $$ one wine at a restaurant.\n\nWe ordered the Jumbo lump crab cakes as an appetizer.  These were great.  Maybe not the BEST I've ever had, but right up there.  Next, we split the Heirloom Tomato and Homemade Burrata salad.  This was also nice - not overly dressed and quite simple.\n\nI wasn't all that hungry, so we decided to split two small plates.  We ordered the Seared Ahi Tuna and the New Bedford Scallops.  We also had a side of the Fleming's Potatoes.  First, the potatoes did NOT go with the food at all.  That is probably our fault for ordering them, but our waiter highly recommended them.  The potatoes were good, but very rich and the flavors were quite overpowering when compared to the fish.  Both fish dishes were great - we liked the Tuna better than the scallops.  \n\nOverall, we had a good meal.  Will we be back?  Probably not.

Obviously we like this restaurant; the food, atmosphere and service.\n\nI've written previous reviews but never one for Fleming's, which is my fault.  I've read the previous reviews and must admit this place wouldn't be highly recommended for vegetarians or vegans - it's primarily a steakhouse, by definition.  I rarely buy steak at home (because my doctors think I'm on a low-cholesterol diet), but I do love steak.  Fleming's has excellent steak, meat and fish dishes.  We've been to several Fleming's locations in the Phoenix area; they're all good. \n \n[Note:  The previous reviewer's comments are perhaps in the wrong location because they basically reviewed Paul Martin's American Grill.  Paul Martin's full name is Paul Martin Fleming.  His current restaurant is Paul Martin's but he has a long and successful history.  He created Fleming's Steakhouse but sold it years ago to Outback.  He also founded P.F. Chang's China Bistro (P.F. = Paul Fleming), Z'Tejas Southwestern Grill, and Pei Wei Asian Diner, all of which he sold.  As best I understand Paul Martin's is currently his only undertaking.  He was also formerly an investor and involved with Ruth's Steakhouse.] \n\nWe absolutely love all their food.  They offer an absolutely fabulous \"happy hour\" with appetizer's and hamburgers (which isn't by any means hamburger), and discounted drinks.  What a great introduction to Fleming's for those that have never been here before.\n\nOne of the things we particularly like is their bread.  As soon as you sit down they bring you warm freshly baked bread with some wonderful spreads.  If you want more, just ask and they'll bring another small loaf, but be careful because if you eat too much you won't get through your meal.  We rarely order their \"sides\" because we're not big eaters, but they are all terrific.  The one thing I never pass up is their wedge salad; a wonderful salad.

By the end of the meal we were debating whether it was our worst expensive meal ever. Here's what you get for $200/couple: It started when we were seated 20 mins late for our reservation - the hostess sounded genuinely perplexed that 'people are taking  longer than I expected.' (Hint: it's not your guests, it's your abysmal service.) Then we waited 35 minutes for first course, the squash ravioli, which was just OK (we were sharing it, but got no plates -- several waitstaff watched as we leaned over the table trying not to drip sauce all over). Then it was another 15 min wait until our spinach salad came (which was good). By now my wine glass was empty, and it would remain that way for the rest of the night without any offer for another. We had another 30 minute wait for our main course to arrive, which would have been more at home in an Outback Steak House and not even remotely worth the $50 price of admission -- my steak was undercooked, my wife's was overcooked. They weren't very tender or flavorful (mostly just over-salted). We ordered two sauces, and they brought the only one we DIDN'T ask for. The Fleming's potatoes, which I always love at the DC Ranch location, were mediocre here. The asparagus was cooked well but incredibly salty.\n\nWe also were treated to a show at neighbor's table as they sent back their steaks, and then received a shower of lobster bits as their server cracked open the shell (like a crustaceous IED).

The subject slice is a quarter of an entire pizza!  It comes with one topping and I went with the standby, pepperoni.  It's a thinner crust pizza, usually sliced across several times to make a slice so large, manageable to eat.  This last time, I had requested the slice remain uncut.  I wanted to pick up the whole thing and eat it that way.  It's a thinner crust pizza.  As the crust goes out from the center it gets crisper, the edge being near-crackery.  With pepperoni grease dripping & the smell of the oregano I shook on top permeating as I took-bite-after-bite, it was the pizza experience I had been craving.\n\nThe salad is a generous mix of romaine, tomatoes, the vegetables associated with pizza and lots of shredded mozzarella.

Being from Chicago, this was the pizza we had to try. The food is amazing, but the customer service stinks. We've ordered 5 times at least and have had a major delay 2 out of those 5 times. Tonight I placed an order for pickup. It is a 40 minute pickup time, but since the food is great, I agree. I arrived on time for pickup to discover that the woman hadn't even added the wings on to our order. I asked how long for the wings. She tells me 20 minutes. I told her to forget the wings, we'll just take the rest of the order. She then tells me that the order isn't ready and that I am looking at another 20 minutes. Tired from just arriving from a plane trip, I agree to pay upfront and have them deliver. I noticed while I was there that they had taken the phones off the hook because they couldn't accommodate any more orders. Even with $10 off the bill, I am outraged! It took almost another hour for them to deliver the food I had paid for upfront. I tried calling, but phones were still not being answered. No pizza is worth an 1 hour and 40 minute delivery time!!! Especially when it was supposed to be a pick up order to begin with. Good food, but poorly managed. If you have that much business, hire more help and do right by your customers!!!

I called to let them know, they argued saying I ordered something different. I was very specific when I ordered the first time and the guy even repeated it on the phone at the end of the order, so it was very clear they just dropped the ball. He never apologized once and asked me to drive there to pick up a new one if I really wanted it. I just told him to refund me on my card instead, as he sounded pretty pissed and I wasn't about to risk having a very angry guy remake me the sub I actually ordered. I was pretty bummed about the experience as I was excited to finally order from there. Oh and by the way, we could barely eat the  pizza...it was very below mediocre. Most frozen pizzas are better. :( We should have never strayed from Barros.\n.....quick update (months later)...they actually didnt refund the cost of the sub, instead they recharged me just for the pizza. So I paid for 2 pizzas and a sub and really received 1 pizza and the wrong sub. I had to go into the restaurant on a specific day to talk to the right manager to get it straighten out.

At 10:20pm I still had not received my order. I called the store and after waiting on hold for several minutes someone picked up and said sorry we're closed. I told them I placed an on-line order almost an hour ago and still have not received it. He asked my last name and after I gave it to him and he said to hold a minute he said \"it left awhile ago and should be there soon\" and then hung up. Not even giving me the chance to ask or say anything else! The driver showed up at 10:28pm and gave me my pizza and asked for payment. That's it not a sorry we were late or anything. He actually seemed annoyed and even though the pizza was late and service was bad I gave him a $3 tip. The pizza was below normal standards and the service/delivery time was awful! The way the pizza tasted and the way I was treated and with the delivery time it seemed like I was the last order of the night and they were pissed off to have to deal with it. If you don't\"t want to serve your customers good food in a timely manner then don't except the order if it's later then you want. I order a minimum of once a month from pappa johns, sometime more. This is the worst experience ever. If I would have received a \"hey sorry were late\" or something, I would not be writing you. However the pizza took close to an hour to get to my door and it was not the normal supper hot great tasting pizza. Very disappointed and will not be ordering for a long while. Thank you for your time.\n\nTo there credit I did get a phone call from the store manager, I think. He left me a voice mail asking to call him back so I can give him details. I didn't save the message so I didn't have the number to call him back. I'm a little surprised they didn't try a second time or contact me via e-mail or snail mail. I'm a chef at corporate run restaurant and when we have an upset guest we bend over backwards to contact them and make them happy.

It was a handwritten sign, the message was easy to understand and very clear. I didn't see any other pricing on the plants that made this misleading. As we walked through I saw a cashier running around watering some plants. We began the search for the elusive can. In the past, I had seen employees wearing company vests in various areas of the store. I'm pretty sure I walked a secret path where all employees were invisible. While staring up at the signs I finally catch a glimpse of an employee behind a lighting desk. I say hello and explain what I'm searching for. There was no smile, no greeting, no friendly tone of voice, I felt as though I was an inconvenience to this individual. We follow the directions and find the can. We decide to pay and exit through the plant department. On the way we see another rack of various sized plants and flowers. This rack had a printed \"50% off\" sign. We saw the original pricing tags in white and other tags in yellow.  In some cases the yellow tag was not 50% off the white tag. The sign didn't say 50% lowest price or price marked is 50% off. We banter back and forth between ourselves trying to make sense of it all. It would have been simple to ask a CSR...but there were none to be found! We arrive in checkout and the CSR is friendly, outgoing and helpful!! We donate to their current promotion, (sign the shamrock- they hang it and it will help some organization).

My office is about 50 yards from Sakana Scottsdale so we go there all the time. \n\nI actually have mixed feelings on Sakana. I know it's a great lunch spot but it might be much more than that ???\n\nMy main viewpoint on Sakana is a great lunch place with killer specials where you get excellent value for your dollar. The sushi is fresh and good. The cooked meals are great. The salads are great. Hard to beat when you're doing a lunch & want to have some reasonably healthy options. Add in the proximity and it's a no brainer.\n\nThe question in my mind has to do with their dinner options and going big on sushi. When we had them cater one of our holiday parties in the past, we had some conversations with them about what they do and got to talking about some less mainstream dishes: ankimo (monkfish liver), amaebi (sweet shrimp), etc. I didn't realize that they focused on these as well.\n\nSo a few weeks after that conversation, my wife and I headed into Sakana for dinner at one point and sat with Ray at the sushi bar. We proceeded to have a great meal. Really excellent. I was shocked as I'd always thought of it more as a \"lunch spot\" and wouldn't have considered it when thinking of going to my favorite spots like Yasu Sushi Bistro, Kampai, etc. Now we haven't been back for dinner since so I don't know if the stars were just aligned or if Ray was taking extra special care of us because of our discussion. So I'm hesitant to expect that we would have a similar experience just wandering in there for dinner. I need to give it another try though to find out.\n\nSo with that in mind, I cannot say they don't do great traditional, high quality sushi. \n\nI can definitely say though that the lunches are great and the value is excellent.\n\nFrom their killer deal of the Sakana lunch to the chirashi to the calimari/jalapeno salad to the chicken cutlet, I've never had a lunch there that I was really disappointed with.\n\nIt's probably our number 1 go to lunch spot. Always delivers.", "business_id": "Bjt3rB73dvSDe1XEPEWc6w", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-12-04", "type": "review"}

It wasn't until I moved 10 miles away did I start eating there. \n\nMy first time I ate there was almost two years ago. I remember being surprised that there was a line outside. From my limited experience with amazing, line-worthy restaurants this, typically meant a good thing. Long story short, I wasn't disappointed.\n\nSakana is a small sushi bar and restaurant tucked away at the end of a large strip mall. Its rather easy to miss the first time you drive by. I have always been impressed that the sushi chefs are Asian (I'm sorry but I always have found irony in how other ethnicity's cook and prepare another ethnicity's food. I'm not German, I'm not going to pretend I can cook German food well - Italian, well, that's another story... moving on). The place can seat about 10 people at the bar, another 50-60 people at tables and despite the amount of people the place can hold it's rather comfortable. The lighting is dim, the music is not intrusive and unless it's a Friday or Saturday its very easy to hear the group you're with even when it spans 2 or 3 tables.\n\nExcept for spring rolls (which are totally fabulous) I haven't ordered anything besides sushi & salmon nigiri. This is hands-down the best sushi I have had in Arizona. The fish does not taste like that terrible fishy flavor that makes you wonder if it's fresh or if you'll end up sick the next day, it has the flavor of the fish you are meant to be eating. The nori is rarely ever bitter, salty, chewy or pungent. Only a handful of times out of the dozen that I have been there have I ever been disappointed in the flavor, texture or presentation of the roll.\n\nPersonally I get the same thing every time I go. A Philidelphia roll and an avocado roll inside out (I like my rice outside the nori, thank you). They're my favorite and 9 times out of 10 perfectly made. It's pretty fabulous that the roll pretty much never falls apart which irks me at other places to no end. The salmon is well flavored and very smooth - it practically melts in your mouth.\n\nOther sources (some being people that I have converted to Sakana Groupies) tell me that the soft-shell crab roll is amazing. Their spicy tuna is fabulous (again doesn't taste like over powering canned tuna) and their eel roll has a surprisingly light taste, it's not as heavy or chewy as I would have thought. Order some rolls, snag some hot green tea (or some chilled cranberry sake) and appreciate some really great sushi rolls. I could do a whole review on just one roll alone...\n\nBeyond their rolls their nigiri (a piece of fish over a bed of rice) is great. Dab some wasabi on it, dip it in some soy and enjoy. A good friend of mine orders nothing but their nigiri - seriously they ordered about 16 pieces. If they have Toro on their list of sashimi, get some. You will not be disappointed..\n\nOther people have mentioned their amazing specials. They're open for lunch now and you can easily get out of there for about 8 bucks (1 or 2 rolls and water to drink). They have a great selection on their Customer Appreciation list (has about 8-12 rolls on there) and offer every evening at least one different dinner special in addition to the 5-10 specials they're offering that night. On the other hand, with a large enough party, you can also end up leaving with a tab in the hundreds. But it's worth it. \n\nIf it's only you or you're there with a small group (2 or 3) sit at the bar. You learn some pretty awesome things about preparation and some insider sushi secrets sitting at the bar chatting with the sushi chefs :) \n\nLet me know if you want to go... I don't pass up a trip to Sakana :D", "business_id": "Bjt3rB73dvSDe1XEPEWc6w", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-12-06", "type": "review"}

I usually order a dragon roll as well but for whatever reason Sakana doesn't have one. v_v. The rest of the group ordered yellowtail, salmon, tuna, some tofu and a few rolls. They got their order fairly quick but mine was delayed for some reason.

About ten minutes later I asked again and received the same response.

The menu and the food have changed over the years, but the general quality is still there. This last visit I got the Brooklyner, which has corned beef, pastrami, and braised brisket. I finished most of it, but could have finished all of it if I tried. I know some people expect these huge mile-high sandwiches (like in NYC) but I've been to some of those delis and they charge $20 for a sandwich. So the sandwich may be bigger but you still pay for it. Anyway, $13.29 is a bit pricey for a sandwich, but this sandwich had a really excellent taste to it. Mike T. got a beef tongue sandwich, which was equally tasty. Both were admittedly a tad on the small side considering the price, but I think that's a minor point.\n\nChompie's is unique in that it doesn't just focus on the deli elements, they do traditional breakfasts, some Mexican food, burgers, crepes, wraps, there's something for everyone here. I think it generally fits the transient mindset of the Phoenix area, where most everyone isn't from there, they're either just passing through or ended up there by a set of circumstances. You could view this trait as a big minus and say that Chompie's doesn't match up to a traditional NYC deli (which it doesn't). But like a lot of other restaurants in the area, I think its strengths are that it continues to try new things with the menu and it tries to just create good food and atmosphere without being confined in a box.\n\nNow on the menu they have 5 pounds of sliders for 50 bucks or so, it's free if you can finish in half an hour. That doesn't appeal to me, but it's just an example of a restaurant that isn't afraid to try something new while keeping their classic dishes in tact.", "business_id": "IM-9thHqQbBK5tX5MfTzBQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-02-07", "type": "review"}

Without  going into the a lengthy description of the dialogue that followed between my husband and Phil, suffice it to say that Phil had real attitude for manager.  At no time did he offer an apology, free dessert or to take anything off the bill.

Just like a kid who overdoses on sugar, I certainly got a week's worth of grease in just one bite of my meal. I ordered a Montecristo sandwich (my fav) and they somehow turned it into a cube of oil. My hands were glowing with grease and I could feel my body cursing me for subjecting it to that sandwich.\n\nAs happy and excited as I was to enter the restaurant, I felt equally shitty when I was done with the meal.\n\nDistinguishing factor: Menu and portions that will certainly rival your appetite.

With that being said, Chompie's used to be the only game in town.  This review is specific to the Scottsdale location. I would go back to the PV Mall location, but I'm all finished with the Scottsdale/Shea location.  The 4 of us went to eat, it was NOT busy. Our waiter, who had NO personality attempted to take our order. I asked for a corned beef on Kaiser roll. He told me they were 50 cents extra. I asked if he could please show me on the menu, where it said that, since it was not obvious to me and I couldn't see it.  I honestly didn't care about the 50 cents.  He said he doesn't know where on the menu it said that, but he knew it was there.  Ok, fine, I ordered my kaiser roll, prepared  to pay the additional cost, since that's how I like my sandwich.  I got up to take a walk over to the bakery, while our food was being prepared.  The manager, who was on duty that night, came up to my husband at our table and basically shoved the menu in HIS face to show him where it said there was an additional charge for kaiser rolls.  So when I got back from the table, he pointed it out to me. I then, took it upon myself to go up to the manager AND the server and I told them I was sorry, I wasn't trying to be petty, but my husband showed me where it said the additional charge on the menu. I apologized and told them I just couldn't find it, since it wasn't THAT obvious.  Well the freakin manager LAUGHED at me after I apologized!  Are you KIDDING me? How many restaurants actually have a customer who says they are sorry and then you are going to laugh at me? Apparently they have no idea that YELP is my newest obsession!

When we first moved to Scottsdale seven and half years ago, Chompie's was our go-to place . . . it didn't matter if we wanted breakfast, lunch or dinner.  Personally, I could eat breakfast for all my meals anyway so Chompie's fits the bill perfectly for me. But we tired of it after probably four years and thousands upon thousands of calories . . . so we gave it a rest, a two and a half year rest. And the funny thing is . . . now having gone back for brunch, I think I could put Chompie's back on our regular go-to rotation.\n\nSome things have changed since we were last there, but all for the good . . . new upholstery, new look to the menu, new carpet . . . but the same faces are still there . . . and the good old standby items are still on the menu . . . Service on this particular Sunday at 11 am was brisk, polite, friendly. The coffee refills came on time without even asking. If I had any complaints, it was that the napkins are a little thin for such huge and sometimes messy meals and they neglected to set out place with knives.  \n\nMy French omelet was divine, cooked perfectly.  I asked for the onions to be almost overcooked and they were, and my eggs were soft. If there is the slightest bit of brown on my omelet, it's a minus sign in my book. I usually can't finish a 3-egg omelet, but this was so delicious, I almost finished it -- okay, I left one bite. The home fries were also yummy, some a little charred, just the way I like it.  My hubby had the Long Island Expressway Skillet which came with plenty of Nova Lox, cheese, mushrooms, onions, scallions and potatoes. Loved it!\n\nAs were were approaching the restaurant an older couple in a car rolled down the window, said they were from out of town visiting and asked where Goldman's was located . . . I said, you are in Chompie's parking lot, stay here, you'll love it . . . it's an experience!\n\nSomehow I made it past the bakery without buying a thing! Everything looks so pretty. They even have high-heel shoe pastry.  That was new to me!

For the first time in my 4 decades of life, I left a restaurant without eating there because I was mad,  and it was this Chompie's.\n\nI was actually looking for a location to host a Meetup group that I'm the organizer for.  I saw that Tuesday was \"Kids Eat Free\" night so my 2 1/2 year old son and I went to check it out.  It was a beautiful night and we wanted to sit outside.  The tables were all set up on the patio  but apparently the server did not want us to eat outside because she was training someone and it would make it harder.  Our hostess went and asked another server, who also was not able or willing to serve us outside.  So, our options were to eat inside or to get it as takeout and sit out on one of the picnic-like tables outside without service.  We elected for the takeout, even though it was not the most convenient thing in the world to juggle the food with a toddler clinging to my leg.\n\nWhen I went to pay for the takeout, I was charged for the Kids Meal, too.  I brought up the \"Kids Eat Free\" and she said that was only for dining in, but she would ask the manager because of our circumstance.  She came back and said no, that the Kids Meal would not be free.  I think she was actually trying, the only person there I can say that about.\n\nBy that point, I was so annoyed that we went to Sprouts, got some nice, fresh strawberries, and went home, made our own sandwiches and opened a can of soup.  Probably healthier anyway, though I had been looking forward to trying the Reuben and the matzo ball soup.\n\nI'd imagine they didn't care much because I was not a big ticket customer with one adult and a free Kids Meal.

I love Chompies, but I don't think I will becoming to this location anymore.\n\nThe last time I was here was on a Friday night, which happens to be a night when they have fish tacos and unlimited fish and chips and while the servers kept saying they were \"really busy\" we were sat right away while noticing other empty tables. The host took and delivered our drink orders letting us know that our server was taking a \"smoke break\", which I guess was nice because we knew it would be a bit before he came over. Anyway, we were able to figure out our entrees by the time our server got to us and my husband went for the Reuben sandwich and I went for the fish and chips, but then I was denied because \"they were out and it would take 30 minutes\". Bummed out, so I opted for chicken strips (kind of similar, right?). \n\nOur entrees were delivered and while my husband's plate was the standard we've come to expect, the chicken strips were something you would see at a truck stop diner. Not only were they tasteless and dry, but they were DISCOLORED. Like the discoloration you get from freezer burn. I was going to wait for our waiter since, traditionally they always check on you soon after entrees are delivered, but instead we had to flag down the busboy to get our waiter. When he arrived and we told him the disappointment, he stood there saying \"what do you want me to do, do you want to talk to a manger?\". No sympathy or embarrassment from the low quality meal, just confusion from him. Naturally, we said, \"yes, send the manager over\". Well, he had the same reaction, \"what would you like me to do?'. I don't know if this is the new way the food industry deals with issues, but I find appalling that they ask the customer what to do. I would think one would be embarrassed enough to take the plate away, offer a new version of the plate, offer a completely different entree, anything rather than \"what do you want me to do\" about it type attitude. By that time, 30 minutes had passed, so when it was up to us to decide what should happen after the terrible chicken strips, my husband suggested to fish and chips and the manager said \"okay\". \n\nWhen that meal arrived, I was blown away by the difference in both taste and appearance, why couldn't this had happened sooner? Ugh, anyway after we \"complained\" it seemed our drinks were to suffer with not being refilled and I also wasn't asked by the waiter if this meal was okay or any better.\n\nThe service was sub-par, but I did get to exchange my meal which was nice, but that was only after a horrible meal. I don't know about this location anymore. I don't want to come back.", "business_id": "IM-9thHqQbBK5tX5MfTzBQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-01-10", "type": "review"}

I have someone who can vouch for me on this.\n\nHead chef notwithstanding, this is an absolute lock.  If you want a delicious dinner (or lunch) there is no question that you'll get it at Houston's.  And I will make the bold claim here: they serve the best cheeseburger in the state.  When the fries are right, they are amazing--thin yet crispy and deliciously salty on the outside but steamy and soft in the middle.  Yet it's the cheeseburger that gets my vote every time.  And this is in spite of the fact that I have had the hawaiian rib eye (amazing), the chicken sandwich (delightful), the prime rib sandwich (a savory taste sensation) and even remember fondly the best pork chops I've ever had at a restaurant, back when they served them.  (Butterflied with--yes--a tab of butter melted across the top of each side.  Fuck.)  But it ain't broke, so every time I get the cheeseburger, medium, no onions, and the juices ooze out to form an oh-so-tempting puddle on my plate--generally the only evidence that something edible even graced the plate in the first place.  Trust me on this.\n\nAppetizers: The smoked salmon appetizer is fucking ridiculously good.  And I don't even like salmon.  Also the chicago-style spinach dip.  For dessert, if they still serve the warm five nut brownie, get it.\n\nSides: if they offer the braised cabbage, go for it.  The brussels sprouts are also a delight.\n\nWait: get over it.  Dress relatively nicely because they claim to have a dress code.\n\nBottom line: one sure way to know if someone is a moron is if they don't like Houston's.", "business_id": "jBb5KHHAj4s8hcXVS6QXDg", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-02-13", "type": "review"}

The first time I went with a friend of mine.  I had their roasted chicken with couscous and we split the hot fudge sundae.  One of the most flavorful roasted chicken and couscous I have ever had.  And the fudge was rich and decadent.  I had it again the second time I went (yesterday) with my husband.  However, I was a little disappointed with the texture of the ice cream the second time.  It was a little bit on the icy side.  It was still really good though.  \n\nMy husband and I also had their Rainbow Roll and their Thai Tuna Roll (sushi).  Also some of the best tasting sushi I have had in the valley, but again I experienced a little bit of a disappointment.  The first roll that came out was the Rainbow Roll, and although it tasted great it was a bit too cold.  Yet, they made up for it with the Thai Tuna Roll -- the perfect temperature.  I also had the Hawaiian Rib Eye (medium rare), my husband had the Prime Rib (medium), and we both had their Cesar Salad.   All of it was very tasty.  The salad was crisp and fresh, with just the right amount of dressing -- thoroughly coating every leaf and not drowning them.  My rib eye was brown and carmalized on the outside and the center was warm and rare without being bloody -- just how a good steak should be. It was marinated in a light terriyaki marinade which gave it great flavor, perhaps a little sweet for my taste buds, but still very good.  I'm more of a savory person.  I can't say anything about the prime rib (I was too busy with my rib eye), but my husband thought his prime rib was very tender, not too fatty, and he thought the horse radish was balanced well so as not to overpower the flavor of the beef.  Our enterees also came with baked potatoes, which were good.  We did not get another side, but I think next time we go I will get a side of their vegetables to cut the richness of everything. We ended with the hot fudge sundae, but next time it will be the peach cobbler.  \nThe staff was also very great.  They were attentive without being overbearing and their smiles felt genuine.\nThe atmosphere is cozy due to the smaller size, lively, and comfortable.  No pretensions anywhere.\nAll in all, a great dinner.  We spent a worthwhile $175 including a bottle of merlot ($36) and 20% tip.  We left stuffed, happy, and a bit buzzed.

The spinach dip is a must on the list of starters regardless of the calories that come with it. I've enjoyed the chopped salad with a side of honey mustard.

A colleague suggested that we come here for a lunch meeting one day.  He said they had the best French Dip Sandwich in town.  Seduced by this claim, I had to give this place a try.  Of course, my first time there I had to try this legendary Sandwich.  Priced at $20, it better be good...\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/houstons-scottsdale?select=U0ixpfN85zASG-5U8eBq1w#U0ixpfN85zASG-5U8eBq1w\n\nI took one bite and OMG...!  It was friggin' awesome!  Even better than I expected.  The flavor of the Prime Rib and the Au Jus sent my taste buds into the stratosphere.  It also comes with a Creamy Horseradish Sauce that just adds to the flavor explosion.  The Bread is Buttered and soft, but had just the right texture to hold this all together and complimented the sharp flavors of the Beef and Sauce.  Wow, it is a masterpiece.\n\nThe service here is also impeccable.  You feel like you're dining in a 5 diamond restaurant....and it's lunch!\n\nI was so impressed after that 1st visit, that I've been back several times and have brought many friends and colleagues to experience the French Dip.\n\nMy other favorite item is the Hickory Burger (Canadian Bacon, Cheddar Cheese, Onion, w/Hickory Sauce), $14.  \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/houstons-scottsdale?select=CYjS0T6wl1Pe9fX_-DV9mw#CYjS0T6wl1Pe9fX_-DV9mw\nThat's right folks, there's a thick slice of Canadian Bacon that tops this Burger!  This is a big bad Burger....and it tastes awesome!  I can barely take a bite out of it....and it's not like some freakishly huge Burger, but the ingredients are fresh and stacked high....making for an awesome Burger.\n\nFor sides, the Cole Slaw is by far the best you can order and I highly recommend that.  The Fries are so/so.  \n\nAnother tip, if you come for lunch you can make reservations.  It can get busy, so it's worth the extra step to do so.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%", "business_id": "jBb5KHHAj4s8hcXVS6QXDg", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-01-18", "type": "review"}

The atmosphere is Southwestern Swanky so you get that cool, old school vibe. The leather booths and dark lighting gives it a classy, mysterious setting.\n\nI'm a low carb eater so my go-to menu item is their cheeseburger (sans bun) with the vegetable of the day (make sure to ask what the veggies are and if they say spaghetti squash or brussels sprouts, ORDER THEM! They are by far my favorite). Their standard veggies, or ones they usually have all year, are sauteed spinach or broccoli with Parmesan cheese on top. The burgers are SO GOOD here because they grind them fresh in-house. You'll be paying close to $15 for one, but they are tasty.\n\nI prefer to eat here at lunch time on the weekends when it's not so crowded. Evenings tend to feel a bit too \"formal\" and the place gets packed with the worker crowd during lunch hours on weekdays. Plus, if you go on Saturday, they have their awesome chili!

For the past 30 plus years we have always eaten at Don and Charlie's. Last year we finally realized that they were just not up to par anymore. We took a chance and tried Houston's. Typical Scottsdale eatery. Range Rovers, posers and people not at all concerned with paying WAY too much for average food. Hamburger, pork chop, kale salad and ribs. It was just ok. Have had better for much, much less money. First go around with the pork chop plate, the potatoes were cold. Got a replacement and they tried to charge for them. No pre-dinner anything. We asked for bread and they brought a \"bread service\" which is 4 slices of rosemary bread. $1 on the bill. Really? The ribs were pretty good but at $28 they should have been. Have had much better for a little more than half of that. The staff was attentive and very friendly, no problem there. Needless to say, we will be shopping around again next year.", "business_id": "jBb5KHHAj4s8hcXVS6QXDg", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-01-03", "type": "review"}

We came for lunch and it was surprisingly not busy. We had a baby with us and instead of using high chairs, they have one that connects to the table. I like that so much more because then the baby isn't sticking out in the aisle and they can feel included in the meal as well and right by mom/dad/whomever. They offer a very large bar with some craft cocktails. Only 2 of us were drinking and only one get a cocktail. It was a moscow mule. The drink itself was good, nothing over the top and it didn't come in a copper cup. They do have a good wine selection, somewhat limited in by the glass options but I made due and got a really nice Sav Blanc from New Zealand. I will say the pour is a little heavy and I love it! As for the food, 2 people split the Hawaiian ribeye as per the recommendation of our server. The portion was large for one person so it was perfect for 2. They asked for medium and it came medium with some parts a little medium rare so they were very happy. The char on it was perfect. My husband got the famous french dip. It was enormous. I think it was about 6 inches thick and mostly meat. It also looked like it was freshly sliced meat because it didn't have that dark brown crusted edge to it but was pink and clean cut. It was excellent. The portion was also huge, he struggled to finish it. Finally, I got the Thai steak salad and wow! I can't wait to go back and get it again. The amount of dressing was just right, it had a great spice to it but not enough that I wanted to grab water every few seconds. The portion was very large but I had no problem finishing it and basically licking the plate after. I would highly recommend this one. We finished the meal with their famous ice cream sundae. Before you laugh, it was more than enough for 4 of us to share and they give you a gravy boat of hot fudge on the side. Did you hear me- a GRAVY boat full of fudge.

Walking in on a Saturday morning at 9:30, the place was jam packed with folks of all ages. The staff quickly greeted us and scurried us to an open table while keeping a smile on their face. Looking around, guests looked like they were having a good time. Whether it was the group of partiers who needed some grease to settle their hangover or the retirees on the run from Sun City andd taking a morning walk to get breakfast and coffee, I saw just about every type of person at Randy's. \n\nNow let me get to the menu. I am pretty sure that not a thing on the breakfast menu exceeds $6.00. Slowly but surely, Scottsdale's losing this trait of economically priced meals so I salute Randy's for keeping the prices down. Now on to star number two in my book of Randy's cuisine. Do you ever go to a restaurant for breakfast and think...I'd really like an egg but I'm also craving a pancake or french toast, but I don't want nor do I need a full order of carbs. I do all the time. I love pancakes and I love french toast, but there's a rare occasion when I actually order that as my main entree for a meal. Enter Randy's. In their 20+ breakfast combination choices, they offer options like \"one egg, one piece of bacon, and a half order of french toast\" or the same but with a pancake instead. When I read this, my heart skipped a beat for Randy wherever he is. And let me also mention that this meal is around $4.50. Can't beat that! \n\nThe food itself was just what the doctor ordered. It tasted homemade, with flavor and it was just the right amount of food. Now don't walk in expecting The Food Network to feature Randy's, but if you want a solid breakfast at a decent price, this is your spot. But buyer beware. They only accept cash or checks. Better bring some cash because if you are under the age of 60, I highly doubt you're walking around with a check book and if you lack both, you'll be slapped with a $3 ATM fee. That's nearly the price of the meal! \n\nSo until next time Randy's. With a six (?) page menu chock full of everything imaginable in small town USA dining, I think I have my hands full getting through it!", "business_id": "68_EJEA9Ibo55EDp3d-nOg", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-12-11", "type": "review"}

I wish I would have gotten a hamburger instead. It looked so good after i ate half of my bland breakfast burrito with bacon(bacon and eggs you cant go wrong in a tortilla with cheese but THEY DID!).  So i added some salsa to it to see if it would kick it up a notch...Did it work? (oh hell no!) it just felt like it added unnecessary moisture to my burrito. So i had to call the waitress who i only saw for the most part when we first arrived and up until I got my extra hot sauce that was desperately needed severely. The fact I only ate half is bad for a business that means I didn't enjoy nearly as much as I should have.\nI really really wanted to try their pies because they are supposed to be awesome and home made and I do not mind trying places that are supposed to have good pie because I like to compare and contrast to my own pies. \n\nBut what really pissed me off is i had the time to ask her what kind of pie they had and then our waitress went missing did not come back til the guy I am a caregiver for finished all his food and wanted his bill. BUT i easily could have finished a pie ala mode before he finished his food if she came to check on us one time after the hot sauce incident. I was trying to figure out where the hell she was most of the time and I had noticed that she was outside waiting on tables. Why on earth would a manager allow a woman or man wait on a huge area in two different areas?\n\nHuge pet peeve i easily could have given them 4-5 stars if the service was decent that day and they easily were on the right track up til the hot sauce incident.

If I cannot be safe then what's the point?  First off a yelp check in offer appears for this restaurant stating a deal on gluten free toast.  According to the Manager they don't advertise with yelp and think that yelp is a rip off because if you don't advertise with them then you get less stars...so that is why she'd never advertise with yelp. So I don't know why that comes up on my phone app.\n\nI am a celiac so it is dangerous for my health if I eat gluten (wheat, barley, etc.)  This restaurant offers gluten free toast and pancakes.  Most people would assume that since they offer these choices then they would follow cross contamination guidelines and know how to prepare food to keep people with Celiac safe.\n\nThis is not the case. Yesterday, I had an excellent waitress.  I asked her point blank if the gluten free toast (which is more expensive) was toasted in a dedicated toaster.  She said that yes, it was toasted.  I then said again specifically, \"So you have a toaster JUST for the gluten free toast?  And you are using separate utensils and butter?\"  She looked at me like I was speaking Russian (and that is NEVER a good sign when addressing these issues.)\n\nShe stated, it's toasted in the big toaster we use for the toast.  AH!  So then I asked if they prepare the gluten free pancakes on the same griddle as the regular ones and prep those in the same area as well.  And the answer (that I figured was coming) was yes.  No, there is no other prep area in the back for keeping gluten free items apart.  No cross contamination education imparted.  She didn't even understand that there needed to be any procedures followed. \n\nNow, don't get me wrong, this was a very nice waitperson.  She was very concerned when I was asking her these questions.  I asked her if she could make sure that someone with clean hands (not having touched regular items) could get me my slices of gf bread and just put them on my plate and not toast it?  And she did that for me herself!\n\nPretty soon the Manager came over to follow up on the gf toast issue.  I asked her again if they had training and separated areas for the gf products and she said that they did not.  I asked her why they didn't if they were offering gluten free toast and pancakes.  I told her that I get sick when the toast is made in the same toaster from the other bread crumbs being on my gf toast.  That I had eaten it there before and now understood why I had been sick!\n\nHer answer (I kid you not!) was that people with Celiac Disease should just KNOW that a restaurant like theirs wouldn't follow protocols or that a person should ASK how they were prepared.   They just offered gluten free items for people restricting gluten from their diet for lifestyle.\n\nREALLY?  Advertising something gluten free and charging significantly higher prices for it do NOT get you access to the safety of training your employees?  NOT stating that on your menu?  I now KNOW that she knows there is a difference since she said that she expects Celiac's to know they won't follow safety precautions!\n\nI told her that I think that she is endangering people's health and that her answers were not acceptable.  Her entire explanation was that I couldn't possibly hold her responsible for my issues if I didn't explicitely state my needs to her so they could tell me their gf foods are unsafe for me to consume.\n\nI won't be back!  But if you don't have gluten or other dietary issues.....go ahead on!", "business_id": "68_EJEA9Ibo55EDp3d-nOg", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-12-09", "type": "review"}

You get your choice of how you want your eggs cooked, and type of potatoes and toast. I decided on poached eggs, country potatoes, and wheat toast.\n\nI only waited maybe 5 minutes for my order. Wow they are fast! Driving home, the delicious savory smells wafted through my car, increasing my hunger for breakfast! I opened up the to-go boxes and found hearty portions of each component of my meal. They were as follows:\n\nCorned beef hash: Looked like it came straight from a can (Perhaps a Hormel can?) Tasty nonetheless (I grew up on that stuff!), and it looked like they dumped the whole can's contents, griddled it, and put it in my meal.\n\nCountry potatoes: Perfectly cooked and griddled, with a good savory taste.\n\nPoached eggs: They came in a small Styrofoam cup with lid to keep the other parts of my meal from getting soggy. The yolks were a little more hard-cooked than I usually like.\n\nToast: The weakest part of the meal. I got 2 whole slices of buttered wheat toast, but each slice was burnt. The toast came with one packet of grape jelly.\n\nOverall, it was a lot of food for the amount I paid, and I ate everything (Except the really burnt parts of the toast) with gusto. They accept cash or check only, which keeps prices down. \n\nSince it was cold outside that morning, I didn't venture out to the patio area, but it looked nice.

The food was great, and prices reasonable; that's the one star. CASH ONLY! However, no one mentioned CASH ONLY! until it was time to pay.  That's why only one star--now, there is a sign (not prominent) on the window outside, and there is a sign by the narrow aisle to get to the seating.  However, when it is busy, like lunchtime, and many people are standing in that area, the sign is obscured.  So imagine after a fine meal when you try to pay you are surprised with CASH ONLY!!  Yes, there is an ATM in the lobby; it charges $3.00 for you to use it (I'm sure Randy's gets a cut for letting it be there), and then my bank charged me $2.00 to use it.

My boyfriend bought a pair of rimless frames and was upsold on super pricey \"high index\" lenses that were supposed to be thinner than normal ones. (They were virtually the same.)\n\nThey came in (after the first three pairs from the lab failed quality inspection) and we had to wait for an hour while they put in the extra set of lenses because the initial set had a bubble. The second set they put in seemed ok till we were home and he noticed that there is a small watermark on the lenses visible in each eye's field of view AND the lenses weren't even cut to fit the frame correctly. These are $600 glasses by the way, just sayin'. \n\nWe spoke with a very unapologetic and defensive manager/supervisor, Angel who was shaking because she was so angry (that she had to offer customer service to someone with legitimate concerns??) said the markings are standard and they couldn't do a perfect cut with the frame he selected.  I was very thrown off by her behavior since the customer in this situation was being really calm and friendly about the whole situation. I've verified since then that these markings and off-cut are not standard at most quality retailers and I have a hard time believing it is for a trusted name brand like LensCrafters.\n\nHe reordered the glasses with regular polycarbonate lenses so that he wouldn't have to deal with indicator markings. They told him it would take up to two business weeks to fill the order. After two weeks passed he called, Angel said she would call him back and never did. This happened twice and because he wasn't getting any return calls, he finally decided just to go in to the store. When he did they did in fact already have the glasses and he waited for her to prepare them -- not sure how long they were sitting in the store.\n\nIt ending up taking over a full month to get these glasses. In the meantime, the immature manager and the sales rep, Marina that we worked with offered no apologies at all.  Apparently, once you've paid they don't want to deal with your issues. I found the experience really disappointing because I've always had extremely positive dealings with LensCrafters in the past, but we won't go to this  location again in the future.", "business_id": "VJMDdI_zOcACApaOG452Iw", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-02-01", "type": "review"}

(2009 was the first time I had my hair lightened.)  Parking lot was empty, but it was raining hard, so I wasn't surprised... Besides me, I think there may have been only one other client, back in the coffee/tea room.  Again, not a big deal, since I don't like crowds.  After checking in for my appointment, I was invited to sit down in the waiting area.  I found the wait pleasant- the area was tidy and cozy, and the music peaceful.  If you like to rummage through books and magazines, or look at hair and body products (and whatever else you may find for sale at salons), you won't have to look very hard here!  You'll find something to keep your mind busy, but I like to take the time to de-stress.  The receptionist offered something to drink, which is always nice!\n\nAfter meeting up w/ my hairstylist/colorist, she showed me where to dress down to my comfort level and put on a robe.  Yes, it wasn't a plush robe, and it made me feel uncomfortable, as it wasn't very flattering, but no one was around to see me, anyway, so I didn't care :)  After finding my way back to my colorist, we discussed about the results I wanted to see and feel, and she then told me what procedures she would take me through and how long each phase would take.  I found her a good listener and felt comfortable that she knew what she was doing.  I'm not much for talking while at salons, and I sensed that she knew this, but when I would speak up and ask her questions, professionally and personally, she was open to talking, as well.   I found this refreshing, bec. I've met quite a few stylists throughout the years that act slighted or mad when I'd rather not talk...\n \nThe results were fantastic!  My stylist didn't lie- the products she used made my hair very shiny and silky to the touch (some things that were lost due to the color-stripping), and the fact that it took awhile (from a few hours to a few days!) for others to realize that I had colored my hair back to brunette (I had caramel, blonde, and red high- and low- lights) is testimony that the coloring looks natural!  (Actually, the color she gave me is the darkest I've ever had my hair- darker than my natural haircolor.)  Many people did comment on how much weight I've lost, which isn't fact, so I attribute all the compliments to my darker hair :)\n\nEasier to access than Tempe's Moodswings (free parking!) and none of the snobbery one can find at other salons.  Less expensive than comparative salons, too!!  Friendly and knowledgeable staff, comforting and welcoming ambience... Give Spa Lamar a try!\n\nBTW, every first Wednesday of the month, Spa Lamar holds \"Live at Lamar,\" a \"happy hour\" of sorts, from 6p to 9p there's live music, light apps (nothing fancy, just something from the grocery, I'm told), and perhaps cocktails.  MOST SIGNIFICANTLY, if you bring a friend who's never been to Spa Lamar, services are BUY ONE, GET ONE FREE!  That's right, you read correctly!  What are you doing this coming First Wednesday?

All tolled, I was there for 6 hours: from an early yoga session masterfully led by Lisa Valle, who wove mind/body/spirit into the one hour and 15 minute practice, to a chocolate-peppermint body scrub, then an added-on facial (as I was happy to remain in the company and expert hands of Natalie, the asethetician), to lunch and the finaly service of the day - a pedicure that included extensive defolliation and leg/foot massage. \n\nThe staff members I encountered were all professional and extremely courteous.  I felt welcome and pampered.  The services were simultaneously relaxing and invigorating.  Peaceful. \n\nThe facility is conveniently located on Scottsdale Rd. with ample parking by the entrance, which is behind the main thoroughfare making for easy access.  However, the interior looks ready for an rejuvination of its own - the painting and furnishings are dated, the towels worn and frayed.  Same for the small poolside area.  \n\nThere are many selections one can chose for lunch upon checking in. My choice was a salad, which was set out for me in the main dining/lounging area after my tacked-on  facial request (I do have to commend the staff for being so accommodating) and was sent in a plastic container from a local, well-established take-out deli.  The fresh-baked cookie dessert was served to me warm on a plate during my pedicure, making for a nice touch to the otherwise standard fare. \n\nLiving in Scottsdale, I've had the pleasure and opportunity to sample many of the amazing spas in the local resorts.

I asked for most of the work to focus on my shoulders and forearms, which he did, but didn't neglect my legs and feet which was great! \n\nAfterward we spent another 3 hours lounging which seemed to completely fly by.

I can't remember the last time I was at a hotel that required a wired connection. Plus, the wired internet costs 12-13 bucks a day.\n\n3. Paper-thin Walls. We could hear the two brothers in the next room wrestling and smacking each other. Occasionally you'll hear the father scream at them.

Our first visit was ok.

I made an appointment with Dr. Ketchmark since we had seen him before.\n\nUpon arriving, I sat in the waiting room and was ignored for 15 minutes.  In that time, there was only one other person in the waiting room, so it's not like it was crazy busy.  I was clearly upset and crying a bit, so perhaps they didn't want to deal with me?\n\nWhen someone finally came over she asked \"what are we seeing Daisy for today?\"  Daisy was the other person's animal.  NOT a cat, but a dog.  I told her that she was there to be euthanized (hello, do you not keep notes in your appointment book???) and was told to come back to a room.\n\nOnce back in the room she asked which doctor I wanted to see.  Again, do you not keep appointment notes????? And then left me to wait for the doctor.\n\nDr. Ketchmark himself was fine.  He explained the procedure to me and gave my cat the first shot.  I could hear the staff laughing and chatting which was a bit unnerving considering why we were there.  Maybe put people in this situation in a room that isn't right off the front lobby?  He was pleasant and thoughtful when treating her, and both he & the vet tech expressed their condolences.\n\nAll in all, I wouldn't go back to them again for a situation like this.  Total lack of sensitivity from the reception staff and clearly some disorganization.

The walls are VERY thin. I heard the neighbors coming home, talking, breathing, etc. The TV was an old tube style TV! Come on even Holiday Inns now have LCD's lol. Sorry I judge hotels by TVs :)\n\nI ate at the hotel restaurants and was not pleased. The food is lackluster at best without much variety nor flavor. And that's including the breakfast buffet! I live for my breakfasts when I travel so not meeting my standards in servicing such a simple but best meal of the day is disappointing. I know hotel food is never the greatest but I've had delicious meals at many hotels. \n\nThe highlight was definitely eating at Fleming's Prime Steakhouse & Wine Bar, which is connected to the hotel.

The room is really old and country style feeling (meaning more casual), but the bathroom is really small, hardly have any space if you have two people in there. \n\nBig Pros is their breakfast bar is super great. Food and service are nice, that's the only highlight I can say. I might just come back for the breakfast, but might stay in other place if I need.  \n\nCons is, besides the quality of the property is much lower than other Hilton, their front desk people are kinda in a mess. \n\nWe booked a room to stay for two nights, and when we arrived early morning for check in, our room has already been sold to someone else, and they have no other similar type of room in this hotel (the most expensive one they offer). We have already been charged for the deposit for that room. This is so unacceptable! How come they sell your paid room to other customers without informing you and double check if you want to cancel it, or you do not intend to show up? \n\nCould't offer us the same type of room, the manager can only give us the standard room for two nights instead. I asked him if we will get charged for the room we originally booked, because in my understanding we will, but he said no, and there is no charge yet. OK we believe in his words, and it turns out to be a lie- we got charged for what they called \"cancellation fees\" for the room they didn't keep for us. After we found out, I called the accounting dept refunded that part. So I guess their manager either didn't do his job to cancel the charge, or he just fooled on us and hoped that we won't check credit card account and find that out. Sigh\n\nExcept the charges for two nights, the wrong cancellation fee charge, we also got charged for $280 for no reason. Their accountants cannot even find the charge in their system, they don't know what it is...too ridiculous to be true. They triple charged us and don't have a clue...I seriously doubt the security system in this Hilton. Probably someone stole our card just swiped it multiple times...having stayed in so many Hilton, never experienced any service like this.\n\nThree hours later, their accountant finally be able to sort it out and call me back, that the $280 was the \"no show up\" charge. He admitted that room we booked was \"double booked\" that night, and that's why when we tried to check in the room was unavailable. He refunded me that part, sort things right. \n\nIn the end, I think this is what happened- the front desk guy who created a new reservation for the standard room for us did not cancel the previous reservation, so we kept being charged. Glad we found it out and cured the mistake!!!

Lastly, the restaurant service is slow.  What was good was the maid service.  When we checked out we also received a $5.00 charge Per Day for Internet.

The hotel itself is very beautiful, with a holiday decorated lobby, and well landscaped pool and lounging area. They have infused water daily in the lobby and it is DELICIOUS! Each day was a different flavor, I can tell you I drank this water all day, every day that I was there.  They also offered a brochure with recipes to make your own water at home.  A really cool little perk, and I love that they had more than just standard coffee and tea for basic refreshment. \nThe room was very clean, and aside from the bathroom, very spacious.  The bathroom was TINY.  When you open the door to the bathroom, the door just misses hitting the commode...it was an awkward set up.  The water pressure and temperature were both good.  I loved that they give you a full range of travel soaps including shampoo, conditioner (so rare at hotels anymore), bar soap and shower gel and a shower cap.  I didn't love that the scents of these products as they were a bit on the manly-smelling side. I can understand that it must be difficult to find a unisex fragrance but there has to be a better one than the one these soaps had.  So if you are female travelling to this hotel, bring your own. If you're a male, you're good to go!  \nThe first night there I ordered room service, I went for easy and just got a burger and fries, it was probably one of the best room services meals I've ever had. The burger was cooked perfectly, and the fries were crispy and hot.  It was also delivered quickly which was awesome. \nSleeping was not easy at this hotel...the beds were squeaky...every time I rolled over the bed frame squeaked loudly.  Also, the room did not have a good barrier against sound.  All night long I heard people in the hallway, doors slamming shut, and a couple of times I even heard the TV from the room next door.  It was frustrating to not be able to get a good nights sleep either night I was there.   The second night I was there I went next door to Fleming's for dinner...very convenient as I did not have a car and this hotel did offer several dining options.  I was able to eat in the bar area with their happy hour menu, the crowd was friendly and the service and food were perfect.  I would absolutely recommend eating here, especially if you are trying to save money(I know not a normal statement for Fleming's Steakhouse ha ha).  The happy menu goes until 7 pm, the burger and fries is $7 and it's probably the best cheeseburger I've ever had in my life.  The Blueberry Lemon Drop Martini was $6 and it was very tasty.   They offer two happy hour menus, one from 5-7 PM and one from 7-9 PM each with their own unique dinner/drink choices and prices.  The 5-7 PM menu is slightly cheaper, but either option is a great way to eat at a gourmet steakhouse and still save money. \nWe were in Salons 1 & 2 for the conference, very quiet and spacious, perfect for a conference setting.  Both days offered a light continental breakfast and a lunch, I assume both were catered by the hotel's restaurant.  The food was very good, and the choices were plentiful.  The first day's lunch alone offered chicken, beef, sides and salads, along with an array of desserts.    \nThe wi-fi at this hotel is very frustrating...as a HHonors member you get free basic wifi, but it's spotty and doesn't work great. Of course you can pay for better wifi, but with the cost of hotels these days I find it utterly ridiculous that ANY hotel should charge for this feature.  There was a separate wifi connection for the conference rooms, which kept making you refresh and go to the Hilton screen. It was very annoying that the wifi was not constant.  \nIf I had to base this review on staff alone, I would give 5 stars.  The entire staff was some of the friendliest I've ever encountered at a hotel. From check-in, room service, housekeeping, and check-out, they were all attentive and always said hello.  Also, the gift shop was a great find as well. They were having a huge sale while I was there and I picked up a perfect weekend travel bag for around $15.  Apparently they have these sales often, so if you stay there, definitely stop into the gift shop, they have a ton of great souvenir type stuff. \nOverall my stay was okay...but I can't say that I would stay here again (barring a work event) because I can overlook a lot of things, but not being able to sleep is a huge issue for me.

It was rough at first as they gave us 2 queen beds vs. a king like we had reserved, but they were more than helpful in accommodating us in getting a king. Unfortunately most of the king beds are all around the ends of the hotel and not pool views they told us, so they sent us all the way to the back of the building to an available king room. However It was facing Chaparral Rd. and was so noisy (from the street traffic) in that room. We ended up back to the 2 queen beds, which after all, worked out okay. Bright side is we got more pillows. :) \n\nThe rest of the 4 days we were there were great! The breakfast is a full restaurant and was included free with our stay! Great, fresh food, cooked to order. We saved quite a bit of money from not having to go out and buy breakfast. Breakfast was one of our favorite things about the hotel. :) \n\nPool, hot tub & fountains looked great! We didn't have time to swim but it was really nice to see the cleanliness of everything on the grounds. Another great thing was the free parking and so close to Old Town Scottsdale and the Fashion Square Mall. The only down side of the parking is that in the evening it is very hard to find a parking space.

Some of the throwback facets were rad: cafeteria style breakfast (made to order), dilapidated pool tables, and elevators whose machinery in the backing was exposed to the pool/plaza (although all I could think about was if I were a kid here, I'd hang on the cables while my brother rode inside to the fourth floor looking down at me through the window-walls).\n\nBut when you get in the rooms, it's a little off-putting: old school thermostats, VERY few outlets, wifi that don't work so it requires ethernet from the phone jack which is located in a (modernly) strange place.\n\nThis joint hosted mostly older folks, too-- and that ain't a bad thing.

The front desk attendants seemed to be relatively bored with helping me. As soon as I approached the counter I was asked for a credit card and an ID, I presented both together and the man behind the counter barely looked at my ID before swiping my credit card. Next he had me sign a receipt for 504 dollars for the length of my stay, explaining that this was all I was to be charged. After this quick transaction he gave me a small map that pointed me towards my room and the most convenient way to access the elevators. Once inside the room I was horribly disappointed by what I saw. It looked nothing like the pictures on their website, in fact it looked like the rooms were in need of a remodel. The bathroom was directly across from the kitchen with a hallway between the two that was barely big enough to fit my luggage through. After settling in, I decided to check out the pool, because the pictures made it look very relaxing and luxurious. Upon getting there I found out, that not only was it nothing like the photo it was half the size. And to top it off the pool is a salt water pool, with an odd green tint to it and warm water. \n\nFinally I returned to my room to look for nearby food places since I would be staying for a week. After deciding to go to Yardhouse, I checked my bank account. Imagine my surprise when the 504 I was supposed to be charged turned into 800! After seeing this I rushed down to the front desk to question the charge. While waiting to speak with the manager I overheard her telling a couple (who was leaving because of the state of the rooms in comparison to what they were promised) that she could do nothing about it because the renovation that would make the hotel look closer to what is on the website is not scheduled until July! The couple ended up finding a new hotel to stay in and she immediately walked away from them, while they were still standing at the counter no less. I walked up to where they had been standing and politely asked if she could speak with me next. She came over, seeming very exasperated and when I asked about the charge she looked at me like I had an extra head. \n\nHer reply was simply that's your incidental. And when I told her her employee stated I was only to be charged the 500 she shrugged and said its like a hold and walked away. All of this happens on just the first day of me being here, I can't imagine anyone willingly staying here, if I wasn't here for a conference I had to attend for school I don't think I'd choose this hotel again. \n\nMaybe being raised in Vegas has jaded my opinions and the way I judge hotels, but this experience so far has been truly awful.", "business_id": "Xe-zwcsX5EikIK6Ul5bGlw", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-12-11", "type": "review"}

Yep, all that resulted was the need to replace the whole damn thing.  So we spent a lovely evening at HD browsing the commodes.  Picked out a sporty little model, but they don't really let you test drive it.  Enter Anne.  Do you need any help?  Nope, we got this.  Then the barrage of questions.  Do you want round or elongated?  Chair height or standard height?  Single flush or double flush?  Uh, does it matter?  Apparently, it does.  Men prefer elongated you know?  Why?  You could give them a target the size of a swimming pool, and they'll miss.  Men also often prefer chair height?  Why?  It's more comfortable for them, and we all know how much time the average man sits parked on the pot.  I'm pretty sure mine has a Playstation hidden in there somewhere.   Men also NEED the double flush.  Saving water is great, but if you have to flush six times, you really didn't.  She also made sure we got the right seal.  You need the double wax seal, not the standard wax the installer will try to use.  You also need an extra long flexible hosey thing (my words not hers) for the chair height.\n\nSo it's all about men.  Thanks to Anne, we flushed our original choice down the toilet (hahahah), and went with the super industrial man model-elongated, chair height, double flush.  I feel like a 2-year old on it, but he's happy.  And this is one sacrifice I'm willing to make.", "business_id": "PmZ3Ft4aOGpzhpPnF21loA", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-01-25", "type": "review"}

Neighborhoods were more stable, everybody knew everybody. When you went into a store, the shopkeeper called you by name and probably knew what you were planning to buy. For better or worse (and it certainly wasn't all good) those times are long gone - but we found a little slice of it last Friday.\n\n     When we walked into Casella's Italian Sub Shop at about 3PM, we were warmly greeted by Joe and Denise, a father/daughter team. Joe, originally from Philadelphia, opened the restaurant thirty-three years ago in this exact spot in a strip mall on Granite Reef, just south of McDonald in Scottsdale. Denise started working with him twenty some years ago. They instantly know if you're part of the \"family\" or a newbie. If you're curious about an item on the menu, you're given a taste. Most of the things are made in house. Joe cooks 70 pounds of chicken breast a week for his famous chicken salad. Mom makes the meatballs, and Denise the cannoli filling. I could go on, but you get the idea. These are genuinely nice people who care about their product and want to please the customer. Joe gets in every morning at 7:30 (although service doesn't start until  11 AM) and stays right through closing at 6 PM. He likes to know what's going on. Saturday closing is at 3 PM so everybody can spend time with their families. And there's a lengthy Christmas break for the same reason. Very nice.\n\n     Naturally, Philadelphia Steak Sandwiches ($6.60 - $7.20) appear on the menu. Joe's isn't your typical greasy, cheese whiz loaded, meat too-tough-to-chew sandwich (which, I admit, often appeals to me): here the meat is meltingly tender, sauced with a little marinara, and topped with provolone, served on an outstanding roll made by a local family baker.\n\n     We had to try the chicken salad sandwich ($3.70 fir a half, $7.20 full size) - we knew it would be fresh since Joe cooks up a batch most mornings. In the back cooler you can see huge jars of mayonnaise waiting their turn. The salad was very simple, not gussied up with lots of add-ins. I will say that when I ate the leftovers at home I added a dollop of cranberry sauce. I think I'll bring some to Casella's next time we go.\n\n     After 2 PM, if you buy two sandwiches, you get a third free. So I chose the Italian Hoagie ($3.70/$6.80). Ken was astonished to find that he actually enjoyed this one. What made it truly delicious, oddly enough, were the onions. Thinly sliced, and sweet enough to be eaten on their own, they also graced the cheese steak. Our side of homemade coleslaw was one of the best versions in town. Can't wait to try the potato and pasta salads. \n\n     Other sandwices on the menu include roast beef, ham and cheese, meatball, sausage, and pastrami (not made in-house). Also available are two entrees: Lasagna ($10) and Spaghetti & Meatballs ($8). \n\n     Now for dessert. Ken wanted a cannoli, usually not something I like. I'm now a convert, at least to Casella's version. Denise makes the silky filling, garnished only with a few chocolate chips, and the large, wonderfully crispy shells don't get filled until you're ready to snarf one down. Homemade rice pudding is on the menu. We had a taste and it, too, was delicious, but it had no raisins. We'll bring those next time, along with the cranberry sauce.\n\n     Not much to say about the decor. I think it came from that long, long ago time. Basic wood paneling. There are photographs of years and years of Saguaro High (I think that's the school) graduating classes. That's about it.

If you do, don't go to Sweet Tomatoes.\n\nSince you are still reading this review, you are probably thinking \"it had better be a special salad bar\".  Well it is.  Sort of.  Here's what you are going to get:\n\nThe Salad Bar Itself: this contains a large variety of items but nothing outstanding.  There are a few prepared salads and some specialities like country potato salad.  The big plus here is that you get so many choices that you will be able to build just what you want, so long as what you want is not chicken or hearts of palm, etc., for which they charge extra.\n\nThe Soup Bar: this is the high point for Sweet Tomatoes.  You have eight choices, about half of which are vegetarian.  Chicken Noodle has huge pieces of white meat chicken, and there are usually at least a couple of soups that rate an A.\n\nPasta, Potatoes, Bread: the freshest items are the pastas, which they make in small batches.  There will be two or three, but unless you think that mediocre mac & cheese is worth dying for, these are not worth looking for.  The baked potatoes and sweet potatoes are ok but no more.  They have a few breads, incuding a couple of foccacios which are not bad (I will say no more).\n\nDesserts:  This is what you get -- soft serve ice cream in two flavors and a few desulatory toppings, a couple of dishes of cut fruit, jello, and a half-dozen types of standard muffins.  They also have one warm specialty dessert each day, such as a chocolate lava cake or a fruit cobbler.  This is usually a cut above average -- try it first.  \n\nSweet Tomatoes is a comfortable place to eat, albeit a bit crowded and noisy -- lots of kids.  It is clean, bright, and in good repair.  It is also busy, especially around 6-7 pm, but they handle it fairly well.  The conclusion -- if you are not put off by paying $10 plus drinks, and you are not primarily a carnivore, there is really nothing MAJOR wrong with Sweet Tomatoes.", "business_id": "RbWAL8KYgUp9pNSeLSjXtQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-02-03", "type": "review"}

This place is nondescript from the outside with no windows and once inside it is like a time-warp to the 70's.

I have definitely met some interesting people here and that is part of the allure of the TallyHo. \n\nI am familiar with 2 of the bartenders and they are nice ladies...maybe a bit rough around the edges, but I think you have to be at a place like this.  I was impressed they always seem to remember me though, as I have only been in a few times.  Their drink pours are no joke and they are very good at remembering your drink of choice.  Also I should note this is a cash bar so come prepared.  As Michael C. said the entertainment consists of a pool table and a jukebox.  There are also 2 smallish TVs and I myself just enjoy the 'atmosphere'.\n\nIf you have a friend in need of a drink ,or you need one yourself, or you just want to make yourself aware of the fact that your day wasn't that bad, well then come join the folks at the TallyHo Cocktail Lounge.", "business_id": "2BSF6wu1V3KfyFJf1DQ3DQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-12-12", "type": "review"}

Mackie's Parlour was at the top of the list.  I looked it up on Yelp and saw there was only one review, so I figured I'd go check it out for myself.  \n\nI couldn't believe that I'd never been in before based on their location alone.  They are located in the Hilton Shopping Plaza next door to Blue Wasabi 2 and near Cupcakes.  They have a cute little door (like a good parlour should) and they are dog friendly.  Minnie came too and was instantly wagging her tail when we walked in she smelled all of the scents of treats, dogs, people, toys, etc... so much to see and sniff!\n\nAs S W said in her review, this store really does have everything dog!  They have an excellent selection of dog collars and leashes; dog beds, coats, dresses, bowls, an even sunglasses/goggles.  Mackie's Parlour also carries homemade treats made locally and bullies (I think is what they called them) that are made in the USA (compared to other treats) and Minnie instantly went to sniff!  Of course, I was looking primarily at all of the dog goodies, but if you are a cat person, they have plenty for you too!\n\nAs Minnie and I shopped around, Vince and Tony (the owners) apologized because they said they were low on inventory as it's just after the holidays.  I thought they had plenty of inventory though!  They were extremely friendly and informed me that they've owned the boutique for 6 years now!  Minnie and I missed taking pictures with 'the real' Santa Claus by just a few weeks - damn!  I also learned that they've recently been voted the 'best pet boutique in the valley' by Phoenix Magazine for the 2nd year in a row.\n\nIf you are looking to pamper your pooch, this is a great place to do it!  Or, if you are looking for a gift for that dog or cat lover that has it all, go to Mackie's - I guarantee you'll find something unique and different!\n\nMinnie gives '5 wags.'

I've shopped here 1-3 times a week for the past 8 years & I'm not going back if I can avoid it. This is the closest & most convenient grocery store to my house. I went here the most in the past because of convenience, but never because they had the best selection.\n\nI was grabbing some quick dinner items on my way home & at checkout I was embarrassed that I forgot my wallet. Nobody was in line behind me, so I asked if I could I run out to my car to grab it. I didn't have my wallet, but luckily had my checkbook. My bill was only $44. I wrote a check, but she wouldn't let me use my check without ID. I've literally checked out with this same woman at least 50 times & she makes a comment on my last name every time as \"Doolittle\" isn't very common. I asked for a manager \"override\" & the manager (Dan N.) came over and said no. Ok, so a place I've been a regular at for 8 years won't let me use a check for a $44 bill. I took a breath because I was pretty embarrassed at this point, and asked her if there was anything else we could do.\n\nShe told me would put my groceries to the side while I ran home to grab my ID. So, reluctantly I did exactly that. I live 5 minutes away so I was back within 15 min. I came back with my wallet (ID, cash & cards), and asked them what they wanted me to do...pay up front or at same register. They all looked dumb founded because my groceries were gone. They started pointing fingers about somebody putting them away. I had to laugh at this point, but I started walking out. I was not treated as a loyal customer, the manager did not make an effort to help, and there was no apology at the end. As I was walking out I saw the same manager (Dan N.) and let him know my groceries weren't up there, I shop there multiple times a week, but I'm never going back again. He had not reaction, no apology, and did not try to do anything. It was like he was half asleep and had no reaction at all.\n\nI drove up the street to Albertsons right after and purchased the same groceries. With all the big data grocery stores have on us I wonder what it takes to acquire another frequent & loyal customer like myself. Additionally, they use all this personal shopping data they collect on us to market, but they don't treat a loyal customer with any kind of special service or consideration?

I apologized to her saying I wasn't trying to interrupt her activities but I needed some help finding a specific craft. She responded by ROLLING HER EYES at me and asking for the item description. At this point, I was just trying to get through my interaction with her so I could find the item but her body language and behavior were so hostile I had to stop and I asked her why she was being so rude to me. in response, she started listing how busy she was. I cut her off saying I would find someone else to help me since she was taken with other duties. \n\nI found a manager (I believe her name was Jen or Jenny) and relayed my difficulties with the previous associate.

But I was still extremely dissatisfied with the lack of skill when it came to addressing the previous associate's HORRIBLE customer service.

It's conveniently located in the Promenade shopping center tucked between a clothing and a beauty store. The inside is well stocked and pretty well organized. I still get lost sometimes, but I enjoy wandering around as well. My only real complaint is how long it usually takes to check out and pay. Usually there is only one, maybe two, cashiers helping customers. So the line to check out can be pretty long. Then, when you actually go to pay, I've had the credit card machine time out after 5 minutes of waiting for it to process. I just wound up paying in cash, since the cashier informed me this was a regular occurrence and would probably time out again. Thus, whenever shopping at Michael's I try to have cash on me. Overall, if you are working on a craft project or want to find some inexpensive gift wrap or trinkets, then Michael's is a great place to stop by.

She opened my hand and put a piece of paper in my hand saying that she wanted me to call her. I loked over her shoulder and noticed this poor sap at a nearby table kinda looking my way. I felt bad for him so I took the paper, said good bye to the lady and watched her as she walked back to him. My friend Rick came back and I said \" your never going to believe it but.....\"  Now the real kicker is that Rick is single and dying to meet a girl. The look oh his face was priceless! To make a long story short I gave him the phone number and told him to call. He proceeded to call her literally as we left the club. I was laughing so hard that I didnt notice him saving her number to his phone. Fast forward a few days to find out that he called this girl atleast 10 times in 2 days!

So we peaced out of there and I'm never going back. \n\nThe End", "business_id": "M0Pch3_-Gvj45RN1U4I35Q", "stars": 1, "date": "2009-02-12", "type": "review"}

Best decision I can say we've made thus far! Upon walking in we were both blown away by the size of the store. The lack of bright lights in the store and throughout the cases was a plus, you could tell you weren't in lighting that would over hype the sparkle of any of the diamonds. I loved the fact the diamonds were loose, and there were more settings than we could have imagined to choose from in order to create the perfect ring. I would like to personally thank Collin for all of his help and patience, because of him my fiance is above and beyond satisfied with her engagement ring. He went through every hoop he could to help us find the exact right diamond, cut, color, clarity, and setting to make her happy as could be. He stayed within the 4 C's we wanted. High color, cut, clarity, and a fair sized carat. We ended up with a smaller carat than I thought we'd leave with, but because it was an ideal cut which is extremely rare it gave the diamond a larger look with a shine I didn't think was possible. Even he was taken back by it. He also helped me extremely with their financing options. We didn't feel pressured from the second we walked in the door, to the moment we left.  Even the manager congratulated us followed with a handshake and eye contact. Thanks again Collin, you really made our experience something we won't soon forget. Even if you don't actually buy anything from Shane Co, at least make it an option.

No pressure or trying to up sell you for their commission!!!! IMO this makes them give superior customer service as they just want \"brownie points\" from customers for giving stellar customer service.

He's always raved about the customer service and I must say he was right. \n\nA weeknight in October we arrived to pick out a bridal set for me. The selection can't be beat. We were greeted by every employee we walked by. Finally we met Ariana who spent what seemed to be 2 hours with us helping me find the perfect engagement ring and band. Not one second did I feel rushed or pressured. I went in that night with an idea of what I wanted and by the end of the visit I decided upon something even more amazing thanks to Ariana's help. It's an absolute stunning set. After finding the rings, we started the process of finding the perfect diamond to compliment. She worked within our budget and carat size and found us the most beautiful colorless diamond I had ever seen. \n\nAll the while, as she milled about the store grabbing different rings/diamonds for me she didn't have to snatch back the rings I already had picked out to compare and put them back in the case. That was great. I wasn't treated like a criminal like other jewelery stores. I was free to wear and gaze at them as she, truly, waited on us hand and foot. Meanwhile other staff would stop by and offer us coffee or water, or lighthearted conversation. We truly felt very special here. \n\nTo top it off their protection plan and free resizing/service for life is very comforting. \n\nI had such a great experience I returned a few months later to sell some old (ahem) diamond rings and gold and had an equally perfect experience with Joe. They even allowed me to apply that cash towards the balance of my wedding set. \n\nI too can't imagine doing business with any other company ever again. I'm glad we didn't \"go to J****\".  ;) What a huge difference all around. Why bother with anyone else?\n\nThank you to everyone at Shane Co.

Service was amazing at first. I even came back for Christmas to purchase a set of cuff links for my now fianc\u00e9. However after a month of wearing my ring a diamond on the halo sunk in. Shane co took my ring for 3 days. I showed up at Shane co at the time they told me it would be ready. I sat waiting for 20 minutes. The girl behind the desk look like she couldn't find my ring. Not a good feeling. Then they finally found it and gave it to me. A week later a stone fell out of the band on the side. I took the ring in, they apologized and said it would be ready same day at 4:30. I showed up at 5;15 just to give them extra time. Once again it took them 35 minutes to get me my ring and out the door! Once home I noticed that where they fixed the stones they had placed new LARGER prongs! They didnt even match the others. The new prongs on the band are silver when they should be rose gold. I do intend on taking my ring in for its cleaning and inspection in a couple of months and I will then have them correct these issues. Btw I've only had this ring for less than a month with all these problems  Shane co please make the pick up and check out process more efficient also my ring should look as beautiful as the same day I bought it. It should have been contructed correctly in the first place and not with adding larger prongs here and there.", "business_id": "BUsmaloKEZeOvXLrSjKWSQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-02-01", "type": "review"}

We were visiting family for Thanksgiving and with a family of 5 it can be a challenge finding a decent inexpensive hotel that allows 5 in a room.  The suite was perfect with 2 queen beds and a pull out couch in the other room.  A full size refrigerator, sink, coffee maker, 2 burners, microwave and toaster were in the kitchen area.  They had a basket filled with coffee, hot chocolate, and microwave popcorn.  My kids were in heaven.  The lobby always had lemon water, coffee, tea, hot chocolate, and fruit.  On Thanksgiving when we came home from dinner there was also pumpkin and apple pie.  Often cookies or other treats were available in the lobby at no cost.  The breakfast is only lavish, not the standard cold cereal and waffle iron, but they had eggs, potatoes, meats, oatmeal, yogurts, fruits and tons of breads/pastries.  Not up to my standards of yumminess, but the kids loved it.  My husband had forgot his shaving cream, no problem they were happy to provide for him.

I found it to be very pleasant and the staff to be very friendly. The inn was very clean and looked like it was a fairly new building. As I first walked into my room, the very first thing I noticed was how wonderful the room smelled and how clean everything looked. The room I resided in had a television, microwave, small refrigerator, coffee pot with complimentary coffee along with typical condiments, a desk, and an individual HVAC unit attached to the wall. My room also included a bathroom with the usual clean towels, shampoo, conditioner, and soap. The facility also offers free Wifi with your last name and room number as your access code. My surroundings weren't loud so I slept well except for the fact that I went to bed late and had to get up for work the following morning. One other additional amenity I partook in was the complimentary breakfast; specifically, I opted for the breakfast on the go, which consisted of a brown bag with bottle of water, muffin, apple, fruit bar, and mints.\n\nThe location this Hampton Inn is situated in is pretty ideal as it is about a 7 or 8 mile drive away from the shopping, clubs, and fine dining of Downtown Scottsdale. \nThe shopping and fine dining is also just a hop, skip, and jump away within the immediate area. This is also an ideal spot for out-of-towners visiting to attend the Barrett-Jackson auction and Phoenix Open Golf Tournament that occur within the area in late January and early February.

I was extremely dissatisfied with the school's inflexible policies, the communication rendered by employees, and the effects enrollment there had on my child.\n\n1) Incompetent Care\nThe entire time my three year old attended, she had a rash on her rear, as they did not wipe her properly when she used the bathroom. Three year old's need assistance in getting cleaned up after they go potty - this is daycare 101. As soon as my child would come home, her rash would clear up - then return during the next week at school. I spoke to the employees at the school about this on several occasions and nothing was done to correct the problem.\n\n2) Forced Naps\nTwo hours out of the five my daughter attended Scottsdale Academy daily, the children were required to nap. No provision was made for children who don't nap (mine just happens to be one of those kids who don't). They are not even allowed to quietly read or draw - they are forced to lie there. Failing to provide an option for a quiet activity / assuming all children fit one mold is simply bad childcare.\n\n3) Inflexible Policies\nThis school requires that you pick up your child at a certain time, regardless of what time you drop them off. For every five minutes you are late, they charge you $5.00. They are completely inflexible about this regulation, even for moms who have other kids to pick up across town after school. Because of this rule, I was forced to pick up my little girl at 2 PM before the other after-school pick-ups I needed to make, thus reducing the amount of time she was spending at Scottsdale Academy. They would do nothing to modify their fees to compensate for this, and were completely unwilling to make adjustments based on actual hourly attendance. It's as if they do not want your business!

A slip of paper is provided at the end of the day telling parents that the child napped or did not, ate or did not, and what project was completed. No other information is shared - nothing about social interactions, milestones, problems, or other pertinent issues. When I arrived to pick up my child, everyone there acted as if they were too busy to stop and talk to me.", "business_id": "0HTnlz0k8vK4V1mXc9TPzg", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-01-06", "type": "review"}

I was craving some Chinese food and this place was close to where I work and had decent reviews on Yelp. The lady who was at the counter didn't really greet me, she just asked what I wanted. I was lagging looking over the menu and decided on the sesame chicken lunch combo. I received my meal and sat down to eat, as I opened my styrofoam container of food and looked over my meal, I was very taken aback. The sauce for the sesame chicken looked like someone had a bad cold, blown their nose and taken the abundance of snot and rolled the fried chicken pieces in it. It even had the consistency of snot. It looked nasty. I was brave though, I tried it, it didn't taste any better. It was a bland taste of who knows what. The only \"sesame\" that was in the sesame chicken was the sesame seeds that were all in the snot consistency sauce. I asked for white rice to accompany my meal, the rice was cold. The \"combo\" came with a wonton and an egg roll. As I bit into the egg roll, the texture of the egg roll was very soggy. The wonton was surprisingly hot, but had a very minute amount of meat in the middle, it also came with no sweet and sour sauce to dip, I guess that was extra. The whole meal set me back almost $8, that's way too much for lunch and I didn't even get a soda! I could have gone have lunch at Benihana for a dollar more. Next time I will.

Currently, the resort is in the porcess of upgrading all of the rooms, so if you book there, ask for an remodeled room.  I haven't seen the newly remodeled rooms, but based on the old style, the rooms are great.  The bigest complaint people seem to have about the rooms are the lack of a full kitchen.  But keep in mind, the Orange Tree was not built as timeshares, rather, it was a former hotel that went bankrupt. The old units had a \"college sized\" refridgerator, but the remodeled units will have a full sized refridgerator and flat creen LCD TV. The bathroom is the best part of the units, with a two person water jet tub and a walk-in shower and television.

The tee boxes, fairways and greens are all in various states of disrepair. Brown spots, diseased patches of grass and general neglect have produced a very unpleasant looking golf course at present.   A combination of factors may be to blame for this, including an unsucessful overseeding, the recent cold weather and rain, and the general quality of the maintenance. As other reviewers have noted, it's a pretty straight-forward, boring track with nary an elevation change.  It's not a hard course but the course does have a good design with bunkers guarding nearly every green.  The greens sloped from the back to front and can be quite tricky.

I can consistently expect them to bring out my fried rice far before my entree...yep, my rice is always cold by the time my entree arrives. There can be quite a wait at times, especially at the grills- I suggest looking on Open Table for a reservation. Overall, I prefer my local Japanese steakhouse in my home town (not chain affiliated) but this hasn't and probably won't stop me from coming back.", "business_id": "ishjLG3Sc94ZOelXZZhaIw", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-01-16", "type": "review"}

This is one of the few places that you can get that!   This is a guarantee if you reserve your spot at one of their many teppanyaki grills.

They have several tricks to keep your eyes dancing.  I won't give away the show...  OK so now that we have entertainment out of the way :).  The food... it's all pretty good and obviously fresh - \"right off the grill\".  I've had the chicken, the shrimp and several choices of the steaks.  You get soup, a small salad, a grilled shrimp sampler - then your entree with rice and vegetables.  Now to the shocker...  The Chateaubriand Steak - I had it for the first time recently and it will be my choice forever after...  It made the filet next to it look like its child!  After searing both the bottom and top of this amazing piece of meat the chef cut it into 2 pieces and cooked it to completion (medium rare).  OMG it was so tender with amazing flavor - I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it.  Truly one of the best pieces of meat I have ever had (and at the price that's saying a lot).  It's apparent why people often have celebrations/birthday gatherings here - because it makes it that much more memorable.  Always a good meal/experience at the grill.

The staff goes above and beyond the call of duty.\n\nThe first night we all shared a PuPu platter which was very good and why I'm giving it 2 stars.  You can't go wrong and the crab puffs are definitely the highlite.  However I got Warshu Chicken and the chicken was overcooked and too much sauce.  However had such a good time with my friends I returned the next night.\n\nWe again got the PuPu platter and it was awesome, this time I got Orange Beef.  The Beef was overcooked and there was not enough sauce.  But again we had a great time and watched 2 free live bands.\n\nThe prices are cheap for the area, and they serve the food in takeout containers even when u eat in.

The car wasn't driven much because the tires were bald and needed to be replaced.  But on November 13th, our other cars were being used so my son drove it the 5 miles to his work.  On his way there the back left wheel fell off the car!  Obviously, when the mechanic had put the wheels back on he either over or under-tightened the lugbolts.  The car was towed back to Sun Devil because the work done in October was still under warranty.  \"Steve\" at Sun Devil assured us the car would be thoroughly inspected to make sure no damages were done when the wheel fell off.  If they found any damages, they would repair them free-of-charge and would also pay for the tow charges.  On Nov 15th, we got a call to come get the car - everything was taken care of...they only needed to replace the lug bolts.  But, when we got it home, we could see through the wheel spokes that the brake shield was sheered in half!  Sun Devil hadn't replaced that and God-knows what else was wrong with the car we couldn't see.  So, we called our insurance company and they said to bring it in for an unbiased inspection of the car.  Turns out over $1,400 of damage was done to the car when it hit the ground.  Our agent called Sun Devil to see if they would cooperate and at least pay our deductible.  Sun Devil refused - saying that the wheel falling off was \"driver error!\"  So, we had to pay the $500 deductible to repair the car and now will have to go through the hassle to sue them in small claims court to get our $500 back.  We've checked with three independent mechanics who all agreed that Sun Devil is 100% at fault.  BE VERY WARY OF BRINGING YOUR CAR HERE!

When I called sun devil auto i spoke with a gentlemen craig & told him my situation & asked for a quote, He advised me to just bring in my vehicle so they could look at it before quoting me a price, so they could see what was going on. That made me feel like they really cared about my buisness and not just the money. When i dropped off my vehicle everyone was super nice and attentive, I informed craig that i had my vehicle in other shop a few days ago and told him of the repairs that the other shop did. A few days later craig called me & told me of his findings: my head gasket was bad, & my head cyclinder was cracked:( Then he also informed that my cooling housing was leaking, Which is very funny because thats what i had replaced at another shop(Firestone). I was in outrage that firestone put a leaking part in my vehicle. Craig was awesome and told me to come down to the shop so he could show me everything. My boyfriend & I went down to the shop and craig walked us over to my vehicle and phycially showed me where the housing was leaking, and the crack in my head cyclinder. He also explained to us in detail how things like this happen and really educated us on how the whole cooling housing effects the whole engine. Basically my car overheated so badly that it caused my head gasket to blow and my head cyclinder to crack. I asked him if i could take the cooling housing so i could bring it back to firestone for putting a bad part in my vehicle, he was totally understanding and allowed me to take the part. After all of that he told us a few ways we could go about fixing my vehicle, I was at the point were i just wanted it fixed as soon as possible because i work full time and have a 5 year old son. I told him do what you guys think is best & what will fix my vehicle! He had to order a newly used engine block and basically rebuild most of the engine.A few days later I was in middle of fileing a claim through firestone because of the damage done to my vehicle and asked craig to hold off on the repairs for a few days till i heard back from someone, He was very understanding!!!!! & had no problem what so ever. A couplde days after that i had not heard from anyone so i called craig and told him just to continue working on my vehicle. 4 days later craig called me just to give an update on how everything was going. I was still in middle of fighting with firestone to get someone to process my claim.  3 days went by and finally someone contacted me from firestone telling me they needed to send out an inspector to look at my vehicle. I immediately conatcted craig and explained what was going on and he was totally fine with someone coming out to look at my car while it was still being repaired. He gave me some really good advice about my current situation and really helped me get the ball rolling with firestone. Craig called me on on january 24 th to tell me the good news that my vehicle was finally fixed!!!!! & ready for me to pick up but he needed me to bring back the cooling housing. I go to pick up my car and asked him about the inspector from firestone and craig told me that they sent up a date for the inspector to come in while he was working so he could explain everything, I felt so relieved that he cared that much to make sure i was taken care of. I then found out that craig was/is the store manager! He told me he would contact me as soon as the inspector came down to look at my old engine block and cooling housing they put in my vehicle! Today is monday Jan 27th and craig called me to tell me that the inspector stopped by taking pictures and ect. I was so happy that he actually called me to keep me update. I told him how greatful i was for all of his help , he responded with no problem call me and let me know what the whole outcome is.  \n\n\n\nMy situation and craigs outstanding customer service is a wonderful expample of what CARE FOR THE CUSTOMER is really about! He went above and beyond to make sure that i was happy and kept me informed every step of the way. Their are not Many mechanics that are out there today that are this honest and caring. You would be a fool to go anywhere else. I will go to sun devil auto for every repair,oil change and etc.  BY FAR THE BEST SERVICE I HAVE EVER HAD AT AN AUTO SHOP!!!!!!!!!!!

I had never been to SDA before. When I arrived the man at the counter was nice and of course asked what kind of car I had etc.. At that time I mentioned that in the time since I made the appointment, the low air pressure light came on for one of my tires. That was the second  time in about 10 days so I was concerned that maybe I picked up a nail or had a slow leak. No problem he said they will take a look. I sat and waited in the waiting area. \nAbout 1 hour and 15 minutes later, a different guy came in and told me about a possible oil leak with the car and that they were almost done. I asked if they found a nail in the tire during the rotation. He didn't know what I was talking about, I again explained about the light. He went out into the garage and told the man working on the car. \nAbout 30 minutes later, the first guy apologized for the long wait time and told me that they do not typically carry the parts for my car, so it took longer than usual. Again, he was very nice. \n20 minutes later, I glanced up from my book to notice my car completed outside. I walked up to the counter to check out, looked at the receipt and again, no mention of the tire. Are they just not into tires? I don't know..I guess not. At this point I wanted to leave. I didn't want to get into the tire light story again. When I got into my car, the low tire pressure light was on again/still. Shocker. \nI really wanted to like this place, its close to my house and as I mentioned before, the employees are friendly. However, it seems crazy that they completely ignored my concerns about the tire. Now I am going to have to take more time and go somewhere else. Second, maybe when the appointment is made, it would be good to find out the make and model of the car so that the appropriate parts are available. Its a Volvo not a Lamborghini, the parts aren't super rare.

I wanted something less chain-y, commercial, and more homemade (without having to make 'em myself, of course).  Thanks to the magic of Yelp, I found the Chocolate Star Bakery, located within a reasonable distance from my office.\n\nThe place is in an unassuming shopping center, and I nearly drove right past it - it's a small storefront, one of those places that's 9/10ths kitchen and food-making area, which is almost always a good sign for a bakery.  A fellow from the back room came up and helped me almost immediately, offering good suggestions on which varieties to try.\n\nI wound up getting a dozen different cookies, and all of them were quite tasty on the same \"this is a darn good cookie\" level that makes picking a favorite nigh-impossible.  Even after some of them sat, uneaten and unloved in my refrigerator for close to two weeks, when I got to them, they still tasted fresh, with no staleness to speak of.  \n\nI just bought another dozen as a part of a belated holiday present for my parents, and have heard rave reviews from them as well.  This might not sound like much, but my dad is pretty much a \"pie or cake or nothin'\" kind of guy, and my mom usually avoids sweets that aren't straight-up chocolate.\n\nThe only warning I would give is that at $1.50 each, the price seems a little steep, given the size and the fact that these are, well, cookies.  So if you're on a budget and are looking for quantity over quality, this shop might not be right for you.

The manager told me she was busy, for me to call back after the holidays.  \nI took a PIE baking class right before Christmas.  The instructor was very nice but there were too many students in the class.  Six of us wanted to make the Banana Cream Pie.  They did not have enough workstations for us to each make our own so we divided the different steps with two making crust, two cutting bananas and two making the cream.  They did them in one batch for the crust and two for the filling. \nThe girls who did the crust forgot to put the eggs in and had to pull it out of the fridge where it was chilling to add the eggs.  ( this meant more mixing and kneading- not good)  The girls doing the filling divided into two batches (for 3 piies each) on the stove.  At some point they noticed some black flakes (Vanilla paste) in the pan and mistakenly thought the cream was burning and took it off the stove. It had not thickened)  Even the bananas that were cut should have been tossed in lemon juice to keep from turning brown and were not.  The instructions said to butter the pie tin. ( not a good idea)  When the crusts were taken out of the oven they had crawled down in the pans and looked awful. We poured the creme mixture in the crust on top of the layer of bananas and put it in the pan to chill.  The instructor said they should be fine after chilling thoroughly.  I brought mine home and put it in the fridge to chill.  When I took it out to show my daughter it was so sad it was funny.  I put my finger in the liquid and it sloshed around like water.. I poured it out and the crust that was in the pan was only worth throwing out.  \nI wrote an e-mail to Sweet Basil stating the above and a suggestion to have smaller classes where each person would be responsible for their own outcome.  I at least expected a reply.  I was not asking for a free class.  A discount offer would have been acceptable ( I had spent $60 on the class and bought two pie dishes for another $65. )\nNo Reply at all.  I decided to call a few days later and I asked for the manager.  The person answering said she was the manager, I told her I had taken a class and had sent an e-mail and had not received a reply.  She said \" I am busy, why don't you call back after the holidays\" and hung up.  WOW... That is the worst customer service I have ever heard of.  Another warning... I had previously been given a gift certificate that would cover two classes.  I took one class that was fine.  I called to set up the second class and told them I could not find my certificate.  She looked it up and told me it was ok, she had the record.  I signed up for the pie class.  A day or so later the lady called back and told me the certificate had expired so I gave her my credit card number for the class I wanted.

In spite of all this, our barely-existent waiter took our order after I had to send for him twice. He was not helpful at all in explaining any dishes, and could not make any recommendations when asked for suggestions. He was very bothered by the whole process and seemed more interested in talking to his manager between ever course. I continually had to keep asking for him to keep the dinier moving. When the check came, I caught two mistakes, he over-charged us for a bottle of wine I didn't order and added an appetizer that was supposed to be for someone elses bill.

But the review here looked great and we were staying across the street so we decided to give it a shot.  And I am REALLY glad we did.    Its got a good vibe to it - classy, but not stuck up, dim lighting so its kind of romantic, but spacious so you don't feel like you're right next to your fellow diners.    \n\nThe dungeness crab crepe was amazing.  Two little crepes in a lobster sauce, a perfect appetizer size so you don't feel stuffed after the first course.  Definitely leaves you wanting more.   \n\nThe purpose of this review is really to mention the Filet Mignon Sous Vide.  It was the most tender, flavorful mignon we have every had!  Granted I don't get filet very often, but for $30 something, I couldn't pass it up.  Our waitress kindly explained the Sous Vide cooking method.  The meat is slow cooked in a vacuum sealed bag, keeping all the juices soaked in the meat.  Delicious!   Must try it!\n\nWe also had a french onion soup as well as the pork tenderloin.

It was such a motley crue of Burberry wearing Benz drivers that it was quite an effort not to burst out laughing. Needless to say I asked for a table inside!\n\nGreeted by a surly host we were shown to a table for two which in classic Bistro style was on the small side but it wasn't a busy Thursday so we had plenty of space. ZB has done a good job with the recreation of French bistro decor but you had the feeling it was more American French than French French. As if they had been to Bourdain's Les Halles in New York and tried their best to recreate the look and feel of his authentic bistro. \n\nI ordered Moules Marieniere with stringier then usual shoestring fries (frankly they were so thin they were worthless). The mussels were tasty and the buttery white wine sauce has a nice kick to it and stood up well to bread dipping at the end of the meal. The mussels themselves were a little rubbery but if you order seafood in the desert I always think you have to be forgiving.\n\nMy fellow diner ordered a burger and the small taste I had was a delight, one of the best tasting burgers in some time and a nice lunch size, not huge so you wouldn't be weighed down for the rest of the day.\n\nThis was my second visit to ZB. Last time I ordered a really unimpressive Duck Confit sandwich and so I was hoping it would be a better experience all round this time, sadly not ... should a burger be the thing that impresses you most at a French bistro?\n\nThis joint is a classic example of having the look but not delivering the product. French bistro food should be fresh and simple but my second time here delivered just an 'OK' dining experience. Small things like the waitress pronouncing the 's' on Moules and the wine menu offering George DuBoeuf 'Morgan' when the wine is actually a 'Morgon'. If you are going to attempt French authenticity you should make sure the details are correct.\n\nThe final reason I won't be back was when I turned round and saw the same surly hostess taking her shoe off and rubbing her foot before putting it back on and handling menus.\n\nNon merci.", "business_id": "GIGI8bJfN6HyPzmEW-QqjA", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-02-20", "type": "review"}

Being a resident and citizen there for so long, I would like to think I can spot a decent French fare.  I have now been to Zinc three times, every time I ordered something different, so far the food has not dissapointed as much as the prices have.  Wow.\n\nOkay, okay, you have a spot in Scottdale, it's a nice little posh area with plenty of traffic, designer furniture and nick-nack and artsy stores that typically have things that would require your to take out a 2nd mortgage to afford those things that often just gather dust, one season at a time at home.  You would think someone on that strip would be the one to say, let's have reasonable prices.  Zinc is not one of those.\n\nThe restaurant has the name Bistro in it. They have folks dining out on the sidewalk, dining with noise and the occasional smell of BMW exausts...  That's beautiful and very Parisian, also very Bistro.  Here is a wake up call though... Bistros offer fares with decent prices, a prix fixe menu and simply good simple food.  \n\nThe prices were incredibly high for what you do get.  Unfortunately the charm of having an outdoor patio and serving fries in fake newspaper doesn't cut it.    The Steak Frites (a hanger steak w/ fries and a brandy sauce) is a French Bistro Classic, a staple if you will and that was the only thing that was fairly prices for what you get.  But if you knew how much those cuts are to get from a supplier, you'd be asking questions about the prices even then.\n\nOn two of those occasions we had cheese plates, it was more of a mix and match, you could pick from a few Chevres, Softs and hard cheeses,  they were incredibly small portions but the breads that came with the platter was very tasty, warm and fresh.  It is typically served with a ramkin of olives.\n\nSo overall, sounds like I am bashing this restaurant, I am not but I am dieing to find a reason to go back because there is something good about it, the atmosphere, the lighting, the seasonal menu.  But little things keep me from enjoying Zinc.  Such as the time we sat at the secluded back part of the restaurant, the small courtyard.  Very charming, though some of the waiters, and cooks smoked right outside of the courtyard's gates.  The smell of cheap cigarettes and mumbled chatter caused us to ask for another table, when we did, we were all the sudden looked as \"picky customers\".  \n\nOne more tip Zinc, you may want to get the mall janitor to move his trash can from the view of your utmost beatiful courtyard, such promise, undelivered due to tacky flaws that could have been prevented by an attentive manager or even a caring waite staff.\n\nDon't miss:  Dining in the courtyard, or the sidewalk.\nSkip: Specials that are simply trendy", "business_id": "GIGI8bJfN6HyPzmEW-QqjA", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-01-08", "type": "review"}

Very decadent. I had the onion soup - it's remarkable how when onion soup is not loaded with salt it actually tastes oniony! Followed it up with the duck confit. I preferred the sliced duck rather than the crispy duck, but both were delicious, and the risotta was out of this world. Do I want the souffle? Yes please! We had the chocolate with Grand Marnier sauce, and the kitchen pre-divided it before baking so we each had our own perfect portion.\n\nTwo small complaints:\n1. Despite having a reservation, our party was seated in the crappiest table in the house - the booth next to the kitchen door. We were promptly moved as soon as we requested it, but the worst table in the house should never be given to a (extremely polite) party with reservations. Save it for your rude, self-important, entitled Real Housewives of Maricopa County walk-ins.\n2. The butter for the bread was rock hard. That's one of my biggest restaurant pet peeves, and it irritates me even more when it happens at a restaurant of this calibre. I need full and equal butter distribution on my bread. One giant hard chunk in the middle, or a wad of bread shredded by trying to spread icy butter, is a total buzzkill.

Let me preface that I took Mom w/ me, and it was this meal's experience that I have learned never to take her to a place that ranks higher than a \"moderate\" in terms of costs.  It doesn't matter that she's not the one paying, and I refuse to let someone, not even my mother, dissuade me from enjoying a great meal!\n\nWe'd arrived 30 minutes before dinner service, and Mom was already hungry.  I tried stalling for about 15 minutes, looking over the off-hour menu for something for her to nibble on.  (We also found it difficult to flag down someone to help us during our stay here, even though it wasn't busy!)  I decided I'd get her the open-faced Zinc Burger, which was listed at $13.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zinc-bistro-scottsdale?select=MgpZeM3N2f8wi6EuEbjd3A#MgpZeM3N2f8wi6EuEbjd3A  The menu didn't list a side dish accompanying it, so I asked our server if there were any fries or salad that came w/ it.  No was the answer.  This angered my Mom, who did not wish for me to pay $13 for just a burger.  She only had the ambience (of which she thought wasn't great) and the arrogance of our server to go on; I knew of Chef Matt Carter's reputation, as well as Chef Beau MacMillan's endorsement of the best French onion soup (at Zinc Bistro) he's ever tasted on Food Network's episode of Best Thing I Ever Ate: Cheesy.  Those 25 minutes waiting for the burger to arrive were the longest 25 minutes I've ever experienced in my life, no exaggeration!  Thank God that when the burger finally did arrive, that it was a VERY tasty burger!  Of course, she wouldn't admit this to me.  No... I only learnt of her approval when our server had asked us later on if we were enjoying our food-- a very enthusiastic yes was her reply!\n\nMy restaurant week meal thus followed: \n\n1st course: Smoked Scottish salmon tartare- green apple, creme fraiche, and toasted brioche.  A truly lovely dish to gaze at, and even more wonderful to taste!  I loved the texture of the salmon- very creamy, and the cubed hard-boiled eggs added some fun mouth-feel!  This dish made me think I was eating salmon sushi w/o the rice!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zinc-bistro-scottsdale?select=z--Qcv88vRbjCa_KUDY7Hw#z--Qcv88vRbjCa_KUDY7Hw\n\n2nd course: Seared Ahi Tuna- preserved lemon creamy orzo, roasted beet, and fennel.  Another winner!  Great presentation-- seared ahi tuna chunks, w/ red centers atop wonderfully creamy orzo (Mom's first time trying orzo... she loved it!), with a beet reduction glazing the dish.  Really enjoyed the meaty tuna chunks, which tasted fresh-from-the-sea and not \"fishy\" at all.  Again, the orzo added great texture contrast to the meaty fish-- I enjoyed this dish so much, I had the leftovers for breakfast the next day! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zinc-bistro-scottsdale?select=SHDk_-fvZRXr4O82qOEKFg#SHDk_-fvZRXr4O82qOEKFg\n\n3rd course: Apple \"Tart Tatin\" Brown Butter Caramel, which really wasn't a tart tatin.  It wasn't even a pie, which was a bit disappointing.  It consisted of a cake that looked like angel cake but had the texture of a pound cake, apple-flavored, and quite dry.  Not even the brown butter caramel sauce nor the house-made ice cream could save it. :( [I was told it was either a cream cheese, sour cream, or buttermilk- based, but all I tasted was vanilla.]  My favorite components of this dessert were the three, caramelized and very thin-sliced pieces of apple.  We also enjoyed the French-pressed coffee, which also came w/ one piece of biscotti each, that I chose to accompany this \"tart tatin.\"  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zinc-bistro-scottsdale?select=M8rhOQyLbDHHNTSq7nF6gw#M8rhOQyLbDHHNTSq7nF6gw\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zinc-bistro-scottsdale?select=sXKSvx7P8pLPKLeZPdLHeQ#sXKSvx7P8pLPKLeZPdLHeQ\n\n4 stars overall for the food, and less than 3 stars for the arrogance and absenteeism of our server and for the ambience.  (We didn't like the flow of the rooms: the tables were too close to each other, and while there was a lovely mini-Eiffel Tower on display, on its base sat containers filled w/ artificial sweeteners- a bit tacky, I thought.)  \n\nI wouldn't mind ordering the Zinc burger again, but please add a side dish to it!  And lose the arrogant servers.  Unless, of course, they have sexy French accents to go along w/ their dispositions!

What stellar service!

But if this is just a fraction of what an actual french bistro is like, then sign me up for a trip.  My girlfriend and I enjoyed a very pleasurable Valentine's Day meal together at Zinc.\n\nWe actually went out on the night before Valentine's day because we have odd schedules and we wanted to avoid the crowds.  But as you can imagine, a highly regarded french restaurant was still fairly slammed.  The dining room was packed and it was very noisy.  I don't know if there is anything they could do about the acoustics, but it was awfully tough for me to hear our waitress at times.  It also is pretty dark inside.  Not quite as bad as a couple of Yelpers have complained about, but I could image why it may be too dark for some.\n\nThe french onion soup was a reputation for being superb.  I'll agree that it's excellent.  Not the best.  But you won't regret ordering it. I had the seared ahi, which was awesome.  Not only was the fish cooked perfectly, and the thinly shaved ham, crab, and potatoes compliment the tuna quite well, but the presentation of the dish was a work of art.  It was almost a shame to eat it.  My girlfriend tried the short ribs.  Zinc continues to prove my theory that there's no such thing as bad short ribs.  The bread that's served with the meal is also great.  It has that burnt bottom crust that just tells you it was made right.\n\nWhen we ordered our meals, the waitress advised us to give her a heads up early if we wanted the chocolate souffle (like any good souflle, it takes a half hour to bake).  Yes, please!  And we were sure glad we did.  Both of us were quite stuffed when it arrived, but that didn't stop us from devouring it.  It was light and sweet and the chocolate sauce was to die for.", "business_id": "GIGI8bJfN6HyPzmEW-QqjA", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-02-16", "type": "review"}

I saw this reviewed  on \"The Best Things I Ever Ate\" on the Food Channel, and since it is near where my mom lives in North Scottsdale, I decided to give it a try whence I next visited her from Cali.  \n\nThe soup is without question the best French Onion Soup I've ever had!  The stock had a deep, rich, developed flavor, and was topped with bubbly Gruyere cheese and chive garnish.  The cheese melts over the edge and down the side of the bowl, and scraping it off with the spoon at the end provides a bit of a fun treat - nice caramalized melted cheese snack!  So, based on this one thing, I'll rate it five stars.  It would have been nice to have had the bread served warm, but it's bread - yippee - not the make or break of a meal.  The soup was what this visit was all about, so no need to be overly picky.\n\nNow, having said that, the rest of the menu, while featuring some interesting selections, seems a bit overpriced.  Most of the restaurants in this area are a bit on the pricey side by about 20%, so I can't say that this is a surprise, but it's more than I'd like to spend, even for a quality meal.\n\nThe place is fairly noisy for what one might want for an intimate dinner for two, but it is a bistro after all.  The wait staff was very courteous, including the bus people, outgoing and friendly.  One of those in attendance entertained with a story from his past.  When learning I was in from California, he related how he used to play professional soccer and had lived in LA for a time.  \n\nNot having had anything but the soup, I might be tempted to rate Zinc Bistro at four stars, but I can't do that in all fairness.  I came expecting an excellent soup, and that's exactly what I got.  Give it a try!", "business_id": "GIGI8bJfN6HyPzmEW-QqjA", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-02-21", "type": "review"}

We went for my husband's birthday and had a wonderful evening. Absolutely no wait on a Friday night at 7 pm, which was a nice surprise, and even got seats in their beautiful hidden little courtyard. (Make sure you ask if there are tables available out there if you want a quieter, romantic evening as it can get rather loud inside when the place fills up) \n    For dinner my husband had the french onion soup to start,  which as always was the best you will find anywhere around, and the flat iron steak with zinc potatoes (their version of au gratin potatoes but with no cheese) He loved the steak, a perfect medium, and the potatoes were creamy and perfectly cooked. We do miss the cheese though!\n   I started with the tuna tartar, which is served with rye toast points and a cornichon paste, it was so good my husband, who refuses to eat raw fish, even tried a bite.... and liked it! Then I had the short ribs, which were melt in your mouth tender, as short ribs should be. My only issues was the amount of vegetables with the ribs... I think I literally had three slices each of carrots and celery... But they were delicious as well :)\n   We were then surprised with a little birthday treat for my husband which I will not ruin for anyone else who decides to celebrate their birthday here. I will just say that it was a perfect ending to a perfect meal.\n   Overall, I will have to say that Zinc Bistro is honestly one of my favorite restaurants in the Valley and I have never been disappointed in anything I have had there. Not to leave out that the service is always amazing and the staff is fun and friendly.

Both drinks were well prepared and strong.  The spinach/frisee salad was fresh with bacon dressing, a poached egg and lardons.  It was fresh but nothing to write home about.  The duck leg confit was ABYSMAL.  While my husband  was eating  I saw his unenthused expression, so decided to take a taste of it.  THE DUCK LEG HE WAS SERVED HAD TO HAVE BEEN SITTING AROUND THEIR REFRIGATOR FOR A WHILE PRIOR TO BEING SERVED.  I cannot believe that Zinc Bistro would serve such an unappetizing, unflavorful , dry \"meat\".   When we got home, I asked my husband why he didn't tell the waitress how bad his food was and his answer was that he didn't want to spoil my birthday dinner.  I would have been kicking and screaming before I would eat anything so vile.  My steak and frites were NOTHING LIKE I AM USED TO IN PARIS!!!   The steak was cooked medium rare,  au poivre but the meat had no flavor whatsoever.  It also had an excessive amount of peppercorns.  A person who sat across from us returned his steak because of this.  I have eaten steak au poivre many times both in the US and abroad.  This is definitely an excessive use of  peppercorns. None of the restaurants I have experienced do it this way.  Doesn't mean that Zinc Bistro can't be unique.  But, it must be unique and edible.  The frites  were a total disappointment.  They could NOT HAVE BEEN FROM FRESH POTATOES---NO WAY, NO HOW . No WAY, NO HOW... HOW MANY TIMES CAN I SAY THIS?  In Parisian bistros the frites or fries are to die for---simply sprinkled with salt and they are amazing.  Zinc Bistro's fries had this or that sprinkled on them but this did not improve the lack of flavor from the potato.  OMG,  what can I say about a restaurant that  charges more than a Parisian  bistro but none of its flavor.  \nOne saving grace was that they gave me a complementary mini-chocolate souflee as I was celebrating my birthday.  \nZinc Bistro management.... check that duck confit dish.... go into the kitchen right now and taste it.   Get ready to spit it out.  \nI am feeling super-uber guilty that my husband ate that vile dish and kept quiet about it so he wouldn't spoil my birthday dinner.  \nZinc Bistro,  how long can this quality of food continue before Scottsdale patrons realize that they are not eating anything like what is served in a Parisian Bistro.  \nI have to give Zinc Bistro one star--earned by Ashley and the complementary chocolate souffle.", "business_id": "GIGI8bJfN6HyPzmEW-QqjA", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-01-20", "type": "review"}

It was a 15 minute wait which wasn't horrible and then they called us up. We came up to the hostess stand and just stood there waiting for about 5 minutes. I finally asked the hostess why she would call us up if our table wasn't ready. The hostess supervisor overheard me and got involved....apparently what happened was the hostess seated another smaller party at the table set for our group. We watched the hostess go up to the newly seated group which had been seated for about 5 minutes, and KICK THEM OUT of the booth. I felt horrible for the other group. This started the slow and unimpressive meal  :/\n\nOur waiter was just kinda sloppy. He was REALLY SWEATY (like just ran a marathon sweaty and sweat rolling down his face and neck) and unorganized. He had no idea what was on the menu-for example, someone ordered Moroccan Chicken, he asked her if she wanted mashed potatoes with that or a salad but the dish didn't even come with those items, it came with couscous. He made the same mistake with my MIL's entree choice too.  He then tried to push the brunch options but brunch ended at 2pm so it wasn't even available. He didn't even know what time it was.\n\nThe menu itself was FILLED with advertisements for an assortment of crap, very off putting to me as I just want to pick my meal, not be subjected to page after page of crappy ads.  as It took 20 minutes for him to bring bread, 1 HOUR (yes HOUR) for appetizers, another 45 minutes for entrees. I asked him to bring water for our table for everyone, he brought ONE. When we finally got our entrees, they only came out partially. A member of our group was without his entree for a while and was stuck staring at everyone's food. In the 3 HOURS that it took to get everything we ordered, he refilled our drinks once. I ordered a turkey burger and was not impressed.....it needed more flavor, seasoning and the fries were unappetizing and tasted slightly freezer burnt. \n\nMy MIL insisted on dessert so we all got cheesecake (a variety). It took an additional 25 minutes for cheesecake, AS IF it takes 25 minutes to slice a darn cheesecake and plate it?? By the time we had ordered dessert, the place had cleared out for the most part and was NOT busy so there was NO excuse whatsoever for the length of time the service took.\n\nBy the end of our meal, we could NOT WAIT to leave. My MIL is very shy and gets embarrassed  easily so I didn't raise a fuss with management but this was my first time dining here and it was so unpleasant. I was hugely disappointed\n with the entire experience. \n\nSave your cash for a place with better food, better service, perhaps less sweaty servers.", "business_id": "ewZlgc22xN5NNQ1H7U6Y7g", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-02-18", "type": "review"}

My date and I both ordered the filet (I would think one of the most expensive meals on the menu). The steaks were delicious. The potatoes came \"garnished\" with onion rings. I was eating an onion ring and couldn't chew it. The \"onion\" was the skin of the onion. I had to pull it out of my mouth (in front of my date, on New Years eve)  I let our waiter know and showed him the skin. He just danced around it and barely acknowledged my complaint. He proceeded to take our leftovers and box them up, and brought back our check. I asked him if he could accommodate me at all. He said he would grab his manager KIM. A couple minutes later Kim came to our table and asked me how my steak was. I told her it was delicious and then proceeded to let her know what had happened. She said sorry and that she would let the cooks know, in a super condescending way. She said it was a \"garnish\" and was glad that everything else was ok and told me to have a Happy New Year. I was shocked that she didn't offer me even a desert or to accommodate me in any way. I had to make a little more fuss about it, embarrassing me again in front of my date. She then asked me if I wanted more onions rings. What??? Why would I want more of something that I just had a bad experience with and after I already had my leftovers boxed up. She finally says, I can give you the drinks (which totaled 8.50). Any time I have ever had an incident in a restaurant, I have always been fortunate to have someone actually care about a mistake. I completely understand mistakes happen, BUT, at least own up and take accountability when they do. KIM, the manager, did not want to own up at all. \nI definitely wouldn't recommend this particular location at the Kierland Commons, to anyone.

If you didn't know any better, it would seem as though a random stranger was grabbing drinks off the bar and taking them away. That is completely unprofessional.

Also, watched the manager thank her for helping, so I guess he had no problem with working an employee off the clock (without a proper uniform). \n\nWe had wanted to get some cheesecake to go, but we so displeased and ready to go by the end of the meal we decided against it.

I naturally gravitated towards the cat cages and saw that PetSmart was giving away free adoptions of cats a year or older!  Each cat would even go home with you with a free bag of cat food.  These cats were either spayed, or neutered, were free of FVR/FHV-1, and were microchipped.  (Well, the one I fell in love with was, anyway.  If only I could've brought her home that very day, but I wanted to make sure my housemate wouldn't mind.)  I asked if these cats had any behavioral problems and was told that NONE of them were damaged, but that these were pets who couldn't stay with the families anymore due to either a sickness, or onset of allergies of a family member, or a new addition to the household.  Some of these cats were \"package deals\" and couldn't be separated from the other companion.  These cats were being offered on free adoption in order to make room for the kitten population explosion that always comes around in the spring... (Or even as early as a week later from my first visit!  I went to visit the cat I fell in love with the very next week and she was already gone!  Boo!  It was very understandable, though, as she was absolutely delightful.  Aside from the two adult cats that grew up together, the other felines present were all kittens.)\n\nIf you ever walk in and fall in love with an animal but couldn't take it home with you that same day, you could fill out the necessary adoption paperwork and the store will gladly hold the pet for a couple of days, or so, while you prepare the home for the arrival of its new member.  Needless to say, the store would rather you return for the pet sooner, than later, so please be considerate.  I knew I really didn't stand a chance of persuading my housemate in letting me adopt the cat, but I was hoping I could spend a bit more time with the lovely feline before she was claimed by somebody else.

I was waiting for my fianc\u00e9 to pay for our items and wandered over to the grooming window. Having been a former groomer, I was curious to see what they were doing in there. I was appalled by what I saw! This happened on Sunday January the 4th at about 4pm. The groomers don't wear name tags so I could not identify her by name (but I will be reporting her to corporate so they can figure it out by the staff schedule and description I give them).\n\nThis particular groomer was grooming a medium sized dog using clippers in one hand and holding her cordless phone in the other and grooming with that one hand while talking. Then she put the phone down. After a few minutes I witnessed her checking her phone WHILE grooming the dog's leg. Meaning, she had the dog's leg up in the air, clippers were on and grooming while she looked away to see if someone was calling her phone. She was rough around tender parts of the leg, too. I was stunned.\n\nAnd she was NOT the receptionist. There was another person sitting at the desk in front of her. So whether this was a personal call or one for the business (which I highly doubt AND it wouldn't matter...she should not be looking away while grooming!!!), there was no need for her to divert her attention to her phone while she should be caring for this dog. If I was the owner, I would've been horrified at the lack of care! I thought of finding a manager but had no confidence in them as this was being done through glass for anyone to see. I'm sure this is standard behavior not yet corrected. The staff in there looked young and some looked like they were just goofing around, too. I've decided to take it up to a higher level with corporate. They are putting me a bit through the hoops to submit a formal complaint, but I am in the process of doing it because I think it's important. I would want someone to look out for my pets if roles were reversed.\n\nI will say that the staff in the store have been pretty helpful and we've gotten some good tips on our cat's healthcare.

I love how they have a private room where you can set up to write or read all day at your leisure. It's a very comfortable space, decorated to make you feel welcome. After coming here once I was so pleased that every chance I get, I stop by. They also have live music on the weekends. A great place to meet for just coffee or if you're hungry also for lunch and dinner!  In case you're wondering what's good, all items in the menu are delish!", "business_id": "I2_yeLfTzXHGwi8an0tL4w", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-12-04", "type": "review"}

Both were personable and professional, working with us to tweak our original drawings numerous times.  \n\nBoth artists were professional not only on the day of the tattoos, but from day one.  Right when we entered the shop, we were greeted and put at ease to discuss our designs.  The shop is VERY clean, both in appearance and in artist attention.  It was reassuring to watch Mark and Tami scrupulously clean their workspace in between each of our tattoos and I lost count of how many times they changed their gloves.  \n\nBoth artists answered questions throughout the process with tact and professionalism.  I felt totally at ease and will definitely be going back for a few more pieces.", "business_id": "nb7OvZFB1CoZCj-Yruuk-Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-01-10", "type": "review"}

The woman behind the counter ran out of the store yelling \"you need to come back in here RIGHT NOW!\".  Ummm... people are staring... I go back inside with her, and she gives me a kind of up-down look and says she has to see the inside of my purse.  I can't hold it open and let her see, she has to take it from me and paw through it on the counter.  Really?  You think I took something?  The outfit I am wearing (grown-up business clothes, by the way) is fitted and does not have pockets and the purse (not one of my usual suitcase-sized bags) is very small.  Where, exactly, did she think I was hiding merchandise?  Did I somehow fit a pair of stilettos in my bra?  WTF!?  Finding nothing, she proceeds to lecture me on the importance of removing the magnetic security tags from inside clothing since they set off her alarm.

Beautiful property with many amenities and a superb staff. \n\nCost to worth it rating: 3.5 (satisfied with their rates based on other resorts higher prices) \n\nEve award: one of top 5 hotels I've stayed at \n\nHighlights: \n- Full service resort: I've been to places with pools, a restaurant, and a spa, but this extends to so much more. Multiple restaurants and places to sip drinks, activity schedule, several pools, and expansive grounds. It reminded me of a cruise ship experience without the cheesy factor or being confined in. \n- Pool areas: a mellow adult pool with a lap area sectioned off, a fun large swirly/curved shaped pool, lazy river, and even a waterslide. Areas are surrounded by cabanas I'm sure are perfect sanctuaries on really blistering hot days. A bar with food (note can order off the room service menu) is just a few steps away to ensure your thirst and hunger needs don't go unsatisfied. \n- Drink areas: the rim itself has the bar area as well as the comfy chairs in the mid-section and expansive outside including an awesome fire pit. The xxx has a cozy western room theme specializing in whiskeys and bourbons. Deseo has a lounge specializing in muddled drinks like mojitos and often with a fabulous Cuban??? Artist creating colorful paintings right there. \n- Staff: impressed by how professional, friendly, and welcoming each person was during our stay \n- Arizona art: scattered all around the property are unique art pieces like the one in the center of the water by the golf course. In addition there and gorgeous palm trees and cactus planted throughout. \n- Location: just a few minutes from wherever we wanted to go (restaurants, downtown, etc.) and across the street from the lovely outdoor Kierland commons shops \n- Kid-friendly: activities and places they can go to have their own fun \n- Balcony: like that our standard room has this small space outside with a table and 2 chairs \n- Parking: valet is free til 11pm and have option to continue the no-charge by self-parking in the big lot in front overnight \n\nLowlights: \n- Resort fee: I'm all for what the place has to offer, but wish would just include in the rate vs charge extra since you don't have the option to deny it \n- Wireless charges: broadband is included but it's up to 24/day extra for wireless which bothered me \n\nOn my first visit for a weekend away, fell in love with this resort as well as Scottsdale. Definitely will be back--hopefully as part of my regular trip rotation.", "business_id": "SYqTY48DJa1cYhglvmgvsQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-01-18", "type": "review"}

This place is humongous an is pet friendly!  They've got a golf course, fully equipped gym, a luxurious spa, and two pools - one of which is designed like a lagoon that encircles around a large circumference. They provide inner tubes for you to float and relax lazily along the water, too! It is also walking distance to some great shopping and restaurants like mastro's and ra sushi. The lobby is luxurious and beautiful with plenty of comfy couches and chairs to relax on.  The rooms are of decent size, always nice and clean.  We also had access to the club room where they provide complimentary breakfast and snacks/beverages throughout the day. One of the things I most appreciated about this place is that they offer complimentary filtered water and free usage of their stainless steel water bottles (very environmentally friendly). Like any other hotel they also have overpriced plastic bottles of water for those who have different preferences as well.  Their \"heavenly\" beds and shower heads are truly quite heavenly. They also gave us vouchers for a free gift bag which was a nice surprise. I love anything free!

The staff was friendly, welcoming, and my room was amazing.\n \nI was surprised by getting a nice and comfortable room on a higher floor and the view from the balcony was breathtaking. I stood on it every evening and morning. Bring a camera! The beds were even better...the pillows, heavenly and super soft. I slept better in that bed than I have in my comfy one at home. I was later pleased to hear that they sell them on their website. Smart. I had to get up early to work at a conference hosted in the resort that week, but if I could have stayed in bed longer, I wouldn't have stopped hugging the feathers out of these amazing pillows. \n\nMy favorite things about the resort (besides the awesome beds) were the saloon and the Deseo restaurant. May have been one of the best dining spots I have been in a while. With phenomenal wines on the menu, dishes filled with a melange of delicious flavors and fresh ingredients, and their bread is some of the best I've ever had. I would highly recommend going on a nice dinner date here or out on a business dinner. You won't be disappointed! The saloon below the lobby is also a great spot to grab some drinks and enjoy some bourbon or scotch. \n\nIf you are a golf enthusiast, they have a large golf course on site. By far, I will say that the fire pit outside is THE best amenity of this resort. With comfy large couches surrounding the fire put, drink service available, blankets there to keep you warm, this is the perfect spot to lay back and relax with friends in the evening. Everyone should have a fire pit. At 5pm every day for an hour, the hotel has a very talented Scottish bagpiper who wanders around the fire pit and golf course, entertaining those outside with some great music. \n\nI would love to stay here again sometime!

Scottsdale AZ is all about these resorts/spas and attached golf courses, but the Westin Kierland is one of the best from the rest that we've stayed at so far.\n\nThe hotel is located right off of Scottsdale road, and behind and next to Kierland commons (an outdoor shopping complex with plenty of choices for restaurants and shops) The shopping plaza is literally a 2 minute walk across street from the hotel. There are also plenty of shopping complexes along Scottsdale Road.\n\nThe property itself is massive, and yet manageable, there is a huge parking lot with plenty of parking spaces (Hertz rent-a-car not only has spaces to pick-up and leave your car there but a Hertz desk in the check-in area) They also have valet but we didn't use their services, and parking is free. When you walk up to the front of the property you are greeted (if the time of the season is right) with the sweet, loving scent of jasmine (they have jasmine plants all along the walk paths that lead you up to the hotel (a sweet, plus in my book). When you walk in you the first thing you notice is what is behind the hotel and that is an outdoors gathering and commons area, where you can sit and chat, or have a meal and look onto the golf course or light a fire at night.\n\nThe hotel is broken into two wings a west and east wing, in the east wing is the concierge desk (who have a small gift waiting for you as hotel guests) they can also print out your boarding pass', and you can also get a list of places in kierland commons (the shopping area) and if you show your Westin Key-card you get discounts and special promotions etc. and beyond that is the spa, and gift shop, and the grand ballroom. To the west wing is the check-in desk (because of the time of my arrival my check-in was a bit lengthy but I understand) beyond the check-in area are the elevators, the restaurant (deseo), the office of \"fun\", and to the pool area.\nThe property also has what they call the \"casita\" village a complex that can be reached by golf course or short walk passed the pool areas. The casita village were more guest rooms but in a secluded complex.\n\nThe room was a typical Westin room clean, spacious, filled with their \"heavenly\" products like soaps, shampoos and conditioners. The beds are the most \"heavenly\" of them all maybe except for the typical bath-tub (another major plus in my book) and the dual shower heads. But the beds were large and comfortable with plenty of pillows and their \"heavenly\" comforter, it's like sleeping on and in a cloud (pure bliss).\n\nThe pool area is large there are two pool areas and they are all somewhat gated. The adult pool area is small and quiet with a large pool and has a swim lane for those who want to swim laps. The much larger, more raucous kids pool is where most people hung out with plenty of cabanas, and food and beverage people taking orders. There is a large pool, and then there is a large lazy river with inner tubes to float down in relaxing comfort (a huge plus). Beyond the pools are recreation areas with table football, an RC car racetrack, two table tennis courts, and an over-sized chess board. There is also a basketball hoop with basketballs and two tennis courts (where you can either reserve tennis lessons or reserve the courts to play).\n\nBack to the \"fun\" office this is where this resort gets another star because it is great for families, with young children because there are a ton of events put on by the staff for not only the adults but for kids as well. For example we saw a schedule in the \"fun\" office that offered a kids pajama party, arts and crafts, and a kids only talent show (now they came at a fee but to have these events for kids was very welcoming) They also had supervised field trips to the zoo, snorkeling lessons, and plenty of poolside events that were kids only which again made the hotel less \"stuffy\" and \"adults only\" type of resort but for everybody.\n\nThis Westin is on par, and in some instances a cut above some of the other Westin properties it maybe a pricey but let's not forget Scottsdale AZ is a resort town and you are going to pay some \"resort town\" prices, but for all negatives the positives far outweigh them, and this property is \"heavenly\" experience.", "business_id": "SYqTY48DJa1cYhglvmgvsQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-02-18", "type": "review"}

Both times were extremely delightful.  Our stay at the timeshare was for an entire week.  We had a very nice 1 bedroom unit which easily sleeps 4 with the convertible sofa bed in the living room.  The unit was somewhat small but very comfortable with a full kitchen.  We used the BBQ grill and enjoyed a wonderful steak dinner outdoor very near our unit.  As a guest at the timeshare units, we had full access to the entire hotel/resort property.  To say we had a blast is an understatement of decent proportions!  There are numerous activities and events happening throughout the day.  The pools, water slides and lazy river are wonderfully fun and were not too crowded.  They have a wonderful kiddie pool for the pre-swimmers. Everything at this resort is top drawer.  There are lots of activities including a remote control car racetrack so kids, bring your cars.  They also have a couple of top notch ping pong tables and an giant outdoor chess board. The restaurants are pricey but if you're on vacation at a property like this one, you have to expect that.  We had our grandson, daughter and two teen boys all of whom had a fabulous time.  We watched movies from the pool and spent much of our time there during the day even ordering lunch and drinks throughout the day.  They offer a free shuttle to all the restaurants across the street at Kierland Commons which is great because one does not have to worry about finding parking or driving after enjoying a couple of cocktails.  We all thought this resort is as close to Disneyworld as you can come in Arizona. Most of the resort staff is extremely friendly and helpful. Everything is clean, well maintained and easy on the eyes.   We hope to return soon as it's already been a year since our last visit.

I have had several massages a year over my lifetime and was very surprised at the poor quality massage I received at the Westin Kierland.  I saw many patrons walking out of their service with that \"ahhh\" look on their faces.  I did not have that.  I specifically asked her during the massage if my muscles felt tight and she said actually no.  Which surprised me greatly as my neck and back are usually a ball of stress.  I did tell her as we walked in that I would prefer that she spend more time on my back and neck and not my arms and legs but this did not happen.  I was very surprised when she has me turn over onto my back so quickly especially after I asked for the concentration on my back.  She did lift up my arms a few times and do some digging into my shoulders, but it was no where near what I would consider a deep tissue by any means.  The time that was spent on my neck was minimal and felt more like a quick back run than anything.  My time spent in the sauna, steam room, and pool was actually more enjoyable and relaxing than my massage.  I actually asked my friend how she felt about her massage and she had very similar comments to mine, although my massage did seem to be more in depth then hers.  We questioned whether the reason of our sub-par massage was due to the fact that we used travelzoo vouchers - although we did tip on the full amount.  Also during the massage I was told there would be an add on foot session.  I'm not sure what it was supposed to include, but I received no more than a 2 min scrub and 30 seconds of rubbing in lotion.  Over all, this was not an experience that I would expect at a location such as at the Westin, but more of a lesser quality massage parlor.  \n\nI left a voicemail and 2 emails for Carol Ford who is the spa manager and she has not returned the call or emails.  This just adds onto the poor customer service that I received while visiting the spa.  As a local patron, this is a place that I would have given a second chance - but now after horrible Manager customer service on top of it - I will not return.  And I will let all of my friends know as well.\n\nFOLLOW UP:  I was contacted by someone they asked me to come back and try it again.  I will post another review following that service", "business_id": "SYqTY48DJa1cYhglvmgvsQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-02-27", "type": "review"}

There is a golf course, tennis court, swimming pool, hot tub, fitness center, shuttle to the small shopping center, gift shop,  bar and during the summer this have this complex water park open during the day only. This resort made my stay wonderful.  Nice views of the golf course which I find odd, but sure. Everyone was attentive towards requests.  I wanted to see how long the walk would be to Scottsdale quarter and they offered to call up the shuttle driver to take me there.  It was a nice drive through the lanes,  as it would have taken me ten minutes to walk there.  I did walk be to the hotel in ten minutes, so the attractions aren't far from the resort.   One setback is depending on where your room is relative to the lobby you might be giving yourself a self guided tour of the resort.  It spans a huge area.  \n\nI was there during December so I got to see the 3D holiday paint scaping lightshow during dinner. Very clever and unexpecting for a place like this.  For those who were staying in the rooms where the lights were going to shine through, they got a friendly door knock to close their blinds for the show :) It created a nice christmas touch to the season.", "business_id": "SYqTY48DJa1cYhglvmgvsQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-12-29", "type": "review"}

I am just disappointed with the department that handles the hotels vacay packages (ex honeymoon package, babymoon, ect). My husband and I flew here from Dana Point, Ca because I read in Fit Pregnancy Magazine that the Westin Kierland has one of the best babymoon getaway packages but come to find out once we got here nobody who worked at the resort had any idea about the package. \nWe expected someone to acknowledge we purchased this package, but that didn't happen so we kept having to call and say, I think we're suppose to get a massage, sparking cider, gift set , ect, ect. we just felt we came all the way here just for a regular trip, nothing special about it. It just would have been nice if at check-in they established we had the babymoon package and guided us threw what, when, and where we would be able to take advantage of the all that was included in the package . It was a very impersonal and unorganized package and we just didn't expect that from a Starwood resort so the babymoon was sadly a let down. \nOn a more positive note Patrick at concierge was AWESOME. He helped sign us up for the timeshare presentation and just took an extra step to take care of us one night. Oh and Robyn was great!, she was massage therapist and gives an amazing prenatal massage. Also my husband mentioned many times the lobby bar staff was great too:)  If it weren't for these people I have to say I would give this place one star...sorry:/.", "business_id": "SYqTY48DJa1cYhglvmgvsQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-01-02", "type": "review"}

Not all are rude, but it seems like either they don't enjoy working there or they don't care about customer service. \n\nBefore Thanksgiving, we visited the store during a big furniture sale and unfortunately had to get a rain check for three items. We were pleasantly surprised as the person helping us was very helpful and informative about how we would get a call when they were in stock and also the dates that they would most likely have them. She checked the distribution center for us and everything. We were very happy that day and thought maybe the store had finally hired some service friendly staff. And, we were also excited because although we wouldn't have them for Thanksgiving, we would have them for Christmas. She said the estimated time frame and gave the specific date of the 21st, as that is the latest date a new shipment would be coming in from the distribution warehouse.\n\nWe we were having a very large party at our house on December 20th and would have loved to have the tables there. So on the 18th, we called and asked for them to check to see if the items were in stock. My husband politely asked them to check to see if they had any in stock. He was then rudely told by a guy that if they are in stock, they will call us. He wouldn't even check to see if they were coming soon or if they happened to have arrived and hadn't called yet. He then went on and on to a point that felt condescending. No friendliness or helpful response was given during the entire call - with either the warehouse or the person who first took the call.\n\nSo the 21st came and went, and obviously so did our party. Then yesterday, the 26th, we went back into the store. After waiting around for 15 minutes to get someone to help us, we couldn't even finish our sentence asking about the items before the guy started the whole spiel, \"they'll call you when we have it...\". So I politely told him it had been five weeks and I know that the distribution center should have had them on the 21st..blah blah...Sir, please, can you just go back and check? His eyes rolled and he agreed.\n\nFinally, about 10 minutes later, the same guy comes back out to the front, \"Uh yea, we have your items. They call you on the 17th.\" They didn't call - trust me, I would have loved for them to call! I would have picked them up the same day! Then they would have been there for our party. \n\nI was frustrated. We told the guy that we never received a call and then he BLAMES us for not getting the call, saying that the guys there call people immediately when items come in from the warehouse.  We didn't get an apology or anything from him or the cashier lady. Later on, he says, it was probably a new guy who, \"didn't know how to us the phone...\" They both continued to act like it was our fault that we didn't come get our items earlier. In fact, the guy had the nerve to say, \"Luckily we still have them for you...\" as if they should have sold them to someone else because they didn't call us. Worst customer service ever. \n\nAlso, don't expect help loading your items. They'll watch you struggle and do nothing. I understand they can't be responsible for your items, but at least last time, my husband had help lifting the heavy items into our truck. \n\nThe only reason they get 2 stars is because I do like their products and unique food. If you only are buying small items, or a bottle of wine, you should be fine. But if you need something big, important, have a deadline, or otherwise are short on time, look elsewhere. Looking back, I would have paid more for a better item somewhere else.", "business_id": "0Gu2cpJ5x9ZZfDDHohBY_A", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-12-27", "type": "review"}

Researched online for about a month and found the wheels/tire combo I wanted. I talked to one my friends who used to discount tire and was told to ask for the manager to get a discount and fair treatment. Mind you, this is a completely different discount tire who I won't put on here.\n\nI called and talked to the manager. I wanted supersport tires from Michelin which are high performance tires that I can take to the track. These tires are special order only and are hard to find for the size I was looking for. He told me that he would call me back after he talked to Michelin to get the tire. I got a voicemail saying that he had news for me and to call back. I called him back the next day and unfortunately got another person who said he would help me since he is on the phone with another customer. Told me that those tires might take a while and was pushing different tires toward me. Explained I really wanted the supersports as I had done a lot of research on the tires and would have to think about the ones he was pushing me toward. I asked him as well how long it would take  for the supersports and he told me it would be backorder and I would need to wait anywhere from 3-6 months.\n\nAfter I got off the phone, I was feeling really deflated and did some research on the tires he was pushing but didn't feel good about it. Thought about it bit more and decided to call another discount tire to get a second opinion. Luckily for me I got in contact with Juan. He said he would call around for me and see what he could find. That same day he called me back, I wasn't able to answer since I was at work but he told me that only 3 discount tires in the nation had them. But he said he would call me the next day and would let me know what he found. Next day he told me they were super had to get but he was able to find them. When I came in Juan was super helpful and even without a appointment got me out in under a hour. Not only that but he kept checking over everything to just ensure that everything is done properly. Ironically the other discount tire called me 2 days after I talked to Juan to tell me he got the tires miraculously somehow which was upsetting and confirmed my suspicion. \n\nHe was as stoaked as I was about the cars new look and told me I made a good choice which was cool. After I had left I realized I was missing my stock tire and that I needed to go back. On my way back, I managed to crash my Z into a curb and shatter the rim, and ruin the tire. I called Juan and he had it in the next day for me.\n\nI am now back up and running and couldn't be happier with the tires and my car. I am so grateful to Juan for all that he did and a bit bummed that the other discount tire tried to play me, as I went through a friend's manager who he used to work there for.\n\nThanks again Juan!

There isn't another course in the marketplace that does as many things as perfectly.  It's not inexpensive, but I can't think of a better example of getting what you pay for.  From the initial reservation, to the time they place your bag in your car, you will be exceedingly impressed.  Every single employee we encountered was helpful, and smiling (and a sincere smile, not a forced smile typical of someone who had been TOLD that it was part of their job).  When you arrive, and when you pull in to the bag drop, they greet you and smile and direct you to the club house.  When you enter the club house they greet you with a smile and make eye contact and thank you for being there.  They direct you to the driving range where your clubs are on a cart with your name on it (just like when you play a tournament...and we weren't).  The range is perfectly manicured, it's got a chipping green, putting greens, a well marked range, etc.  When it's time for your tee time, they don't call your name on a loud speaker, a smiling employee comes over to you at the range and lets you know that it's time to tee off, and doesn't leave it at that...they then jump on a cart and have you follow them to the first tee.  On the way they stop at the halfway house to see if you need any food or drink for the round ahead.\n\nThat's all BEFORE you even tee off.  And when you step up to the first tee box, you will quickly see that this is going to be epic!  The course is perfect from tee to green.  It's challenging, but not impossible.  I had to keep touching myself to see if this was real.  You will play better because you're relaxed (and because the fairways and even the rough are in amazing condition).\n\nWhen you're on the 18th green, some guy sneaks over and cleans your clubs.  When you're done, someone says thank you.  \n\nI'm not paid to write this review (in fact, you'll see I've only written 5 or 6 over the years), but I write them when something is this good or exceptionally disappointing...it's this good.  The Phoenician and a handful of other courses are really pretty and have great views, and some have very good service...this is all of those things and done perfectly.\n\nSo, all that positivity and my only real criticism is that their website is clearly not where they invested their marketing dollars.  It does it no justice and makes you wonder if this place is really that big a deal.  Don't let it fool you...", "business_id": "QaKtwJTSoIgQE1Yg3qiEXA", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-12-09", "type": "review"}

It is on the expensive side to play at so my expectations were high. The course itself is in great shape! The driving range is in ok shape.

I feel I should consider t the complete experience so that is why I am only giving it 3 stars. \n\nThe staff seemed preoccupied when we arrived. I believe they were trying to track down missing flags. This was my first visit there so the staff said they would show us where the practice areas, bathrooms, etc.. were but after we finished paying they pretty much ignored us. There were 3 people in our group and we were looking forward to a fun day out together. Surprisingly, they paired a single with us. It was a bit awkward. I understand if they were extremely busy and had to put someone with our group but they were not packed. I am sure the guy that joined our group was probably not thrilled to be paired with 3 ladies either. I have played at courses all around the country and in my experience, especially at the nicer courses, they do not add a single with a threesome. Maybe I have just been lucky:) \n\nAfter the round, we were not allowed to drive our carts and bags to the car. They had to bring them up for us. That is usually a really nice service. In this case, we were frustrated because my friend had a nice driver cover go missing. It was in the back of the cart and should have been put on the driver. Instead it was lost and the staff did not seem to care. \n\nI am not sure if I will golf here again.

What a let down, even though we got a good laugh out of the Ferrari parked out front (how many plates of pasta sold?!)\n\nI grew up in with a Sicilian family and spent years on the East Coast, eating literally hundreds of meals in restaurants all throughout New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey.  My opinion is that I have tasted authentic American-Italian food from the gamut of my grandfather's bolognese sauce (to die for) to off the Jersey turnpike dive Italian joints (to die from).  I appreciate a good dive joint with homey Italo-US grub.  This ain't it.\n\n+ 1 Star - Decor.  I love the kitchy (ok, downright tacky) walls painted with the Italo-city flair.  It's just the perfect hideous companion to the checkered table clothes and low grade china/glasses.  It works for me.\n+ 1 Star - Waiters.  I love grumpy Italian waiters! Their presence usually means that there will be some good food coming.\n- 1 Star - Bread.  What is with the hideous squishy white rolls?  At least they were warm and came with some pesto dipping sauce.  But they were more like sandwich rolls and less like dinner bread.\n- 1 Star - Pasta.  Why is the pasta cooked to paste?  Is it because we were the only diners in the place without gray hair, maybe they can't chew the al dente anymore?  Squishy noodles that became paste in my man's dish, and blubbery tubes that couldn't be forked (I had to spoon them!) in mine.\n- 1 Star - Sauce.  I had vodka sauce.  He had al fredo with mushrooms.  Not a good comment when he says: \"It tastes like beef stroganoff without the beef\".  My vodka sauce was not bad, but nothing I would think about twice.\n- 1 Star - Grated Cheese.  Not fresh grated.  Likely bought in bulk - was actually \"sprinkled\" over my food (by request) with large sticky-glumps of it bouncing off the edges of my plate.  Had zero flavor - just a mild saltiness.  Obviously cheap quality.\n- 1 Star - Bus person.  Hey lady!  Why would you come and ask my date if he wants a box for his pasta leftovers (ugh! no thanks!) while I am still SPOONING food into my gullet?  There are plenty of other empty tables, so why rush us?  Oh, and you don't have to come by twice and ask it.  Get us some more grainy Phoenix tap water, why dontcha?\n- 1 Star - Price.  It felt overpriced to me to pay $15 for his plate of mediocre pasta with no protein (chicken, salmon, meat).  And just about that for mine.  Add one beer (I had water) and we are hovering around $40 with tax/tip.  Silly.\n\nI really would like to give these guys below a 2 but they weren't quite nasty enough to rate a 1.  I don't know what all these people who are rating this place 4 and even 5 stars are thinking.  Maybe they are comparing it to Olive Garden (I mentioned that place to my man and he said he thought the OG food was better than here!) or Macaroni Grill? This is a place for people who have mediocre taste buds and little experience with innovative dining.  \nFor me, I won't bother coming again and neither should you.", "business_id": "fmWyI5ec05F8PJpx3eNpLg", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-12-11", "type": "review"}

I was with two others and the salads were not good - the Caesar dressing tasted store-bought (and not a good store either).  I had the beef carpaccio and have to say it was the worst I have ever had - very tough around the edges and flavorless in the center of the beef.  They were very nice about exchanging it for a salad and didn't charge me for the dish.  I then had the eggplant appetizer and it was basically very thinly sliced eggplant with a mound of mozarella and some decent tomato sauce.  So, it actually tasted fine, but could have been better.  In addition, the prices were ridiculous for what you got.  If it was homemade pasta, I would understand.  But it clearly wasn't.  I'll keep looking for that great Italian restaurant that's not a chain, but stick with Maggiano's until I find it...", "business_id": "fmWyI5ec05F8PJpx3eNpLg", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-01-11", "type": "review"}

One person brings the bread, another takes your order, and another fills up waters.  You may not see your actual server very often, but that allows you to focus on the food.\n\nThe food, for the most part, is great.  I love the Chicken with Mushrooms.  Portions aren't too big, especially considering what you pay, but you likely won't be disappointed.  Just keep in mind the Calamari isn't fried, so if that's what you're expecting, steer clear.\n\nOne time we went, the hostess was fairly rude to my wife.

It's a cozy little place - maybe less than 30 tables. We dined on a Tuesday night, and although there were only a handful of patrons in the place, it filled up fast and by the time we left, there were only a couple of tables left! On a Tuesday!! Go figure.\n\nThe meal began with a nice, warm, fresh bread roll. OMG - so heavenly! Not sure what the herb was in the bread, but whatever it was, it gave just the right hint of flavor. The Veal Madeira was very tender , cooked perfectly, and the sauce flavorful. And the pesto dipping sauce was excellent. One of the evening specials was the other choice - lamb chops with risotto.  Six chops! They were cooked to perfection and delicious.  I'm not a big risotto fan so hesitate to weigh in on it. It was cheesy and I'm not sure it would pass the Gordon Ramsey test, but tasted fine.\n\nOur server was attentive; she checked in on us a couple of times to make sure everything was OK. The atmosphere is nice - faux painting deck the walls that give an old-world kind of charm. The lights were a bit bright - they could tone them down a bit to create a nicer atmosphere (maybe they do on weekends??). \nAs we were waiting for the check, the bus boy came by to ask us if we wanted boxes. Too funny as there were only 2 noodles left from the veal dish!! \n\nVery good food and friendly staff; prompt service. Definitely will patronize this restaurant again.", "business_id": "fmWyI5ec05F8PJpx3eNpLg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-12-06", "type": "review"}

The restaurant is relatively small with about twenty five to thirty five tables.  The clientele on a Sunday night is largely graying snowbirds with the exceptional family with kids. The restaurant feels more akin to Northern California than Scottsdale, Arizona - that is a complement! \n\nThe meal began with ice water and fresh bread with pesto.  A great combination.  My son ordered the Caesar salad and minestrone soup and left nothing behind.  I had ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo con Funghi which was simply outstanding.  As a matter of fact, my wife and son ate most of my meal.  If you have the opportunity to visit this restaurant try this meal - you cannot go wrong.\n\nMy wife ordered the Rondelle 4 Formaggi which is rolled pasta, tomato sauce and rolled pasta which is pan fried.  It appears to be a light weight meal, but is truly filling.  \n\nI would say the food is a five star, the service is somewhat lackluster.  Water refills were not timely, the salad took a while to make to the table and the service is so so.\n\nWorth trying........", "business_id": "fmWyI5ec05F8PJpx3eNpLg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-12-12", "type": "review"}

No one received a table visit, apology or acknowledgment despite the owners chatting at the front for 20 minutes after the rush passed.

The boneless wings were pretty good in their own right but didn't really make us think of wings.  They were more like chicken nuggets albeit a class above fast food.  I personally didn't like the flavor of the steak in my quesadilla but I did like the cheese and the crispiness of the tortilla.  I would order a cheese quesadilla in the future.  \n\nThe restaurant.com deal we had was for $25 and we needed to spend $50+.  After the food and two beers each we were still only at $40 something so we also had J\u00e4germeister shots which put us over our minimum.  I thought their pour was very generous for the shots.\n\nWe just returned from our second time here.  This time we had the regular wings.  They have a mild and extreme sauce.  We asked if they could do something in the medium range and they were able to accommodate us.  We chose the blue cheese over the ranch option for sauce. We were happy with our wings.  They had a spicy tangy flavor without being too hot.  \n\nWe shared the Big Boy burger (Just like Bob used to make only better! One patty\nand our secret sauce).  We chose the double patty option and added cheddar. We also had the seasoned fries and onion rings.  The onion rings were pretty good. The fries were a bit bland so I asked for more of the blue cheese as I despise catsup.  That helped a lot.  The burger was tasty and it actually reminded me of a Bob's Big Boy even though it's been many years since I've had one.\n\nWhen I was in Bisbee a couple of weeks ago we met a couple who were drinking Moscow Mules which I've never even heard of.  Arena serves a Moscow Mule in a copper cup so I had to try it. It's pretty good.

The band hadn't started playing, because we were there to early, but the people were nice, and all the staff were really pleasant.

Obviously, there was a group of people that were regulars, and came just to dance.  Then there were a lot of people (like us) that just came to watch, drink, and have a good time.

As we walked in and started making our way towards the dance floor, the owner stopped us and asked if we wanted a table. Not understanding her, she bluntly stated that the dance lessons are separate and if we want to join in, we have to sit down and order food (two drinks per person or a meal and a drink--mind you, it doesn't say this ANYWHERE on the website. A warning would have been nice. And, it's not to say that we wouldn't have ended up ordering a few drinks or getting some food at some point during the evening, but the way she told us was quite rude.) Since it seemed that we had no other choice, she showed us to a table in the dining room and gave us a couple menus. When our waitress arrived, she explained that these particular menus were only for the bar or patio areas, and that we couldn't order from them. But, once I told her the owner gave them to us, she reluctantly obliged and allowed us to order, ya know, because we are trying to give them our money, I didn't think it would be a problem. \n\nOnce we got settled at our table and ordered, it was pointless for us to join the dance lesson as it had already started and we wanted to get our money's worth (I know it's only $5, that wasn't the issue--it was merely the principle of participating in the entire lesson and since we had an awkward start to the whole experience, we didn't even want to bother at this point), so we just watched the other folks enjoying some fun dancing and good music. After we had gotten our food and were halfway through our meal, our waitress asked us if she could move us to another table....um WHAT? As we are finally beginning to somewhat enjoy ourselves, you want us to get up and move because you have a party of 5 that needs this table? I don't think so...but since you're already picking up my drink and my food I guess I'll follow you. She seats us elsewhere and doesn't come back for another 30 minutes. We danced for a little bit and joined in on some of the line dances to try and brighten our situation, but we couldn't get the sour taste out of our mouths. \n\nWe decided after an hour of nonsense it was time to leave. Our waitress finally gave us the check; I needed change, and had to hunt down the owner to take care of it for us. She ended up chatting with some guests and seemed to forget that I needed change back. Our waitress finally came to our table and couldn't find our check. She estimated the total of our bill and just handed me my change out of her pocket (definitely didn't give me exact change, but at this point I was so over it.) With a smirk she said, \"here,\" and walked away. I took all of my change and we got the heck out of there. \n\nSo extremely disappointed in this joint and it's such a shame because the ambiance and decor are quite nice, as well as the spunky gal who was teaching the lessons--those are about the only two things that Handlebar J has going for them.", "business_id": "d840tbYJSVn8Fu-n5XRJTw", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-01-15", "type": "review"}

I work across the street and stopped in here on my lunch break the Monday before Christmas, as I wanted to order a bouquet for my grandmother for the holidays. Knowing that Cactus Flower had such a great reputation at least in the past, I figured the big price tag on some flowers would be worth it. \n\nWhen I entered, needless to say they were busy.. But I expected that. I didn't expect to stand in line to wait to be acknowledged by one of the free \"florists.\" There was only one gentleman in front of me, and he was already being helped. Another woman was on the phone with who I'm assuming was a delivery driver and there were at least four other women in there who didn't give me the time of day. \n\nWhen I was finally acknowledged and helped, I asked to see some examples of Christmas bouquets, and asked for recommendations for hearty flower that would last long in warm environments (my grandmothers home is extremely hot). The woman who was helping me not only didn't know how to operate the computer system, but couldn't give me any straightforward recommendations on flowers or arrangements. After a while of struggling through her sentences, she pointed to a card on the counter with some popular Christmas arrangements. \n\nI liked one, except for the fact that it had Carnations in it. Everyone who has at least somewhat of a respectable knowledge on flower-giving knows that carnations are a no-no. So, I asked the lady if I could pay more and have them subbed out for white roses instead (to have a combination of red and white roses with the green filler plants and pinecones). She said yes. I also paid extra to have some orchids put in the bouquet to add a bit of height to it, because it came in a low, square vase. \n\nWhen I went to pick the arrangement up, I found that it was MUCH smaller than it seemed in the advertisement. maybe a 5\"x5\"x4\" vase. And, needless to say there were carnations spread throughout it. I asked the woman (different from the lady that helped me order) to look back through the order and see if this was notated, and it was. So, I asked them to fix this mistake, and that I would return in about a half and hour to pick it up. When I returned the bouquet really wasn't much better. Instead of the normal white roses I expected to be in the arrangement, I got these miniature white roses that not only looked cheap and sleazy, but were brown and dying around the edges. Without much time to spare, I just agreed to take it anyway, instead of waiting another half an hour to fix yet another issue.

When he came home with his repaired shaver, I queried him about what work they had done and how much he paid.  \n\nRepairs cost just shy of $60. They replaced the razor, the shave guard and battery (which I don't believe one bit) amongst some other \"unknown things\" according to my Dad.   He was told, \"We can fix it right away for you!\" after he informed them of the symptoms.  The con artist took the device in the back to work on it while my Dad waited and returned within a few minuets.  $60, REALLY???  for a few cheap chinese manufactured parts worth at best HALF the price.  With that being said, I started to research before I flew off the handle with this place.  He could have bought a BRAND NEW - same model shaver for $35.... yes, THIRTY-FIVE US-DOLLARS.\n\nI DO NOT APPRECIATE my elderly father being taken advantage of and RIPPED OFF when he should have been advised to just buy a new one.

Back then there was much more family running the place.

Not \"fried\" chicken, but a close cousin and absolutely terrific.  Juicy, crispy and darn good.  Comes with 3 huge Broasted potato wedges and cold slaw.  Let's talk about the cold slaw:  BEST in the state.  Has some kind of oniony taste that just knocks it out of the park.  Sounds strange, but sometimes I crave the cold slaw more than the chicken!\n \nWings are solid.  Pizza's OK (I'm from Brooklyn and a huge pizza snob, so nothing in AZ is going to work for me).  Hot Sandwiches are great.  Chicken Parm and Meatball sub are favorites of my teenage sons.  Great selection of beverages.  Interesting beer choices from the help-yourself-refridgerator in the front.\n\nPrices are decent.  Service is spotty, but the kitchen is right in front of you and very open so if things aren't going well, you can walk right up to the cook and tell him.  Also, Guido is always there, so...\n\nOnly real disappointment are the frozen \"Italian Ices\" that sit in a freezer near the front of the place.  They are pre-packaged and frozen.  Tempting to look at, but a poor immitation of the real thing. \n\nIf you're headed to the Harkins Shea 14 movie heater or the Big League Dugout for your baseball gear stop in.

Desserts are sublime. \n\nI'm happy to have a glass of House Chianti, which is around $6.50, so you can enjoy a reasonably priced glass of wine as well. \n\nThis is NOT corporate service, so don't expect a \"Capital Grill\" waitstaff skill level every time.  Definitely there are skilled wait staff, but there are also family members working there, and while I enjoy the old-school family restaurant experience, I know that not everyone appreciates the less than polished service.  They are always well-meaning, and that is part of the charm, for me.\n\nThey do not rush you out, they are pleased to help you select your food choices if you need.

The experience was fine for them, and they were treated well BUT they behaved appropriately, and were able to sit for an almost 2 hour dinner.

While they will gladly bring out a dish of buttered pasta or the like for a picky eater, be forewarned with regards to the potential length of your visit, and the no corporate kids menu.\n\nOn the dress code- we are in Phx/Scottsdale- an area where people are traditionally casual in dress.

My partner had lamb shank (osso bucco style) over milanese risotto with rich veal sauce - yummy!  I had homemade squash ravioli with four cheese sauce.

Carpaccio with parmesean cheese, capers, tomatoes, olive oil; gnocci (Iighter than a cloud)  in a cream sauce with a spoon full of marinara; burrata (same as the first night but it was double the size the next day); and the best mussels I've ever had (spicy marinara sauce or you have your choice of white wine/garlic or tomato sauce).  The stuff was like crack and my boyfriend practically licked the bowl.   My boyfriend loves limoncello so Deborah made him a limonello martini and then provided complimentary limoncello after dinner.

When it came back it was charred on the outside but still rare. By that time my husband and I were 1/2 way done w/ our meal. Our friend decided to switch the steak for another cut. He was, unfortunately, facing the kitchen where he got bird's eye view of the chef's arguing and visibly upset by this steak situation. They did bring out the new cut which was better cooked but our friend was questioning whether or not he should taste it. When we had originally ordered he also pre-ordered a dessert b/c we were told it took 1/2 to prepare. After he was done w/ the steak, they did bring out the dessert but after the issues w/ the steaks, he  forgot he ordered it and no longer had an appetite for it. This is the kicker. Rather than the waiter saying it was on the house as some form of compensatory effort, he quickly took it back. I know if i was the manager, I would have tried to compensate for the whole situation, i would have credited the customer with the bad experience. Not so here. Not only bad meal experience, expensive but also poor managerial decision. \nWill never go back and do not recommend.

We couldn't have had better service. We also couldn't believe the sheer size of the steaks - my \"slightly smaller\" NY strip steak was about 2 1/2 times the size of the smallest steak at Outback. My husband's regular-size steak looked like at least 12 oz., maybe more, and both of us took about half of our steaks home. My husband's garlic mashed potatoes were enough to feed three people, so we took the extras home too. The huge loaf of warm bread was crunchy on the outside, tender and tasty inside, and when crumbs got all over the table, our server quickly came and removed them with his little scraper (very elegant). \n\nA photographer took our photo and presented it to us in a signed folder a few minutes later. The ambiance was upscale, elegant, but very comfortable too. There was a coat check, valet parking ($6 plus tip), and just all-around excellent customer care. \n\nThe menu is a la carte - each item is ordered separately, and there are plenty of choices, but again, you need to be prepared to ignore those high prices (like $47 - 54 just for the steak alone). I had to send my steak back because I ordered it \"medium well\" and it came rare-medium, and the manager himself brought it back to me with apologies. \n\nWe couldn't have chosen a better place for a very special night out.

I like this place because it's old school without trying to be.  The kind of place where you're waiter has been working there for the last 10 years, drinks come stiff, and all the food is top quality.  \n\nWe started with a half dozen oysters and a glass of champagne.  Our next course was the crab cake which was all lump crab, and went well with the mayo sauce they serve it with. After that we tried their new bacon steak which was absolute maple porky heaven.  Next we switched to white wine and split an order of the Chicken Christopher, which IMO is one of the absolute best chicken dishes known to man.  For the next course we split a perfectly cooked medium rare 12 oz filet with saut\u00e9ed spinach and mushrooms and a glass of Shatter Grenache.
