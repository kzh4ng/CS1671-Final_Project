There are photographs of the owners and chefs family on the walls.... its cute. My boyfriend called ahead and told them i was vegetarian and the chef prepared a couple of things for me.  There is no set menu and the waitress reads out what the chef has prepared for the night there are 5 courses. an appetizer, pasta, main course, a salad and and dessert. I thought the salad after the entree was pretty interesting . They are also very generous with the bread which i LOVED!!!!\nEvery meal was made to perfection. It had a homey feeling .....\nMy boyfriend had some scallops that he is still talking about.  My entree was spaghetti squash with mushroom wild rice and berries and limed artichokes. There were soo many flavors and all the ingredients were balanced. The service was great.\n All in all it was an amazing experience. The chef came out to say hi at the end of the night...... i finished off my dinner with the creme brulee and some coffee. Our bill came to $120 with tip and it was absolutely worth it .\nThis is a great restaurant for a super special occasions and  it is very private.Not to dressy and not too casual.\n Pick out a great bottle of wine or two and get ready to get your taste buds blown.\n Im pretty sure my boyfriend and i will be going back.", "business_id": "QVZBd_eu0oJ4IN0md2XPTQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-04-25", "type": "review"}

Olive Garden seems like fine dining compared to this place. \n\nYou can already tell how bad your experience is going to be when they give you the complimentary bread that looked like it was bought from a convenience store. Not the crusty Italian bread. The generic Giant Eagle whole wheat bread that I buy regularly tasted 10x better. This so-called Italian bread came with pre-packed airline butter. No dipping oil with herbs and spices. Then we had the wedding soup which looked like it's been sitting in the kitchen since this morning and was just reheated. \n\nWe had the appetizer platter, which was composed of allegedly banana peppers, calamari, and breaded zucchini. It was 95% breading. I can barely taste any calamari or zucchini. The worst was the marinara sauce, which tasted like it came from a can. Again, no herbs and spices. \n\nFor the entree, I ordered rigatoni and my fiance had baked ziti. The only way I can describe the sauce is: Think of diluted Ragu. My pasta was also overcooked and there was no flavor whatsoever so I had to put so much parmesan cheese. I couldn't even taste garlic in it. What kind of Italian food has no garlic? The baked ziti was overcooked and dry, and it was tasteless according to my fiance. \n\nService was slow, but there was only one waitress in the restaurant. I requested warm water and it took about 40 minutes until she finally served it. She was generally nice and probably embarrassed for serving such crappy food.\n\nHow much did it cost us? $50, including tip.\n\nThis restaurant was probably good back in the day. As we left the place, we saw a certificate of excellence for being one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh.

Full disclosure:  I was dying at the end of a long urban hike, and we were right next to Alexander's and I told my friend I would hate him forever if he did not buy me pasta RIGHT.NOW.  :)  \n\nAlexander's totally hit the spot.  It was so good!  I was really surprised!  I had the chicken bruschetta and it was DELCIOUS.  I'd had the same item at Del's a few weeks ago and Del's cannot hold a candle to Alexanders.  My chicken breast was only slightly seasoned which is a sign of a good, confident chef.  The chicken was delicious and perfect and came out tasting like well seasoned chicken, not salt.\n\nIt came with a side of pasta in any sauce I wanted from their lengthy list of sauces.  I chose penne in gorgonzola cream sauce.  The gorgonzola sauce was extremely strong.  VERY cheesy.  I like gorgonzola, but it was a bit strong for me--although it was still very good.\n\nMy friend had a spaghetti and marinara in the marinara was incredible.  You can tell its made on site.  It was excellent.  \n\nOur entrees came with side salads which were very good, and there was bread nad oil on the table for dipping although we didn't get into that too much.

While most of the menu items are Asian, there were a page full of Italian pastas. The menu had noodles from all varieties of cultures and even some rice dishes and sushi, while their decor was Italian more than anything else. Oh yeah, not to mention that their restroom was French...\n\nIt was a drizzly day in Phoenix. The storm from California was heading east so I was in a ramen mood. Although Cherry Blossom was a little out of the way from where I was staying, I still went the distance to get my fix. They had about 5 different kinds of ramen and I was about to get the Harata Ramen until I saw the word \"spicy\" next to Tan-Tan-Men. I love me some spice so I went with Tan-Tan. My appetite also pushed me to get a Tootsie Roll. My boyfriend decided to go with the Gomoku Yaki Udon. \n\nThe server brought out a complimentary salad and not too long later came our Tootsie Roll and noodle dishes. The Tootsie Roll was good, but it definitely wasn't the best quality. As for my Tan-Tan_Men, the bowl and its contents were huge. I was so excited to eat even though I knew I wouldn't finish it. As for the taste of the broth, it was spicy, even for me. I usually pride myself on being able to take on a lot of spice, but the fact that it was spicy mixed with the heat of the boiling broth made it even more intense. I even choked on it at one point, but as I kept eating it got more tolerable. It was tasty, but if I were to ever try their ramen again, I'd probably go with another one. The Gomoku Yaki Udon was very bland. It had a generous amount of seafood, but not worth getting. \n\nThe dishes may be hit or miss, but for under $7, my ramen was huge. I've been to places that give me less than half of the portion size for double the price. It wasn't the best I've had, but it was good enough to satisfy my ramen fix.

This is a true little hole in the wall! \n\nIf you think the food is expensive, try and make home made Italian food on your own... Not happening cheaply! Oh, add a bottle of wine and guess what it gets even harder!  What is surprising is that Giuseppe's does NOT hit you for expensive wine.  Everything is reasonable. \n\nThis is a restaurant for people that love good food!\n\nEAT, DRINK, and enjoy!", "business_id": "VpW40mznMS43CqdbelX2wA", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-05-12", "type": "review"}

It was the best money I've ever spent.  The restaurant is lovely, the food was fabulous and the service very attentive.   \n\nOn a recent Saturday night, we each had the gnocchi and ravioli appetizer - to die for!  The Caesar salad was one of the best I've ever eaten.  When choosing our entree, there was no vegetarian selection listed.  'No problem' said Jon, our waiter and he had the chef prepare a delicious risotto primavera for us.  \n\nThe only thing not superior was the tiramisu.  Although it tasted great, the bottom layer was too soggy.  I'll give them a pass on that because having assembled that desert many times I know how tricky it can be.", "business_id": "vvA3fbps4F9nGlAEYKk_sA", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-03-04", "type": "review"}
