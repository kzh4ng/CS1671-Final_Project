The comments should be obvious to those with any common sense, but unfortunately, I find myself having to state them anyway. First and foremost, and I feel like i am stating the obvious here, the cinnamon & sugar (c&s) bagels are very sticky, especially on the bottom. With that being said:\n1. Do not store c&s bagels underneath any of the following bagels: onion, poppy seed, sesame seed, everything, or any other bagel that has \"loose parts\". When the loose parts fall off  they stick to the c&s bagel. Biting into a sweet c&s bagel and getting a bite of onion (which I dislike) is AWFUL. \n2. either wipe off the counter or place a new sheet of wax paper on the counter after prepping one of the above mentioned bagels with loose parts. Again, when you place a c&s bagel on top of these loose parts, they stick to the bagel. \n3. when someone orders a tub of cream cheese to go with a c&s, please wrap the bagel. If not wrapped, the container becomes sticky and messy from coming into contact with the bagel.\nI was a \"regular\" at the Market Square location before changing jobs and never had any of the above issues. The C&S bagels were kept on the top shelf and they wiped the counter off after EVERY order.The only good thing I can say about this location is that it has drive through.", "business_id": "uwiD9jxs09xxXG0by_xKuA", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-10-06", "type": "review"}

I'm going to go ahead and play my \"I Waited on Tables in High Volume Restaurants for Several Years\" card just so I can say that even during lunch rush, no, that level of absence is not acceptable. They take up to fifteen minutes to even greet the table, which leaves you looking around wondering who will be serving you, or if you can at least have a water. If I were serving, I'd at least pop over and say a quick, \"Hi, my name's Ali. I'll be with you in just a few minutes.\" No matter how busy you are, there are a few things you just don't let slip: greetings, drink refills, and a speedy check. If it's busy, communicate that delay by saying \"thank you for waiting,\" or \"sorry for the wait.\" Honestly that's all it takes. That's it! Primanti's servers were lacking in all of these things, and from the customer perspective, it really does make a difference in the experience.

Boars Head meat is always good, but I'm not sure if they are actually slicing the meat for each sandwich. Turkey seemed like it was cut another time, wrapped up in some plastic and then unfolded for each person's sandwich. They also doused the entire thing with about a quart of Russian Dressing (#5), put some fancy tomatoes on the sandwich and I requested a change of cheese from baby swiss to Smoked cheddar. You can only get about 8 different cheeses here on your sandwich (the rest you must buy) and they only carry one style of Boars Head turkey. No pepper or pastrami style, nothing but boring old plain turkey. Whoever is raving about the macaroni salad must be a rookie as well. The mac salad lacked any flavor and resembled ones you will find in a supermarket tub. There might be some better sandwich combinations out there on their extremly cluttered back wall (it's actually not cute cause your menu is in 20 places), but with the limited variety of meats, it doesn't mean much.
