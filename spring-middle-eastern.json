Then, lo, and behold, Monica, I'm assuming one of the restaurant owners, walked up to us on the sidewalk menu in hand convincing us to come try her restaurant just a few strides away. And convincing she was.  \"Why not?\" we both thought.  She did such a good job giving us a sales pitch, we thought her restaurant deserved a chance tonight.  \n\nWe were ushered inside the small venue to a table very near another couple just finishing dessert and asked about their experience.  The fact that they were happy being there and the fact that there were other patrons was a positive start.  I was so afraid we were going to be ushered into an empty place begging for business but, not so.  There was a steady stream of clientele, most due to Monica's steady persuasion, I'm sure.  \n\nWe started with hummus and pita and a glass each of Greek white and red wine.  Then we ordered lamb and chicken kabob combo and some other greek dishes which came with a decent salad and a side.  Finally, we had to order dessert, knowing full well it would be home made.  The guests nearest us had ordered the Jackie O (as in Onasis) cake and another pastry, which is what Monica recommended to us so that's what we ordered.  It was all pretty good, not stellar, but pretty darned good.  I've definitely had more flavorful kabobs but I did appreciate the family home cooking aspect.   The wine was ok but would rather have ordered off a wine list.  The salad was a nice size and was good.  The Jackie O cake was light and moist -- a hit.  \n\nOne point to know that has been mentioned in other reviews:  the main meal looks to be inexpensive but it will add up quickly.  Everytime Monica looks at you with smiling eyes and asks if you'd like some wine, then ask if you want another glass, or do you want some hummus, and finally if you'd like dessert, you really want to say \"yes\" as if you're at your favorite aunt's house.  But, of course, each of these items comes with a price which you're glad to pay at the end of the meal because of your gracious host's manners and offerings.\n\nI swear that Monica has the best work ethic I've seen in a long time.  From the moment she saw us on the sidewalk, she was in motion from ushering us in, to seating us, to taking our order, to presenting our order, to refilling our water, to cleaning tables next to us, to flagging down more clientele, to making sure we and other clients were satisfied with their meals, to taking our payment.  \n\nOne small humorous note as other reviewers have pointed out:  Ask for directions to the restroom and you'll be ushered through the kitchen, saying hello to the dishwasher and the cook, down the stairs.  I've never experienced that before (probably for good reasons).  But, it was humorous.", "business_id": "PxP19Rb88OQKiSMl2oWNsg", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-04-03", "type": "review"}

Now that we know our way around a bit more, decided to revisit.\n\nThis time, no one greeted us upon entering.  There was one other table of diners.  There was a gentleman in the back at the cash register along with a girl and a boy who barely looked old enough to work here.  They might have been family members but I don't know.  No one seemed interested in greeting us at the front of the restaurant so my husband walks back to ask if they are open.  They are.  Finally, the young male leads us to our table with menus.  \n\nWe decide on the baklava sundaes.  They were reasonably priced -- 3.00 each -- and decently flavored.\n\nI just want to say the experience was quite a bit different than the first visit.  The first visit had us excited to try the restaurant, as the woman who worked there (I'm assuming one of the owners) was eager to pull us in from the sidewalk and entice us with her menu offerings.  This time no one was excited to have us as diners and they seemed to wish we weren't there.  Quite a difference in personalities and style.

Here is what I recommend: rice needs to be better prepared and perhaps have some nuts, raisins or garnish added to it, the lamb could be thicker, have the fat and/or tough parts removed and also have a stronger marinade or come with a gravy or sauce for more flavor, and maybe the mashed caviar could be mixed in with some unmashed caviar, which would give it much more flare and appeal.", "business_id": "PxP19Rb88OQKiSMl2oWNsg", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-05-25", "type": "review"}

They didn't replace the white paper, and there was some type of food smeared on the corner. We moved.\n\nThe service was generally good but the upsell was present in every breathe. It gets old because you are already plunking down a wad of hard earned cash.  The suggestions were good ones.\n\nThe hummus sampler was very good with the grilled lamb/pomegranate being very tasty!\n \nThe Amel's salad of greens with lemon/mint dressing was good.  The upsell of feta was a good idea.  Why they don't just include it and increase the price for the salad, I'm not sure.  It would have lacked something without the feta.  There's a freshness of herbs in the salad -- it was a great start.\n\nI had the mixed grille kabob --- (2) pieces lamb, (1) filet, (1) chicken (1) shrimp, (2) tomatoes, (1) piece of onion.  While admittedly I am a big guy, I could have eaten two of these.  The amount of food was too little given the price tag.  I can get a full 1/2 pound filet kabob at Giant Eagle for about $5. Or mixed Filet/Chicken for $5. Compare this to the $21.00 charged for essentially the same thing.

Restaurant was dark and decor was unique with painted murals on the wall. \n\nWe were told the wait would be about 20 minutes, so we stopped by the bar.  Moments after receiving my wine, we were seated.  A 20 minute wait wasn't bad, but a 5 minute wait was even better!  \n\nFood was incredible.  Fresh, homemade, local, very filling!\n\nAppetizer: Stuffed peppers.  3 decent-sized peppers & complimentary freshly baked pita bread.  \n\nEntree: Chicken something-or-other (I can't find name on the online menu).  Bone-in chicken thigh from a local farm; rice pilaf; veggies.  \n\nService: Decent - the only reason I decided on 4 stars, instead of 5. Waitress was friendly, but not terribly attentive (perhaps because they were busy?).  She stopped by to take order, deliver appetizer & food, and to deliver check, and I found myself beverageless a couple times.  \n\nOverall, delicious food and a nice experience.", "business_id": "cESul2ojJOjadz-7BKB5eg", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-05-29", "type": "review"}

My husband and I came here for our 2nd anniversary. We hadn't been to Amel's since our first date so it was a properly romantic choice. \n\nIt was a Monday night and not very busy, so it was seat yourself anywhere. I chose the booth in the corner because my favorite Klimt painting was hanging right there. Some people have called Amel's decor cheesy, but I wholeheartedly disagree. It's a bit eclectic, but not cheesy. I actually think it's beautiful, but I'm one of those people that like having a lot to look at. \n\nYou get hot and fresh pita, dipping oil, and butter to start. It's delicious. I ate pita with absolutely everything I ordered, and it was great. They'll keep it coming if you start to run out. \n\nThe thing I remembered the most from our first date is that I got a fabulous cup of she crab soup, and my date ate most of it (but if you ask him, he'll deny it). So this time I opted for the larger bowl instead. It's a rich and creamy soup, with very large chunks of crab throughout. It was awesome. I would occasionally taste a little tiny bit of soft shell, but that just kinda reassured me that it was the real deal crabmeat. \n\nWe had grape leaves cuz my husband loves them. They are a very interesting Mediterranean delicacy. The lamb inside is tender and flavorful. But proceed with caution. If you're not careful you'll get juice all over you. I would recommend fork and knife instead of bare hands. I wish they weren't so watery, but I think it might be a necessary evil since I believe they're made by steaming or maybe boiling the lamb in the grape leaves. It's a wet, but delicious appetizer.\n\nFor dinner I decided on the Lamb Jasmine. It was so so good. Again, the lamb was cooked to perfection. It practically melted in my mouth. The rice and veggies were also great, I believe there was spinach, artichokes and tomatoes. Oh and feta cheese! But the star of the dish was the tomato rosemary lamb glace. The vegetables had been cooked in it as well as the lamb, and it was just amazing. That was the perfect sauce to tie everything together. \n\nDinner came with a choice of salad. I picked tabbulee, which I really like, but I find hard to eat sometimes because it's so herby, and I think the parsley is kinda spiky. Not a great mouth feel. Lol. But again, that's where pita came in handy. I just basically put my salad in a pita and ate it like a wrap. Unconventional maybe, but it was awesome. \n\nI had some really great wine here also, their selection was pretty good. Get a good red wine if you get lamb. I got merlot, and it was really excellent. I think I'm getting better at pairing. \n\nService was fantastic, our server was so sweet and she really stayed on top of things. She even took our picture for us at the end of the night. \n\nAmel's can be a little on the expensive side, but it's definitely got value. Not only was my food delicious, but there was a lot of it. I have leftovers! We definitely won't be waiting so long to come back to Amel's.", "business_id": "cESul2ojJOjadz-7BKB5eg", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-03-17", "type": "review"}

The chicken in the shawarma was freshly grilled, the hummus was very tasty, and it was the best shawarma I've ever had.

I stuck to the non meat dishes, and while there isn't a large selection vegetarian options, they'll occasionally  offer a veggie-kabob on request.  The appetizers include standard fare of cucumber salads, stuffed grape leaves, and roasted eggplant spreads (all exceptional in taste).  The badenjanin in particular is perfectly tart and spicy, but may not be for everyone.  Other than the food, their tea selections are great-- try the spiced chai.\nMy experience on weekend nights has been a full house with a mix of family groups at the tables, and college-age groups enjoying hookah in the pillow clad booths of the tea area.  Some nights feature a belly dancer and middle eastern music.  It fits in well with the decorated interior that's covered in arches an paintings (some on animal skins).  Service has been great 2/3 visits, with attentive and friendly staff open to offering suggestions, and an owner who spends time talking with the various groups.  On one very busy night, service was super slow, but the staff was still friendly and the delicious hookahs kept things calm.

I have great respect for a small business trying to make their way in the world.  PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE POSTING\n\nPositive:\n\nFood:  The food was on par with a decent meal at a regular restaurant.\n\nService:  Initially good\n\nNegative:\n\nPrice: Double the price of a meal of this style and type.  I did use the yelp coupon and only paid what the meal was actually worth.  It was not worth the original 18 dollars charged.\n\nCoupon:  The establishment tried to tell me that the coupon was not good but they would accept it anyways.  This is after I asked when I first got to the restaurant.  Even if the coupon was not being used any more, yelp guarantees it for 1 year.\n\nAtmosphere:  As usual this restaurant is empty, however on a Friday night we were there when they were setting up for an event on Saturday.  Evidently someone rented out the building for the next day.  They were playing really explicit rap videos on the projector while I had a 7 year old and 1 year old at the restaurant with me.  Not the Establishment per say, but the people setting up for the next day. \n\nBathrooms:  Looked like they were under construction of some sort\n\nWaitress:  Our food was served with rice and meat.  We asked if they had any sauces for the rice, the answer was no.  We asked for mayonnaise, the answer this time was that all the people that eat at this restaurant don't ask for things because there is spices (saffron) already in the rice. (as my wife always uses saffron, the amount of saffron was not worth mentioning) I would completely understand this if there were people in the restaurant  eating but it would seem that the one or two customers they get are for the Hookahs.  This means, maybe they should be open to change instead of telling me what the other people who aren't there eat.\n\nExtra charges:  The food came with bread butter and feta cheese.  They asked if we want some more bread and we said yes.  They charged us on the bill an additional 4 dollars without telling us.\n\nKids menu:  None:  They said there is so much food, that kids eat from their parents.  However, if i let my 7 year old do this, I would not have any food for myself.\n\nAir conditioning;  The air was shut off allowing the entire place to be filled with the smoke from the Hookahs.  However, when we were there no one showed up and no one was smoking a hookah until we left.\n\nNote to other people posting reviews:  Please do not post racist comments about restaurants or cultures you do not know or understand.  After seeing the other comments which seemed racist, I did give the restaurant a try.  There are many restaurants in town that serve this kind of food with better reviews, and they are no different than anyone else.\n\nNote to the owner:  If your restaurant improves these items listed, I would be happy to retract my review, but I would recommend lowering prices. People in Charlotte expect more if you are charging them that amount.  Please don't have your waitress tell me what other people eat there when you have no customers.", "business_id": "UFvogJEUiLSJwyx2LSz2uQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-05-02", "type": "review"}

The Turkish coffee was weaker than expected, but wonderfully aromatized with cardamom. \n\nThere was so much food my eyes pin-balled for a minute. The red lentil soup made with sprouted lentils came in a bowl - a real bowl, not a cup-sized bowl. We also had the gyro plate which was satisfying, and mousaka entree which was like an eggplant, potato, and tomato casserole over yellow rice. By itself, the mousaka would last me two additional meals. We couldn't resist the Boston creme donut, which turned out to be the best I've had in Madison, and a gigantic cinnamon roll fritter. Plus the two coffees, the total came out to be $25 (!!) and some change. \n\nThe service is a relaxed pace, but the owners were charming and seemed to enjoy us enjoying their food.

Chinese did not go well the first night... Let's try something totally different... Was around the 16th Street / Bethany Home area... Didn't want to try Richardson's as it was so busy... Let's try the dark and secluded Mediterranean House!\n\nSurprise! This Greek restaurant is owned by a Korean lady named Suki! What a combo! I asked her why she didn't open a Korean restaurant because you can charge up to $16 for BulGogi or Galbi. I guess she just wanted to try something different.\n\nFor starters we tried the Combination Platter which consisted of Hummus, Babaghanoush, and Falafel Balls with Pita Bread. \n\nI warned my friend, and any person reading this review, that Greek cooking combines herbs unlike no other country in Europe. You have to like the flavor of oregano, mint, garlic, onion, dill and bay leaves, basil, thyme, and grape leaves. Feta (Goat) Cheese is used often in their salads. And their desserts are characterized by the use of nuts and honey.\n\nSuki could tell by my friend's facial expressions that Greek spices were not to his liking; she recommended the Cairo Special as an entree - Egyptian Chicken and Mediterranean Beef combination. The Egyptian Chicken was slightly overcooked, but had a sweet aftertaste which was interesting. The Mediterranean Beef was excellent.\n\nI ordered the Lamb Shish Kabob - which consisted of two big skewers filled with gigantic pieces of Lamb, Onions, Green Peppers and Tomatoes! The Lamb was the tenderest I had in years - EXCELLENT! Of course, you have to like Lamb...\n\nFor dessert my friend had the Cheesecake - unfortunately store bought. I had the Baklava, which was delicate and light, with two small cups of Turkish Coffee! The coffee was not as strong as coffee I had in Europe, but is probably the best in Phoenix. (When you drink Turkish Coffee... Stir the coffee OFTEN! Grounds from the coffee will settle to the bottom if you don't... then you'll be drinking Turkish Mud! And stir in about 2-3 teaspoons of sugar, which makes it taste GOOD! I know you're going to say \"that much sugar!\" when you see such a small cup... trust me! When I was in Europe, my friends would often take me to breakfast establishments that would serve Turkish Coffee. (Many customers would take a couple of shots of Turkish Coffee before their workday began!).\n\nAn excellent Greek restaurant... with the proviso that one has to favor Greek spices and herbs.", "business_id": "FltN1Hnw4n7BORXJH1kaeg", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-03-28", "type": "review"}

IT'S GREEN!\n\nSeriously the best in the valley, perhaps anywhere.  AND IT'S GREEN!\n\nIt really does look like some hippies may have cooked up a batch of \"Magic Falafel\" in the back of their VW camper bus in the Shakedown Street parking lot of a Dead concert.  I'm sure it's more benign spices making these garbanzo flour patties the color of money, grass, and a soccer player's ass, but they are a mos def a HOMEMADE recipe.  I'm not saying all light brown falafel is from a box, but that's what most gyro places are doing.  \n     8^ P`.',.`    ---pPbblltptllptbt\nI can do box all by myself.\n\nVarious kebobs, dolmas, greek and tabouli salads, pita sandwiches -- \nthe menu is classic greek fast food deli style, which just like the strip mall pad they occupy, the menu is a bit smaller than it used to be. \nThey've changed ownership and also pared down the size of their store significantly since their heyday.  \nYusef's was Best of Phoenix by New Times, or AZ Republic, or Get Out, etc, quite a bit circa 90, 92, 93, 95, 96, 2001 if I remember the signage.  Since then, things have gotten tough in the American economy for a niche market of Middle Eastern folks.  I sure hope they didn't suffer from former customers purposefully avoiding them after 2001 for any sort of discriminatory reasons -- what a shame that would be!\n\nPerusing the aisles of the grocery while waiting for your food to be prepared is like being flashed to an indoor version of an exotic marketplace bazaar (like in the first Indiana Jones movie, or hey, like Shakedown Street) full of strange and enticing shapes and smells and textures, foreign languages, and lots of \"What the heck is THIS!?\".  \n\nSpice grinders!  Pomegranate juice! Curry powder! Turkish coffee pots!  Anchovie fillets! Fresh Olives! Tamarind extract!\nI'm ready for the PARTY!  Where's the Houkka?  THERE IT IS! Up on the wall, several to choose from actually.\n\nMy green falafel sandwich was freshly made, hot, and delicious.\nStill the best falafel in the Phoenix area (but sadly, it was found to be \"Magic\" only in it's tasty savory goodness).   Only $5.99 with a soda, or check with the owner on bartering your knit sweater-making skills.\n\nCan anyone recommend a good Goo Ball vendor for dessert?", "business_id": "doEZAj-NSnoEMOJl5yXcNw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-03-09", "type": "review"}

I'm not new to Mediterranean food. However, this was my first attempt at eating falafel. Here it's horrible. Tasteless even with the sauce. Burnt on the edges. I have since had falafel elsewhere convinced it was good because I understand the Greeks and Hebrews eat it like popcorn and I have found places with great falafel, just not here as the other rave reviews would suggest. BUT they have great Adas soup. It was really spicy in a good way and nice and creamy. So I can't explain the falafel failure. Overpriced for what you get. I had to eat off my husband's plate to get full. They do bring OK pita bread out to you. \n\nAs far as atmosphere goes, it's lacking a bit. This place is (as somebody wrote) 2/3 market, 1/3 restaurant. They have a sign in the window that says \"Allah\" and \"Mohammed\", which I don't think is a good idea. There is definitely NOT outdoor seating as the stats indicate. The tables are the cheap fold-up kind and so are the chairs. The tables are chipped.

I don't want to add up how many times that is but 2000 might be reasonable. I have to admit that the location is a bit weird, its a strange little mall tucked away from the street.  The sign has letters I don't understand.  \n\nI went there because one of my techs was called to work on one of their refrigerated cases and told me how nice it was.   I went in there and did not tell them anything about my guys working there.  They were so incredibly nice and helpful I could not believe it.  When I told them that is was my first time there they patiently explained everything on the menu to me and even brought me samples of some items I had not had before.  \n\nThe shwarma is my favorite for the meats (both chicken and beef) but everything I have tried is fresh and flavorful.  Their kabobs use good quality meat that isn't too chewy.  I am a total hummus snob and make my own frequently.  Theirs is made fresh every day and tastes as good as my home made if not better.  In fact my wife bought some at Costco today and it was so bad in comparison that it made me remember I had to give these people a good review.   You can buy the same ingredients in the attached store and if you ask they will tell you which ones are best.   The have great pita bread in the freezer you can warm up and is better than any other pita bread around here.  Their prices in both the restaurant and deli are very reasonable for the quality of the food.\n\nAnother reviewer mentioned wiping the tables with the same rag as they wiped the tables.  I have seen multiple restaurants do this and as long as the rag has proper disinfectant I do not see anything wrong with it. In fact -- think about it -- you almost always put your hands down on a booth when  you slide in, then you eat with them!  I am GLAD they wipe down the booths with disinfectant.    I like this place because it is clean, you can see back into the kitchen and see how they keep it.  I don't think giving such a low rating for what seems to be a standard practice is very fair. \n\nYes, the different tiles in the dining room a a bit weird, but it is only like 1/4\" difference.  The location is a little different as is the layout.  In the first of this review I mentioned I had driven buy it literally thousands of times over the last 13 years. It seemed a little odd and I missed out all that time by not exploring it.  If you don't like exploring a little different cultures go to McDonald's.  These are hard working people who make the best food they know how, make it fresh and are incredibly nice.  They have some very beautiful women working there who are also very nice and helpful.  The whole place is maybe a little different than we are used to in Mesa but if you want interesting and flavorful experience stop there and give them a try.", "business_id": "4rr-CJp0jMKr-kg9wnrTdw", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-04-18", "type": "review"}

Over the course of time I have unfortunately seen the quality of this place slip.  I used to really enjoy this place.  The Princess Combo was good.  \n\nI went to Princess last night with my wife.  We ordered the Princess Combo.  The following are some of the observations noted:\n\n1) The cleanliness of the place has slipped.  Please clean your booths and tables (the tables and the floors).  It was nearly impossible to find a clean table.  Cleanliness is something that my wife and I do not compromise on.  We have been to the developing world, and even with that, we still find restaurants in the developing world much cleaner.  \n\n2) Some of the dishes need to be cleaned better.  I had a water glass that was stained, and asked for a new glass.  Please pay attention to this.  \n\n3) My wife found the beef or lamb kabab, in the Princess Combo (do not know which one it was) as being very chewy (inedible).  We enjoy kababs but it was just too chewy.  We could not determine if it was beef or lamb.  It was just too chewy.  Either it was overcooked, or undercooked (I am guessing overcooked...it was not red or raw).\n\nMy wife and I have experienced Middle Eastern and Mediterranean food and we love it.  We have been to that part of the world, and have many friends who are from that part of the world.  \n\nAlso, a lot of my colleagues where I work know that I tend to find restaurants that are \"diamonds in the rough\".  I used to think that Princess was one of them.  I am questioning this now.  \n\nMany of my colleagues are former military, and politics aside, they have been deployed in the Middle East, and they remember that corner cafe or related in Saudi, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Turkey, etc.  They acquired that taste while serving there.  They often ask me about places I recommend for Middle Eastern food.  I used to recommend this place.  I am questioning whether to recommend this place now.  \n\nPlease take a long and hard look at your place:\n\n1) Clean it up\n2) Figure out what has changed (for the worse), and fix it as far as food\n\nI trust that you have a good people who mean well.  Perhaps a little training may be all that is needed.  \n\nYou have a good \"product\" or \"service\", you just need to burnish your image a little bit in order to \"return\" to what I would call a 5 star rating.  \n\nI recommend you do it soon so that the reputation of the place is not tarnished.

With a hit-and-miss menu and tall asking prices, it's obvious that Byblos still has much to learn after nearly 28 years in business!  \n\nThe restaurant itself is well dated and the atmosphere inside generally feels like a retirement home lobby with booths for seating...booths that are very worn and borderline uncomfortable.  While the decor could use a serious smack with the pretty stick, the smaller size of the restaurant does make it fairly cozy for family dinners and small gatherings.  \n\nThe older lady and gentleman that run the place are pleasant and good natured, but can be difficult to understand.  Obviously, this has caused several of the negative reviews, but their heavy accents do add something to the experience beyond just the obvious confusion.  One thing worth noting is that they are their own waitstaff and they clearly don't move as quickly as they used to, so service can be a bit slow if there are more than 3 or 4 tables to tend to.  \n\nOn the plus side, it's easy to get prime seating on both Friday and Saturday night, because it's rarely a full house!  It's also one of the few places left in the area where you can enjoy free, live Belly Dancing during dinner on the weekends, so I give them props for supporting local talent!\n\nRegarding the food, I will say that the lamb dishes are tasty, the complimentary mint tea is exceptionally relaxing and the soups have a genuine down-home taste to them.  However, most of the main entree items are no more than food truck quality pitas and state fair combo plates sold at a premium price.  The quality of the main ingredients just isn't there and a quick trip to the frozen food aisle at Costco would net you most of the supplies needed to start your very own \"Byblos\" franchise at home!\n\nThe desserts are tasty, but few are traditional and none of them, except maybe the baklava, appear to be made by the restaurant.  Also, the bar is limited and the wine selection is nothing short of dreary, though that doesn't stop them from asking fine dining prices on grocery store brands of alcohol.\n\nWhile there's no real \"value\" in the Byblos experience, it's certainly a solid choice when you're just too tired on a Friday evening to drive somewhere else or the inlaws you hate happen to be in town and you absolutely \"must\" take them out!", "business_id": "Aicnm12Zped8nQFXyRRFvw", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-03-11", "type": "review"}

In fact, we were the only ones in there. We waited around awkwardly until someone sat us and then we were greeted by a 75+ year old server, who I assume is one of the owners.\n\nWe ordered tomato soup, a gyro plate, diet pepsi, and baklavas for dessert. It didn't seem like business was going too well. The server was a little pushy on the up-sells (the drink and the dessert). \n\nThe soda was in a smaller cup than I am used to. While we waited for food, we also took sips of the water, which was pretty good. \n\nThe soup arrived in less than 3-5 minutes. I originally ordered the lentil soup, but was very happy they brought me tomato instead. I am not exaggerating when I say that this was the best tomato soup I have ever tasted in my life. Lots of flavor and smelled amazing. Anyway, about 10 minutes later, our food plates arrived and it looked delicious. \n\nThe pita bread was plenty and they were all warm. I like my pita bread warm and soft. This pita bread was on point. To be honest, the gyro meat strips were a little too greasy for my liking, but they tasted GREAT dipped into the tomato soup.\n\nThe rice was well cooked and a great compliment to the tzatziki sauce, which was tangy and refreshing. After we devoured our meal, we felt more than stuffed. But, the waiter insisted we have dessert and even coffee. We agreed on getting baklavas for dessert.

My experience here was fabulous - great service, very clean place, and excellent food. When I was in Vegas in December, my dad and I saw an ad in the yellow pages in our hotel for Habib's.  Being Persian and constantly craving Persian food, I asked my dad (who is from Iran) to go with me.\n\nWe came here for lunch, and ordered entirely too much food.  We started off with must o'khiar to dip the bread in, and it was fantastic.  I ate too much bread though, which is probably why I left here feeling so painfully full.  We also each got doogh (a yogurt drink) which is carbonated - again, probably contributed to the fullness.  He got kabobs of some sort (I can't remember what kind), while I ordered koresht fesenjan (chicken in a pomegranate and walnut sauce).  It was absolutely delicious, and I was sad that I was too full to finish it.  So I got the rest of it to go and gave it to my dad, since he was flying out that day and could eat some while at the airport.  The total bill was $48, which was quite expensive for lunch for two, but like I said, we ordered way too much food, considering it was lunchtime.  But the quality of the food was fantastic, and Habib came over and talked to us quite a bit and made sure everything was to our liking.  There were quite a few people that came in who you could tell were regulars - they were greeted like they were old friends.\n\nAlso check out the market section - they have a large variety of food (some of which we have trouble finding in Florida), so we spent some money in there as well :)", "business_id": "QkVSaXjg5475VD3sZixCZQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-04-02", "type": "review"}

One basic place everyone will want to start out at when tasting Persian cuisine is the Koobideh.  If you're Persian you will know right away whether the rest of the menu items will be good and if a follow on visit is needed.  If you are American (and are meat eater like me) it's a safe dish to go with.  I can tell you the Koobideh at Habib's is very good.  The Basmati rice served at this place is also perfect.  \n\nDon't forget the Maast-o Khiar either.  It's another standard to tell you not only how they prepare the food, but also how they hold the items prepared for the day.  A good Maast-o Khiar like the one served at Habib's is always a pleasure.\n\nThe Ghormeh Sabzi served was also good.  I would have preferred some lamb in the stew as well.  But a vegetarian Ghormeh Sabzi is always delicious stew.  For you dyed in the wool American out give this dish a chance.  It may look super dark green like overcooked spinach, but the flavor is definitely tasty and nothing like spinach.   \n\nFor those reading this review I am not Persian.  But I did fall in love with the food and now cook a wide range of Persian meals often at home.  Habib is not a strictly Persian place as evidenced by having hummus on the menu.  Some of the dishes are a little Americanized to bridge the gap.  But I would say this a decent place to start your love affair with Persian cooking.\n\nThough it's not on the menu you should ask for a serving of Tadig to go along with the stews.  This portion of the basmati rice preparation is a great compliment to the stew. \n\nAs it's been mentioned Habib's interior does have a few failing points.  And the location itself can be easy to miss when tying to find it.

I had always heard that the owner was rude and finally saw it with my own eyes.\n\nHabib was taking our order. My mother asked if the fish was fresh and Habib said yes. My father asked again in the most polite words and soft spoken, friendly, respectful tone of voice if the fish was fresh or fresh frozen (my dad eats a lot of fish!)? Habib SNAPPED back in a rude, confrontational and aggressive tone of voice and said \"I already answered you once! I do not need your business!\" I was frankly shocked. This was after my father had earlier paid him a compliment on his restaurant when we first got there. Frankly it ruined our mood, our meal and whole evening. My mother at this point preferred to leave but we were already there, settled in, tired from travel and we stayed and ate our food.\n\nThe persian food here is reasonably good. Nothing spectacular but not disappointing. The prices are high for what is offered though. There are other places in town with better persian food (see reviews for Royal Persis and form your own opinion) but the physical location etc is not quite as nice, although my limited interactions with the owner there have been pretty pleasant. The inside of Habib's is more upscale, say, if you wanted to bring a guest from out of town, but frankly with an owner that can pop off at any moment does it really matter? He can ruin any physical attributes the restaurant has with a few words.\n\nThe other wait staff were pretty friendly.
