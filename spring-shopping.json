First, I'll walk you through my experience. \n This place is pretty large, and relatively clean, with a nice parking lot.  The racks are packed with clothes - and I mean, hard to move the hangers because there is so much stock, which can be a pro or a con depending on how you like it.  I found it a bit cumbersome since although the clothes are organized by type (dress vs. blouse) there is NO size separation.  In a place this huge, it takes quite a long time to find what you're looking for without the size separation.  But, I'm not one to abandon a bargain because I don't want to look around (after all, that is what its all about), so I gave a good 30 min-45 and got a handful of garments to try on.  (I would typically spend a few hours, but I was trying to spare a friend not as keen on secondhand garments).  With my carefully extracted finds I searched in vain for a fitting room, never to find one.  After asking the staff where it was, I had to take a seat and leave my jaw dropped for a while because THERE IS NO FITTING ROOM! \nI couldn't take this fact into my brain, and although there were some household items I wanted to go back and buy, I was too upset to continue.  (Sidenote: yes, I can understand how this can work for the RWB, but imho it is unforgivable, and I wish there was at least some warning before spending my time searching for a bargain when I couldn't even see if it would fit). \n\nI would recommend this store if you are looking for something specific secondhand especially for dishes, or older electronics, or even beauty products.  There was even a used Nikon SLR with a wide angle lens ($200 though)!  \nBut if you plan on buying a sundress, and don't plan on stripping down in front of your fellow thrifties, you'd better be confident in your purchase.  RWB is just like any other thrift store, and you can't return or exchange your items, so you'd be out of luck and out of money.", "business_id": "kKmvSJ6Z8UVPdrnL74bqrg", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-04-15", "type": "review"}

Here's my rant, a friend and I stopped in one day after high school. I was a senior at a catholic private school at the time so I was required to wear a fancy uniform so I looked highly presentable. I picked a shirt up I was thinking of getting and held it as we browsed through the store. They announced they were closing and I was across the store from where I got the shirt. Deciding not to get it, I placed it on a near by shelf. My friend checked out, and as we were walking out of the store a  woman that worked there said to me \"where is the shirt you were holding\". I told her I had placed it on the self in the back, and said sorry for not putting it back. She said \" I walked back there and didn't see it, so where is it\" and clearly implied that i stole it.  I told her again that it was on the shelf as nice as I could and she then told me that she didn't believe me and told me to go back there and get it or else she was going to search me. Now I get that it doesn't matter that the shirt was 50 cents because stealing is still wrong but because I didn't steal it and told her so I feel Im justified in being furious that I was publicly humiliated and falsely accused over 50 cents. I walked to the back of the store picked it up and started walking back and then the lady said in a grossly rude tone \" well I didn't see it back there\" no apology, no nothing. I handed it to her and walked out. I've never been there since. I was so angry I forgot to get her name tag so I could complain to the manager.

The customer service experiences I've had here have actually been mostly positive. Over the last several months, I've been going paint crazy in our house, so I'm pretty much on a first name basis with the guys at the Home Depot paint counter (it's kind of embarrassing that I'm there so much to the point where they know me, but whatever). Anyway, Jamaal and the rest of the paint department staff have always been very helpful, giving me tips and advice on paint color, type, tools, etc. They're patient with me when I request tons of paint samples (and I know how super annoying that is). Dare I even say that I look forward to getting my paint here?! \n\nAs another example, we get our Christmas tree at Home Depot every year, and we've always been very pleased with how nice the staff has been in helping us tie it to our car. And just the other day my husband and I were in the plumbing aisle sizing up tools to help us unclog a drain, and an employee walked up to us and asked us if he could help. So nice. In fact, I can only recall one less-than-positive experience here, and it was when an employee mis-cut some wood for us (which we didn't know until we got it home and it wouldn't fit in our subfloor). So I guess the service hasn't been 100% perfect every time I've been here, but for a big box home improvement store, I've been very pleased overall. \n\nI do hate the parking lot though. Every time we go here, we pretty much count on the fact that someone will almost hit us, either while we're driving or walking into the store.

She then starts up the stairs and says \"no go upstairs.\" She asked what I was there for and I told her I was in for a appointment to look at wedding dresses. And then she said \"No, what KIND of dress.\" A little taken, I calmly told her the style I liked. She took me into the room of dresses and said to look around. She did not offer to pull for me (she knows her stock, not me.) I found one dress I had a mild interest in trying on. She asked if I needed help trying it on. At this point, in no mood to deal with her, I said my friend would help me. We took the dress in the fitting room and noticed it was dirty and tattered. We tried it on as best we could (if anyone has tried wedding dresses on, you know how difficult that can be). As fast as we got it on, is as fast as we took it off and booked it to the door. No way I was placing the responsibility of ordering and altering a dress for my wedding day in this shop's hands. They can't even give you the courtesy of trying on their dresses.\nAll I can figure is this lady has zero patience and should not be working with the public.

So I had high hopes that my 9(!) bridesmaids would also have a good experience.\n\nThe pros: the dresses are beautiful and the prices are good! Overall, I loved my bridesmaid dresses.\n\nBut getting to that point was one disaster after another.  I had my bridesmaids pick from two different styles of dresses. Two bridesmaids and my maid of honor lived out of town and we were told they could order over the phone. \n\nSo after that was all taken care of... We waited and waited and waited. We ordered on February 1st. I was told that because of Chinese New Year (the dresses come from china) it would take about 10-12 weeks for them to come in. At the end of May, I called just to check in about my order. The girl who answered sounded confused and told me she'd have someone call me back. No one ever called. So I called again after a week and was told there was no way to track my order and that I'd have to continue waiting.\n\nThen, in June, my maid of honor calls me. She got a bridesmaid dress in the mail! Yay! But it was not the dress she ordered. Not even close. In fact, it had some other girl's name on it and a different wedding date. It was a dress from someone else's wedding. \nI had to travel back to the store to return that particular dress.\n\nFast forward to July (5 weeks before the wedding). The dresses finally arrive! They are the right sizes! The colors are pretty! I am relieved.... Until my one bridesmaid from out of town calls me to tell me they ordered her the wrong style dress. She's an easy-going gal and normally this wouldn't be a concern, but she had just given birth and was nursing and the dress they sent her was strapless and a little skimpy. \n\nI called to see how Candalina could possibly amend this and was told (by the owner's wife) that she shouldn't have ordered over the phone and that it must have been her fault for ordering the wrong dress! I asked to talk to the owner, but was told he was out of town. \n\nSo now I'm pretty livid. I travel there AGAIN to see if I could talk to someone in person. The woman who was there was very understanding, but couldn't really help me. She said there was no time to order another dress. No time to get additional fabric. She suggested buying a shrug in a \"close color\"\n\nIn the end, that bridesmaid got a partial refund for the dress. But that was after MUCH time and effort and after many conversations. \n\nThis experience was not worth the beautiful dresses. Save yourself the headache and stay away from this establishment. Planning a wedding is stressful enough, you don't need to deal with this mess of a business on top of it.", "business_id": "YSwiLSkOzH-gQU6PVJ9kmA", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-04-03", "type": "review"}

They also carry some vintage jewelry, scarves and handbags. \nIf you take the time to go through the racks you will definitely score some unique HIGH QUALITY , no funky smells goodies.As far as their prices i noticed that average price was 23-35 and the major designer stuff was between 60-100.They also have a sales rack at the back (was 75% off when i was there).  I knocked off one star because i thought the prices were abit higher than i'm used to in Denver (esp on the jewelry) \n I walked out with a vintage (60's) Pucci dress($88) in perfect condition and an Adrienne Vittadini sweater ($17).

They brought the sofa mid-upholstery to the building just to make sure it would fit into the elevator.  That is such great customer service it is ridiculous.  It did fit, which is great, but their backup plan was to upholster it as two pieces which would then seamlessly be fit together as one inside the apartment.

The back of the shop has wonderful baked goods. Pies, breads and of course the best biscotti around! Though, the true treasure exists in the upstairs apartment where Maria has cooking classes and serves a 6 course meal to parties of  8-10 most nights of the week. I heard about the private parties while at a food tour of Bloomfield. I knew I needed to get a reservation but, I had no idea how difficult that task would be. We scheduled a dinner in October for the first available Friday or Saturday which was 6 months later! That's right folks, 6 months in advance! \n\nThe menu changes seasonally and is posted on the website. We ordered earlier in the week so that Maria had time to purchase the necessary items and prepare our meal. The menu would typically be the same for all 8 in the party but, Maria graciously offered to allow us to split the entrees into a meat and a non meat option to allow those who don't eat meat on Fridays during lent to have another option. When we arrived, we all enjoyed the appetizers in a sitting room at the front of the apartment. The appetizers themselves were a meal- meatballs, bread, shrimp, spinach pie, stuffed tomatoes and cheese with roasted peppers- all of which were incredible. Bring along your wine as Merante's is BYOB. \nThe next course was soup which we were served in the formal dinning room which opened to the small kitchen where Maria cooks your meal. At first it was a little awkward sitting so close to the kitchen and Maria. Imagine having dinner at your grandmother's home with 7  of your closest friends. But, Maria did a great job of giving us our privacy. We hardly even noticed that she was there. After the soup came the pasta (homemade gnocchi anyone?), then the entrees and vegetables, then the salad and last, the dessert. This was a meal fit for a king! The portions were huge! Luckily, Maria boxed up the leftovers making for an easy lunch the next day. If your lucky, you may even get to take home a little extra something such as extra sauce or a homemade truffle. Absolutely everything about this dinner was perfection. Everything (from the food to the service and hospitality) was done with the utmost care and concern to ensure a wonderful experience. I would literally come here every month if it were possible. Unfortunately, Maria is booked through the end of 2014! Not one day available in the next 8 months!

I brought it into Empire Music, which was my local neighborhood music store at the time. The guy who helped me--I wish I could recall his name--was nice and very helpful to me. But he also gave me his take on why it is so important to buy instruments at small, local stores in the first place, and explained that in this case it would have been in my financial interest to do so, because they sold that same guitar for that same price, but with a lifetime guarantee the online retailer doesn't offer. And he pointed out that stores like his couldn't stay alive just working on instruments bought online from big corporations, but that if his store weren't there, I wouldn't have anyone to set up my instrument.\n\nI have to say, he was right! I am not a person who can afford to pay some huge premium to buy the same thing at a small store that I can buy cheaper online, but he disabused me of that prejudice that the big online retailer was always going to be cheaper or the better value, even when compared with a store in a wealthy suburb like Mt. Lebanon.\n\nMore importantly, he was really patient and sweet, showed me some things about my guitar that were useful for me to know, and best of all did a fantastic job setting up my instrument! When I got it back it was so much easier to play and I was immediately able to spend hours practicing on it without killing my fingers.\n\nSo in short, if you are looking to buy an instrument and/or get work done on one, definitely think about swinging by Empire. They have competitive prices, their staff are friendly and passionate about the business, and they do good work. It is an important thing to have a music hub like this in the community.", "business_id": "0vvN8OpWZnzYZkDWMs3f8w", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-03-10", "type": "review"}

I'd say service here was adequate. I wouldn't say they were incredibly friendly but they were efficient and my dress came in on time and the fittings all went without any hiccups. \n\nIn the huge bridal stores like MB Bride in Greensburg, you feel like a number. They hassle you in and out like cattle. I know it's a huge store, so there's a lot of traffic, but I wanted a more personal experience for something this special. That's why I feel like a boutique experience is the way to go when choosing a bridal gown. \n\nI also liked the huge selection of dresses. They carry designers such as Maggie Sottero, Lazaro and Jim Hjelm. You can choose from the whole spectrum of classy to couture bride. I've actually been in here a couple times after my wedding and it always seems like they're up on the latest in bridal fashions. \n\n*Important note: You absolutely MUST make an appointment to see any dresses.

As some of the wedding party drove in from out of town, the bride made an appointment weeks in advance. A few things: Some of the bridal party are curvy and/or very tall, so when the bride made the appointment, she asked if there were samples in plus sizes. She was told there were. \n\nWhen the five of us arrived (the bride and four maids), our consultant was with another appointment that had run over. That's fine. However, we never ended up seeing her! We were given the services of another sweet but slightly clueless attendant. Not only that, but the bride kept asking for samples in sizes over 10-12... and we never saw any. Both consultants kept saying that they would \"get to it,\" but they never did! So two of us had to try on every dress because we were the only ones who could. What was the point of having people drive in to an appointment when there are no dresses to try on? \n\nIn the end, we ended up tentatively choosing some dresses, but the bride has made the decision that we will actually purchase them elsewhere. As we were leaving, the store was closing and I heard several of the consultants upstairs LOUDLY arguing. There were still several customers in the store, so I found this to be highly unprofessional! I forgot something in the downstairs area (where all the bridesmaids dresses are kept), and when I went back the original consultant asked me to apologize to the bride for all that had transpired. I told her to tell her herself! To date that has not happened. \n\nAs for the selection (of bridesmaids dresses), it is ok. Twice as many chiffon as satin choices. Our bride wanted the latter, so we actually didn't have much to choose from. They are renovating so at least currently, the bridesmaids section/dressing rooms are tiny and cramped. \n\nBecause of the service (or lack thereof), we will not be returning.", "business_id": "x2y1d9-v6ReSXJasCagyNg", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-03-04", "type": "review"}

For some reason, this time, MT in plumbing was determined to repair my frame instead of sell me a new one.  He told me that my frame hardware was actually thinner than what he had to sell and it wouldn't fit.  (Later I determined that not to be true - its the same size.)  He said instead he could put a brace across the frame.  OK I said.  I'm always open to saving $50+.  Well that brace added at least 1/8\" thickness to the frame.  Now it won't fit.  If he was concerned that a new frame would not fit, why would he think this very thick brace would?  I had to remove that brace to get the frame back on the window.

I'm a tennis player, and I'm just beginning a league next weekend- so I had to get a few necessities, including racket grips, sweat band, and can of balls (although I usually visit a pharmacy or Target for these). The people here are very nice and helpful. I've never restrung my racket here, so I can't speak for the quality of this service; however, I'm pretty sure I'll stop in here the next time I need to get this done.", "business_id": "3UL1To_gn_eOY5iFH5oBxA", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-05-26", "type": "review"}

That didn't make any difference, as we browsed all over the place.  Mr. Henne was personable, kind, and made us feel so comfortable.  At no obligation did I feel an obligation to buy. The customer service was among the best I have ever experienced.  Mr. Henne gave us his undivided attention, even while other employees sought his ear. \n\nWe made sure to shop around different places, but nothing came close to the experience we had.  Ultimately I decided to go with an heirloom from my S.O.'s family as an engagement ring, but I sincerely plan on taking my future jewelry business to Henne.  \n\nAs far as prices go, we're talking about fine jewelry so the sky can be the limit.

My husband, Chris, and I discussed the aspects regarding an engagement ring (what it means to us and the history behind it, what our families have done previously, and qualities we both would like to see in a prospective stone and setting). After watching Blood Diamond in years prior we were both quite turned off by the idea of purchasing any ring (we considered melting down family jewelry on both sides, but then we also felt that the ring should be a new gift from Chris to me, since the meaning would be formed in the commitment we would be extending to one another and that memories and experiences would be had upon wearing this new piece that would be specific to us as couple and our journey and love story together, both good days and bad over the years).  However, we ended up going with a recycled white gold 18k engagement ring with a conflict-free center stone from Brilliant Earth (see my review for Brilliant Earth for further information).  And then the wedding planning journey was kicked off officially for our proposal in 2012!\n\nDeciding on a wedding band was one of the few wedding planning items that I waited on and was indecisive regarding for most of the wedding planning process and details.  In my spare time I would search and search with magazines, google, various wedding websites and apps, jewelry stores and chains, talking to family and friends and observing other ideas for wedding bands, and I still couldn't quite get set on what I wanted or had a vision of until about 3 months before our wedding. \n\nI wanted something that wasn't part of a set so I had the option to wear the band by itself.  And I knew I wanted 18k white gold (so as to match my engagement ring which was of the same metal), with etchings on the sides, but no stones (so that it would be easier to clean and for general use and also so that if I wanted to engrave the inside of it, like all my maternal ancestors' wedding bands that I have from my side of the family, I could).  I went in person to Roman Jewelers (a local chain out by my parents in central Jersey) multiple times and looked through their book, describing what I was looking for, but they didn't really have it.  And then Chris and I went to a Jared out by his family in Long Island in New York and they too, recommended we look within their expanded book for offerings and kept suggesting men's bands to me.  \n\nMy cousin recommended Art Carved, Blue Nile, and Antique Jewelry Mall since she said a few of her older friends had rings similar to what I described and that these kinds of carved wedding bands with milgrain edges were popular about 5-10 years before we got married.  We ended up going with a gorgeous design from the Marlene Harris collection in Pittsburgh, PA-WBRK100A.  http://www.marleneharriscol.com/item/WBRK100A\nI had to keep scouring the Internet, Pinterest, and Etsy for antique style bands.  (FYI I also really liked WB1588-22W as well as SD1273).  \n\nI am very happy with my band and how it looks with or without the engagement ring from Brilliant Earth paired with it, even during different temperature or weather changes throughout the year.  The only factor is that on the off chance or occasion I've accidentally bumped my finger while wearing the band against something or when I've been carrying a bag with that hand and the handles have rubbed against the ring, I neurotically check to make sure it's okay.  I also am paranoid that it would rub off some of the side stones on the edge of my engagement ring on the days I wear the two rings together, but this also has not happened.  I've gotten a lot of complements about the stippled swirl designs on the edges from even casual acquaintances and other persons.  And Marlene Harris got the ring out to us really fast and in the correct sizing and everything-considering Chris placed the order only 3 weeks prior to our wedding (I was really panicking, since I hadn't found anything I was satisfied with until super close to the wedding) it all came together great.", "business_id": "NfHxV49mtVRq8enjdq1CeQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-03-31", "type": "review"}

They do get busy, and the staff seems to get flustered easily\n4) Liars - I arrived to the range ON A WEEKDAY at 12:45, shot for a half hour, and then went to pay.  They charged me an hour, saying that the paper said 12:15, not 12:45, and had no interest in listening to me prove I wasn't there that long (I also wasn't going to argue too much with people carrying guns). I paid my over-charged rate and never returned.\n5) No discipline - I have never once seen a range officer give any kind of instruction or discipline on the firing line to otherwise (even though there have PLENTY of times where that was warranted)\n\nI could go on, but I think I've made my point. Truth be told, they aren't bad so long as you catch them when they aren't busy, and make sure they write down the correct time on your slip.

This review will cover both the range and the shop. \n\n\nThe Shop:\n\nFor the last year or so, I have been getting updates from Shooters on my Facebook page and usually they are for something I neither want or need.  I have noticed their prices are pretty good.  Compared to Hyatt's advertised prices, Shooters is quite a bit cheaper.\n\nLast week it finally happened.  Shooters posted a deal that was too good to pass up so I stopped by \"just to look\" and went home with a new Sig.  \n\nThe staff was really great, nice, helpful, informative and seemed to know a lot about their inventory, which is as it should be of course.  I was doing some comparisons and they knew all the points and answers to the questions I was asking.  Special recognition goes to Dean and T.J.\n\nAmmo availability is about the same as it is everywhere and there is a limit on how much you can buy.  The price is sky high but again, that is the norm everywhere and this too shall pass.\n\nI wouldn't hesitate to send my daughter in there to buy a gun.\n\n\nThe Range:\n\nOnce the gun was mine, I needed to get some trigger time so today I was finally able to hit the range at Shooters for an hour or so.  Please note, it didn't cost me anything since they give you a free hour of range time with the purchase of a gun and I bring my own safety gear and ammo.\n\nThe range is small. the desk allows for only a couple of people and that was not a problem for me since there were only 1 or 2 others there when I arrived.  The guy at the desk is nice and funny.  When I left there were people waiting and it seemed to have filled up fast.  Some were watching the mandatory safety video, others just cooling their heels waiting for a lane.  My advice, go during the day on a weekday between 10:00 and 3:00 and you will sail right in.\n\nNice selection of rental guns, you can even rent a machine gun.  Be advised that you have to buy their ammo if you shoot their gun, but that is pretty much standard practice. They seem pretty laid back and not in your face, but they may get more \"alert\" during their busier times.\n\nI'm looking forward to taking one of their classes and considering a membership.

I took this issue up their corporate ladder and all they did was apologized.\n\nI since stopped frequenting them. Sadly due to lack of options from a similar retailer in the areaI had to visit this location again recently, I had a backpack on as I rode there in my motorcycle. I walked in the store and started headed to the department I was needing, I was stopped by a rather unpleasant employee who told me I could not be in the store with a backpack due to recent theft issues. I told her that I had been in other dick's sporting goods and was never made aware of such rule. I also informed her that there was no signage stating that as I walked in the store. She continued to state that I could either give them my backpack or I could leave the store!!!!\n\nI told her that neither option worked and that she could inform her security staff to watch me on camera or have someone follow me around as I did not feel comfortable giving them my backpack which had my valuables in it.\n\nThis brand has high prices and the staff isn't very knowledgeable nor very pleasant. They are definitely missing the point of retail on so many levels it's pathetic.\n\nI wish there were other options of stores similar to them in the area.", "business_id": "yzdBzVJ5nMflHwTH0MJzOA", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-05-22", "type": "review"}

So I ordered a custom white leather sectional from Bassett - I have other pieces from Bassett that were not custom and therefore I received immediately.  The quality is excellent but I AM REELING from my most recent experience here.\n\nWhen I ordered the sectional I paid by check in full up front and was told the order would be 6-8 weeks for delivery.  It has been ten weeks and I was just told it would be another two.  \n\nNot comfortable with this change in events I said I wanted to cancel my order.  They are apparently saying I cant cancel a custom order.  So what if it takes a year????  Am I still expected to keep waiting??  \n\nSo I told April (who works as a sales person or something there)  that they should at least refund my shipping cost or do something to maintain this customer relationship.  She says 'Probably we won't do that, you will have to talk to Carla and we have great relationships with our customers' .  Oh really?  By doing this to them?  And btw Carla hasnt returned ANY of my phonecalls!!!  \n\nShe said 'All custom orders take longer than 6-8 weeks'.  So I said 'Why did Kevin  (my salesperson) tell me that it would be 6-8 weeks then?  Is he new here?'  Of course the answer is that I was MISLEAD KNOWINGLY by the sales staff and once they got my check for nearly $5k they completely stopped concerning themselves with my order.  So yes I feel USED AND ABUSED but lesson learned...sigh.....Please be exceptionally careful with any Bassett store and NEVER BUY CUSTOM FURNITURE!!!!!!  I hate you Bassett!!!  (P.S. I will be honest and update this review if it comes sooner by some miracle from heaven or if they refund my shipping cost.)", "business_id": "fqFWad8GW178xzzC4A4ZEA", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-05-12", "type": "review"}

Found my perfect dress on the first day of trying.  I felt super lucky.  I was so worried that I was going to be stressed out and overwhelmed with everything.  I wasn't really sure what kind of dress or color would look good on me.\n\nDavid's Bridal was a good choice for me to stop by.  Upon entering, I was quickly greeted by an employee.  I sat down at the desk and was asked for my information so they could put me in the system, and they quickly assigned me to a consultant, even though it was a random stop by and I had no appointment.  I really appreciated all the help.  I waited only five minutes for them to find me a consultant, and I was teamed up with Ashley.  She was such a sweetheart!!!  When I was looking through the dresses without her first, I just had no idea where to start.  Ashley was nice and helped me start out by finding what type of style I would like to look for so that she could help narrow down what I would actually like.  It was such a good suggestion!  She's such a great employee!  Great customer service here.  I never felt pressure of having to buy one of their dresses, only to find out what I would like to see on me, and the staff also suggested what I should look for when I browsed at other stores  (which I won't now since I'm perfectly happy with my dress).\n\nThe store's atmosphere is great.  The dressing room walls are all lined with mirrors, so that was great!  I could see my dress from all angles.  Very important to see all the details of a wedding dress.  What I also thought was great was the store's ritual of when you have picked out your dress.  They made me ring a bell when I finally decided I had found my perfect dress.  Note, I also had to close my eyes and make a wish before ringing the bell as hard as I could.  It was so cute!\n\nI would recommend future brides to come to this store.  It was just perfect!  And they also have some good deals.  The staff was nice and told me that there are deals often, so I could check in from time to time.

We went for a prom dress. Poor customer service (other than the consultants who were great, that's why I rate 2 stars, one each for each consultant we worked with, the store itself and other staff get a zero), turning away people 40 min prior to close, guess they don't want to work one minute past 7pm = lost sales/revenue, restocking holds even after calling to say we were coming to get it prior to closing, 5 minute alterations taking over an hour (a brides bustle apparently trumped us, we learned this later, we were willing to pick up the dress another day but were asked to wait). Here's our experience if you care for details...visit one, Saturday morning...we walked in and saw prom/bridesmaid etc. to our left and migrated towards the dresses. Okay, yes, the was a little podium to our right with a woman standing there, but didn't think anything of it (assumption was made, that she is there for women with bridal fitting appointments). She didn't say a word to us. We perused the dresses, pulled some, even asked someone at the sales counter if a certain dress was available in another size somewhere (was told what was out was what they had and that was fine). Still, no one mentioned to us that in order to try on the dresses, we needed a junior consultant working with us (everyone is apparently supposed to check in with the lady at the podium). They had 2 opportunities to assist us with the process and ignored us. Anyway, we go \"sign in\", the lady at the podium barks over the intercom for a consultant and my daughter is taken to a fitting room. I will say this, the stylist/consultant was very nice and very kind. We put 2 dresses on hold, since this was the first store we visited and headed to some other stores to shop. When it became clear, around 5pm that the dress she wanted was one of the ones at David's, I called to let them know we were coming for it and not to restock it. They said great and we headed back in that direction. When we got there at 5:30, the dress had been restocked. They couldn't find it in the \"on holds area\" WTH? I didn't complain, just glad it was still THERE, albeit on the regular sales rack. My daughter tried it on again and we noted the hook and eye closure was broken and there was a seem pull on the back as well. Again I will say, the consultant this round was very nice and kind as well, just as much as the first, even helping my daughter find matching shoes etc. and getting the minor alterations done on the spot. Or so we thought. Here's where I need to complain. The alteration lady took the dress to the back, and after about 20 min, we inquired what was taking so long. Our consultant was kind enough to go check for us and came back and said she was currently working on it, We had dinner plans, it was after 6 at this point so we said we could come back for it. The consultant seemed miffed at that and asked us the wait, since the alterations were being done, right then, and the alteration lady was taking the time to do it immediately and putting other things aside for us. We felt bad, and stuck around. BAD idea. At 6:20, still waiting, a prom girl comes in and tries to check in with the podium and is TURNED AWAY, the woman there tells her that since they close at 7pm, she won't have time to try on dresses. WTH again?! There is 40 minutes left to pick and try on dresses! Our visit that morning was only 40 minutes? Lost sale opportunity. We witnessed this again 10 min later, this time with a bride and her bridesmaid seeking bridesmaids dresses. At 6:45, we were done...late for dinner, it had been an hour, when finally, the alterations woman comes out. She was apologetic at least, telling us a bride's bustle had to jump in front of us. Another WTH moment! We were fine picking it up another day but were told she was working on it and asked to wait. A very frustrating moment indeed. Someone should have come and told us that, we would have left and come back. Overall, their consultants, who I'm sure work on commission, were motivated, friendly and helpful. The other staff were horrible! What's also bad for this location is I am a bride and haven't begun my dress search but perused a little while I was there, even mentioned I was a bride, totally went on deaf ears.

While I have always found the floor associates helpful, the cashiers are far less pleasant.\n\nMy trip on March 1st was the most disturbing.  The store was pretty busy because of the $15 sale on jeans.  Finding a floor associate that wasn't helping another customer was impossible.  I took my purchases to the counter and asked the cashier to check the stores inventory for a size 6 pants for my little girl.  She said there were plenty on the shelf.  I told her I looked repeatedly but was not able to find a pair.  I suggested that the pants must have been on a shelf too high for me to reach.  She then asked me if I wanted to pay for my items, then go back and try to reach the pants on my own then stand in line again to complete a second transaction.  I told her I did not want to do that...that I wanted her to have an associate get the pants for me (seeing as I did not have a ladder) and ring up all my items on a single transaction.  With a very disapproving look, she said \"fine\" and stormed off.  Very unpleasant experience.\n\nWould give five stars if not for the terrible check out service.  My latest experience was extreme but the cashiers have always been less than friendly.

I, however, have not had one good experience the 5 times I've been in.  Some of the staff seem friendly, while their helping customers of course because they are trying to make a sale. I'm a people watcher, every where I go even while shopping.  One person I must point out who seems genuine, is the short chubby guy who sounds like he's from New York...seems like a cool guy, maybe.  Another guy, the one who I've seen that sits at the front and has been there every time I've been, the bald guy, will NOT say one...single...word to anybody. Learn some customer service buddy and just smile at least.  The last person I'll point out is, I think, Larry. Older guy who always wears overalls, country folk. He never tried to sell me anything but he didn't seem bothered when I had 100 questions about a rifle, so I felt it was right to say something good about him.  So the next thing, I was a first time buyer, practically zero experience with guns and gun shops. I saw a firearm listed at what I thought was an unusual price for the gun (low price). I really really wish I remembered the guy's name because I would crucify him on this review, but I do know that he wasn't a salesperson and he worked I think in the \"repair\" area. So that's kinda why I trusted him, not salesy. Long story short, he said it was a misprint and that's why it was marked so low...wound up buying the gun because I thought it was a steal. Turns out it came with one less magazine and not the night sights that it was listed for. Huge pain in the ass, and yea somewhat my fault for not knowing better. That was what I got for being a newbie.  \n\nLast thing...people, buy guns from out of state, they are ridiculously cheaper for heaven's sake. The prices at Hyatt, along with all their other \"fees\" are just simply ridiculous. There is no bargain or good deals or even \"sales\" at this place. Yes, they have a ton of guns to look at and a huge selection, but that's all they're good for! Just looking at, and holding to see if you like how it feels. \n\nGo check out Buds, grabagun, or palmetto just to name a few and your jaws will drop at the difference in prices.

Not everything is high priced here....then again...this is South Park. Not WalMart. \n\nI find mostly everything in my size...now lets be clear...I'm not a size 2,4,6, or 8.....more in the Double digits. That's ok....just work what you got...right? I can fit most large tops and dresses....They also do special orders. Which is nice if I need to go up a size. My advice...shop during the Spring Tent Sale, and Fall Party. \n\nI've never had any problems here. The girls are all super friendly. By the way...have you met Tina and her dog Gracie??? She's the CEO. The sweetest person you'll ever meet, and Gracie is Adorable! Overall I think this place rocks. The clothes I find are always fashion forward and in season.

He also helped us find a cheaper part to replace the broken one in our fridge, which otherwise would have needed to be removed and sent infor repair, rendering our refrigerator unusable for a few weeks (excellent business model there, Jenn-Air!).  He also gave us some options when his original plan to fix our oven didn't work.  He never once tried to convince us we needed something expensive.

One of the women at the cutting table left right after I got there (there were five of us in line then) saying that she was already late for her break. I didn't like to see her go, but I understood about the break thing (sometimes you *really* need your break, and sometimes your manager *really* wants you to take your break at the scheduled time). \n\nIt took a long time to get my stuff cut because one women kept cutting but the other one was helping a customer track down some numbers on a fabric. If I was that customer I'd have been thrilled at that level of service. \n\nSo I finally got my stuff cut. The woman cutting it was very efficient (but I think a little rattled from being so busy) and admired my choice of fabric (hey, I love to be validated). \n\nI went up front and stood in line some more. There were, unusually, three different people working the registers.

I mean, I saw bigger versions of the same species of plants for significantly less at my local greenhouse (Custom Grown Greenhouses on 6th Street on the south side of Milwaukee, but that's outside of the range of the average Madison Yelper, I'd imagine).There were a lot of things (particularly succulents and tropicals, but that's just what I'm into) that I thought were priced fairly.\n\n3.

I actually had to help some elderly woman carry a bag of peat moss (I think, it was a big heavy bag) to her car as I was leaving because she couldn't find a staff member to help. This is compounded with the fact that it's often not immediately obvious where you are and are not aloud to go.

For every positive interaction I have, I have two negatives ones.  My husband and I just bought a house, so you can imagine how much time we spend here.  I prefer Home Depot but the prices are so much lower at Menard's.\n\nIn the matter of two weeks, all of this happened:\n\n1. I bought a can of paint for our guest room.  I wanted the best paint, with the primer, all the bells and whistles.  I was covering purple.  I needed it.  The salesperson said I could pick from any four.  Yet, he could not tell me why one was rated higher or called premium over the other.  It was weird.  Like here are your options but I can not tell you what their difference really is.  And some were the same brand.\n\n2. When painting the ceiling of said room, we open up a can of paint and notice it has clumps in it.  This paint was about six months old.  Nothing happened to it.  So we go back to Menard's.  We have shopped at several area Menard's, because we are about convenience.  The lady at the counter was SO rude.  We did not have our receipt and could not find it in their system.  We pay for most things in cash and apparently this is NOT a good idea at Menard's.  It had a Menard's sticker which this location does not use (but other locations still use).  \n\nEVERY time we tried to talk to someone she kept speaking over us and saying this can not be from here.  We then had to repeat AGAIN, that we do not just shop at this location.  We shop outside the city sometimes.  We pick things up on our way home.  \n\nAnother rep interceded and offered to return it for us.  She was SO nice.  I wish I remembered all of their names.  But she needed a person from paint to approve it.\n\nBefore looking at the paint, a rep spoke to this RUDE customer service rep and said he could not take the paint back.  It must be our fault and that is that.  Then they said they could not take and dispose of it.  Nice huh?  No one asked us anything.  The paint was BRAND new!  \n\n3. The same day we went to return the paint, we wanted to look at screen doors.  There was no one in the section and you would have thought we were pulling teeth when we did find someone.  He was SO short with us and kept walking away while we still had questions.  It was ridiculous.  \n\nSo the prices keep us going back but the rest?

Lately, I've only been coming here when I absolutely must; I much prefer going to my local hardware store - their selection for anything that's not a big-ticket item is better, as is the service and overall experience. \n\n- There are signs posted in several places that claim, \"No waiting for savings! If there are more than 2 customers waiting to check-out, we'll open additional check-out lanes!\" -- I have yet to see this happen. A most recent visit left us waiting in line for nearly 10 minutes before checking out.\n\n- The indoor/outdoor lumberyard is a source of frustration. I would venture a guess that one of the more commonly sought items from a hardware store like Menards is the basic 2x4 (or similar dimensional piece of lumber). Any idea where they're located? We wandered the indoor lumberyard for a good 5 minutes before realizing that the 2x4s are located in the faaaaaaaaaar back corner from the main entrance. You have to walk by scores of 1-by-whatevers, fence posts, fence slats, decorative posts, synthetic decking, lattice, and other rarely used items before you get to the 2-by-whatevers. Do you need pressure treated wood? That's outside, somewhere. Do you need cedar? That's on the opposite end of the indoor yard. Do you need plywood? It's at the front of the lumberyard. Do you need insulation? It's in the middle of the lumberyard... catch the problem? There's zero organization/logic...\n\n- The outdoor lumberyard. I hate (as do my contractor friends) checking in and out with the lumberyard guard. Put it all inside like every other store does and call it good.\n\n- Limited supply of plumbing items. I recently needed a Sharkbite connector for a plumbing project I was doing with PEX. Menards didn't have the fittings, but my tiny little local Ace Hardware did.

So I grabbed my list and headed for Menards. I walked into the store at 2 o'clock on a Monday, figuring things would not be too busy. First up is lighting for outside the garage. I walked past the \"Help Desk\" with a guy in his apron. Stood in the aisle by all the lights.  15 minutes later I walked by the guy with his apron and moved on to the window coverings. Oh, did I mention that he never got out from behind the \"Help-less Desk\"  to see if I had any questions?  NOT!\n\nWell, it's on to the Window Coverings area, where I had a couple of things on my list.  I know what I want to buy, but, again, blew 15 minutes rooting through the displays without finding what I need.  Oh this time there were 2 sales types with aprons standing there chatting.  Do I detect a pattern here?\n\nNext up, is a handful of things in the garden department.  Along the way I passed 4 or 5 Apron types without anyone offering a smile or asking if I need help.  The Garden Department is rather large as is my list.  I wandered through the aisles past 3 Apron types looking for things, but by this time my patience is running thin. I decided to leave.\n\nOn my way to the exit, I passed a couple of Apron types and not a one acknowledged me.  Hey, I get it.  I am invisible!  Next stop is Victoria's Secret to offer a hand in the changing rooms.

I'm not sure if it is because I shop on Monday or Tuesday and it isn't as busy as the weekend but seriously this kohls rocks with perfectly folded items and organized shelves. Also unlike the kohls in Ohio, where I'm from, the women at the jewelry counter are knowlagable and help you with selections.

Its not REI, so they dont have a lot of everything you can think of, however they cover all the bases.

These sales are in the spring and fall and the discounts are DEEP, player. I have scored multiple technical fleeces for $20-40 and a Columbia winter jacket for $50, and several very nice sweaters for $20 each. The sale is a great place to get gloves/mittens/hats, too. \n\nMy only complaint is what they don't have: a very good library re: local options to hike/canoe/etc. or an electronic kiosk or something along those lines.

The staff people were obviously experienced in working with students and employees from the university, so they took care of my insurance paperwork without a problem.  The regular eye exam was performed in a quick and competent manner (less than 20 minutes).  If you don't have a preferred optometrist in the area, the office at Lenscrafters will do just fine for a prescription.   \n\nNext, I stopped by their shop to select new frames.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the attendants at Lenscrafters often seem overwhelmed by a mob of customers, so don't expect too much individual attention during the process of choosing frames.   \n\nI settled on a pair of everyday glasses and sunglasses.  I was told the sunglasses would be ready in 1 hour while they would have to order the parts for my everyday glasses.  The staff people  were very attentive and professional when fitting my sunglasses, making sure they sat on my face properly and even feeling the tightness of the metal behind my ear.  I walked out of Lenscrafters feeling fairly positive about the whole transaction...\n\n...Until today.  Almost 1 month has passed (exactly 25 days) and my everyday glasses are still being \"processed\" by their laboratory.   Each Monday, I've called the store to check the status of the glasses.  I'm always told that, \"Your order is still being processed\" or \"Your order will be shipping from our lab soon.\"  How is it that Lenscrafters requires 1 month to make a pair of glasses while every other optometrist in town advertises that they can have your glasses in a week or less?\n\nEach time I've called, none of their attendants attempt to explain the circumstances that are causing the delay.  Was there something weird about the lenses?  Did they stop manufacturing the type of frames I chose?  When I called again yesterday, the attendant who answered the phone told me that she would have to call the lab, and then call me back.  However, she NEVER returned my call (probably because she was buried under work orders from other customers). \n\nTo be fair, I think my case is a freak accident, and I am sure that there are dozens of happy customers who walk out of Lenscrafters everyday.  I feel that I can't deduct too many points from the store itself, because they do have capable employees and their manufacturer is probably more to blame for the missing glasses.

A large man or woman my feel uncomfortable in this section. \n\nAlso, while they do have the latest popcorn-movie hits, if you really, really, really want to see that (insert currently popular celebrity) movie that came out today, you'll have better luck finding it at a Blockbuster-like store.\n\nIt's also located on campus, this may be a plus for students, but it's a big con for us townies. Campus is full of students walking into traffic, beer and food trucks blocking lanes, one-way streets, long red lights, distracted drivers, expensive and limited parking, and parking enforcement officers who have had their hearts surgically removed and replaced with a black rock. Minimize this hassle by going when classes are in session or when the campus is closed (like spring and winter breaks); and bring quarters for the meters. Warning: the red meters are super-expensive and limited to 30 minutes!\n\nThere is no delivery option, and of course no instant-streaming option. The web site doesn't show info about a movie, merely that they have it or they don't. It also doesn't offer any social media options like personal profile pages, peer-reviews, or a \"que\" of movies I want to rent. \n\nBOTTOM LINE\nWhile it may be a bit inconvenient, it still has titles not available anywhere else, and it's very, very affordable.", "business_id": "I9iYkqmioN8MuWEB9wWxkg", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-03-30", "type": "review"}

A party of 8 or so, including a bunch of indecisive kids, sat down AFTER us, and were served before my sister and I... and no acknowledgement of the wait.

The waitresses looked super cute in their outfits and pinup style hair. I didn't get her name but one had beautiful black hair with the biggest victory rolls and it looks amazing. So at this point, I'm already pleased. The food probably could have been bad, and I would have still liked the place. \n\nWe were passed the drinks/sodas/shakes/malt menu and it was extensive. As a Scentsy rep, my friend was like....\"It's just like Scentsy, so many to choose from!\" I decided on a blackberry shake as I use to get them as a girl back home in Washington. It was YUMMY!  We both ordered the Pastrami Reuben for lunch on sourdough rather than rye and had the potato salad as a side. The potato salad was divine. Great flavor, consistency, and appeal. The sandwich was good too. Nothing super fabulous but a good standard Reuben.\n\nWe chatted, admired the stuff all over the walls, and strolled around the store afterwards looking at stuff. \n\nI throughly enjoyed my trip to MacAlpine's and will be going back with my daughter to try the dill pickle shake as she's obsessed with pickles!", "business_id": "R6aazv8FB-6BeanY3ag8kw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-05-12", "type": "review"}

But I would like to be more of a fan, and so I am here harping on the two problems I have with CC. One is the parking mentioned by other reviewers and the other is the bad service at the food court. I don't mean the samples handed out on almost every aisle and the hassle of the lines as stereotypical fat people line up like hippos at a rotten carcass to 'just try a sample'. I mean the little restaurant inside the store where the hippos line up to drown their peptides in sugar and grease. The food at any CC is outstanding fast food at an unbelievably good price. The pizza is fresh and really tasty and only 9.99 for a whole pie, the soft-serve yogurt is a huge portion in a plastic cup for 1.49. The hotdogs are terrific. Everything else is good and cheap too. There are no problems with the food quality and price. It's the service. The service is indifferent and inconsistent. Somedays it's ok to order pizza to be picked up later for a party, and somedays it is not ok and the workers will claim that it is not a service and never has been. Liars. Fat liars. I actually typed lairs by accident which works too. I'm done with this review due to boredom. I just can't stand it when a great business carelessly regresses to the mean. Brave the parking and the neutral service because when you need a good hotdog/pizza/frozen yogurt, it's a great spot.", "business_id": "XLqnjlLYt0_q_NG7l_BpMA", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-05-03", "type": "review"}

I am a nerdy, middle-aged mom who just wanted a fun bike to ride with my kid.  I don't know from mountain bikes or road bikes.  After calling all over town and looking on the internet, a friend told me about Slippery Pig and how nice and helpful they were.  I called and they had my dream bike in stock, and at more than $100 less than I'd been able to find on the 'net.\n\nWhen I went in to see the bike, the little store was packed with hard-core cycling enthusiasts, talking about races and the virtues of various bike parts I had never heard of.  The lone guy running the store was courteous and took his time with each customer.\n\nDid I mention I know nothing about bikes?  Sometimes I hate going into specialty shops because the \"experts\" there are just socially maladjusted snobs with their little corner of knowledge, and they lord that over you to assert their superiority.  I was a little nervous, because the Pig was definitely a \"real\" bike shop.  But when it was my turn for assistance, my man Eli was nothing but nice.  Maybe the nicest guy ever.\n\nEven though it was past closing, he took his time going over the bike, gave me a beverage, offered me a discount, told me about the three free tune-ups I get for the next year, and gave me 20% off all accessories (because you know you have to trick out the new bike).\n\nWhen I went back a week later to get my basket attached, again at closing time, he remembered my name and seemed genuinely interested in what I thought of my bike.  George attached my basket, and I agree with the previous reviewer: he's great, too.\n\nI went in again last night to get a flat fixed, and this latest experience prompted me to write this review.  Again, I rolled in minutes to closing, and they fixed my flat right away, staying until well after closing.  But while I waited, Eli offered me my choice of delicious microbrews (!) and I sipped a lovely Four Peaks Kiltlifter Scottish Ale while they fixed my flat and attached a new saddle!  Where does that happen anymore?\n\nFor context, I had taken my daughter's bike in to another LBS a year ago, and they took two days to fix the flat.  They were also nice guys, but two days to fix a flat?  (And no beer.  I think I am going to make free beer a prerequisite for service providers from now on.)\n\nThese guys are just the best, and reminded me why it is almost always worth it to seek out small, independent businesses.

I dropped off my newly purchased mountain bike (used) for a tuneup and check of a few problem item's (brakes/leaky fork). \n\nI had some less then stellar experiences with other local bike shops and these guys came highly recommended (plus its in a good location). \n\nI dropped the bike off on Saturday and told that they would be working on it Tuesday, cool with me. The guy who waited on me was super friendly and chatted about the bike for a bit, everything seemed great.\n\nTuesday came and went, Wednesday came and went. No biggie, I was expecting a call on what to do with the fork once they had some more information on it so I was surprised when I finally called on Thursday to check on my bike and was told it was done. I am not sure if it was just finished or it was finished days ago and had just been sitting there and no one called me - again not a huge deal, things are busy, things get missed.\n\nWhen I got there to pick up my bike there seemed to be some confusion on what was done. Apparently they didn't check the rear brake pads, so the guy (not the mechanic  who worked on it) put it up on the stand and checked them there. Pads were fine, one caliper was sticking, I checked the brake feel - just as bad as when I brought it in, basically I have to pull it to grip to get anything and apparently that is the best it can be adjusted? Ok.\n\nApparently no one had called Manitou about my leaky fork either, to his credit, this same guy got on the phone right away to try to get a hold of them. No answer of course, at this point I am glad I am not in a hurry. We came to the conclusion that I should just ride the fork till it dies - fine, gotcha.\n\nI am not feeling great about the experience but again, everyone seems cool and is friendly and I understand things happen sometimes. I figure at least it is tuned as much as it could be.....\n\nLater the next day I am riding it around (first ride). The rear brake is true now which is great, front brake still rubbing some, shifting ok - SLAM. Chain suck. Mis-shifting. Chain suck. Mis-shift.....ugh. I guess this is why people learn to do their own work.\n\nI am not sure exactly was done with my bike the 5 days it was there. I would like to give them the benefit of the doubt, I didn't buy my bike there so I didn't have a relationship established but I was trying to.\n\nI would like to give these guys another shot but it's hard since I feel like I got 1/4 of a tuneup. Some would argue this could easily be a 2 star review, some might say they deserve 4 because I am being too tough. I am pretty easy going and patient and the fact that I am still left with a bike that needs adjustment after dropping $70, I think 3 stars is fair.", "business_id": "42Ai9wcFPE2HZ_aADGXI9Q", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-04-19", "type": "review"}

No problem, they said have it ready in two days. Went in to pick up the bike and they said they were slammed and did not get to work on it. \n\nNo Problem. \nA week after that and it was not done. \nAnother 3 weeks after that and it was not done. \nAnother weeks goes by and its not done. \n\nHaving not received one phone call, I finally just go in and ask for the bike. \n\nI was told that they were waiting on some brake pads and a 28\" x 1 1/2\" tube which, they claimed were both extremely difficult to find. The brake pads perhaps, they were different, but the tube? I bought one the same day just around the corner. That was disappointing.\n\nNow, they did seem to do a good job overhauling the bike and they only charged me for part of the job since I took it before they could finish.\n\nYet, after 6 weeks of waiting, not receiving one phone call, and some condescending attitudes, I was ready to take my bike back and try another avenue. \n\nIt seems like a cool place, but this was really a bad experience. Two stars for their work, zero for service.\n\n[Edit]\n\nI meant to add this just after I wrote the entry. I had stated above that I understood it may be difficult to find the brake blocks needed for a rod actuated system. This was to give Slippery Pig the benefit of the doubt with regard to why they needed to keep my bike for 6 weeks (and who knows how long it would have taken to get it back had I not walked in there and demanded it back unfinished). \n\nWell, it took me the better part of half an hour to find a place that would ship the brake blocks to me within 3 days using the advanced technique of the Google search engine. \n\nNow, there are two excuses Slippery Pig could use in their defense, they just didn't care, or they are incompetent.

The first time I came in, I was quoted a certain price to take parts off my old bike and transfer them all to my new bike. Obviously the quote didn't include if parts didn't fit or if I needed new parts. I had called originally and was quoted a price to do this. When I came into the shop, Eric told me that he wasn't going to do it for that price and it didn't matter what his employees quoted me over the phone. He wasn't willing to help at all and his quote was almost double what I was told over the phone. \n\nThe second time I came into this shop was because I needed my fox rear shop sent in for warranty work. I gave him the shock and it was sent in to fox. I was told there would be a 10 day turn around to get it fixed and back at the shop ready for pickup. Fox called the shop and told them my shock was no longer available. I was originally told that it would cost $100 to get it fixed with the warranty through fox. After fox called the shop and told them they didn't have my shock any more, the price went up to $160. I was ok with that considering what a new one costs retail. For some reason when fox called the store, they didn't call fox back and tell them it was ok to fix it and send it to them at them price. One of the employees of the pig even admitted they dropped the ball and would call fox right away and get this resolved. It took 4 weeks from when I dropped the shock off until it got back to the bike shop. When I went in to pick up the shock and pay for it, it now cost $195. Eric again was not willing to help. He told me, \" I'm not going to lose money on this.\" I asked if there was anything he would do for his employees dropping the ball and not returning calls and making this whole process takes weeks longer. He said he would be more than happy to show me the invoice for the shock from fox but that he wasn't going to discount it at all and again told me that he wasn't going to lose money. Needless to say, I will never be going back to this shop again. I have never been talked to or treated this way by the owner of the company and have never had it happen twice and those two times being the only two times I have ever been in his shop.

I told them I absolutely needed to have the tires within a certain, ample timeframe because we would be leaving town. They said it would not be a problem. I even made that timeframe conservative. When I contacted them a couple days after the deadline, they still did not have the tires. We needed the tires, so we decided to go way out of our way to pick them up when my mother would be visiting the following week and we would have a rental car. \n\nWhen we showed up to get them, it turns out they had ordered the wrong tire for my wife's bike. They got the Flak Jacket instead! We were in a bind though because we were out of time and her tire was in serious need of changing, so we had to take it. This tire may be legit for commuting around town, but our field testing has shown it to be pretty useless for touring. A thousand miles later and we have gotten several flats on this one, but none on the remaining Armadillo that has over 4,000 miles on it. We do not buy expensive wheels that are difficult to remove just to have to change flats all the time anyway. \n\nThe employees were friendly and the shop had the vibe of a good place, but this error has had a major impact on our trip.

I self-diagnosed myself with either a brain tumor or an ear infection. I looked up the closest Take Care Clinic, and took a drive down to Central and Osborn.\n\nThe clinic is in the far back corner, near the pharmacy. When you get back there, you have to check in using one of three computers, it is fast and easy. Next, you need to pick up a clipboard and fill out your info, much like you would at a doctor's office. I did my part, and then went and waited. There is not much of a waiting area, it kind of blends into the pharmacy waiting area.\n\nAfter about an hour, the Nurse Practitioner, Tina, called me back. They have a private exam room, fully equipped, exactly like your doctor's office. Tina was VERY kind and warm, and took her time asking lots of questions. If you are unfamiliar with Nurse Practitioners, allow me to tell you how much they rock. To become a NP, you must have years of nursing experience, including critical care, ER, etc. After years of experience and education, then one may attend college to earn a NP masters degree. One of the best things about NPs is that they take a holistic approach to patient care. For example, I have a primary care physician, who really, really sucks. When I have an appointment, she LITERALLY brings in a digital timer set for five minutes- and then starts talking. It was amazing to see her press the timer button prior to asking why I was there.\n\nAt Take Care, the NP didn't just check my ears, she did a comprehensive exam, full vitals, etc. Luckily nothing else was going on with me, but I am confident that other issues would have been discovered by Tina.My diagnosis was correct, ear infection, not tumor- which was nice.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend this location, and Tina, as a health care provider. I am seriously going to just stick with that as my primary care, and skip the egg timer doctor who only likes to write scripts for things, not deal with the source of problems.\n\nSome people have noted that the area is sketchy, and with all due respect, that is silly. This is in a populated area, it is safe. Are there people of all walks there? Sure. Is it safe, absolutely. \n\nMy only recommendation would be that Take Care hire a medical tech to assist with checking people, helping turn around the exam room, etc. As a tip, it can get busy, so get there very early.

I am ashamed to say that I got my appointment time confused and was 25 minutes late, but luckily he was still able to accomdate me, and was very forgiving.  Lilly fit me in and did a beautiful job shaping my eyebrows.  I left there feeling great!  I love my hair cut, and the color is absolutely perfect!  My eyebrows look amazing!  Next appointment is already booked.  The wonderful thing about this salon is that I can get a mini facial while my hair is processing!  I can't wait to go back!  Thanks so much everyone!", "business_id": "1iP6SyuWpm_4E6Mx6zOS9A", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-03-04", "type": "review"}

I bitched and moaned after calling Sunday and Monday (yesterday) only to not reach ANYONE. Come to find out, they are closed both days and I somehow neglected to see that when I looked up their hours online. Yes, I am an airhead. I do think it is annoying that their voicemail directs you to their website for hours, though. Anyways, one of the girls actually responded to my voicemail and called me back today to schedule an appt. Seriously? Someone actually called back? Major kudos in my book and then they were able to take me in this afternoon/evening which made me very happy. I was almost 15 minutes late to my appt because the address on my gift certificate was their old location so be aware that they are at Central and south of Virginia, NOT closer to Indian School. The girl working on my hair was Miranda. I opted for the shampoo, cut, and style ($60). If I recall correctly, they do a scalp massage with every haircut and Miranda also gave me a hand massage but I don't remember if that is also with the cut or part of the shampoo. I had Miranda trim my hair, clean up my layers and blow-dry my hair straight (I have curly hair). My hair looks amazing and is silky soft. Yes, I could be in a hair commercial right now with my hair bouncing around my face. I thought Miranda was great and we had good conversation. I thought, whoah she could actually be my friend! She must have wooed me with her stylist charms. No, but seriously, this place was very chill, employees seemed happy to work there and very welcoming of the customers. I guess $60 may seem expensive to some but I felt like you got alot for it. I couldn't do this every month but could be persuaded to visit IDE Mania every 3 months. That seems more reasonable right???? What was cool, too, was that they let me use the remaining $5 on the gift certificate towards Miranda's tip so I gave the rest in cash. The parking situation could be a little awkward but I didn't have any issues. I haven't really been to any other salons (for hair) but as far as I'm concerned, I don't need to.

Since moving back to Phoenix, I tend to get movies from the Burton Barr branch of the Phoenix Public Library downtown. I know it's a public library, but it actually has an awesome and extensive collection of foreign films and just about a every title from the Criterion Collection you can feast your cineaste eyeballs on. \n\nAnyway, I was browsing the foreign section and was pretty impressed. It wasn't the usual, pitiful selection most rental places usually have that pretty much is made up of The Seventh Seal, Seven Samurai, maybe a French title, and an overload of pre-Loaded Weapon 4 Jet Li martial arts films. No, sir. While it's not as big as the stock at the downtown library, it's still pretty good and they have alot of recent films.\n\nWhat sold me was when I was wandering around the store. I came across something that I normally haven't found in any video store: Russ Meyer films. If you have never seen \"Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!\", I suggest you scrap any plans you have tonight, break up with your significant other if necessary, go here, and rent it immediately. Buying a copy of a Russ Meyer films is ludicrous process that is both arduous and expensive, but you can just go in here and rent them.\n\nAlong with that, you can find just about any cult film you're looking for and probably find titles you've never heard of or seen, like I did. There's literally a whole wall that's just labeled \"CULT FILMS\". I dropped in here last night for the first time and rented a copy of Russ Meyer's \"Vixen\" and a title that I had seen in Amoeba but never watched called \"A Boy and His Dog\". It's a film about Don Johnson (yes, of Miami Vice) surviving in a post-apocalyptic world with his telepathic dog and fighting off a cult of underground humans led by Jason Robards in clown, drag make-up. Need I say more?\n\nIf you're looking for a hard-to-find title, or even a popular one, drop in here and keep this place alive. When you have an itch for a film right away that can't wait for Netflix, as I do on regular occasions, this spot will be sure to please.\n\nIf you have any taste in film, I repeat....

The right size, knowledgeable and friendly staff, and pretty much what you would want in a place. This place makes the local spot here look amateurish. \n\nThe pros:\n\n1.  Extremely well organized store. Definitely had everything for which I was looking. They have a section for new releases and then the older versions are stocked in order. Easy to find something if you're looking for an older issue.\n\n2.  Good variant selection. I think these guys have some good hook-ups in the industry. Nice selection of collectable items as well (statues, busts, etc.).\n\n3.  Very friendly staff that would tell you a little about the issue your buying or potential changes. I dig when they actually talk to you about something rather than just ring you up and send you out.\n\n4.  Plenty of parking, mainly behind the building. If you park on the Central Ave. side you'll have to back out into the raid. Could be precarious.\n\nThe cons:\n\n1.  I'm a fan of variants but it seemed like these guys marked them up a lot more than other places. Maybe they've got access to some real rare issues but I definitely won't pay $30 for a new #1 of the Ultron release. It's a great arc but still too pricey.\n\nPhoenix seems to have a great selection of comic book stores, why can't Atlanta follow suit. Hmmm?

I loved looking through adventures I hadn't seen in years, and looking at some comics I remember my children used to read . . . they may still do so, but they keep them hidden from mother! \n\nOne of my initial thoughts was that the Giroux's must have at least one of every variety, and every character, and every subject ever memorialized in graphic art. \n\nBut wait, the one thing I couldn't find, and the one thing that I would have bought on the spot was a Clayton Moore, the Real Lone Ranger, comic book. Where were they? I asked; figuring that I couldn't possibly look through every thing. The clerk said, yes he thought they had some . . . and he disappeared in a back room behind a door . . . and was gone for 5-10 minutes. I wondered if this old building had a dungeon archive like many old museums do. Eventually he showed up again and said that apparently they didn't have any right now. He said I should check back and he gave me a card so I could call and inquire. PHOOEY! SMASH! BAM! I'm going back in and ask so I can wallow in more childhood memories.

While I was driving into Phoenix from Los Angeles,I realized we had left a posing stool. We called ahead to your store and inquired if you had one. We were told yes. We then set a course to come to your store immediately.  Unfortunately, coming from CA we didn't realize you we're 1 hour aead of us.  We called once the realization hit. We had 75 minutes to travel 60 miles.  We made every effort to arrive by 6:00, as we were told rather rudely, that the store was closing at 6 sharp.  At 5:55, from about 4 blocks away, we called again and asked if they could ready our purchase, that we would run in and buy. We were told NO, that we better arrive before 6, that \"You have 4 minutes\".  I cannot begin to express the frustration and anger that your store couldn't accommodate a simple request, and was completely unsympathetic to the fact that we were driving straight from LA to you.  In fact, I arrived at 6:00 on the dot, as Randy I believe was locking the door.  He could have cared less. While part of me says, \"the people who run this store don't care about anything, why write this email\", as a business owner and potential customer, you deserve to know why I will make it my personal mission on every review site, website etc to let other potential customers know, just how much you value our business.\n\nI have never been treated like that by any company or vendor, and as a fellow business owner, I'm appalled by the blatant attitude and disrespect.

Its been some time since my review was posted, for this store, and things have changed.  My previous review noted Fantasia and Northern Winds - however, the two stores are now combined, however the great vibe and atmosphere has NOT changed.\n\nWhats new?  Where Northern Winds was located is now a learning and gathering room, where classes and presentations are regularly offered.  If you are interested, they have a printout of upcoming events at the front counter.\n\nThey have an awesome supply of essential oils, many made by the folks at the store.  A great variety of herbs and such.  A wide variety of \"tools\" for a variety of faiths or paths - ranging from scrying bowls, to athames, pendulums, altar cloths, statues, etc, etc!\n\nThere is a good sampling of books, with a great selection of books devoted to the pagan/wiccan crowd and also to the heathen/Asatru community.  BUT, if what you arent looking for isnt there, they can generally get it in for you!\n\nIf your needs are jewelery, pendants, etc.  There is a nice selection of those too!\n\nThere is always someone on the calendar to do readings, etc.  So call ahead to make reservations.\n\nOh, and the crystals and stones.  This is a great place to get \"stoned\" at a reasonable price!  If its small little stones or larger crystals or points or even a bit of orgonite - its here!\n\nThe cherry on top is the great staff.  Very friendly, very knowledgeable, and very willing to assist you.  I go here OFTEN and every time I pop in the vibe is positive and the smiles abound.  I love this place and cannot say enough about the store and folks who make it all happen.  \n\nIf you havent been in, make a point of stopping in and checking it out.", "business_id": "SI3pSSDeGcuY2PyJ0BII5A", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-05-24", "type": "review"}

He suggested I take time off during a work day to come and meet with the glass rep. on Friday.

Conveniently located on Camelback Road, however, it's at the end of large complex and could be easy to miss. Plenty of parking available in a lot behind the building.\n\n2.  A nice selection of comics, specifically current ones. I was also impressed by the staff recommendations rack to let you know what the employees are reading and if they like it. As for the staff, very friendly and they discuss issue you buy, etc. Imagine that, great customer service. On major impression was one of the employees went out of her way to look for a comic that was out of print there (Batman Incorporated #8, a major seller). She called a number of other places, even competitors. Shows that there's good camaraderie with other stores. They had a good number of variants and a few collectible figures. Their focus is definitely on comics and games. I definitely dig the idea of comic packs to help a new collector catch up on a series. I was tickled by the DC casualties section as well. \n\n3.  A major plus! They sponsor games at this spot, mainly the card based variety. This was very cool and fosters the culture associated with comics. I was really impressed with how friendly everyone was as well, whether you're a pro or a newcomer.\n\nThe cons:\n\n1.  This is a relatively small place, so don't expect a monster selection. Not much in terms of figurines, but I did see some items that peaked my interest. However, they had a fantastic selection of comics from other publishers.

He provided an adjustment to level it out. Also, he adjusted the bike to my height and advised me the proper body posture to have when riding. :-) He threw me some stem caps and a Sun Cyclery shirt and sent me on my way better than before.

There was no run-around and I felt comfortable spending my money here. While waiting for the replacement, I perused the shop and found their prices fantastic and even more fabulous options. From pedals to baskets to chain colors; I can see myself upgrading my fixie with just about everything in this place.\nZane was friendly, quick and offered advice to help maintain the life of my tires and bike itself. No longer will I waste my money in Tempe, Sun Cyclery has garnered a customer for life. Thanks boys!

I'll find something to make and some way to sport it if it kills me.  \n\nWhat I DO know though (well, now I know, anyway) is that it's not superduper smart to go to SAS without an honest to god pattern that you're ready to cut and sew in your hand.  There are just too many luxurious fabrics in beautiful prints and colors to play with, every aisle you walk down.  Sure, there's some junky stuff, but whatevs, just keep going and before you know it you're fingering the prettiest, shiniest, brightest silk or brocade or taffeta that you've ever seen, and you're imagining the ballgown that you'll make out of it.  Hey, one never knows when one will need a ballgown, so get off my nuts!  And just in case you do, there's plenty tiaras and whatnot to complete the look.\n\nThey do carry lots of notions, some too many and some not enough. There are BINS of loose buttons, if you care to sort through and find all the matching buttons you need.   I don't think I saw a really great selection of laces and ribbons and other trims though.  The thread is super cheap, but the color selection is a little thin and I'm not sure if it's any good (most of them had \"family dollar\" stamped on them, and at .20 a pop, who knows).  Needle selection is next to nil, and the ones that they did supposedly have were almost all sold out.  Other helpers, like fusible bonding and stuff are probably pricier than you'd pay somewhere else.  And of course, there are no patterns at all.  Long story short, go to Joann or something for your patterns, SAS for the fabric, and then back to Joann for your notions.  \n\nAnd DON'T BUY THE GREEN FAUX MINK FUR, unless you plan on checking with me every time you leave the house in it, lest we see each other out.

I am going to hit this review with two views: 1) briefly as a buyer/shopper ... and 2) a seller. \n\n1) BUYER:\nI am a thrift store-obsessed shopper. I don't really consider BE much of a thrift store though. The prices are a little outrageous for the items. If you know your labels - often times they will sell certain brands close to what they cost in the actual store. For the most part, I like their jeans and jewelry. The jewelry is some of the best one-of-a-kind stuff I have seen, and I think people overlook it! I do like browsing occasionally if I am in the area, and found that the Tempe location has more of the funky items I dig. \n\n*******Keep this in mind when you are shopping: these are clothes people didn't want anymore - USUALLY FOR A REASON. The zipper doesn't stay up on the jeans, the button on the back of the dress is a little tight, the shoes are a little uncomfortable in one place, itchy tag, etc. - just be weary of this when you are trying things on! \n\n2) SELLER:\nI just looked at the BE website, and its weird they don't have anything listed on what % they give for trade/ cash. But from what I remember, you get 50% back in trade (store credit) for what they are selling for the item, OR 35% in cash back. Trade is good if you like shopping there, but I usually get the CASH!! The average item sold is about $15, so you would get $7.50 in trade or $5 in cash. Don't quote me on that - I'm not exactly sure! \n\n I admit, selling clothes at BE makes me feel a bit judged, a bit exposed. These clothes (that I don't usually wear anyway) are somewhat a reflection of my style - or what my style was years ago ... which does leave me feeling a bit vulnerable. About a week ago, I went in there with a box of stuff that I was sure they would take - blue jeans and shoes. They took all but a pair of jeans that had been a bit worn at the bottom and a pair of grey retro Saucony's ... is that brand not cool anymore? Who knew? Anyhoo, I walked away with my $75 bucks and felt pretty good. Anyway, while I sat there waiting for about 30 minutes watching the disgruntled sellers in front of me leave with their bags of clothes and maybe $5 of trade in their pockets, I decided to write this to help people decide what to bring to BE and what to donate to their little sister/brother or Salvation Army:\n\n- Jeans: they will always buy jeans no matter the season. They don't need to be extremely designer labeled - they will take levi's, mossimo (target), refuge (charlotte russe) all the way up to true religion and AG adriano goldshmied jeans (my favorite) ... if they are a good color/cut. Above-the-waist jeans offering a raindrop ass need not apply. Capri's are questionable...\n \n- Sandals: This is Arizona, we wear sandals year-round. Even if we shouldn't. You always know that ASU idiot wearing a pair of rainbows while it's raining - because they are quite possibly the only shoes they own! BE will always take sandals, they just don't want them to have the footy prints left in them. \n\n- Dresses: Never seem to be turned down when I bring these in. Don't usually get much money for them though. \n\nWhat NOT to bring & attempt to sell:\n\n- Small sizes/clothes that shrunk: I guess I am lucky that I am a tall, well-proportioned person since they usually take my clothes based on the \"average\" size of them. Don't bring that size 2 or 4 denim skirt you don't fit into, since no one else can fit into it either! \n\n- Jackets/Sweaters: They seem to take some in the early fall, but never like to stock up much on jackets - this is a \"duh\" for AZ! I've noticed they will take blazers over jackets though!\n\n- Worn Clothes vs. \"Gently Used\": Worn out clothes belong at the thrift store. Gently used clothes (i.e. you bought this at a Banana Republic killer sale but you NEVER wore it... or wore it once and the tag was super itchy*... \n\n You need to understand that each of these young hipster buyers have sales sheets, where the company tracks how well their selected items sell. If they buy back too much, they get spanked or something. Also, to the two 18 year-old girls that brought 2 trash bags full of Abercrombie and Hollister clothes from your preteen years... thank you for wasting their time and all of us that had to painfully watch them sort through your junk.", "business_id": "JmEp4DxBEIrFD-rgbL8bvQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-03-10", "type": "review"}

I have no complaints what so ever with that part of my visit. \n\nThe problems began after that. The woman who helped me  (she also picked out my gorgeous eyewear) on the day of my appointment advised that my insurance did not cover the \"professional component\" of my contact lens fitting. I was being charged $125 for that. The eyeglass exam was covered with a $10 copay. This seemed excessive. Really excessive. I asked this woman \"Doesn't my insurance cover both contacts and eyeglasses\"? She stated \"No\". \"One or the other AND that my eyeglass benefit was BETTER than the contact lens benefit\". In this moment, I knew something was wrong. I offered to check the benefit myself, but she insisted \"No, I can do that\".

That's right folks, I have a benefit for eyewear AND contacts. So, when I go to pick up my stuff, I ask to speak to someone about this.\n\nKarina very loudly doubted this, interrupted me and spoke over me, rolled her eyes  and then called my carrier for all to hear. Not at all discrete.  She then returns and confirms what I already knew and says \"Typically, no one has coverage for both....\" I do not know, for the life of me, why she was even arguing with me to begin with.  I am the customer and I was not irate. But I was put off by her behavior and it was written all over my face...which donned a perfect pair of glasses. \n\nThe biggest issue is that I asked the question initially and I was lied to. How could you know which benefit was better if you didn't bother to check.  Clearly, it would have been better to be ethical. Instead she opted to lie and then OVER CHARGE me. \n\nI believe that I got a good exam from the Dr.  I believe that he can charge whatever he wants for his services.

It's also unfair to review this on what it will be - since it isn't that yet. \n\nToday, it's a mall I rarely visit. Apart from a few stores I would visit out of convenience or necessity, there's not much to offer compared to what it used to have. The fantastic movie theater, Jutenhoops, Alpine Ski Keller, Bear Cover, and even Ed Debevics are all long gone... oops, there I go bringing up the past. Seriously though, these were painful to lose - one by one.\n\nSo today, there's a Linens 'n' Things which is hardly unique, and a Trader Joe's which is nice to have in the area, and also a Sister's Attic and Closet upscale thrift stores which add a bit of much-needed flavor. The Chili's, the Bookstar, and Black Angus are still around. So is the jewelry store that has never really offered a compelling reason to enter. They've wedged an LA Fitness here and they've also added a Blimpie and an Arby's... all very healthy choices. \n\nBesides all of the generic shops and eateries and standard offerings, there's still a few unique experiences - though nothing like it used to... shit, there I go again. Anyway, so there's a few places that aren't screaming \"standard mall\" such as Pita Grill, a pipe and tobacco shoppe (you have to spell it that way in this case), a place to get eyewear, and some other small and uninteresting businesses. \n\nIn that sense, I suppose this is has become a decent and convenient neighborhood strip mall. This is a shame really since it's lacking most of the key elements that made it really special. It's still a beautiful outdoor mall and the architecture alone makes it a unique alternative to the cookie-cutter malls that strategically litter the landscape of America. \n\nI'm worried about what they'll do to the architecture when they renovate this place someday, but I think the fact that this mall isn't terribly interesting anymore in general means it won't be so terribly missed when they lose that last remaining bit of \"special.\"", "business_id": "qPfX87VuYeBMgM2B0Zr1hQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-04-27", "type": "review"}

Next visit was for root retouch to keep the highlights for another season, this time was different.  I got a different person, because my previous girl had quit.  The lady was friendly and had a touching story, but her highlights were heavier than I'd asked for, and now they're sort of ghetto looking, to the point where I dont want to flat iron my wavy hair in fright that they are going to look like streamers hanging from the top of my head.  Ugh.  Im going to wear them as best as I can for now and then cover them up with dark color, done at a different salon for sure, then take another 5 years to regrow my hair sans any artificial hair color.  Also I was quoted $120 and walked out pissed that I dished out $170 for some linguini highlights when I asked for angel hair or thinner accents.  \nOne plus...I took my younger 14 year old sister with me, and I figured she should take her DS or a book to entertain herself while I was being done up.  They had an Exuviance brand facial session that was free so I signer her up against her will, the poor soul, but she ended up spending the two hours with the ladies, and walked out with a series of freebies and about $65 in product purchases, and a glowy face!

You can find good jeans there marked down to half or a third of the original price but the challenge is always finding the right size. \n\nMy advice is to pass through Last Chance first, then, if you don't have any look finding what you're looking for, stop by Marshall's before heading to Dillard's or Nordstrom for the real deal.", "business_id": "5A_vuyESZFU9eCArpVfJCw", "stars": 3, "date": "2007-03-23", "type": "review"}

I like what they stand for, I like their products and I like their customer service. For these reasons, when I recently bought a condo and I was in need of a washer, dryer, refrigerator and television, the first place I looked was Best Buy. However, I picked the wrong Best Buy to make my purchase. \n\nThis review is not about ALL Best Buys. This is about the Best Buy on 20th and Camelback. \n\nLike I said, I purchased a washer, dryer and television and the Geek Squad mounting from this Best Buy. \n\nThe washer, dryer and TV were to be delivered on a Saturday morning by 10:30 a.m.  I received the call on Friday confirming my delivery. On Saturday at 10 a.m. the delivery truck arrived, but there was one MAIN problem. They only had the dryer. Where were my TV and washer? Good question. Well, the washer was on a truck that apparently \"broke down\" while coming from California. Best Buy didn't bother calling me to tell me that my washer wouldn't be delivered. The television was a whole other story. The sales associate apparently filled out the form incorrectly, and so the order was cancelled. Was I called about either of these issues? No. It wasn't until I talked to the delivery company and 3 different people at Best Buy to \"resolve\" the problem. At this point it was too late to have my items delivered on Saturday and because I work, I had to wait another week to have them delivered.\n\nBut, this saga isn't over yet. When they messed up my order, they PROMISED me I would have my washer and television delivered by 10:30 a.m. the following Saturday since they messed up my order. I had to be somewhere at 11 so it was impertinent it was delivered before then. They said, not a problem and promised it would be there. \nI called the Geek Squad on Thursday to confirm that my TV would be installed and delivered Saturday. They confirmed that the Geek Squad would arrive WITH the TV and install it. \n\nI then got a call from the delivery truck about my washing machine (remember, they promised it would be there by 10:30 am.) They told me the washer would be delivered between 1-3 pm. I had to argue for a half an hour with the manager before he  final \"pulled strings\" to \"accommodate\" my original delivery request. \nBut...it's not over yet. \n\nThe second Saturday morning arrives. The washer gets there. Check that off the list. Then, the Geek Squad arrives to install my TV. Remember, they PROMISED me they'd arrive with the TV. Guess what. They didn't. The poor guys had no idea they were supposed to pick up the TV. In fact, I learned that they aren't even allowed to pick up deliveries from this store. So, my installation guys are there and the TV is missing yet again. They did me a HUGE favor and actually drove across town to this store to pick up the TV (shocking fact; these guys don't work at the store on Camelback. They work at the one on Frank Lloyd Wright). So, they go all the way to the Camelback location to pick up my TV....which they learn was about to be shipped to Texas for some random reason. If they hadn't picked up my TV, I'm sure I'd still be missing it today. Was I ever called by Best Buy with an apology? No. \n\nI don't think I need to explain further why I would never shop at this Best Buy again. I bought my refrigerator from the Best Buy on Shea and it went off without a hitch. \n\nSo my Yelp friends, if you want a seamless experience with your pricey purchases of major appliances, I would suggest you shop anywhere but the Best Buy on Camelback and 20th. Not only did they mess up my order on multiple levels, the sales associate staff was rude on top of it. \n\nThis is not the experience you want when you are making a large financial commitment.", "business_id": "kEqcAtMaC6hcY8Wbi1nxtA", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-03-11", "type": "review"}

He confirmed with someone/or something in the back on the appropriate ink cartridge to pick up. Together we cheerfully tried to figure out what I really needed. (One Amazon purchase later I realized I was in dire need of an add'l black toner. This is no bueno at 2:31am.) \n\nBrilliantly I had failed to come to the store with critical details. We walked around to the printer aisle and looked at a current model. Irving (artfully) opened the printer and I finally remembered what I needed. (Maybe having a beer at Whole Foods before hand didn't help. Feel free to judge. Even better, try the Four Peaks Oatmeal Stout.)\n\nWith such an easy shopping experience, I said yes to \"Would you like to see anything else in the store?\".

Ive lived by this Best Buy for 7 years now and have frequented it like any other normal person that goes to Best Buy. I've always had good experiences with this store. Today was the best by far! \n\nI purchased an Open Box Item (Pioneer Deck for my truck)  off of their website and it was listed in Excellent Condition with all parts. When I opened the box it was just the deck and wiring harness but the harness was missing wires and the deck was in pretty rough shape. I was incredibly disappointed and went into this Best Buy to try and exchange it for the NIB model that they had but found out that the one that I purchased was actually no longer being sold by Best Buy anymore and they had upgraded to the most recent model. \n\nWhen I walked in I went to the customer service desk and was helped by an incredibly nice woman that said sorry she couldn't help me with discounting the comparable but brand new model that they were selling now but did offer to give me store credit to use to purchase a different model and pay the difference. I originally bought the \"open item\" because it was listed as excellent condition and with all parts. The price difference of the open box and the new in box was $15 so I though I was making a score of a deal on a great deck. By the time it was shipped and to my door the sale they had on my new in box model was over and it was sold out across the US so I lost out on the great pricing and was stuck with this damaged deck. The woman at the counter pointed me to the Manager (Davey) and said maybe he could help me more than she could. Davey was incredibly friendly and understanding of the deck situation and after explaining my situation he went into the back personally and grabbed the comparable, new in box model and did an even exchange on the deck. He apologized for something in that condition being mailed out and told me to have a good night. \n\nI walked out of there with a huge smile on my face and really was very happy with how he and the customer service rep handled everything. I know they see people all day trying to return items or ask for ridiculous exchanges but I truly felt helped and taken care of in this situation with absolutely no negativity from their end. \n\nThis is a great Best Buy location and Davey really treated the customer right.

In January 2015, I went to trade in my iPhone 5S for a 6 at this location. After carefully looking over the salesperson said that there was a tiny dent (that I couldn't see even after he pointed it out to me) and because of that, my phone was worthless.\nThose were his actual words. My phone was worthless. I wound up taking my phone to a different Best Buy location a week later. I even pointed out the area that the dent was supposedly in. The sales person showed another sales person, then a manager who all agreed nothing was there and offered me full price trade in towards an iPhone 6.\n\n2. On the above mentioned iPhone 6 that I got, I purchased the Geek Squad warranty for $10.99 a month instead of purchasing the warranty through AT&T or Apple Care. I'm one of those guys that always buys an extended warranty (except on stupid things like software/DVDs). The warranty plan I chose covers broken screen, lost/stolen phones, water damage etc. Well, I cracked my screen fir the first time ever and brought my phone in. I was told I would have to send my phone in and they would mail me a replacement which would take up to 7 days without a phone, or I could pay and have my credit card on file and have them ship me a phone first then I would return my phone. I opted for that option. I was then asked if I knew about their service fee. I said no and was told that I have to pay my deductible which was $149. He then corrected himself and said it wasn't $149, but $199. I asked why it was more expensive to get my phone screen replaced there WITH my warranty than to go ANYWHERE else. He said he didn't know that was there policy. I asked him something else which prompted him to look at his screen and he apologized and told me he was once again wrong and that it would be $249. He asked if I wanted to do it. I told him no because its ridiculously overpriced and gets more expensive everytime he opens his mouth. \n\nSo finally fed up with other issues I was experiencing with my phone, I took it to the Apple Store. I showed up for my appointment they did a few tests and wound up restoring my phone and told me to take it home and try it out for a few days. I asked what I would do if the problems persist and was told to bring it back and they will swap it out. I asked about the screen, They told me they could replace it for $109 there in store in under 30 min, but to wait to see if they need to swap it out first. I asked about the deductible and was told there is no deductible since its still under warranty.\n\nI love Apple. They've always treated me right. \nAs for Best Buy, I would probably never go back.

I priced it at the Denmarket and then checked online.  I had spoken with the manager Mary at the time of my pricing.  I looked online and found it cheaper through an online competitor.  Due to the economy I figured I would give Copenhagen the opportunity to compete.

The bed turned out perfectly.  There was only one small glitch and that was they delivery staff forgot to leave the assembly directions for the bed as it is a platform bed and a bit different to put together.

Including him, there were 4 or 5 employees and each was helping other customers.  So I started walking around, looking at the merchandise.  Not such a great selection, and not such great prices, but better than Sports Chalet (selection, not price).  \n\nLo and behold, I found the same running shoe I had been wearing previously and was already very happy with.

But I had to stand around and wait for someone to help me.  And wait.  And wait.  All of the employees were feigning actually helping customers but were really shooting the shit about topics as far ranging as personal style and Bartlesville, OK.  After patiently standing around for 20 minutes (but quietly staring daggers at the employees), at least 4 other customers entered the store after me.  One of them, as an employee was finally ringing a customer up, ran over to him and asked for help, and he of course started to fit her.  Several of us were angered by the blatant attempt to jump ahead and we all made our anger very well known.  Wouldn't you know it, I finally got someone to fetch me my sized 10.5 Asics out of the back and ring me up.\n\nSo to reiterate - good store, decent selection, ok prices, and if you are a newb that needs that personal attention for a true fitting then you'll get it here.

I was still a month away from renewing my contract and desperate. As it turned out, I could change my contact, get a new phone that was priced into my monthly fee, and lose my unlimited data, all in one step. Who could resist? Oh, Verizon. \n\nAfter arriving shortly after they opened, I waited for an associate while checking out their selection of toys. I mean phones. Found an awesome Motorola that is smaller than my old one and it is red. Devilish. By the time Juan approached me to assist, I had my heart set on that phone. Juan was great at processing the sale and setting up my new purchase. The whole ordeal took about an hour, which seems long but he was very thorough. So, not entirely bad. By the time I left, I was happy. And Juan downloaded an app that got me a free smoothie from Jamba Juice. Score!

I have been here four times over all so I am just going to go ahead and cover each encounter.\n\nMy first time here was actually a really great experience! I had never consigned before and the girl looking over my items was so helpful. She only took a few items but she explained why she could not take some of my items in a very polite manner.\n\nMy second time here was the complete opposite experience of my first. I brought in my prom dresses and the girl really loved one of my dresses but there was make up on it so she could not take it. Which was fine I wouldn't want to buy something that had make up from a previous owner on it! However, my other dress was not the girl's taste and she made that very clear. She went over it extensively trying to find one thing wrong so she did not have to take it. She found nothing so she accepted it but told me it probably would not sell. I was so offended by this because I WORE this dress to my prom and she made me feel like it was the ugliest dress she had ever seen. (Side note: the dress sold within a couple of weeks, if that!!) \n\nMy third time here was another poor experience. I wanted to cash out my account and the girls working acted like my presence was bothering them. They barely spoke to me and were much more concerned about talking to each other instead of helping me. \n\nToday when I went in to consign more items the girl was so nice and helpful just like the first girl I had encountered at this store. She ended up taking all of my items, but I overheard her deal with another customer and she was very polite when declining some of their items.\n\nOverall, I think this place is hit or miss as far as attitudes of employees go!

I would recommend customers take their business elsewhere -go to someplace like REI wheee they actually value the customer. Here is my story: went into the shop and purchased a fairly expensive pair of ski pants $340. Drove with my family to Flagstaff and when I put the pants on the next morning I noticed that there were some loose strings hanging from the side seam. I photographed the hanging strings .I Carefully saved the receipt and the bag and the tag and used the pants for several hours of skiing. When I returned to Phoenix I attempted to have the pants exchanged for a non defective pair because by this time the stitching was coming out quite significantly along the seam after only a few hours of use. I Explained that I wanted to exchange them so that I could enjoy the remainder of the ski season. The manager told me quite unsympathetically NO the store would not be financially out for the cost of the pants so they would have to be returned to the manufacturer and the manufacturer would have to attempt to repair the defective pair of pants. Manager would not even offered to give me a pair of ski rental pants to use until these were  repaired as he explained it to me the store would lose money !!!! He assured me  that I would be called and notified when they would be ready by the weekend so I could go skiing agin. No return call to me was ever made I made follow-up calls and had to leave a message for a manager and never received a follow-up telephone call back.  I have since purchased another pair of ski pants from REI where I  know that if there is any problem with them they would happily exchange them or give me a refund or store credit. it has now been several weeks and I still have not heard back from ski pro. Unbelievably this business sold me a $340 pair of ski pants which were defective and refused to do the right thing and forced me to go out elsewhere to another business to purchase another pair of ski pants so that I can enjoy the remainder of the ski season.

Sad to say, they no longer have the LV here, but my experience there was second to none. I was so happy with my purchase and with the lady to helped my first purchase such an exciting one, I wish I remembered her name. And I wish LV didn't have to go! That same day I also went into Gucci to look at wallets and to my surprise, they had some items on sale (this was on Black Friday). The lady who helped me was so nice. She brought out tons of wallets for me that she thought matched my style and she was right, I was feeling all of them! Lucky for me, I fell in love with one they had on sale! They only had 2 left and I was hesitant to go for it on the same day as my LV purchase so I took awhile to decide. They didn't rush me at all. They let me hold it and look at it as long as I wanted. I would say it was because of their great service that I was convinced to get it. And am so glad I did!  \n\nI have also made a purchase at the Chanel store there and that one was not as great as my other experience. I'm not sure if it was because I had my dog with me that I felt a little unwelcome there but the sales associate seemed a little uninterested in helping me find what I was looking for, especially because I didn't really know what I wanted. I went from looking at earrings to card holders to keychains and back to earrings and she seemed a little annoyed and kept asking me if I have decided what I want and that was a little irritating because it was a big deal to me - my first Chanel purchase.

The other jeweler I took the ring to was appalled by the quality of the ring.  She said the scorch marks on the ring  were from them trying to solder the diamonds in.  She also saw bubbles in the platinum along with the crooked channel setting.  I took the ring back to Mr. Olson right after speaking with the other jeweler, and he didn't understand why I was so upset.  He finally admitted to seeing the wave in the ring and heard him discuss it with his jeweler about the quality.  He tried to tell me that they were rushed and then the reason they couldn't order another ring was because it was an \"Estate ring\" (this was new)......Finally he offered me a refund \"Because I obviously can't make you happy\", well no you can't if you provide poor service and poor quality materials.  Its extremely upsetting that we no longer have our rings that we made our vows with...That's something we can never get back.  \nFortunately, we went to Molina's this afternoon and purchased our new beautiful and symmetrical wedding bands.

He went with his dad and wasn't sure what he wanted to wear to prom.  He said the staff was not helpful at all, as well as slightly rude and pushy.  I wish I would have gone with him to avoid such a disaster, but I thought he would be in the hands of professionals.  The styles were dated and cheap looking.  The fittings were off by over 6 inches on his waist.  They recommended a tux that was so awful and unflattering.  When he went to pick it up, the measurements were so off that they had to make extreme adjustments but didn't have him try it on again before leaving.  When he got home and tried it on we were devastated by everything.  The pants were pleated and bunchy.  The jacket looked over sized and drowning.  We called to return before the event but they wouldn't allow a return, even though he wasn't going to wear it.  I took him to Men's Warehouse where a staff immediately took action and found an awesome Vera Wang suit for the same price!  It also included more accessories. In one hour they had him in and out the same day of his prom looking amazing.  They had real professionals that were up to date on the styles and looks for men, Rose Tuxedo doesn't even come close to having a clue.  When I went to return the awful unworn tuxedo a day late I knew I would have to pay a late fee, as we had a busy couple of days.  However I didn't expect another horrible experience when I wasn't even arguing the fee.  Before I could even hang the garment on the rack to return, an extremely rude lady jumps out of her seat to point out the late fee and showing me where it states it on the tag.  Not even a hello or greeting first.  They clearly do not care about how the customers' experience is nor do they care about making it right.  Please avoid this place at all costs and go see real professionals that are helpful and know how to really dress people.  Even though he had 2 suits paid for at least he went to his prom happy and looking good after another shop fixed a disaster the same day of prom.", "business_id": "yjS7VP4u2b2rwDwCR02iDw", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-05-07", "type": "review"}

It started off innocent enough.  I would browse every now and again and marvel at the array of products.  Back then, I would never really buy anything, but I would promise myself that I could have whatever I wanted once I renovated my kitchen.  It took me a long time to achieve that goal, but eventually I did.  Then the flirtation blossomed into my first purchase.  My torrid affair with Williams-Sonoma has been raging for a couple of years now.\n\nIn Phoenix, the Biltmore Fashion Park store is my favorite Williams-Sonoma location.  The one at the Fashion Square is okay, but it feels cramped.  I travel for business and I seek out Williams-Sonoma stores on the road.  The one in Oak Brook (suburban Chicago) is nice.  The store in Walnut Creek, CA is also nice.  The new flagship in Union Square in San Francisco is like Williams-Sonoma Mecca!  It's four floors of everything Williams-Sonoma carries as well as artifacts from Chuck Williams' own kitchen.  It's like a Williams-Sonoma museum combined with the entire product line.  As a side note, the original Williams-Sonoma store that was on the square in Sonoma has been closed.  The Union Square store replaced it.\n\nWilliams-Sonoma is the best!  The products are all of the finest quality and they stand by everything they sell.  If you ever have a problem, they will take the item back with no questions asked and give you store credit if you don't have your receipt.    \nI've bought everything at Williams-Sonoma from my Le Creuset Doufeu to Fleur de Sel French sea salt.  If you love to cook, this is the place for you.  If you bake or cook a lot, be sure to check out their All-Clad Stainless Steel Measuring Cups & Spoons.  The measuring cups are adorable because they're miniature versions of the All-Clad saucepan.  For standard measures, they offer sets of both four cups and spoons: 1/4, 1/3, 1/2 and 1 cup; 1/4 tsp, 1/2 tsp, 1 tsp and 1 Tbs.  The really handy items are the odd-size sets.  They offer sets of both cups and spoons in the following odd sizes: 2/3 cup, 3/4 cup and 1 1/2 cups; 2 tsp, 1 1/2 Tbs and 2 Tbs.  All the spoons stack together into a cute space-saving group.  All four sets of measures make an awesome gift!\n\nDon't overlook their website.  Sometimes they will have Special Offers for products online that can be upwards of 50% off of the same items in the stores.  This drives the BF a bit crazy because he thinks their pricing should be consistent across all retail channels, but I'm willing to check their website frequently as I have found a number of bargains online.", "business_id": "31bXixwy2GNmRlhpl21reA", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-05-28", "type": "review"}

It's a step up from a used furniture store. It's two steps up from a thrift store or a pawn shop. It's three steps up from a garage sale. The prices reflect all of this, but it's still pretty reasonable. \n\nSellers - as long as you didn't buy the ugliest couch in the world and you didn't let your dogs hump on it, then it'll probably sell here. They will look at your furniture first before allowing you to bring it in so you aren't wasting anyone's time. You can even bring in a picture and a pillow if that's easier. In fact, you can even email a photo to them that they will go by. \n\nIf it sells, they will give you anywhere from 45 to 55 percent of the money collected. To find out if it has sold, you can call. For security reasons, they won't give out much information over the phone, so you must bring in your paperwork to even ask how much it sold for. This is pretty annoying and inconvenient - they should do email notifications at least - but you can go into any location to get this information at least.\n\nI got the impression that they will let you set your own price, but typically they will price your items for you. Good. Compared to what you would probably get for them if you sold them yourself on your driveway, you're going to be happy (even when you realize you're only getting half the amount they set). They will also sometimes come pick up your items if you need help. \n\nBuyers - the store is laid out pretty well and they seem to only take quality items that would sell, so you won't find a bunch of ugly donated junk. Some of the items are out of date, but still in good shape. You're probably not going to find some grossly under priced antique that you could flip at an auction, but if you need to fill up a room in your house - it's a good place to shop. \n\nWeekends seem to be busy for them, so I imagine their stock changes constantly.

Despite their catchy billboards (\"Sell your sole\"), and the poor man on the side of 20th and Camelback holding a sign that said \"Up to 90% off retail prices\", I was disappointed with the overall experience at My Sister's Attic, as well as the prices. I've been there before, usually just to browse and see if they're recently obtained anything from anyone with really good taste (like mine, of course). This time was different, though. I went with a purpose. \n\nMy mom had these cute curtains that I must have complimented her on the last time I was in Florida, because wouldn't you know just a couple months after my visit, she sends me a package with the curtains. It's not that I don't like them, it's just that right now I don't really have anywhere to put them. So, after much deliberation about the moral soundness of trying to make some cash off of a gift (hey, I'm unemployed right now. Go easy on me), I decided that I would take them to My Sisters Attic. And if you tell my mom about this, I will deny, deny, deny. \n\nI looked around a bit, and then headed over to the counter with my bag o' curtains and waited for help. And waited a bit more. Soon, a blond woman walks toward the counter with some crystal pieces in her hands. She looks at me and smiles. And keeps walking. She proceeds to a shelf at the front of the store where she puts the crystal ware on a display and continues to ignore me. \n\nUsing my best shot at ESP, I start to wonder if there's a different counter for taking in items as opposed to selling them. Yup. Right there tucked away in the back corner of the store, with a sign on an 8  1/2 x 11 piece of paper identifying it as the \"intake\" area. There were two older ladies behind the counter there discussing some items as I walk up. But don't worry, because they didn't let my presence interrupt their conversation. Finally, I interrupt and ask if they took curtains, to which they said a gruff \"no\" and went right back to their business. I interrupted again to ask if they knew of anywhere else that might take curtains, only to be met with the same response. Of course. \n\nI did notice some cute items while I was waiting around for help, but looking at the prices, I wasn't too impressed. Outside, they had a set of three barstools for upwards of $200, and I saw some cheap looking nesting tables inside for I think $50. They looked like they were bought at Ikea for probably less than that. \n\nAnyhow, after my experience with Thing One and Thing Two, I wasn't much in the mood for shopping. So I left the store, and on my way out I couldn't help but shoot a snarky \"Thank you!\" at the first useless woman who didn't help me. Then as I passed her I competed my thought under my breath, \"...for nothing\". \n\nThe only reason I gave this place any stars at all is because they do have some cute things, although pretty overpriced, from what I could see. Also, they had a pamphlet on the counter (that would be the check-out counter, not the intake counter) on the Arizona Humane Society. I don't think any percentage of their proceeds actually go to the Humane Society. Another redeeming aspect, though: their website says that if items don't sell after 60-90 days, they are donated to non-profit foundations that benefit homeless pets and women's groups.

What I was expecting was their expertise but what I got was a console panel that pops inward. When I made the dude aware of it he walked straight out of the office with this annoyed expression whether to demonstrate how mad he was at the tech or by complaint. Either ways I was left without a word thinking wtf I'm I supposed to follow our what. Obviously I was because how would he be able to see what I'm talking about. Anyways he talks to the tech and then tells me that its made that way and if I want they can screw it in. Again wtf would you want a panel pooping inward ask the time. Give him a call to make an appointment he says. Fine. 2 days later I can't open the door from the inside. Fukk I thought the tech probably messed up in there too because I had speakers installed. Opened it up and sure enough the connector was broke and a poor attempt to fix it by filling holes and a zip tie. I feel that this is something you should mention to the owner if your going to drill into the plastic visible or not. I doubt anyone gets upgraded stereos because they don't give a shi! About their car. So drilling holes, at least give me a call. So instead of getting a professional installation I got some half as$ workmanship. I don't have the time to do an installation myself and that's why I took it to these guys, unfortunately. So why didn't I take it back for them to repair? Do you continually annoy your food server when they already give you bad vibes? I dont want spit in my food and didn't want more broken things in places I can't see. I don't want to have QC their work afterwards. So I did the repair myself. I've uploaded a picture of the broken piece.\n\nAnyways people might have been satisfied and maybe I was just unlucky but I'm not going back.

He looked up how much it would cost because I didn't have a warranty on the powerbook. (People have warranties on Apple Products?) He came up with a pricey number that I almost considered for a second, but before I could respond he told me that would be dumb to pay. He gave me a card for a Mac store that would be much cheaper. He then also gave me a card to what was according to him the best data recovery store in the city. He then sent me on my merry way completely free of charge.\n\nI used to work at a service desk for a Gateway Country back in the day and I would have been fired for telling a customer to go somewhere else for cheaper.

I mean, I'm walking into a book store that is suppose to sell used and hard-to-find books, when I sadly realize the price isn't that much different than the original asking price. \n\nI found a book I wanted. I began to drool over it. Seriously... but for $50? The original price tag was $60. So, 10 bucks off? \n\nMaybe I got the wrong impression by the exterior. Maybe I was just hoping this place would sell used books that I could afford. After all, some where okay - $12 for a used copy of a popular novel. But, seriously, you can buy a new one for the same amount at Borders when you're part of their discount program. So, I don't get it. \n\nMaybe I'm not their ideal shopper, for I want a bargain. I don't want to wander through filled bookcases of WWII, Comics, Music, Fiction, Nature, Philosophy and discover some amazing gem that's going to set me back $50. Hell, that's 5 bottles of $10 wine. C'mon, you do the math! \n\nI would recommend this place to any one who likes to peruse book shelves and is in the market to find a \"vintage\" edition of a book. Or maybe anyone who likes dusting off the pages before reading about ancient warfare. This isn't for somebody who typically gravitates to the a certain section, knowing what she's looking for, expecting not to spend alot of money on what has become a really expensive habit. \n\nIf you have an hour to kill and you like the ideal of stumbling upon something unique and original (book kismet), then check out Book Gallery.

If you want just a basic retail book store, Borders-I shop a lot there-Bookstar, and that type are available.  Book Gallery is something special.  The inventory is of books that one probably isn't going to find in the other stores.  Mike, the owner, buys books for people looking for something t more specific to the areas a person might be interested in.\n\nAs to service, you can receive it at this store.  The employees are more laid back and don't follow the (ninety second rule to say hello) most of the large stores are supposed to follow.  The majority of the customers that come in are coming to this store to look for merchandise they won't find other places. It is enjoyable to see what gem is available there at any given time without being bothered.  However, just ask. and the employees will go out of their way to find what you need from books small artistic items to music.  I will admit that there is one employee I'd rather not have help me but that is a personality thing.  At any time, they will call the Mesa store to see if they have something there and have it in Phoenix in a day or two.  They also will keep an out for something if you ask.\n\nMike, the owner, enjoys buying knickknacks, book ends, and just other small things that make delightful and unusual gifts.  I have a friend that is just so hard to buy for.  I found a small piece of De Grazia sculpture that I didn't even know was made.  The very reasonable price surprised me.  I expected to pay more because many of the things there you can't  buy other places.  I don't consider myself to be a snob.   I have a great time shopping at Goodwill.  I am realistic in knowing I should expect to pay more for something the owner has personally selected for some unique quality.  \n\nConcerning the prices of the books in Book Gallery, they will depend on the merchandise you are considering.  I happen to be a science fiction fan. I always find very reasonable prices on older paperbacks from two or three dollars and up. One day I found a signed copy of one of the Dune series and I paid considerably more.  It only made sense. It cost more than the original price, but  considering the author is dead, how many more are going to be signed-zilch, none!  Besides, how many stores would have it available for purchase anyway..\n\nThis store has another quality that really appeals to me and that is plenty parking!  It's a great place to go browse before or after going to one of the other interesting stores or restaurants in this small center.\n\nSo I am a snob for shopping at a small unique bookstore with merchandise that isn't typical.  Quality means more to me than quantity.  I find quality at Book Gallery.  Check it out!", "business_id": "fhqdlwLbO4ec_vavw-ke1A", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-04-07", "type": "review"}

It is now has the third highest sales of any Tuesday Morning stores in Arizona while being the smallest.  (I asked)  To accomplish that a store has to be fairly well organized with good service.  I consider this store to be a real gem!  I don't have to pay the prices of Fashion Square or the Biltmore or deal with it takes to find a parking place there either. (Don't get me wrong, I like both of those places as well, I use them just for point of comparison.) Nine times out of ten i can go in there, find what I want and get out if I want to.  The problem is I usually look around a bit and go home with maybe a bit more than I expected.\n\nObviously in a store that carries as man better name close outs in as small a place as it is, one does have to keep a sharp eye out, and maybe do a little digging.  Who cares, treasure is to be found.  I have found this store to be infectious.  Every time I go there I seem to find a better price on something than the time before. Be it something for the yard, gifts for the kids, entirely to expensive sheets for the bed, crystal, monogrammed thank you note's, something for the my cat, Picasso, they are all there and waiting..  I took a friend there the other day who complained they didn't have prices like Goodwill.  The truth is this person is not a shopper and never will be.  If you are a shopper, you'll recognize the quality is at prices that make sense. \n\nAnother minor but really nice thing about the Tuesday Morning stores is the music they play when you are there.  At major dept stores you hear music that has been selected by a team to maximize sales according to critical factors.  The owner of Tuesday Morning picks the music you listen to.  I like his taste and usually find myself humming a tune at some time before I leave which is usually with more than I planned on.\n\nI will talk about the service which is unique to this store.  Depending on the lines of customers waiting to be rung up, they may or may not greet you as you come in.  Usually I find they do.  If you just aren't finding what you are looking for, you might have to to be the one to seek out  one of their people and ask them concerning what you are looking for.  At this point, I am usually very afraid.   They are going to steer me to an area where even if I don't see what I asked for, something will be there that will work.  I just have to decide which or how many!\n\nI haven't discussed the wonderful yellow Clearance signs have I?   I look at prices that really can't be beat on things that I probably will use for some thing  at some time.  If I can't see why they are marked down, or there is a flaw that I can live with,  I have this good habit of buying them.  The result is I never really have to shop for the holiday, birthdays or you name it.  I  dig in the back of my hall closet closet and usually something is there that will suffice.  Tuesday Morning is truly one of the stores that helps keep that closet well stocked.  \n\nVisit this location.

I have brought two phones to them to sell, and couldn't believe the miniscule amounts they offered me for two great and expensive phones.  Yes, I am aware that this is a business, and so they must profit somehow from used phones, BUT to be offered $5 for a $300 phone is absolutely ludricrous to say the least.  May I add that the same make and model of this phone was in their display case for $130????  The second phone I brought in, another popular relevant model (originally worth $200), I was offered $21 dollars for. After my eyes went back into my head, I wondered if the extra $1 was intended to sway my agreement to this absurd offering.  I informed the sales guy that my friend went to their Mesa location with the same EXACT phone in also good condition and was offered $90 which I thought was very generous, but also fair, being the reason I decided to give them another shot.  He informed me that they are FRANCHISED (always a bad sign) and that they use \"different\" buyers for each store of theirs.  I then picked up my phone and walked out, never to return again.  Now I know why this place is always empty (even on weekends) and why they only have four parking spaces (two of which are used by employees).

I will use yesterday as a short but accurate example:\n\nI went to purchase a picture frame with my daughter.  We bought this and 3 spontaneous purchases.  The 3 additional purchases were frivolous and cheap, however it was the bright red SALE sign that attracted to me to these items.  And, at the register, none of them rang up at the advertised sale price.\n\nSupposedly the popcorn was on sale for $2.50. It rang up at the normal price of $3.29.  The watermelon oreos, which everyone has claimed are gross but are surprisingly good, were on sale for $2.80, but rang up for $3.  And lastly, I bought some sour patch flavored gum, on clearance at the register for 60-cents, yet rang up for .99 cents.\n\nYES, THEY DO HAVE SOUR PATCH FLAVORED GUM.\n\nI didn't say anything at the register because I am not going to hold up a line over an extra $1.29 total.  Nor am I going to waste my time standing in customer service to embarrass myself over $1.29.  But, the problem is that this is exactly what Target expects from us.  They basically overcharge ALL OF US every time we shop there.  Sure, in minimal amounts, but does that make it right?\n\nIt was Sunday so  it is very conceivable that this particular store simply did not update their sale advertisements throughout the store and it's more of an issue with location rather Target itself.  Hence the yelp review.\n\nSince they have sour patch flavored gum and watermelon oreos (and yes, I realize I  have taste buds like a 6 year old), I will probably return anyway.

When I got to the nursery I really like the layout of the plants.  There are also large trees on the grounds that provide nice shade while you are shopping.  I purchased 5 Hybrid-T 36\" Rose Trees that were listed as \"Firefighter\" as the color.  There were a couple that did not have flowers on them so there was no way of verifying the color.  Berridge offers a 90 day warranty on these plants, so I wasn't too worried. \n\nAfter planting them and a week later, sure enough one of them was white, and not the red that my fiance so dearly wanted.  Now I'm in trouble!  We call Berridge and they told us to bring it back and they would exchange it.  So now I have to dig this rose tree up and haul it back to the nursery.  Not exactly what I want to be doing.  When I got there I realized that I did not bring the receipt which is the policy for returns.  Not a problem though because Bill came out and assisted me and helped me find a different 36\" rose tree to replace it.  They did not worry that I did not have the receipt because I had left the tags on the tree.  The staff, especially Bill was knowledgeable and friendly, and was a great help in fixing this situation.

I have been here over the past few years and until today have had decent experiences.  I showed up to my appointment 10 minutes early and was required to fill out paperwork (is there a reason they don't keep a file for me?) but again, I was early so whatever.  I was done in 5 minutes but had to sit and listen to front desk staff discussing personal issues (babysitters' schedule, going to lunch, making fun of a poor lady who called for directions to the office two times, etc) until finally heading to the back around 9:20.  While waiting I couldn't help to notice that the place is dirty - trash on the floor,etc.\nI go to the first round of tests and Megan (I think that was her name) the tech was awesome.  Except when she had me remove my contacts in their bathroom --- to spare you I will just say that it was more of a mess than the waiting room.\nThe dr exam was also pleasant and quick.  My current contacts were discontinued so she recommended a new brand and even gave me a sample set to wear home with my new prescription.\nI went upfront to pay and was expecting my $20 co-pay as in years' past.  They charge me $60.  So of course I asked why and it was explained to me that this year they had given me a contact exam so that's why the additional charge.  What the?!  I've worn/renewed contacts for 4 years and have always gotten my exam from them.  In my opinion nothing has changed but I had no choice but to pay, obviously.  I called my insurance immediately to see if there was something that had changed with the plan and the agent said no and then asked if I order contacts through Nationwide or elsewhere.  I always do my exam at Nationwide where my exam is covered by medical insurance and order contacts/glasses at another place where my actual vision insurance is accepted.  Here's the kicker-- because there was no change, the insurance agent thinks Nationwide is charging more because I mentioned I wouldn't order though them.  Looking back, I'm not sure I was so honest in past years.  This makes me sick because I know I've been \"had\".\nI should've run away from how dirty the place was anyhow because now I keep thinking about whether or not they sanitize anything that touched my face... *shudder*\nOn the up-side, this place is next to Wildflower for a good muffin & good cup of coffee.", "business_id": "AJONCMi8dnGWAkD-86FK5A", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-03-08", "type": "review"}

I like the nursery...they have a very good selection of succulents, starts (veggies, herbs), and a decent selection of trees, vines and desert-adapted plants. I wouldn't recommend them if you are looking for natives however because the selection is small.\n\nOver the years I've bought a lot of plants and trees here...and I've only had a few die...most recently, 4 out of 5 pedilanthus I bought (lady slipper plant) died almost immediately after bringing them home. When I went in to Baker to talk with them about it, they were unapologetic, unhelpful, and rude. They said they don't guarantee their plants at all...it was my fault completely and I killed them. I was upset, yes, but I kept going back and resigned myself to having just lost about $100. It is after all, a local nursery close to my home and maybe I did do something wrong...I'm not perfect.\n\nWe started getting serious about landscaping our yard a year ago, and I wanted more natives and desert plants. Since Baker didn't have them in stock, I requested them by writing down the item and giving it to the cashier who then would give it to the person who orders plants. I did that three times over about 3 months. No response. I tried to call...sometimes they don't answer the phone. I stopped by. No one ever responded to my requests.\n\nSo I finally went to other nurseries around the valley to find natives. It was then that I realized what I'd been missing at Baker--good customer service with a smile. Baker's staff seem disgruntled or crusty most of the time--even the 20-somethings that work there never have a smile to greet you.\n\nThe last straw: I've been asking around at all the nurseries for a certain plant called Rabbitbush. It's a Chihuahuan desert native related to our Sonorant desert's turpentine bush. I want several for my yard and I can't find them anywhere in Phx (most nurseries are supplied with desert plants through a wholesale company called Mountain States and I knew already that they didn't have it in their inventory.) I'm not an expert at plants, but I did my research on this bush and I knew what I wanted. I went to Baker about a week ago to get some succulents and while I was there, I asked about Rabbitbush. They didn't have it in stock of course but I could leave a note for Joy, the gal who orders plants. I thought, \"yeah, right, no one will call me back\", but urged by the salesperson who said they sometimes order plants from Civano in Tucson, I wrote out the request: \"5 Rabbitbush, Ericameria nauseosa var. nauseosa\" and left it with no expectation of hearing back.\n\nI got a call a few days later saying they got it them in. Thinking that was too quick, I called back several times and finally they picked up. I was transferred to Joy. I asked her what she had ordered and she told me Ericameria nauseosa. Yeah, but which one, I asked. The one you requested she replied. I asked her about the exact botanical name, at which point she got annoyed and told me again she'd gotten what I requested. I tried to ask whether it was the subspecies nauseosa or speciosa but she told me that Mountain States shortens the names on the sticker (shouldn't she have asked whether it was the right plant prior to buying it or calling me?). Sensing this was about to be a repeat of the Pedilanthus conversation where I was the one that was at fault for daring to question the all-knowing Baker staff, I quit trying to explain it and asked, \"does it say Whitestem chamisa on the bucket?\" \"Yes.\" I told her there was a difference between chamisa and Rabbitbush in the subspecies name, but she just said \"do you want them or not?\" No thanks was my reply and we hung up.\n\nYes, maybe I'm just a customer and maybe I haven't worked at a nursery, but I know what I'm talking about on that one. I will probably go back to Baker at some point and I think it's a good nursery for Phx folks to check out at least once. But, if you go, set your expectations low:\n1. Expect to be treated poorly. Don't expect them to be nice to you or give you any respect, even if for one moment you know more about a plant than they do.\n2. Buyer beware: if a plant dies, it's your fault, not theirs and don't ask them about it because you will be told that you killed the plant in a rude tone of voice.\n3. Help yourself. Don't expect them to go out of their way to help you. (We have a hard time getting anyone to help us get our plants to the register.)\nWith low expectations, if anything goes right for you at Baker, you'll think it's great.", "business_id": "7p0OI2Ld46-EzJkRHGQEJQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-03-21", "type": "review"}

More than two but less than four grand later, said couch was paid for and supposedly on its way to my new home. (I think you know the rest, but I'll continue.) Two weeks later. Nothing. Three, nothing. I call. Oh, it had to be shipped. It will be there right away! Shipped? I call in mid-February. 'They ran out of fabric ... it will be there the first week of March!' They're making it? She said it was in stock. Well gang, it's the first week of March, so I call again today. Now it's looking like the end of March AT BEST because it is being MADE overseas (so much for the assurance that this was a stock item ... and it's being made in Taiwan). Long story short, Pruitt's kept my $$$ for 7 weeks ... did nothing ... never called ... and lied when I called them ... repeatedly. So I made them give me my money back this morning.

He told us to bring our bikes in for a free estimate and they'd more than likely be able to fix it without too much of a charge.

We get there, he looks our bikes over, and says that it's going to cost $10 for a chain (reasonable) and $15 to put it on. Uhhhh, WHAT? You're telling me that you're going to charge me more than the actual chain to put it on, when if I had brought my little chain tool with me it would literally take me no more than five minutes to put the chain on? That was absolute BS.\n\nHe also said he was going to charge $25 to put a front brake on. Please tell me you are joking about that, too. I checked my watch to make sure it wasn't April 1st.\n\nThen after my girlfriend walked outside, I find out that they aren't even going to fix it today (when it in total would have taken them no more than 10 minutes). The hipsters response was, \"Uh, well I don't have the time to do it today. It's very labor intensive work.\" It wasn't. At all. If I had the right bike tools it would have taken me about four seconds to rearrange the bolts for the front wheel.\n\nThey're rude. They're pretentious.

He never offered to fit (which I later realized was very important)  or even ask my height, riding style, etc which has cost me some pretty stiff joints and a trip to the chiropractor.  I had to ask all the questions - he could care less.

A\"gift store\" with a Coke machine...hey looking at plants and cute plant guys makes me very thirsty. \n\nSo if I ever decide to expand my backyard living from a balcony to a space with dirt and grass, I'll head to Whitfill Nursery. For now I'm happy living in my concrete jungle with no plants to water. That's all for now.

It turns out the owner himself helped us, answered all of our questions, never made us feel rushed, and we couldn't be more pleased with our experience!\n\nThe feeling continued when the trees were planted; we weren't going to be home so we unlocked the side gate and put down the flags. The planting looks excellent, and they even moved the lawn/leaf bags which were next to the house (we thought they were enough out of the way - oops!) so now the side of the house looks as good as the back!\n\nThis was our second time buying from them - I would go back and also highly recommend them.", "business_id": "pCvl0km6v3Imcpq5UV_-UQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-03-25", "type": "review"}

Had them plant a boxed Palo Verde last March, which is going strong. \n\nCan't tell if things are declining or  if people are just constantly dropping the ball, this year.  Got a great price on three trees, a couple weeks ago, but were a little peeved they never mentioned planting wasn't  included in delivery.  Instead, we found out when they plopped the pots down in our backyard and left.  We had a fine time digging holes all weekend, but it would have been finer had we known it was coming.\n\nConsidered never going back after the neglectful treatment the other day, in which some old shrew w/ no customer service skills refused to hang up her personal phone call and put through our transaction w/o so much as two words to me.

I swung in today to see what kind of stuff they had going on plant wise, and I forgot how huge this place was!  \n\nThe front part is a lot of the smaller plants, annuals and perennials, hanging baskets, herbs, and general household plants.  They also have a really cool greenhouse with all indoor plants with a very large selection to choose from!  The farther back you go, the bigger the plants and bushes are, and they have all kinds and sizes to choose from.  Tremendous selection of just about any tree, plant or bush you could imagine!\n\nI talked to the girls at the front to see if they had any sales going on, and she said no. I checked out their plants, but I didn't see anything that caught my eye today.  As I walked around, I noticed what an awesome selection they had.  Service here is really good, but they don't have any kind of rewards programs either.  I mean, that doesn't mean I won't shop here, but in regards to competition, its something to think about if you spend a lot on plants and flowers.\n\nStaff here is really friendly and knowledgeable, easy in and out, great location.  I admit, I've gone here a few times in the past during what I thought were normal business hours (Sunday afternoons?) and sometimes they've been open and sometimes they've been closed.  (and I mean between the hours of like 1 and 3 PM.)  Overall, a great nursery, with a humungous product line!", "business_id": "pCvl0km6v3Imcpq5UV_-UQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-03-28", "type": "review"}

We didn't plan on coming here--we just saw it from the road and decided to visit.  I have been seeing their ads in my mailbox for some time and wanted to see what it was all about.\n\nHuge place.  Service was attentive.  Lots and lots of plants (flowers, veggies, cacti, palms, decorative, etc,) soil, chemicals, and accessories for your garden.  We didn't buy anything, but it was nice to look around.  If my wife were wearing better shoes, we would have stayed longer.\n\nProblems?  Well, the prices seemed a bit high in comparison to the big box hardware stores, but if the quality is better, who cares?  I didn't like the fact that many of the plants were unmarked except for a price, so you didn't even know what you were looking at for quite a number of the items.  That bugged me a bit.  Maybe they don't have the time to label everything and the merchandise goes out quickly, especially during the Spring.  However, it would be nice to know what such and such plant is without asking for assistance.\n\nFour stars for now.

No one greeted me so I had to track down someone for help.  I found a woman watering and asked her for help.  She asked this other employee to help me.  He agreed since he just ended a call helping a customer.  He asked the woman watering if they had any Zucchini plants she said she did not know she would have to go check.  He said that was not necessary because he simply told the customer they did indeed have them.  I thought to myself that would really make me angry if I drove all the way there for something they said they had come to find out after arriving they did not have it.  The employee took me to look at a plant I was asking about and while he was in the middle of explaining about the plant, his phone rang and he proceeded to answer a personal call only to yell at the other person on the phone about being responsible and being locked out of the house etc...He said he could not talk, said he was at work and hung up on the caller.  I thought to myself, wow how rude.  He then made another call to another person saying they needed to communicate and that they had to go back home to let the other person back in the home.\n\nI simply just walked out at that point.
