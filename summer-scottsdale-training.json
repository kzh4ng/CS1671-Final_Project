They also offer free breakfast which we did use every single day if not just for coffee and juice.  The food wasn't the best nor did they have the widest selection, but it was free so you cant complain.\n\nThe rooms were nice and spacious.  They had a fridge, dishes etc.  This would be an awesome place for an extended stay.  They had a separate bedroom with a large bath.  The shower was kind of narrow and sloped weird but the rest of the bathroom was nice.  The bed was comfy and they provide you with a shitload of pillows which I love.  The only bad part about the room was the furniture.  The couch wasn't comfy at all, and they had this little old school recliner which wasn't too comfy either.  Dont know what kind of cable they have but it only had about 15-20 channels which was weak.\n\nThe pool area was nice and we swam pretty much every single night.  Only once was someone else out there.

I was shown to a booth and presented with the menu.\nNow when you look around the place you soon realise that the portion sizes are generous even by US standards.\n\nThe menu has plenty of choice sandwiches, burgers bagels and traditional Jewish food too. There's also a kids menu which I have to say sounded pretty good and there was a dedicated gluten free menu too.\n\nI picked Bobs Brisket from the Colossal Reubans section of the menu priced at $14.99 you would be forgive for thinking its a little pricey. However when it arrives it is huge, and I mean huge! It was full of flavour, tender meet, perfect onions and beautiful seasoning.\nHaving seen the size of it I was glad I didn't order a side of wedges billed on the menu as 'full portion sides'.\n\nChompies is the home of Chompies slider challenge which was featured on Man v Food. Its essential 12 sliders filled with brisket, mini potato pancakes and Jack cheese served with gravy and 5lbs of onion strings. Many have tried few have succeeded. At $39.95 its actually pretty good value, and would certainly be worth having as a sharer.\n\nI loved this place, the food was great, the atmosphere great and the prices reflected excellent value, my sandwich and a coke came to $22 (inc tip).", "business_id": "IM-9thHqQbBK5tX5MfTzBQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-08-07", "type": "review"}

The little details are tended to; good coffee and flavored waters in the main lobby, outstanding poolside bar service, thick cotton towels and robes and clean public areas among them.  In fact, so much attention is given to hosing-down the outdoor concrete that you would never suspect that the area has a water shortage.\n\nRooms were right-sized, neither spacious, nor cramped, and attractively furnished.  Water pressure was good on the first floor, but temperatures were extremely inconsistent and variable.  Beds appeared to be a bit old and not as comfortable as in most Hilton properties.  The available television stations were at least a decade behind current tastes, but high-end LG flat screens were appreciated.  WiFi bandwidth was outstanding, and didn't require constantly repeating a log-in process.\n\nThe Scottsdale Hilton Resort has two restaurants, an independent Fleming's (a top-tier chain steakhouse) and their own Blue Fire.  While I found the food at the Blue Fire to be adequate, I believe that the other members of my family will disagree.  Service is amateurish and slow, while prices are high.  No worries, however, as there are dozens of places to eat within an easy walking radius.\n\nWe checked-in as a family of four, yet received only three sets of towels.  The front desk was apologetic, and promised that additional towels would be delivered shortly.  Three hours later we called again and the extra towels arrived within five minutes.  Yet for each of the two remaining days of our stay housekeeping brought only three sets.  It is an attention to details like this which separate \"very good\" from \"great\" motels.\n\nThere is plenty of free parking, but the campus is very large and long walks may be necessary if you don't park near the closest entry point to your room.  Our room had a locked refrigerator, which I'll assume to be a cash bar feature, yet we were never offered the opportunity to obtain a key.\n\nWe enjoyed our stay at Scottsdale Hilton Resort, and at $119/night found an incredible irony in the fact that the least expensive of the three motels on our cross-Arizona vacation was clearly the best.", "business_id": "ZRrIwqIUMII1b2keMI8QRw", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-08-09", "type": "review"}

We were seated with 2 other families who were also celebrating birthdays with the same certificate.  They were a fun bunch.  Our chef, John was really nice and very accommodating to our son.  He was funny and cracked jokes with us while cooking.  I know it must be a hard job to have to stand there and entertain people and cook and sweat so we definitely were appreciative for him. \n\nThe husband and I both ordered the \"Splash & Meadow\" - which was jumbo shrimp and steak.  Our son had the \"child's\" version of it. Even though hubby's dinner was \"paid\" for, we still ended up with a $74.00 bill.  They added on gratuity that said it was \"suggested\" but had no where to really change it - the only extra line was to add on \"additional tip\".  \n\n\"All of our beef is USDA Choice, aged to perfection and hand-butchered on premise. Served with Benihana onion soup, Benihana salad, shrimp appetizer, hibachi vegetables, homemade dipping sauces, steamed rice, Japanese hot green tea and H\u00e4agen-Dazs ice cream, sherbet or sorbet.\"  \n\nI want you all to take a look at this description - and let me say that none of us received hot green tea...and ONLY the people who had the birthday coupon received ice cream.  When we asked if us \"regulars\" could get ice cream, they said we had to pay extra for it when it CLEARLY states on the menu that it comes with our dinner!  Total crap.\n\nAlso, the \"onion\" soup was completely tasteless.  It was just broth with some mushrooms and dried onions tossed in.  I do say that the shrimp and steak was pretty good and even better when dipped in their mustard sauce.  \n\nI probably will not come back again - even if we get a birthday dinner, it's still expensive and it's mostly for the entertainment of the Chef cooking for you that you're paying for.", "business_id": "ishjLG3Sc94ZOelXZZhaIw", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-07-23", "type": "review"}

The Good Egg has 17 establishments located in Arizona.  The Scottsdale establishment is a Heart Smart certified restaurant, so they can truly attest to healthier portions and options for those watching their waistline.  For those wanting to partake of larger portions and delicious food in all of its glory, The Good Egg can surely assist too.\n\nTheir menu boasts everything related to the egg.  One can have an egg cooked to order in a variety of styles (scrambled, frittata, Benedict, omelet).  Looking to \"carbo load?\"  The Good Egg has many choices in their pancakes and French toast department.  If you are looking past breakfast, for lunch they also have various combinations of sandwiches and salad to choose from as well.\n\nEntering The Good Egg, is to enter official breakfast time at your mom's kitchen growing up.  The walls are lined with yellow flowery wallpaper, and rooster decor interspersed throughout this location.  There is ample space both from tables, to booths, to even a small counter section.  If you want to partake of the nice Scottsdale weather at this time, there is outdoor seating on their patio as well. \nAdvertisement\n\nThis morning, I found myself on a mission for a great breakfast sandwich.  Their sandwich consists of your choice of egg (cooked to your order), choice of meat (i.e. bacon, turkey sausage, ham), choice of bread (wheat, bagel, white bread, croissant) and topped with cheese.  Home-style potatoes come with your sandwich.  I built my sandwich with scrambled egg well done, crispy bacon, wheat bread and cheese.  When my sandwich arrived it was of extremely ample portion, stacked high with all the ingredients I requested.  The bacon was especially crispy, not runny at all.  Just the right amount of cheese and bread toasted well to hold my scrambled egg together.  With my sandwich I received about a cup's worth of their home-style potatoes, which were also crispy and diced into small bites. \n\nGoing on a Friday morning to The Good Egg was very peaceful indeed, quick service with a smile, delicious food that will keep one's stomach full for awhile.  Do note that this establishment can get quite busy on the weekends, during their morning rush.  Best to arrive early or after the breakfast rush.  Regardless, The Good Egg is truly worth the wait.", "business_id": "nP9zQBRNSxlnU8BsbqYI5A", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-06-20", "type": "review"}

I don't think I have ever been disappointed in anything I have ever eaten there. The curries are a standout for me; particularly the Malaysia Cashew Beef and the Green Chicken Curry. Yum. Well, the hubby hated the atmosphere...too noisy due to concrete and scraping of chairs on said concrete...so if we want Flo's for dinner it is carryout only. One of my gal pals is always up for going out to lunch and loves the food at Flo's, too. We go there fairly frequently. Or should I say, we used to go there fairly frequently. Monday was the last straw. We sit down, with menus to the side and start yakking. A minute or two goes by and before our server has even come by, the food runner plunks down our salads and fried won tons. Now mind you, we have not ordered food yet, let alone DRINKS. Are you kidding me? Who serves the salad course before drinks are even ordered? Tacky. Super tacky. We looked at each other incredulously. Now here comes our \"charming\" server. Who waited on me last time I was there, by the way,  and was every bit as \"charming\". She opens with: \"Are you ready to order\" no \"Hello\", no \"May I get you something to drink\"...girlfriend is cutting right to the chase. I look up and simply say I would like an iced tea. Gal pal Sue replies, \"Yes the same for me\". Then Ms Personality asks if we are ready to order. I say \"No\" as coldly as she asks us. Yuk. What a buzz kill. Okay. Things went fairly fine after that. She came by two more times (with a little less 'tude) and on the third we did order. Of course it came out with lightening speed, and of course it was delicious. It is also such a good deal for lunch with most entrees served with salad coming in at around 7-8 bucks a pop. So, I have a couple of questions: Is the management so bad that they make everybody miserable who work there? And why the rush rush rush? It is a large restaurant, we were there at the tail end of lunch, and clearly not in a hurry. The joint was half empty. I have waited tables and I know that working the lunch shift kind of sucks because you don't turn your tables. But I tip accordingly if I overstay my welcome. Good look doing that at Flo's.

But what I can review is the friendly, personal service that every employee here makes a priority and the clean, functional rooms that you expect from a Westin.\n\nThe resort is large and located in an area of shopping malls and office buildings so it is perfect if walking to either of those is high on your list.  The banquet facilities are large and most open out on to the outdoors which make breaks nice.\n\nThe guest rooms are standard sized with all the amenities that you need including a layering of duvets (perfect cuz who needs a heavy duvet  when it's 120 degrees outside?) free in room coffee, and a bathroom with a stand alone shower which has excellent water pressure and a rain shower option.  Internet access is a daily charge.\n\nIn the lobby bar- there are plexiglass cages that I don't suggest you go anywhere near if you have a fear of snakes.  One has a couple of rattlesnakes in it, the other a Hila monster and still a third a leopard snake.  Fascinating!  And I have it on good authority if you go on a Tuesday around noon- you can see the local herpetological society (is that the right name for those who love snakes?) feed them.\n\nSpeaking of the lobby bar- the bartender , Nick was just a great guy.  He is exactly the kind of bartender you want- affable, knowledgeable and just fun to talk to.  And he pours a good drink too!\n\nI liked the common areas that include fire pits and cushy sofa areas to relax and enjoy a drink.  And the vista across the golf course and water is lovely.\n\nI didn't use the spa or any of the recreational facilities so I will have to review those on another visit.  \n\nSo my headline?

We have seen our waiter when we've been there on previous visits - he's not new to a busy night.

We have paid much much more for standard exams and vaccinations before when we lived elsewhere.  They are very forthcoming about their pricing; anything above and beyond a regular charge (i.e. office visit, vaccination costs) they will quote to you.  One of our dogs recently had surgery and we were floored by how inexpensive it was.  \n\nLastly, and one of the most important things, is appointment times.  Their hours are great, and we can easily work vet appointments around our busy work schedules.  But even more, when there is an emergency, they will make sure and fit us in during hours and they have a great after-hours emergency service that they recommend (and Dr. Besemer's wife works there, which reassures you that you will get the best care possible in an emergency situation).\n\nWe recommend Scottsdale Hills to anyone we can!", "business_id": "ul28DO_afdK_gWDLqmudeA", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-08-12", "type": "review"}
