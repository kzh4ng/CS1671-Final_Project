What I have a problem with is all the nasty flies in the building. And while you're eating too...it's so disgusting. The place is so freakin crowded as well...maybe just because I hate being in crowded and tight spots. \nAs far as the menu, I wasn't impressed. It took me 20 mins to find something (partly because I'm picky). But I ended up with the chicken broccoli alfredo, nothing to rave about. I wanted more broccoli than what was provided, but oh well.

Michael, our server, finally shows up 10 minutes later with a half-hearted apology and to let me know that my steak was being prepared again. He does not offer to refill our drink glasses that have now been sitting empty for 20 minutes. The manager makes an appearance and brings me a strip steak that looks rare from the sight of it. He informs me that my steak is on him and apologizes. He goes away. I cut into my steak and it's, you guessed it, Pittsburgh Rare. I asked for medium rare. He returns and I tell him that the chef needs to go back to culinary school and learn how to prepare a steak. The manager apologizes again and asks me if I want to take this pathetic piece of beef home with me! Not only is it rare but it's a cheap cut of strip steak that is loaded with connective gristle.

He adores this place. We usually go to the one on the North Side (their back yard area is adorable!) but they were closed on the particular day we were planning to make a visit, which led us to the Strip. The seating is limited, so on a busy day, you may not be able to get a table. My mom, dad, boyfriend and I were able to find a table easily when we visited. My mom and I decided to split the Joey Porter \"Bella\" hoagie (steak, portabella mushrooms, swiss cheese and horseradish sauce) and added fried onions, lettuce and tomato to our hoagie. We also ordered onion rings and French fries as well. My dad ordered the Italian hoagie and my boyfriend ordered the New Yorker, which is his favorite.\n\nMy mom and I really enjoyed our hoagie, although we did find there to be a lot of bread on the sandwich. The bread was fresh and delicious, but made the sandwich extremely filling. The horseradish sauce on the sandwich was delicious and not very spicy. The onion rings were fresh and yummy and the fries were fresh cut! My mom and dad were first timers and really enjoyed their food. \n\nOne important thing to mention- the service was amazing. The man who took the orders was very patient with my family, while we tried to figure out what we wanted. He gave us helpful suggestions and was overall very friendly. At the end of our meal, he thanked us for stopping in, which was really nice.\n\nOverall, I am not as obsessed with Peppi's as my boyfriend is, but I definitely enjoy their food. I don't think I will ever crave it like he does, but I don't think I could ever turn it down either!", "business_id": "J011r7mUV1QhgLJ7GkrtMw", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-07-06", "type": "review"}

It's a place that's (apparently) been around forever and just has a cool, old school vibe to it. The decor is totally out of date, just like the uniforms the servers wear. Who thinks that the white button down shirt with the little black tie works in 2012? The owners of Tessaro's do, which is part of the charm.\n\nIf you're in the mood for a tasty burger when you're in Bloomfield, you can't go wrong with Tessaro's. For my most recent lunch visit, I decided to change it up a bit and went for the cheesesteak with a side of boiled red potatoes.\n\nI chuckled when my food arrived. The cheesesteak was ridiculously large, overflowing with meat. The red potatoes came with a cup of melted butter for dipping. If you don't think potatoes should come with a cup of melted butter, honestly, you should go somewhere else... somewhere else where you can enjoy hating flavor. Personally, I assaulted those potatoes and didn't look back.\n\nThe cheesesteak was average. With some salt added, it was slightly above average. My advice to the kitchen would be to add some more salt and pepper while cooking to make it tastier out of the gate.\n\nTessaro's provides a classic Pittsburgh experience. While the food may only be worth three out of five stars, I'm going to add on another star because I like the fact that the dining room is dark, the menu is filled with meat, and the staff is friendly and efficient. Bottom line,  Tessaro's is a solid choice if you're in the mood for meat and you want to minimize your chance of running into Bloomfield hipsters.", "business_id": "vgXE1I7c9ElcfYyZfQiN1Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-06-12", "type": "review"}

Most of those tales had Tessaro's as the destination in question. The first time and every subsequent time I have been there has held up to it's legend. Don't get me wrong, there may be better burgers in Pittsburgh, but I have yet to find them.\n\nTessaro's has not only great burgers but also other foods that are delicious. Their menu is similar to what you would find in a steak house. They serve a lot of fish and steak aside from their burgers. After eating several different meals at Tessaro's I can say with no doubt that my favorite thing there is the \"Bacon-Bleu\" burger with crumbled blue cheese (rather than creamy because they give you the opion). The bacon is amazing, the blue cheese melts to the bun within a coulple of minutes and the burger mean is so fresh that you can distinctly taste its freshness.\n\nThe ambiance of the place is really nice too. It is an older place which has kept that old Bloomfield feel still to this day. Everyone is extremely nice there. The owner is usually there at the door to greet you and is always willing to have a nice conversation with you in the time when she is not flying around trying to get people in their seats. \n\nThe only downfall with Tessaro's and this is not their fault is that they are alway's almost too busy. Because this place way a neighborhood bar at one point it doesn't exactly have a lobby for you to wait in while you wait to be seated so that part of your dinner may be a bit uncofortable but all in all Tessaro's will be a great experience, espescially for those who are a fan of the old fashion hamburger and beer.", "business_id": "vgXE1I7c9ElcfYyZfQiN1Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-07-11", "type": "review"}

What you find instead is a decent, run of the mill, average burger. The meat is pretty good and certainly juicy but rather lacking in seasoning and the toppings don't do much for the overall experience. I've had burgers that are 4 or 5 star burgers, just not here.\n\nI was famished the last time I ate at Tessaro's and so was my husband. I'd just spent the entire day at Shadyside Hospital having a minor procedure and hadn't been able to eat since the night before. We didn't get to Tessaro's until 3pm and both of us would have literally eaten anything at that point. While I spent the day waiting, I'd read one of those infamous Best Burger in the Burgh lists online and had been daydreaming about a big juicy burger literally for hours & Tessaro's was right down the street.\n\nThe bacon bleu cheese burger was on special that day so we both jumped. Peculiar that they offer the bleu cheese wet or dry. Guessing the wet is bleu cheese dressing and I like my bleu cheese straight up, so easy decision. Side of coleslaw for me, fries for hubby. \n\nWe both remarked that we expected it to taste better than it did. The bleu cheese had no flavor, the bacon was barely noticeable and I had to add ketchup to it to get anything going on. At one point, I even put coleslaw on it to try and wake it up. \n\nAs mentioned, the meat itself was good but I'm sorry even the best burger needs seasoning and flavorful toppings.

The location was perfect -- close to the convention center, yet not right in the middle of all of the hubub.  The park was pleasant to walk next to while heading over, but  I was glad to have someone with me who had been there before.\n\nWhile ordering, the staff was polite and friendly, noting our convention badges and asking where we were from.  They recognized the members of our group that had been there the previous day.  I ordered the two corn-dog combo; others in my group ordered the hot dog combo and the burger combo.  The fries were piping hot and perfectly seasoned.  Our corn-dogs were the perfect combination of golden batter and awesome dog, and the burger and regular dogs were gone before I could ask the others how they were :)  The ketchup on the table was a little low, but I think we were there just after the lunch rush, so that was understandable.\n\nBy the time I was ready for a refill on my diet coke before heading out, there was a small line at the register.  The cashier waved me to the front of the line when he saw my cup, so I didn't have to wait while others ordered -- I was highly surprised, and very thankful for his consideration.  I wish more restaurants did that.\n\nOne of the earlier reviewers mentioned confusion with picking up baskets right next to the utensil area -- when I visited, there was a young woman running food out (she called the number and waited for the correct person to raise their hands).  It seemed to work much better than having customers pick up their order.  \n\nI would definitely recommend Matt's Chicago Dog for anyone in the area.", "business_id": "gpCtDCSXIoQx70cq9itfNA", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-08-17", "type": "review"}

First off, the health grade never seems to be better than a 94 (http://mecklenburg.digitalhealthdepartment.com/facilities.cfm?facilityID=316649.)  Don't even bother ordering anything that will differ from the way the employees are trained to make it - forget about extra pickles, hold the onions, no ketchup, add mustard - it WILL NOT HAPPEN AT THIS MCDONALD'S!!!  One day, a man ahead of me at the counter simply wanted a PLAIN cheeseburger - JUST CHEESE AND MEAT!  He sent it back 2 times because they kept making it wrong.  Really?  Bread, cheese, meat - that's it.  How hard can it be??  When my simple little ole iced coffee came out wrong (after they had overcharged for it!) that same man smiled at me and said \"Good luck with THAT!\"  \nAs for the drive-thru?  I've had to jump out of it too many times to count because after I had placed my order at the speaker, we never seemed to move along.  If the car at the pick-up window is waiting on something that is taking an extra long time, YOU will have to wait also.  They don't have that car pull out of line for an employee to bring them their item(s) when ready.  OH NO!!!   EVERYBODY in line has to wait!!    \nDon't bother calling any 800 # about this McDonald's - it's useless.  One would think that the owner of this location would be more proactive in making it a better McDonald's, but after more than 6 years of the same kind of service (or lack thereof!)  I guess not.  The only reason I ever went to this location was because it is close to my work, and options are pretty limited.  But now?

They even have a roll-down projection screen towards the rear of the bar that shows the big games as well.\n\nI recently went to Picassos one week night, and ordered a beer and an order of a dozen Cajun Garlic wings w/ranch.  This is a tasty sauce I've had many times so I knew what I was given.  The wings were brought to me pipping hot and the ranch was thick and cold.  There's nothing I despise more than a warm, runny ranch.  The wings were cooked with the perfect amount of crispiness but were not overcooked by any means.  \n\nMy only complaint with the wings is that they are not charred.  I'm sorry to say, but if you're not throwing your wings over an open-flame and charring them at this point then you're simply behind the times.  Plenty of establishments such as Fanz, Hickory Tavern and Mac's throw their wings over a grill before serving them.\n\nIf your looking for a chill and relaxing WEEKDAY evening to watch your favorite team, Picassos is the perfect place.  On football Sundays, Picasso's University is nothing short of perfectly organized mayhem.  Fans often arrived at 11am-11:30am even though their game doesn't kick-off until 1pm!  Furthermore, you are very likely to see a skirmish or a squabble as Sunday day turns into Sunday evening and patrons start to get that liquor courage. \n\nBefore I close, I want to make an important distinction in my rating.  I give Picasso's Sports Cafe as a whole  5-stars.  The staff is always friendly, prompt and efficient.  However, I am not giving their Cajun Garlic Wings 5-stars!  Though their wings are good, there are not \"5-star\" worthy.  On a scale of 1-10, I'd give them a 7.\n\nAt its soul, this is a classic, American sports-bar.

And I have got to say, they have some pretty good ones.\n\nThus far, I have tried three different kinds.  The Caribbean Creepers were like eating a jerk chicken wing, but they were just a little too different for me.  The medium garlic were pretty good, but the best I have had, by far, are the Cajun Garlic.  They are the perfect level of spiciness, not too spicy but plenty of flavor.  \n\nI have tried some of their other things here too.  Their bacon cheese fries were kind of 'meh' when I had them; they were pretty skimpy on the cheese and bacon.  Their pizza was pretty decent.  We had the Masterpiece, had a lot of good toppings.  Still, I am not a huge fan of New York-style pizza (I originate from the Midwest, and am quite partial toward Chicago-style or deep dish), but it was pretty standard for pizza.\n\nService has been ok here.  I have never had bad service, so that is definitely a plus.  They do have a decent amount of seating too, and it's not overly crowded in there.\n\nI plan to try a few more things on their menu, and that definitely includes other styles of their wings.

I come here to play poker and spend time with my poker buddies a couple of nights a week. BUT, for those who are sports fans and like to eat/drink while watching a game,  you should be very happy with this place.\nPicasso's is very popular with the college-aged sports fan crowd -- particularly since it's located just up the road from UNC-Charlotte.\nThe food is standard sports-bar fare. Wings, pizzas, sandwiches, wraps, fries and other appetizers. These are of fairly average quality -- though I have heard some of my friends comment that they particularly like the fajitas. There are no desserts.\nThere is a good selection of beer & mixed drinks -- nothing fancy, but adequate and fairly priced for your average sports fan.\nThe staff is very friendly and professional and are able to accomodate large crowds with ease -- given a little advanced notice. As I mentioned, my poker league plays here twice a week (on Mondays and Wednesdays, 2 games each day at 7pm and 9:30pm FREE) and we usually have crowd of 20-30. Often, other college groups (clubs, fraternities, sports teams, etc.) share the same space.  It's a spacious establishments with lots of TVs and even a huge (I'd say 10 ft or bigger) projection TV for the big games.\n\nIn addition to the games on the TVs and twice-weekly free poker, there is also an electronic darts board and a \"shuffleboard\" game. The covered outdoor seating area is convenient if you happen to be a smoker or have smokers in your party. \n\nSO . . . being a foodie, I'd give Picasso's 3 stars.

Since they were supposed to close at 11:00 pm we figured it was enough time to eat. When we walked in there were only three other tables of people, one of which was a couple that came in right before us. We waited at the host stand for 3 minutes and finally were greeted by the bartender. He took us to our table and told us our waitress would be with us shortly.  \n\nThe only server left (female, dark brown hair) came over and rushed her greeting by acting annoyed that we were there. She took our order and ran off to start doing the close prep. 5 minutes later she came back to our table and said that the bar was closing (10:30 pm) and that we couldn't get frozen drinks. She asked if we were interested in ordering another type of drink but we declined. She then acted annoyed that we didn't want something other than water! \n\nOur food quickly came out and it was WONDERFUL (thankfully) but our waitress never came back to check on us. I ran out of water and just as I was putting my napkin down she came over with another glass. At that time we asked for our check. We were so mad about the quality of the service that we just wanted to get out of there. We ended up walking out the door at 11:00 pm on the dot! \n\nMy partner and I always tip a min of 20% but often if we like someone we will tip way above. Our service was so terrible that we left her a 15% tip with a note explaining how uncomfortable she made our visit. If she had one ounce of sweetness to her we would've given her 20% BUT she was cold and distant. I understand wanting to get off of work but at least fake a smile and a personality. \n\nI will not be coming back. Yes, the food was amazing BUT bad service equals a no go in my book. Also, why close the bar 30 minutes early???? The drinks are around $8 so do the math on how much you are losing if our table would've ordered 2-4 drinks. I'm just beyond put off.", "business_id": "1hBOR97oX5Xph3J8Tdob7w", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-07-04", "type": "review"}

I think we were expecting a normal ice cream shop kind of atmosphere, with a big case of flavors to look at, so we had a bit of a deer-in-headlights moment when we first walked in, trying to figure out what we were supposed to order. It turns out they only have 3 flavors (vanilla, chocolate, and one other) per day, and most of your choices come from what sort of sundae you get. Once we figured that out, a number of the sundae choices seemed pretty solid. I ended up going with Turtle, and my husband got the Peanut Butter Cup. Both were excellent. The chocolate shell on the PBC was nicely chocolaty, especially for that kind of a product, and I appreciated that they didn't skimp on the pecans for the Turtle. We both had smalls, which were QUITE ample. We also got a K9 custard for our dog, which she appeared to enjoy. \n\nI guess I just have a couple of objections that keep this from being a 4-star place. First, I wish they had more flavors, since I don't always want a sundae (but maybe this is characteristic of frozen custard joints and is not a fair criticism). Second, I think it should be served slightly colder so that it doesn't melt as fast when the hot fudge hits it. Third, I felt that it was a bit overpriced for a fast food-style place. This is especially true of the K9 custard, since we're used to getting something more along the lines of a 79-cent kiddie cone for the dog.

They are similar to Culvers but doesn't offer you that \"home quality\" kind of experience. \n\nI typically get the Bleu Ribbon with some pink. I like the fried onion straws they add to the burger as well as this chipotle spread they use after toasting their buns. Mix that with the burger, BBQ sauce and bleu cheese and you've got a great tasting large juicy burger. I sometimes have to cut it in half because it's hard to take a bite out of. The burger comes with a side of endless steak fries they are often cooked to perfection. They are one of the few places that offers onion rings, however, as much as I love me some rings, I do not care much for theirs. The onions they use are extremely thick making it hard to bit into. I have often times ended up just eating the breading and putting the onions to the side. They are onion rings! This doesn't make any sense! They need to slice their onions thinner. As of now, I do not believe they are editable. \n\nMy other negative is presentation. The Bleu Ribbon has a lot going on so I realized that sometimes the burger can get messy. However, there have been times where my burger has come out looking like it went through a tornado. Lettuce falling everyone, too much BBW sauce, bleu cheese thrown on. The presentation needs to get better. I've experienced this at two different Red Robins. Also, I've also noticed that within the last year, they've cut back on the amount of steak fries they give you. Since they are bottomless it makes really no difference but I've definitely seen a change. \n\nThat being said, I would rate Red Robbi as being more than just an \"A-OK\" burger joint but they are far from a \"4+ star\" quality kind of joint. I do like the atmosphere. They have a few game machines, TV's, bar, background music and great classic pictures hanging on the walls that are great for helping to start a conversation ( say you're on a first date?). The art and photography they use to decorate the place I believe adds a lot of character and \"spunk\". \n\nThey do get very busy on weekends so expect a wait for a table and for your food but from my experience, it has never been extremely long. Wait staff has been good for me as well. \n\nOverall, they are a solid burger place. A bit pricey but I do think they are good. \n\nOh, one more thing, if you're dieting,....The Bleu Ribbon is 1,001 calories and fries are close to 500 calories!!! (According to my \"Lose it!\" app - they could be wrong but I also believe this is an extremely high calorie meal)", "business_id": "4pZeC9W0EIiBTOJMnwG2vw", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-06-04", "type": "review"}

Nothing beyond what you can get anywhere else in this city. What takes places like this to another level is the service and the ambiance. This is what took Red Robin straight into the toilet.\n\nFrom the moment we walked in, this place felt different. I've been here off and on for years, but there was a weird vibe in the air. I knew it was going to be a memorable visit after the hostess asked if we were \"going to need a high chair for that?\" while gesturing at our 9 month old daughter.\n\nWe were seated fairly quickly, which was nice, and our server seemed average, didn't tell us about anything new, didn't ask us if it was our first time at Red Robin (usually they do, and it wasn't, but still, try a little), and didn't bring us any silverware or napkins. Took our drink order, took our order, and left.\n\nShe knew we had a baby with us, and knew that she had just taken an order from the table of 8 behind us, and didn't bother to consider bringing the fruit cup for our daughter or my wife and I a basket of fries ahead of time since we'd be waiting a bit due to the large ticket in queue ahead of us. She didn't even bother checking on our drink situations in the meantime. Just went all ghost and ignored us.\n\nIn this meantime, my wife and I are entertaining our daughter and looking and watching around us. She notices the manager checking in with other tables and rolling her eyes a bit after a few exchanges with customers. I notice a few scoffs and eye-rolls among the staff, and start to get bothered by how the staff is acting like this job is beneath them.\n\nAnother server brings us our food. I had asked for a side of sauce that doesn't show up, but she gets it promptly. I had asked for no tomato on the burger, but was talked over so she must not have heard it. No big deal.\n\nWe go to serve some fruit to our daughter, but we still don't have any silverware or napkins, so we ask and some are brought reasonably promptly. And set right in front of our 9 month old daughter. Not the brightest of plans to set metal forks and knives in front of any small child, but especially one who is currently fussing a bit at not having any food.\n\nAt no point does the manager come by to check on us. Our server barely says another word to us after handing us the bill. They coasted this entire time, why did I expect them to suddenly make any effort? Because I thought they would want us to come back.\n\nI'm of the belief that if you think your job is beneath you, then you should prove it. You never know who is watching or who you're serving, and who may be able to help you get out of the job that you don't really like. I mean, there are so many places to get a mediocre burger, you may as well offer above and beyond service to make it stand out.\n\nI guess when even the manager is rolling her eyes at customers, the rest of the staff begins to believe that kind of behavior is acceptable.", "business_id": "4pZeC9W0EIiBTOJMnwG2vw", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-06-29", "type": "review"}

Applebees is typically our ideal location for nights we plan out, due to their awesome happy hour. We usually go to one particular location but on occasion we will go to this one (44st and Thomas). I've been to this location maybe 8 times. Every single time, we leave incredibly dissatisfied. The food is cold or tastes old. The drinks are always watered down.\n\nThe last time we went was a few weeks ago. My boyfriend had just got off work and wanted to have some drinks after a long day. We decided to go to Applebees, once again, for some food and drinks. Since this location was nearer, we decided to give it a shot.\n\nI ordered the nachos. Because I'm a vegetarian, I ordered it without the chili cheese sauce. How hard is it to get nachos wrong? My boyfriend ordered the two for $11.99 meal and got the blackened steak and chicken parmesan pasta. To drink, I ordered a strawberry daiquiri and he ordered a Dos Equis beer. The drinks sat at the bar for ages as we waited for the waitress to deliver it. By the time we received them, they tasted watered down- even the beer. \n\nFinally our food arrived. The nachos looked great, as did his food. However, looks can be deceiving. Everything about the nachos was disgusting. The cheese (queso blanco sauce) was cold, as if the nachos had been sitting around. The chips tasted old and stale. My boyfriend's steak was tough and very small. And the chicken pasta was cold as well.\n\nThe waitress (I believe her name was Taylor), wasn't very attentive. I don't blame her for the quality of the food, but the service could have been better. When we asked for the check (after I could only manage to eat some of the nachos) my boyfriend decided to inform her about the old taste of the chips. The waitress informed us that we needed to tell her earlier, which was understandable. She went on to explain the old taste could have come from the fact that the fresh batch of chips were just currently being fried, so my batch was most likely older, which obviously did not sit well with me. \n\nWe paid, and even tipped decently (15%), left quietly, and vowed to never ever go there again.

I have a rule when it comes to food establishments and this place does follow suite. Most often than not the little mom and pop shop hole in the wall. . (( and this place is what I consider a \"dive / hold in the wall\". . )) usually have really good food. \n\nSo here is my review. And I will have to break it down into categories. \n\n---------Environment:****\nHere's the deal. If you enjoy tennis, chess, and polo. This \"aint\" your spot. If you are comfortable with wobbly tables, hard chairs the sound of beer bottles tossed into a trash can .  .then keep reading.  \nHarvey's Wineburger reminds me of Stag's Head bar. In case you don't remember that's the name of the place on Dukes of Hazard? Ok well the waitress was no where near the same looks as daisy but she had a mom and pop shop charm about her. Smiles and jokes were readily available. Chris T. and I were rather excited about possibly finding a new \"joint\" to hang out at and writing a good review. I ordered the Cheese Wineburger and Chris ordered the Super Cheese Wineburger. She mentioned something about the fries and onion rings because we would get more for cheaper or something. I didn't really hear but Chris said sure and that was good enough for me.  \n\n---------The Wait: ---------**\n\nAs we walked in the door it we found a dark bar with a grill on the left. We sat our selves hoping someone would notice. There were a couple people in there that looked like regulars chatting away about something to the line cook and I think that is what our down fall was. The food was late and the waitress right off the bat apologized as she gave us our to-go bag as we requested after franticly watching the clock. She tossed in the drinks and fries for free because of the wait.  There was a long wait for the order. I believe it was the cool jibber-jabbin to the regulars that hung up the order. \n\n---------The Food: --------- *****\n\nIf it came only to the food I would give this review 5 stars. The burgers were stacked high like it was going for a photo-op.  I like my fries a little crispy and thought they were perfect. I'm not into soggy fries. \n\nI have to make a comment on the other reviews. These are the ones about the lack of hygiene comments. This is referring to one night that they were extremely understaffed on a Friday night. I have to ask you if you ever worked in a restaurant.  I hate to tell you but that is more common than you think. Even when I worked in a 4 star restaurant at a resort. Ever watch Hells Kitchen.  .yeah. . Stick your finger in my food and see if the meat is done. . Thanks. .\n\nI have to say I have not made a final thumb up or down. Next time I go there for lunch \"and I plan on going back\" I will call ahead and order. My only issue with this place was the wait for the food. The staff was friendly in a down home manner.  The food was really good, and my only issue was the wait. \n\n---------Over all score: --------- ****\n look for another review at some point. I'm not firm on this. I will have to see if the time service issue is the same next time. \n\nUntil next time. . keep the groove and be cool.  .", "business_id": "ntJAKLAq0cXzzdFgPoo0Iw", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-08-14", "type": "review"}

Happy hour (and the weekend, apparently) had arrived early at Harvey's. \n\nJust a quick moment on the very eclectic crowd that filled this place. On my left were two appliance repairmen. On my right was a gentlemen that was pushing 80. At the pool tables were a group of what looked like college kids. Their common bond was the beer they were all putting away. I immediately made plans to return on a coming Friday afternoon, with friends in tow, and be a part of this very diverse, day drinking crowd. \n\nNow, onto the food, which is why I stopped by in the first place. I wasn't sure what a \"wineburger\" is and I can't fully say that, even now, I understand. All I know is that I ordered their standard wineburger and that it was grilled fresh for me, right at the bar. \n\nThe burger took about 15 minutes to cook and I could pretty much watch them prepare it. The same person that took my order (and delivered beers to all my fellow patrons) prepped and cooked the burger. It was fresh ground meet, pressed into a patty and they regularly pressed it into the grill with her spatula. Ultimately, it was served up on a fresh bun, which crisp lettuce, onions pickles, and melting cheese. \n\nLet me tell you that this burger was FRESH. Grease was still dripping off the sides of it. There were cracks in the edge of the burger, where they had been pressing it down into the grill. I actually had to wait a couple of minutes to eat it, as it was still TOO hot. I'm not sure of where you're going to go and get a burger that is cooked that fresh, right in front of you, and then immediately handed to you. Probably one of the freshest hamburgers that I've ever had prepared (in which I wasn't actually grilling it myself). \n\nThe onion rings were straight out of the boiling oil and too hot to eat. (I'm sure my doctor does not approve of this meal). All the condiments I could ask for were delivered promptly. The burger was hot, with just the right amount of grease, and full of flavor. This was as close to home-made as you can get.", "business_id": "ntJAKLAq0cXzzdFgPoo0Iw", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-06-08", "type": "review"}

Harvey's now accepts plastic!\n\nI've lived around the corner from Harvey's for a little over 4 years now.  I had lunch there once in the mid 1990's, and went in to watch a Suns playoff game a few years back when my friend was decked out in Spurs gear and we were nearly lynched at Half Moon.  Quick lunch with a girlfriend who was in the mood for a burger about a year ago.  \n\nWhile I love, and I do mean LOVE a good dive bar, this place scared the crap out of me.  I'm young, not hideous, female, and not of the meth-head variety - so not only did I not blend, but I felt targeted.  Sad, really.  The ONE bar within easy drunk stumbling distance from my house, and I wasn't happy going there.  During a weekday for lunch was more or less okay.  But evenings are when the freaks come out.  And I don't mean the freaks like me.  I mean the dangerous crazy ones - not just the fun crazy ones.  There's a difference!\n\nWell, enter the new roommate.

According to Echo, the bartender (yes, it's her real name.  her parents are hippies like mine), the owner has been working hard to improve the place (read: clientele) for over a year.  It shows!  \n\nEcho is three shades of awesome - the perfect gal to be running the bar!  Easy smile, quick wit, great sense of humor and the talent to mix a great drink while cooking any of the grub from the menu.  She is a one woman show and pulls it off like a champ!\n\nJune drink specials included $2.00 Beam 5 Star bourbon, Yukon Jack, and I don't remember what else.  I asked for a bourbon and coke, the roommate asked for his bourbon neat.  (Brave - cheap bourbon *needs* to be cut with something!).  The pour is solid and consistent  Oh, and did I mention you can get a mixed drink, anytime day or night for just two bucks?  For $2!!\nTwo drinks for me, two shots for him, a beer chaser for him and a cheese wineburger split between us.  Under $14!!  Holy hell, it's cheaper to drink here than it is at home!\n\nAnd at home - we don't have the entertainment of the other patrons.  Like Cowboy who would do the splits on demand.  And suggest my roommate go through the needed steps for a game of \"rodeo\" with his girlfriend. You just can't make this up!\nOh - and he bestowed slightly drunk me with a new nickname.\nApparently, I am a \"prick ass bitch.\"  I don't know how he meant it, but I am taking it as a compliment and will wear it with pride!\n\nOh, yes.

A good friend was in Harvey's in the past month, and ask me to go there with him today.  He said on his previous visit, he got a lousy hamburger and suspected something had changed.  His assessment was quite accurate.\n\nThe first thing you notice when the burger is delivered is that the bun has shrunk and that the burger patty has become perfectly round, as compared to its 'jagged' predecessor, and flattened - maybe pre-formed and frozen?  The first bite discloses the sad news:  the meat is tasteless, rubbery, and absolutely nothing like the burger that has kept the joint in business 40-plus years.  Astonishingly, you can no longer taste any hint of wine in the burger.  My guess is that the rubbery consistency of the meat (they OBVIOUSLY have changed their supplier and/or grade) rejects the wine poured on it like water on Bullfrog sunscreen.    \n\nWe had heard about the ownership change several months ago with someone commenting that \"oriental owners\" had taken over.  The smaller microwaved-tasting bun and the Birkenstock meat are clear signs the new ownership has resorted to use of cheap ingredients - specifically the meat - the landmark's staple - to squeeze more profits while raising prices that are unrecognizable to Harvey's regulars.  \n\nIt's quite sad.  This was one of my favorite places in Phoenix - a wineburger and a game of pool - never crowded - that old dive charm...and hands down in the top 5 best burgers in town.  Apparently the new owner(s) believe all they need is a 40-year reputation.

Usually it is pretty quick even though there are lines in the drive-thru as usual.\n\nI decided to Yelp this place today though because it is either extreme coincidence or racism that occurs each time I go. I honestly don't care either way, but I think it is interesting to report..\n\nI am a Caucasian adult male, and I commonly have African American adult males ringing me up or handing me the GIANT bag for the one order of french fries. Every single time so far they avoid looking at me, don't ask me if I need anything or any questions, and beyond that they literally do not say a WORD. Even when I say 'thank you' before I leave it is ignored.\n\nToday though, which is also why I wanted to write a review, FOR THE FIRST TIME, I was asked if I wanted ketchup, and my fiance didn't want any, but I was glad that someone thought about how they never give you anything, not even salt, on the side, and wanted to make sure the order was okay. The funniest joke about this was that he was an older Caucasian adult male. He even responded when I said 'thank you'. That is what made the difference of treatment stand out to me. I always assume fast food workers won't say a word, but this particular experience painted a weird picture over the different visits.\n\nI wish I would have asked his name.

The food cooked by Julio is wonderful.  The wings are the best in town.  They are fried then tossed in mild, honey, fire or a few other sauces and then fried again.  They are they best wings.  I saw that others posted that they seem smaller but, that could be because you are getting a wing that is really crispy.  They aren't cooked a bit then drenched in a sauce then put on a plate. Yuk!  They are given a quick drench in the frier and crispy.  Bravo Julio.  The waitress' are wonderful.  Be careful because as \"Ron White\" say, \"I have been over served\".  They have cabs waiting and I since I drive by in the mornings I have to laugh but feel relieved that there are cars in the parking lot and the \"over served\" took a cab.  On Saturday's they have the best Prime Rib in town and for under $17.  you get the Prime Rib, salad and a baked potato.  I also love the tacos special.  I thought it was taco Tuesday but maybe it's Taco Thursday.  Great special.  Now I must say that it's a old neighborhood bar in a old little strip mall.  Growing up down the road since the 60's I saw how the bar used to be.  It was where the men and \"drunks\" would go to drink.  I always say that it was my friends and I that changed the place.  My husband would go there with some friends and slowly slowly I would go.  I would be dressed up and feel very out of place.  Eventually about three years later I saw the change that I fell we instigated in about 2005.  It is now a tavern that you can take your girl to, if they are open to a \"tavern\".  I will warn you that because it is in a little strip joint they can have some plumbing issues and sometimes you may get a septic fume.  I just say \"oh well that's JT's\".  The people, service, drinks and cost are worth it.  I like the low lights and the mini Christmas lights strung and all the old memorabilia and hundreds of patron photos on the wall.  It will always be a bar where I know I can go in, sit at the bar and start up a conversation and have a great time.

I wasn't crazy about the chili. I love the heartiness of it and the portion.

I searched for options on the internet, and read reviews for various places around town. Places way out in Mesa and Gilbert were an awful long haul for me, especially since one can never be sure how the reviews will actually stack up against the reality once you arrive and try the food. So I decided to make the relatively short drive over to the Chicago Hamburger Company.\n\nI had my first Chicago Style Vienna Beef Hotdog in Chicago, back in about 1986. I love the \"pop\" when you bite into the hotdog, and the flavors of the relish, peppers, and other ingredients that make a Chicago Style Hotdog what it is - especially with Vienna Beef inside. I have repeated the experience in Chicago over the years, and when living in the Minnesota, I found great places to go to relive those experiences. Fast forward to Arizona. \n\nI've had experiences that were close, but not quite there. I arrived at Chicago Hamburger Company hoping for the real deal.\n\nEven as indicated in the ratings, this is not a place to go for pleasant ambiance. It is strictly you order food at the window, they make food, you take it with you, or sit at a fairly clean table to eat it. No frills, just hopefully, the taste you came to enjoy.\n\nThe menu was straightforward. There was no line, so I ordered my Chicago Style dog, and because they might be interesting, garlic fries. My food was brought to me pretty quickly at the table I had chosen by the front windows. I was glad I had gotten there when I did, because a line had formed, and was getting longer by the second. \n\nThe fries were loaded with garlic, which is a good thing, but the fries were so heavy and greasy that after eating two, I had to toss them. Good idea, but way too heavy. \n\nMy Chicago Style Dog had all of the right ingredients, including the poppy seed bun. The hot dog, however, lacked flavor and there was no \"pop\" biting into it. I'm guessing that the hot dog sat in hot water for too long, and that the flavors were leached out and the texture compromised. For all the great toppings, that Chicago Style Dog was a bust. I ate it, but the experience was disappointing. \n\nThey had a sign up proclaiming their home made milkshakes, so I decided to try one to overcome my disappointment. I ordered banana, and only had to wait a couple of moments for it. As I drank it on my way home, I thoroughly enjoyed it, although it didn't quite fill the void left by the disappointing Chicago Style Dog,\n\nI'm going to guess they are called\" the Chicago Hamburger Company\", and not \"The Chicago Style Hotdog Company\" for a reason... Maybe one day I'll go try a burger - but not another hot dog.", "business_id": "iNvY0zAlaD_ye7Z6rHu-Ug", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-08-18", "type": "review"}

I'm working nights from 6pm to 6am, and after putting in a 12 hour shift, sometimes a man wants to have a damn drink, get something to eat, read the newspaper, relax a bit.

As with any bar opening at this hour, there is your contingent of old man alkeeholic regulars, but this particular place also seems to be popular with the nurses getting off the night shift at a nearby hospital.

APPARENTLY, there is no food served on the patio, nor is the consumption of food that you have brought out to the patio yourself tolerated.

They give you a little Tag to place on your table and its brought out to you. The young mad that brought it out to me was very nice and had another tray with him offering Ketchup, Napkins, utensils. \nOn to the food! Chicken Bites were SUPER Hot!

Never had bad service or food 4 that matter, but notice a marked improvement each time I visit. We decided 2 visit as the previous day we missed dining here on account of their hours (which I think is pretty ingenious). I'm sure they get a good portion of their business due 2 the fact they close @ 2pm, (unless it's fri open till 8p 4 dinner) so if u snooze u lose! Places like Denny's that r open 24/7 r probably put on the back burner by people that like them because u can go anytime & they'll always b there (except 4 the loc8ions that have shut down).\n\n   I remember back in the day this property used 2 b a bar (named Last Call or something 2 that effect) w/ a weird shaped roof 2 look like a sports arena & there were a few Xs when near accidents almost occurred as drunkards leaving there were almost turned in2 speed~bumps staggering across the road right in2 traffic, oblivious 2 any danger. Glad that's long gone & now replaced by a 60's style place that puts 5 & Diner 2 shame & probably had something 2 do w/ the L8 Nifty 50's & Ed Debevic's being out of business as far as Gr8 pricing 4 Better food w/ Generous portions. \n\n   1derful classic look decor w/ black & white tiled bar & funny themed signs/collectables throughout. When u come in, make sure u stand a li'l 2 the right (not enough 2 fall in a diner's lap) but enough where u can b seen 2 b seated as their busy tending 2 patrons inside unless u opt 4 grabbing a spot @ the bar top. Their windows have been upgraded 2 the frosted logo/design which helps keep u from cooking while w8ing on ur grub & the bright sun out of ur eyes while staying cooler, Nice!\n\n   Service can b w/ a smile or none depending on who u get as ur w8ress but never had bad & would gladly take their worst over what we went thru @ Kiss the Cook!! I also like witnessing other servers helping out other tables w/ refills, clearing pl8es etc which made us wanna tip them 2 (since they were actually friendlier than our w8ress) but hey, she didn't bark @ us or fling our pl8es like frisbees either so I can handle non~smiling (better than being nause8ingly fake/phony if not naturally 'nice').\n\n   Gr8 lamin8ed menus w/ breakfast on 1 side/lunch on the other & I dig the novel concept of the booth tables w/ local places advertising their business/services (actually jotted down a few of interest 4 future reference). What was ordered: a Veggie omelette chock full of spinach, tomato, onion, mushroom, broccoli florets topped w/ sliced avocado, hash browns, a crispy on the outside fluffy inside waffle w/ all natural syrup, an AMAZING Banana Muffin (shoulda got 2), texas style toast w/ grape & mixed berry jelly, perfect no lumps grits w/o being soupy, & apple juice. EVERYTHING was DIvine in complimentary flavors, textures, freshness & portion!!\n\n   What woulda made this 5*? Bring back your AWESOME Bread Pudding we planned on sharing, that YUMMiness was the *Bomb* & we were disappointed not 2 get slightly tipsy from the bourbon or whatever it was made w/. Perhaps that's why they removed it from the menu/no longer offer it. Can see it now: 'No officer, I haven't had anything 2 drink, I just came from that diner & all I had was some bread pudding!'

And the breakfast was okay.  It was... well... average.  I'm no cook- I'm a career girl.  But my breakfasts made at home KILL over what we got.  I was expecting breakfasty fireworks and culinary glory after a week of dieting and restraint.  It was a rare Sunday morning alone with my husband... no kids for a few glorious hours... and we decided to monumentally Have Breakfast.  \nI, of course, consulted my fellow Yelpers, who are generally the smartest, best, and brightest in the world... and having been to Giant Hamburgers for,well, a Giant Hamburger,years previously (which was FREAKING AMAZING) I thought that I could not go wrong in suggesting this place to my husband.  Many Yelpers highly recommended G.H. for breakfast so HOW could we go wrong?  And off we went.\nBetween the two of us, we were able to sample a fair range of food.\nOkay, so the toast was just cheap bread (think 2 loaves for $1 at a bread outlet... it shreds apart when you look at it sideways) the eggs were very plain and bland... bacon was okayyyyy (and I love bacon with an unholy passion so it's rare that bacon doesn't blow my skirt up) but just cheap, thin cuts, not particularly underdone but not the usual glory that bacon is.  I will say that I did somewhat enjoy the biscuits and gravy, but I would swear to you on any religious book that the biscuits were pre-packaged generic, not fresh/hand-made.  \nThe staff there is truly nice, and I like the personal service.  Saying hello.  Eye contact.  Genuine niceness.  This was consistent with my experience there a few years back, and it hasn't changed.  This kind of services is worth BUCKETS of cred in my book.\nWhat I *SEVERELY DISLIKED* was being the only english-speaking people in the restaurant for the last 15 minutes of our stay.  At one point, all the staff were speaking spanish, and after one older couple left, all of the diners were speaking spanish, and it was as though we had been transported to someplace nestled deep inside the manky heart of Guadalupe.  But without great food.  It was uncomfortable enough that we finished up, left some food behind, and bailed a little quicker than we probably would have. \nSo, although I am a big fan of the Giant Hamburgers at Giant Hamburger... I just didn't feel all the breakfasty love that other reviewers did.", "business_id": "AoO0FJyUm01lmIJJTcPWEQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-08-28", "type": "review"}

Owner and employees alike are very friendly. As far as the food-customize your chicken or burgers to how you like it. My husband had ordered here once before and didn't like it. Standard burger is salad dressing and double cheese. He didn't prefer the fries. This time he went with ketchup, no cheese, lettuce and tomatoes. He said it was very good. He was glad there wasn't cheese to block the flavor of the meat. I had chicken with green chile and cheese. Good but very messy. I had a bite of peach pie that was very flavorful with big pieces of peach. Yum!\n\nAs for the response from the owner... Proof of how warm and friendly they are. \nI believe in diversifying so next time-pancakes with bacon! I haven't read any reviews on the pancakes yet.

Not only are the burgers here tasty, but I love the fact that you get to pick and choose the toppings from their self-serve produce and condiment bars. One of my favorite things on french fries is Heinz 57 sauce and Fuddrucker's is truly awesome for including that amongst its vast condiment selection.\n\nAs a professed condiment whore, I was thrilled to discover a new flavor of Tabasco I have never encountered before... and I like to think I really know my Tabasco products, having lived in Louisiana for years. This Fuddruckers special-orders the Sweet & Spicy variety of Tabasco which is not only great on a burger, but would work as an egg-roll dipping sauce. Knowing that I must have it for home use, my dining partner graciously approached the manager who arranged to allow him to purchase a bottle. This was just one example of how efficient, helpful, and friendly the staff here are. Next visit, I will demand to meet the one who refers to himself only as \"Mr. Crusty Baker\" (see photos).\n\nThe restaurant also has a lot of shiny fun decor evoking shameless Americana and Route 66 roadside culture. The bright colors and the overindulgence in fast food goodness contributes to a heightened state of arousal that can only be described as a \"Burger Party Contact High\". You can just feel the burger love... the afterglow punctuated by the difficult click of the seat belt as you strap in for a ride back to a somber, less-gluttonous reality.", "business_id": "-h1WpfgqAmJcJDqyXXJ2og", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-08-21", "type": "review"}

Something about the name in collaboration with the tropical sign that makes you feel like you are going to a wonderful amusement park for adults.

Where dolphins spray you with mist from their little snorkel holes and Ariel gives you a lap dance. Okay, I probably took that a little too far, but you get the idea.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the REAL Islands isn't much different than my fantasy restaurant in the Bahamas.

What's better is a hamburger that I don't have to cook - so I stopped by Islands for some burger-goodness. The service was very fast. I ordered a drink and within seconds it was on the table. As the drink neared its end, another appeared promptly. The glass was never empty, which being someone who is constantly thirsty, is a good sign. \n\nThe burgers now come with the endless fries. I was there previously and the fries had to be ordered separately. I found the fries to be very good. A little crunchy, but not too crunchy. The burger was a good size. I cut it in half and could only finish one half. I went with the Hula - which is a cheeseburger with Swiss, tomato and mushrooms. The burger was a little messy. It had condiments on it and the combination of condiment and grease made for a messy burger. Most guys don't really mind messy food, and I am among that list. What I didn't like was the burger was extremely salty. I assume the mushrooms were saut\u00e9ed probably in garlic salt - but I think there was a bit much.

I may be bias since I used to live in Hawaii and had the pleasure of enjoying local island cuisine for many years.   The only thing Hawaiian about ISLANDS is the reproduction decor and the addition of pineapple & teriyaki items on the menu.   ISLANDS BURGERS seems a bit more \"Southern Cali boy - who had a knack for naming his restaurant's burgers after the places that he visited in Hawaii\"...which is pretty much how this restaurant was founded.  \n\nDo not read me wrong and confuse my love for authentic with the passion of a dream.  These burgers are NOT fast food.    You can rest asured that you will get a good, decently cooked, restaurant burger, and it is BIG.   Other items available on the menu include, soups, tacos, salads, ect.  \n\nTwo people can easily split a burger, share an appetizer, and walk out stuffed full.   My favorite is probably the Kilauea Burger with avocado added.   It is a superb blend of spicy (jalepenos), creamy (avocado & ailoi), and crunchy (batter fried, thinly sliced red onion).   Suprisingly, my husband - who HATEs onion - loves this burger.    I think he enjoys it because the onions are mild in flavor and cut so thin they dont have the normal onion texture.  It is pure CRUNCH!    I always ask for extra chipotle aioli so that it drips from every corner of my mouth. mmmm.....   all burgers are served with an unlimited amount of fries.  \n\nThe atmosphere is casual, family, booth seating, w/a separate bar area.  I would compare it to a Chili's with a tropical surfer vibe.   \n\n I enjoy this particular Islands location.  It is close to the Fiesta Mall but not on the main mall circle.   It gets crowded but you are not fighting all the riff raff of the cranky exhaused shoppers.  \n\nBonus: \nFull bar with Blue Moon on tap.   \nMixed drinks are good and strong.   \nTuesdays - Kids Eat Free.", "business_id": "ASNxwg9dD4-_F4H1uNN2KQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-08-15", "type": "review"}

It should have been my first sign to turn around and leave.

The indoor playground had only four tables in a wide open room, with two of them taken and one filthy, I opted for the only table available. The chair was sticky as we sat down. Already, before eating, my stomach churned at the thought of the impending food poisoning. \n\nEverything was filthy at this location. I regret not grabbing my kids kicking and screaming and dragging them from the restaurant.\n\nBut it wasn't until I noticed the large rat house-style trap on the side of the building that I realized what I'd just subjected my family to. \n\nNeedless to say I will not be returning. The kids got a head-to-toe sanitizer bath in the car and a full bath as soon as we got home, in hopes of killing some of the germs that are no doubt crawling on every inch of their skin as a result of playing in the playground. \n\nI would rather brave the 115 degree playground than return to this restaurant!

The manager, a young guy, had a headphone on and was rude with my dad (my DAD--the poor man is gonna be 70, and he's one of the most patient ppl ever--WTH?). I had to bark at the manager-kid for him to stop his rudeness. I also called him on his odd behavior of asking me if I wanted our drinks to be larger for (xyz cents more)--I said, we're eating in--we get free refills--are you on drive-thru mode or something? That's when he decided to get the chip off his shoulder, at least w/ me.\n\nMy dad's Bk topper was smashed down and looks nothing like the pic...very flimsy.  Don't get that.  Also, when did BK start having sucky, overcooked, fatter fries? They used to have a slim version something like McDonald's only soggier.

Let's start by my arrival, I got a good parking spot up front, it's in a unique type of building and parking lot so the entrance is almost facing the road...as I walked in I noticed there was no one behind the counter as I looked around, I see this women Maria(name tag) in the back talking to a couple with a baby at the back table, she shyly greats me and says hey...as she goes behind the counter she asks to take my order, not very friendly to say the least.\n\n So I ordered the double whopper combo medium with cheese and bacon, I asked if could substitute my fries out for chicken fries and she says this is not possible, I would have to get the chicken fries as a separate order....so I do...total comes out to $12.30 seems like a lot for burger combo with just chicken fries...but it is what it is...fast food isn't even cheap anymore. \n\nSo the restaurant is pretty clean for the most part and besides the couple Maria was talking to no one else was in there.\n\nLet's talk about my food, I got it for there, I always do this now, because I have given up on drive-thru's getting my order right, most of the time they fuck it up even if the screen is correct.\n\nThe burger...no taste at all...like eating some moist cardboard, the bacon was stiff and even thou I got a double whopper, they only put one slice of cheese on it. the tomato's used were a bit green, and were the top of the tomato by the stem, so it was like a tomato wheel with no center and in general it was not that good. The chicken  fries, were sitting on the counter when I placed my order, they were definitely old...they were a dark brown a sign that the fryer grease need to be changed and extremely chewy and not warm at all...I will never eat these again if this is what they are suppose to taste like. The french fries were the only thing that was good.\n\nHow can you fuck up fries thou...seriously. this place should get 1 and a half stars at best.\n\nAs I am finishing up I see the women Maria was talking motion to Maria and she motions back to go up to the counter after I had been there about 15 minutes, I saw no money exchanged but Maria provided this women with a pretty hefty tray of food. I did not see any money exchanged so I assume she gave it away...at least someone got hooked up here...as far as my food and service experience goes I didn't.", "business_id": "z8DlBX3FNJUgCVFHN2BPnQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-07-21", "type": "review"}

I was late for breakfast on the way to work and curious to try their cronuts. Wait. WTF are cronuts you say? No not crow nuts. Not the nads of a bird. Not the testicles of Croatian or Cro-Magnon men either. Cronuts are croissant donuts. Wait for it. The Cronut\u2122 brand and product is a registered trademark of Dominique Ansel Bakery internationally. There - so with that out of the way, Crack In The Box can't officially use that term to call them that. So I found myself feeling stupid when I actually went to the drive thru and asked for cronuts. Huhhh??? was the response I got. Oh. I mean \"croissant-doughnuts.\" You know? That freaking pastry formerly known as a cronut? So then she understood and I could pay and GTFO and on my way to work. This location does the credit card slider on the outside so you don't have to give some sketchy degenerate your credit card to actually hold for too long - you just do it yourself. Extra star for that. Now I've never had the real trademark Cronut but I had something that resembles it at a convention once. These that I got from Crack In The Box were donut shaped and not croissant flakey at all. In fact, the outside was indistinguishable from a regular sugar donut. Well, maybe not THAT sugary but still sweet from some sugar and cinammon. I cracked open the package to make sure I actually got 3 croissant doughnuts and not anything else like a chicken head or any of the stuff you hear about in urban folktales/the internets. MMMM. It actually smelled nice and fresh and cinammony. So I get to work and instead of getting straight to work I'm taking pictures of my food. See photo - money shot/centerfold of a croissant doughnut doing the splits. Smelled great and is actually fluffy like a croissant in the middle. Had to try it once. Not sure if I'll ever get the craving for it again but if I do, I know where to go. Nothing personal, Jack.

The many times we have been here before the service was great now it has slowly gone downhill. One waitress we had a few occasions ago was excellent. She was friendly, took our order in a reasonable time, brought us sauces in adequate amounts (I hate it when they give you a dinky portion that you know you're just going to end up asking for more soon), we never needed to flag anyone down and she came over frequently but not too frequently to see if we were doing okay.\n\nThe last few times were terrible. I think this is either the result of inadequate management or disorganization by everyone. Possibly both, okay I must watch too many Kitchen Nightmares or something. One time we were seated to the right of the restaurant when you come in, by the bar area. A girl came and took our drink orders, myself partaking in an endless root beer float (only a little over $3 I might add) and my partner ordering a margarita. Some time passed (10 min) and then we had to flag someone down to get them to bring us our drinks. Margarita was disappointingly small for the price but root beer float was fabulous as usual, they forgot the spoon which also had to be flagged down for.\n\nOrdering time comes which was during the span of time waiting for drinks and so forth. Food takes awhile to come out, meanwhile the waitress is serving as the bartender for the whole restaurant making drinks one after another while waiters whiz by in and out carrying drink orders and we are left wondering when can we get a refill and where is our food? Food finally comes and someone else brings it and we discover my partner's food is cold. Sent it back and it comes back better but the whole experience was aggravating, no set server for a table and to keep flagging down people for things. It was like the equivalent to being seated next to the bathroom or kitchen, forgetful service and confusing, crowded and busy servers rushing by.\n\nThe next time we came they tried to sit us there again! We replied with a resounding NO and the girl looked very \"butthurt\" for lack of a more flavorful word. We explained why but she didn't seem to be too concerned. We sadly looked at the people who were sitting in that area, aware of the service they were about to receive. Finally we ended up where we wanted to sit and the server was just okay, not very friendly. I hate it when I look at other tables in a restaurant and I see their servers are way more friendlier than mine and then I end up having \"server envy.\" \n\nSummary: weekends are very crowded, if you are only two people they might try to stick you in the \"forgetmenot\" area. Families and larger groups they seem to move to the main dining area as I noted. I think I'm just going to find another location. Although I dislike chains mostly, Red Robin is a decent place to grab a burger $8-11 and don't forget those bottomless fries.", "business_id": "zoHCkEiIKfXiLTKUqKEojQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-06-13", "type": "review"}

I like to play a game called 'How many seconds from the time I finish placing my order until the time I have my order in hand and am driving away?'.  Today it was 24 seconds - now that's fast food!  They are so quick when taking the order, charging at the first window, and delivering your food to you at the second.  And that was around the time of the lunch hour rush.  My favorite game, however, is called 'Don't come to a complete stop when picking up my food'.  Since they usually have my order hanging out the window before I even get there, I can just roll right through, grab my food while still in motion, and be on my way (With a \"Thank you\" of course).  This location usually has hot girls working there too.  Did I mention that the girls at both windows said \"have a good day!\"?.  Well now I did.  In fact, the second one even asked me how I was doing, and while I know their bosses tell them to say those things, my friends at Wendy's almost always sound more genuine than at other places. Many times I get the mandarin chicken salad, which is amazing, but today I got a jr bacon cheeseburger, a crispy chicken sandwich, and a frosty.

Yes, our waiter had about as much personality as Data on Star Trek the Next Generation. On another occassion, our waitress left us on the island. You know what I mean, \"here is your food, I will check on you in 45 minutes and see if you are still alive then\"  Then one fine day, we had \"Alcohol Only\" waitress. Our waitress was friendly at first until she realized we were not going to order a bevy of drinks and rack up a thick bill and hang out for an hour. We were immediately disqualified from good service the rest of the evening. On another occassion, we had the \"The Flash\"  You know this waitress. If you don't know already know what you want to order and have questions, you are given a penalty. If you ask her for her opinion, she says in a very stoned face and quick manner \"it's good\" no descriptors, no recommendations but simply \"It's good\"  Then if you pause even for  a second, she says \"I will be right back let me get this other table their drinks really quickly while I give you time to decide\"  Then we had \"Charity Case\" waitress. This waitress is probably a hardworking college student or a mother of 5 at the age of 25 who hasn't slept in 3 days. Because of her situation, it is our job as patrons to be considerate and aware of her situation so if she messes up our order, forgets to refill our drinks, or gives us a dirty look if we ask for ketchup\" we are supposed to forget all that.\n\nCONCLUSION: So you are probably wondering if the service is so bad, why do I keep coming here, the food is actually pretty good and it's darn right cheap! Seriously, you can have a full dinner for 20 bucks. It's bar food done well. But what I like is the food still tastes like bard food. It's not haughty gourmet bar food that you find at Jillys or Peyton's Place. I don't want a kaiser roll for my burger, I want a normal bun! I don't want sweet potato fries, I want regular fries! t's just sad because if the service improved, we would come here more often. The only warning with regard to the food is to stick to the classic bar food items. If you see \"shrimp\" , \"scallop\" or anything that sounds like it could be offerred at a real restaurant, don't order this item. It's rather funny because people who had bad experiences here ordered the \"Jalapeno Shrimp Caesar salad Wrap\"..oklay that item doesn't exist but you get the idea.. Think burger, nachos, fried cheese, chicken sanwhich! Outside of those items, the food is prepared in a replicator hence the reason it doesn't taste good. The servers come in that rare cross breed of ASU apathy with \"West Side\" sensibility. I would also recommend you adhere to it's strict dress code if you want good service. If you are male, wear a wife beater, shorts, flip flops, Oakley sunglasses, and preferably a goatee. If you are female, wear the same thing as the guys but no goatee, instead substitute that with a rose tattoo on the back of your neck", "business_id": "7-4FxYXhNUS2lhpUb_q5-w", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-07-31", "type": "review"}

I usually shy away from restaurant slash bars with loud music and loud patrons.  On the other hand, they have high chairs, a kids menu with a word search, a number tracing picture, and tic tac toe.  There are nine, count'em, nine kid's menu items, and four are vegetarian friendly.  And there is a \"family room\".  I was still not convinced.  The first time I came here there was a party going on in the family room, and it seemed like we were just crammed in the corner of the restaurant.  So my daughter's school had a fundraiser at Teakwoods.  Fifteen percent of the bill went to support the school.  Maybe kid friendly, but still not connived.  Could the school be wrong?  The place was slammed and, at first, I thought we would be waiting for long periods of time for not showing up early, but management was helping pick up the slack and I assume that it was an unusually high volume Monday.  My daughter was a little skeptical about throwing peanuts on the floor, so I'm not sure if that counts as kid friendly.  She would hold out the peanut shell and watch it fall in disbelief.  There is also a video game machine with two classic arcade games, one was Galaga, one of those hutin' shootin' games, and a claw.  I resisted my daughter's urge to spend my money.  And then I noticed that the kids were playing Duck, Duck, Goose on the floor in the family room.  Okay, this places is definitely kid friendly.  How dare you think otherwise.

After finding other worthy wing options in the greater Phoenix metro area, I would qualify these wings as completely respectable. I can testify that the wings here are properly sauced, reasonably crispy, and meatier than most. I know some of you gals out there are very particular about the ever-important meat-to-bone ratio, so this is why I mention it. (There's a dirty joke in there somewhere... I just KNOW it!)\n\nAnyhow, I'm a big fan of the unlimited peanuts/throw-your-shells-on-the-floor thing, so kudos for that. Here, however, is my main gripe: You really oughta chill your salads! I come here for the wings and I often order a side salad (perhaps to feel better about my chicken-meat gluttony or just to be right with that whole Atkins-on-crack approach). Every time I've been here, the salad has been a bit less than palatable because it sat somewhere warm before being brought to me. Chilled salad, good -- warm salad, bad!\n\nSo although my heart now belongs to other wing-serving establishments, I'll never forget you, Teakwoods. I respect you for your frosty beers and your bountiful nuts. And every now and then I may have to come back and sample your goodies. Just a nibble or two... to remind me of the love we once shared.

Got here before my friend did and sat in the crowded dining section in the east wing of the restaurant. Noticed the peanut shells on the floor - sorta creating the same effect as sawdust on the floor at Bill Johnson's Big Apple restaurants. My friend was bragging that this place had the hottest wings he never tried. Wuss. One of his friends tried the hottest wings on sale here and started sweating and crying and could not finish them. Over time and many beers I've heard that same legend over and over stretch to include emergency vehicles, demonic possession, terrorists/US military wanting the recipe so it could be weaponized, fire-breathing and whatnot until I finally said - ok we're going there - I need to know for myself. I ordered the suicide wings - traditional. No waivers had to be signed, nobody standing around with fingers on 911 speed dial button. Seemed like a standard thing to order at this place. Ok. Cool. When the wings came, they looked like any other \"hot\" wings. Tabasco colored little wings just sitting there waiting for me. Grabbed the first one and took a bite. Tasted vinegary hot sauce - good stuff. But the burn kept up as if all my teeth suddenly grew little wicks and turned into lit candles. Whoa - a CONSTANT burn even after the wing is done. Took the next wing and same thing. Ended up instinctively grabbing my beer to put out the fire. Wow. Perhaps the story had some merit - Teakwood's suicide wings aren't wussy at all like a lot of other places that claim to have super hot wings. When I finally got through all the wings, my friend noticed that I consumed four beers in the time it took him to drink one. Most times we go to a bar it is the exact opposite situation. Our waitress was even nice enough to bring me a tall glass of ice water as well. I'll have to admit, I have recently been on a quest for the hottest wings and most places have failed to impress - haven't finished the quest but I'm putting a flag down here for now as the hottest I've had so far. Was a bit concerned I'd find out the true meaning of \"fire in the hole\" the next day but fortunately that wasn't the case. Funny thing we got here at peak dinner time and when we left just around 11pm the place was a ghost town. If I didn't see another table of customers in a far corner I would have thought they were closed. They're open till midnight most days except for weekends when they close a little later.

The sides of Jalapeno & Cheddar Mashed Potato Pie and the Macaroni & Cheese were both great options.\n\nIn summary, great service, good food but pricey, but awful layout and setup of the restaurant.

It's certainly nothing fancy. It's split into 2 parts. It's just a very large room with somewhat of a warehouse feel. The main section has a bunch of low tables, a few high tops, and a bar to the left side. I'm not sure what it is about the layout of this place that confuses me. Picture a school cafeteria. Lots of tables set up in rows. Good for groups because pushing them together is a cinch considering you are basically in the lap of the table next to you anyhow. If you need to get up to use the restroom, it feels like you end up rubbing your ass on the head of the person behind you trying to squeeze by. The side area has some booths and more cramped seating and seems more \"family appropriate\". \nThey do show music videos, which is pretty awesome considering some of the tunes people choose. Some real old school gems are thrown in that provide some entertainment. They also have darts and a Big Buck Hunter. TVs are scattered about. \nThe menu is big and diverse. Typical bar food (wings, burgers, sandwiches, salads) even pasta as well as Mexican food. Something for everyone! Service is friendly and fast. I usually have Lori, who is terrific. \nI would up the rating if it wasn't such an odd seating arrangement. I'm not in middle school anymore and prefer to keep those days behind me. \n*Happy hour has some good drink specials. \n*The water tastes like dirt from a pond, so spring for a bottle if you are in the need for some re-hydration. \n*There is no patio or outside seating here.", "business_id": "_TWT58PWunYIyPgpz1fuog", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-06-06", "type": "review"}

We were excited about a place that serves up hot dogs and warrants five stars!\n\nEven though they sold burgers and sandwiches, you have to order some type of sausage or dog when that's what they are famed for.  My friend and I opted for the Polish Sausage ($3.25), the BF chose the Bratwurst ($3.29), and my other friend went for their Regular Hot Dog ($2.05).  I read about their fabulous milkshakes, so chose a Chocolate Shake ($3.05) and their amazing Onion Rings ($2.59).\n\nI requested all the sausages and dogs to be loaded up with everything, which looked like it included onions, peppers, a pickle spear, relish, ketchup, and mustard.  I must admit, they did look a bit smaller than what I'm used to.  And the cashier couldn't tell the difference between the Polish Sausage and the Bratwurst.\n\nIn terms of the hot dog, my friend was not impressed. He said the hot dog itself tasted like any other hot dog, but he did like all the fixings on top.  The polish sausage tasted a lot better than the bratwurst in my opinion.  You can see lots of spices and stuff in the polish sausage, but there wasn't enough kick for my tastes.\n\nThe chocolate milkshake was thick and made from real ice cream.  Their onion rings reminded me of an onion blossom because of their thin batter.  I wished they had a different kind of dipping sauce for it instead of ketchup.\n\nOverall, my experience at Ted's Hot Dogs was just okay.  Maybe it's a locals thing and you have to be a true local to really appreciate their hot dogs and sausages.  I guess I just had a little more in mind.\n\nSidenote: Cash only\n\nTotal cost: Less than $19.00 (You can see the photo of everything we ordered in the business profile pics!)", "business_id": "jJhNOhuGpIsJX5SEUFFWYQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2007-07-24", "type": "review"}

Almost....damn near a photo finish but Wieners Circle in Chicago has my #1 vote, but you know what?  Coming in second is still something to be proud of.  Teds Hot Dogs are a-m-a-z-i-n-g!\n\nWe came here 2 times during our 4 days in the desert.  Both times I left with a smile on my face and a stomach full of tube steaks.\n\nThe first day we went I got 2 regular dogs, a white hot sausage, split an order of onion rings and washed it down with a Loganberry shake.  We got in line and the man grilling the dogs kindly asks you what you would like.  You kind of shout it out and then he grabs the dogs and stacks them in order of when they are going to be cooked.  A very streamlined operation.  By the time you reach the man, they are pretty much done and then handed off to the condiment lady.  You tell them what you want on each dog.  I went with mustard, onions and their hot sauce concoction. They dish up your onion rings and make your shakes and then off you go.\n\nThese dogs are super tasty.  Everything just works so well.  They use a soft potato bun and the dogs are char-grilled over charcoal so they get a crispy/burnt like texture to them.  I devoured those things in a matter of minutes.  The onion rings are more like an onion loaf.  Pretty good.  The Loganberry shake was very good too.  Just sweet enough without overpowering it.  The shakes are a tad small though but they are the right consistency and you can easily drink it through your straw which was nice.\n\n2nd trip I got a foot-long, a regular and an Italian sausage.  This time we split fries and got another Loganberry shake.  The Italian sausage was the winner of both trips.  It was the BEST sausage I have ever had.  I got it topped with just mustard and onions.  It was perfectly cooked, snap when you bit in, but soft and almost mushy when you chewed through it.  Kind of hard to describe but god damn that was a tasty sausage.  Perfect flavors and everything.  My 2 dogs I got topped like day 1.  Mustard, onions and hot sauce.  The wife had a burger which she said was ok.  Looked kind of skimp though.  She doesn't eat dogs so she missed out.  \n\nI will have dreams about this place.  It was by far my favorite 2 meals in AZ and I would eat here all the time if I lived close.   I cant wait to find some reason to go back to AZ just to eat here.  It may even be worth the 5 hour drive just to eat these, turn around and come back.

They serve huge portions for decent prices and everything is always fresh and tasty. (Spent $8.15 for a large iced tea, all-beef hot dog, and onion rings.) The onion rings are more of a torn apart onion blossom than the traditional rings--an approach I much prefer. There are plenty of sides and toppings you can request as well, from cheese to chili to onions, 'kraut, ketchup, mustard, and all the other basics.\n\nOverall a pleasant experience and a unique flavor.

Its a plump sausage with a white color.  I got that topped with mustard and onions also.  This one didn't have as much flavor as the other 2 but it was still excellent.\n4.  Jumbo Beef Dog-  This one I got topped with mustard, onions, relish and their hot sauce.  It was a huge plump all beef dog.  It was bigger and thicker than any of the sausages.  It was great as well but I would have preferred another Italian or Brat instead of this thing....and that's saying something.....ALL of their hot dogs/sausages here are great....some are just greater than others.\n\nFries-  Real crispy shoestring fries.  They were perfect. \n\nShakes-  Loganberry.  Delicious!  Not too sweet and a perfect consistency to suck through the straw.

This is a transplant of a small Buffalo,NY hotdog chain.  The meat is flown in several times a week from Buffalo.  The dogs are great! The Weber's mustard is also a local Buffalo condiment. Don't forget the Ted's sauce on your dog too. It's basically a combination of ketchup with slightly spicey tomato relish. You can also get a foot long or a \"jumbo\" (really thick) hotdog. The \"Jumbo\" burgers are great too.  They serve Polish and Italian sausage too.  The onion rings are a great side.  You know the food is great here because there's always a line.                Be prepared to order your dogs, burgers etc while standing in line.  Don't  be one of those people that holds the line up by not having a clue what you want. If you've never been there before, read the menu posted above the grill area. You don't have to tell them the toppings you want until you reach the cash register area and your stuff is cooked.  After your order your dogs they will ask you if you want any fries or rings,  then later they will ask what you want to drink.  This type of ordering confuses some people.

I've always wanted to go, and today seemed like as good a day as any. Perfect summertime food.\n\nWalking in, the line was long and most of the tables were occupied, but I read that they move pretty fast, so I was not deterred. At times, the line stretched all the way to the back/side door, but it moved relatively quickly and no one seemed annoyed about it. The smell of the grill is amazing, and the menu is simple. In fact, it looks like they haven't changed their menu boards since the place opened in Tempe some 30 years ago :) The process may be a little disorienting for someone who hasn't been there before, but basically as you snake closer to the front of the line, someone working the grill will shout to you to get your order, and you shout it back to them. They cook your food as you get closer to the front of the line, and they seem pretty good at remembering what everyone orders. \n\nYou get to the front and confirm your order, they ask if you'd like anything to drink, fries or onion rings (get the onion rings, oh man), and any condiments or veg on your dog/burger. \n\nI ordered the all-beef dog (a bit pricier than the standard hot dog, but I know I'm not getting a mystery combo of meat) with ketchup, mustard, easy onion and a dill pickle. A word about the onion rings: I'd read how good they were, and trust me, they are. A degree thicker than onion strings that you might find on a burger, they're prepared in much the same way, in a thin flour breading, and fried crispy and golden. The serving is quite sizable, easy for two to share. A tad greasy toward the bottom of the portion, but big deal.\n\nThe hot dog was the best standard hot dog I've ever eaten. Piping hot with tons of flavor and char from the grill, it was just perfect. Coupled with the onion rings and a root beer, it was a fantastic lunch.\n\nMy dining companions got an Italian sausage, and a cheeseburger and fries. The fries seem like just regular frozen variety shoestring fries, nothing to write home about. They have lots of signage about how their onion rings are made fresh, never frozen, so stick with the house-made stuff.\n\nThe prices are very reasonable, and I'll definitely be back.", "business_id": "jJhNOhuGpIsJX5SEUFFWYQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-06-29", "type": "review"}

The grill cook was super friendly and chatted with the line, which all seemed to come out of the New York area, like the griller. \nGot two \"regulars\" with ketchup and a side of fries with chili and cheese. Not sure if it's because I ordered them to go or not, but the chili and cheese both came in to-go cups (with the chili being hot enough to almost completely melt the cup and lid) rather than on top of the fries. The two hot dogs were perfectly grilled and it comes on Aunt Hattie's brand buns - my favourite. I ordered the buns grilled too but because my order was taken by about three different people, that didn't happen. The chili seemed like Hormel brand without beans, but it was great. The side that came with my \"chili cheese fries\" was more than enough to also pour over my hot dogs. If you're getting dogs and fries, just order one side of each and it'll be plenty. The fries were thin sliced but really good  - perfectly crispy and fresh. \nTwo dogs, a regular fry, a side each of chili and cheese, and a large soda came to just over $10. \nIf you're craving for some classic American food, this is definitely the place to go.", "business_id": "jJhNOhuGpIsJX5SEUFFWYQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-07-03", "type": "review"}

I ordered the veggie dog, and my friend and I split some fries and some onion rings. I was in heaven. The hot dog was amazing, and they dressed it up exactly like I wanted it. The fries were thin (sort of like shoestring fries), which I actually like because they're great for dunking. The onion rings, however, on my first trip were awful.

Thin sliced, crispy breading - clearly made fresh to order. \nMy Italian Sausage was perfectly seasoned and had just the right level of spice. Topped with deli mustard and cooked peppers and onions. I could not have asked for a more delicious lunch.\nIn hindsight, I should have eaten the regular dog first. It was tasty. Incredibly enjoyable. But with the flavor of the Italian Sausage still on my tongue, it was a little on the boring side.

The fries tasted like the oil had gone rancid and the water tastes like it came out of the toilet.  Everything was tainted by the bad flavors.

We had a waiter who was very friendly and never had us feeling forgotten about or less important than the other customers. The food was great and orders were correct, so nothing to complain about there. The waiter doubled up as the bartender and he had the friendly persona to go with it. I'm updating my 1 star review to a 4 star since 3 would be stingy with an all around good experience. (& glad I didn't get the waitress we got last time!)\n-----EDIT-----\n\n1 Star\nI'm used to great food and service with Red Robin, but this location was very disappointing. The waitress brought us drinks with no ice, and when I asked if we could get some, she mentioned they were running low. The issue with this, is every other drink that came out of the kitchen had a normal and decent amount of ice. This was inconsistent and bothersome. \n\nThe waitress approached our table initially, and she would only interact with my husband. This followed through when she had brought more ice back in her pitcher of water, and managed to only give him ice while she managed to give me none during the next refill. \n\nJust bad service. I love the food for the price, but I won't be going back to this particular location. It's unfortunate that we have to drive out to Rio Salado when this location was conveniently located next to a Costco. No thanks.", "business_id": "x737irkRUs8ABGRc2ILLAA", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-08-13", "type": "review"}

PROs:  in the bar we were greeted by Mikela & she provided outstanding service throughout our stay.  Further, our meals were very tasty; I loved the Ensenada chicken (sauce on the side).

If you take the drive thru your taking a gamble. If you order a big mac and a coke, you might get a ham burger and an orange juice. It's like they are spinning a wheel and whatever it lands on they put in the bag. I ordered a large fench fry and they were all shit brown. I told the manager and she offered me a refund. I said, i don't want a refund, i want you guys to clean your fryers, but first, you try one of these brown frys. They think people dont undo the wrapping or look inside the box, well suprise, I looked, and I don't see bacon on my burger. So even if they get the order right, whats in the burger is another gamble. Sometimes you get an extra cheeseburger and your like, where did this come from?
