My parents saw a recommendation to visit this place from Rick Sebak's \"25 Things I Like About Pittsburgh\" and he's usually pretty accurate.  His recommendations were to try the Reuben, Fish Sandwich and Open-Faced Steak Sandwich.  We went early afternoon for a late lunch today (a Saturday) and were seated right away.  The staff is extremely friendly.  My Mom & I each had the fish sandwich, while my Dad & Brother had a Reuben sandwich.  The fish was very good, but the Reuben was to die for!  Both dishes were massive, and could very easily be shared between two people.  On top of being extremely large portions, it was incredibly affordable.  The giant fish sandwich was $8 and the giant Reuben was $7.50.  Our drinks were always filled and we were checked on several times during the meal.  We will definitely be back!!!  Oh and a bit of advice ahead of time - they take CASH ONLY.  So come prepared, but I'm pretty sure I saw an ATM there as well.  And I do believe they are closed on Sundays & Mondays.", "business_id": "mVHrayjG3uZ_RLHkLj-AMg", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-12-01", "type": "review"}

One of them, the pork chop, is one of the finest I have ever had.  Double cut, juicy and flavorful, it is an absolute winner.  Braised kale and butternut squash risotto accompany this perfect dish.\n\nI managed to sample two other dishes (courtesy of my willing dinner mates) that are also noteworthy.  The short rib ravioli is an excellent combination of tender, richly flavored beef rib and toothy pasta.  The ricotta cavatelli combines fresh, simple ingredients into a well structured dish.\n\nService was a little hit or miss the evening I was there.  Part of that may be because we were a large group and the restaurant was rather busy.  However, for an establishment of this caliber, I do expect more.

I will add that the food portions also seem to be decreasing! We went during happy hour last week and I had the worst tasting rye drink possible - described as rye with fig jam, bitters and lemon, sounded like something that cannot possibly be fucked up, but tasted like nothing but the juice wrenched out of unripe lemons - super dry and gave me a stomach ache. No fig flavor to be detected. To make matters worse, when my partner tried to ask the bartender about the drink, if it was supposed to be sooo god-aweful lemony, she responded with a \"yes, it's got lemon in it.\" When he pressed the issue, she simply repeated, \"yes, it's a lemon and fig drink.\" More frustrating than conversations with the wall. The risotto that we ordered was the size one would expect of a side dish (which is what risotto should be, but this was proposed as an entree...). It had about 5 little pieces of maitake mushroom and 6 hazelnuts in it and was otherwise flavorless. We added lots of salt and pepper. Total waste of $25 bucks. \n\nAlso, their bar seating sucks. The chairs are stationary and far away from each other, and a bit far from the bar for a shorty like me; my feet don't reach the foot bar on the chair either, so my legs fall asleep trying to sit there.", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-12-18", "type": "review"}

Here is a summary of our experience: \n\nPROS: \n- Ambiance is nice, upscale, not too loud. \n- We were able to find a low table in the bar within 15 minutes. \n- Drinks were good, generously proportioned. Cocktails were priced as expected for the type of place ($10-$14). Wine list had multiple options by the glass.\n- As for the meal, the meats were good cuts, well prepared. \n\nCONS: \n- Overall the food felt rich with creams, fats, salt without any particular inspiration showing through. The ingredients were all good and well sourced, but the finished products did not seem to elevate them in any particular way. \n- The service was high end of amateur - not what I was expecting from this caliber of restaurant. Our 30 minute wait stretched to 1hr 30min without any meaningful acknowledgement by the staff. Upon sitting we were told that they usually have \"excellent sourdough bread\", but they were out of it for tonight so we had ciabatta (which was fine, but we didnt need to hear what we didn't get to have). \n\nFOOD: (vegetarian options reviewed directly, meat options as reported by dining companions)\n- Cheese plate: Nicely prepared with a good range of cheeses. Only complaint was that the cheeses were served too cold to fully appreciate them. \n- Beet salad: the greens were good, the dressing was a bit too mild to offset the beets, the beets themselves were gritty and not particularly well cooked. \n- Squash soup: Overall very good - quite rich but flavorful. Felt like the salt and cream were taking over the squash \n- Mushroom pasta: Again quite rich and salty. Packed with high quality mushrooms but didn't feel that they were quite given justice due to the salt and butter. Pasta was high quality but again, overshadowed by the salt and butter. \n- Steak: Good cut of meat, cooked well.\n- Ragu pasta: Excellent pasta dish well cooked, reported to be almost as good as Piccolo Forno's. \n\nOVERALL: \nA similar experience at 2/3 the price would have received 3 stars, for the price of the meal this was barely a 2 star event. We won't be going back, even with the lure of 2 for 1 entrees around our birthdays - the food just isn't that good even discounting the service. I'm sure they will continue to do well with a certain crowd, but there are much better dinner options out there.", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-01-19", "type": "review"}

There weren't too many people there when I walked in, so I went right up and sat at the bar.  I was greeted right away by the bartender (Bill).  He told me which three beers he was out of (which unfortunately were the three best ones on draft), then took my order.  I started with some wings and a beer.  I only order a half dozen of the atomic flavored wings which was unfortunate, as they were some of the best wings I've had in quite a while.  As a comparison, they weren't as hot as Buffalo Wild Wings 'hot' wings, but had decent heat and great flavor.  I then had another beer and ordered a meal they had on special.  It's not what I would call bar food by any means, as it was a perfectly cooked baked chicken with vegetables and potatoes.  I got a cup of cheddar and lager soup as part of the meal too which was wonderful.\n\nOverall, I was glad to stumble across this place.

Yes, I might and will say this.\n\nAfter a frustratingly long day during a frustratingly long week at work, I decided I needed to stop here and ease my nerves with some comfort food and try out a few brews.  This, my friends, is just what the doctor ordered (no pun intended in relation to my work).\n\nMy friend had beat me there and already had one of each in front of her.  She decided on the Trailerpark Tatchos and I'm not quite sure what she had to drink, but it was interesting in an interesting glass.  The Tatchos were amazing.  Nothing more than nacho toppings on tater tots, but a brilliant idea none the less.  The mixture of tastes on the fried up tater tots was great.  In a single bite you got spicy, hot and cool.  I decided that I needed to order something else myself, as I feared that my friend might end up raising her lip and snarling at me for eating more than I should.  I got myself an order of Cloudy and a Chance of These.  I dare you to take a wild guess as to what this order pertained to.   DING DING DING...you, sir get a prize...not really.  Nothing but an order of meatballs swimming in a big huge potion of their sauce.  Served with a side of bread to sop up what the fork missed.

It was kind of hard to choose, but their nifty little binder filled with the choices made it easier.  What also made it easier was the fact that our waitress was able to make suggestions, not just guesses like most places.  \n\nDifferent flavors hitting my palate at just the right time made for a great night here.

It's always a guessing game when you pick a restaurant in a strange city. Even with reviews to check out, you never know what you might get. Ri Ra had good solid reviews, however, and was within walking distance of our hotel, which was a deciding factor!\n\nIt was fairly busy when we got there and there was a trivia round going, which was slightly annoying, since it echoed through the whole restaurant, but we were there early and once the game ended, it was much better.\n\nWe were impressed with the selection of import and local beers. I stuck with Smithwick's but my partner was a little more adventurous and tried several local NC beers, all of which were good. \n\nWe started with the hummus appeitzer, expecting the usual bowl of hummus and sliced pita. We were more than pleasantly surprised when what we got was the hummus, toasted pita, and a selection of roasted red peppers, olives, marinated artichokes, and cucumber and celery for dipping. The hummus itself was excellent, garlicky and spicy. \n\nI had the Irish curried chicken over rice and it was quite good. The curry was sweetish, but still had a nice bite to the finish. The chicken was all white meat and nicely tender, and the peppers and onions that were in the curry were delicious.\n\nMy partner had the Guinness beef and veggie stew, which was also really good. There was lots of beef in the stew and the Guinness added a really different (and delicious) flavor. \n\nOnce the trivia game was over, the atmosphere was great. Music was fun but not too loud for conversation. Our server was friendly and helpful. She made great food and drink suggestions, and even gave us info on places to check out during the rest of our trip. \n\nRi Ra is definitely a solid 4* and we'll be back the next time we're in Charlotte.", "business_id": "WuCcv_Dyd_1B_1-4jwK7sQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-12-13", "type": "review"}

Understandable but I think he could've said it differently. \n\nRestaurant is very steakhouse cozy. A little bit pub vibe, very small and quite dark. They have a bar. We were seated on high chairs. \n\nMenu personally I didn't think they offered a lot of choices but that's a personal preference.

I was even looking at other tables who were waiting on their food staring at each other or the ceiling. \n\nWhen we got our food, you would expect it to be hot. It's not.

It was a friend's 30th birthday so we wanted to go somewhere and light up a cigar to celebrate. Given Cutters is one of the few (if not only) indoor cigar smoking bars/options, your hands are kind of tied if you like cigars. I called (at 11pm) before going and was told last call was at 12:30 and the bar closes at 1am. At midnight, the waitress comes around for last call. When I ask what happened to 12:30 for last call, she says that the food and beverage director wants to shut down early - no other reason for the early closing. \n\n20 minutes later, a waitress comes over while we are finishing our cigar and drinks and says, \"Alright guys, you have to leave now\" and opens the door. If this is customer service, I'd hate to see what customer disservice looks like. I guess paying $15 worth of cutting fees for the cigars we brought with us and purchasing several drinks was not enough to buy good customer service. \n\nWe were clearly unhappy about the way we were being treated but left anyway. On the way out, the waitress holding the door makes unnecessary comments about our slowness in leaving the bar at 12:20 (which should be open until 1am). The waitress and the food and beverage director proceed to follow us out of the hotel, ask if we were staying there and threatened to have us kicked off the property. The sad part is we had not spoken with the food and beverage director up until this point so instead of inquiring about our displeasure and what happened, he immediately jumps to conclusions. Needless to say, Marriott Charlotte City Center and Marriott's Corporate Customer Service center will be receiving letters regarding this incident and the customer service of its staff. \n\nI personally hope Cutters gets what it deserves and closes up. It gives Charlotte entertainment options a bad name and the customer service was the worst I've experienced in a long time. \nCutters does not have to worry about my patronage going forward and Marriott should be ashamed to have such poor customer service associated with its brand.", "business_id": "7BVCmaxhvXgEpx7J-SQ4QA", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-12-10", "type": "review"}

Decent service, mediocre food, fairly pricey for average bar food.\n\nDetailed review:\n\nAfter taking a small fish fry break, we resumed our quest to find the best fish fry in southern Wisconsin. With the roads in poor shape thanks to the recent snow, we decided to focus our sights on local offerings, and since Tully's is \"around the corner\" from our friend's house, we decided to give it a try.\n\nWe walked in and seated ourselves; we chose a small table that was located in a section \"in front\" of the bar area and adjacent to the pool tables. The salad bar and another small dining area are located on \"the other side\" of the pool table room... Odd layout for certain.\n\nOur waitress took our drink orders and we browsed the menu, which included your typical bar fare: lots of fried appetizers, burgers, sandwiches, and so on. I'll say this - there are a ton of items on the menu; even the Friday night fish fry offered 7 varieties of fish, 4 of which are all you can eat.\n\nOur drinks arrived and we placed our orders: AYCE baked cod with a baked potato, AYCE beer battered cod with cheesy hash browns, and AYCE lake perch with hash browns.\n\nWe were informed that our meals also included a salad bar trip... Too bad we had already ordered cheese curds. \n\nBut, being the troopers we are, we ventured over to the salad bar and built a few plates. It was ok for a bar's salad, but not great by any means. My tomatoes were mushy and tasted \"off\"; broccoli was dry and obviously came from a bag. Coleslaw earned decent reviews.\n\nCurds and fish arrived at the same time. Curds were breaded and typical \"from the freezer bag\" variety. Nothing special, and not worth the $6.79 price tag.\n\nFish plates each had two pieces; baked cod was drenched in buttery water and loaded with dill flake. Hmm... It tasted ok, but wasn't as flaky, tender, or flavorful as I'd prefer. Baked potato was foil-wrapped, and nicely cooked.  \n\nBattered cod had a decent batter that had just a hint of a unique flavor (we couldn't put our finger on it, as it was tasty), but it was fairly greasy and like the baked cod, the actual fish was quite \"lifeless.\"  The cheesy hash browns were good- nice and crispy, with only a hint of grease.\n\nBattered lake perch was just like the cod, only it was more greasy. I shed a small tear as grease oozed out of the piece I tried.\n\nThe bill arrived... $55 for three with one round of beers. Yikes.\n\nTully's = fail.\n\nService = 4 stars (good, prompt, fun)\nFood = 2 stars (based on fish only)\nValue = 2 stars\nMisc = 2 stars (not real exciting)\n\nI'd come here to drink some Miller Lites and to munch on some bar food during a game, but I'd skip the fish fry.", "business_id": "kOXJrbuB1a1Na6sf_WQnDg", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-12-13", "type": "review"}

So there's a new bumper for a car being painted in her garage on Sunday. The sister comes inside the house around 5ish, as we are trying to decide where to go to dinner. Name places... all no, finally \"Farrens?\" and it's a yes. We decide to meet there at 6:30. \nDrive from the country into town, and exit at Neil street from 74. As we are exiting, look to the north and see Toys R Us is packed, as is Olive Garden, and most everything else that way. \nDrive down Neil, turn onto Main, and all the restaurants in downtown are relatively empty: 301, Dublin, Big Grove, Guidos, Destihl... everything is relatively vacant. I start to feel sad, not for the empty restaurants, but for the people who decided that it was worth it to eat at Olive Garden. I felt genuinely sorry for people who thought that Olive Garden was a good decision. \nWe park, and walk to Farrens. We go past more restaurants that have seats available, Miga, that Thai place... and still I'm thinking... FRIGGIN OLIVE GARDEN IS FULL!!!\nWe go down the ramp into Farrens. I make eye contact with the server He points to a table. No one else sees him point to the table. I go and sit down, they stand on the ramp, and are like \"You can't just go sit down, they have to seat you\". and i'm like... DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM!!! A little while later, I inform them that yes, he did tell us to sit there. \nWe place our drink order, there's Triptych on tap, so that's nice. (Seems to be a recurring theme, that Triptych stuff is everywhere). I order a beer on draft, the lady orders a beer on draft. The sister asks \"do you only have that craft stuff on draft?\" She gets, I think, a Coors Light. How can you drink mass produced beer with craft food? \nKridz orders the mozzarella sticks. I get the portabella mushroom appetizer. The moz sticks are moz sticks. Nothing too fancy (it seems) about them. The portabella mushroom is the entire cap, cut in half, breaded and fried, served on a salad bed. Hell, this thing is practically a meal to itself. For the actual meal, I order the Russell, you can't go wrong with saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, bacon, blue cheese sauce and pepperjack cheese. BACON ON EVERYTHING!!! \nAt some point before the burgers came out, we also ordered the mac and cheese. If this is on the menu, get it. The ladies at the table were like.. \"what is this puddle on the top? grease?\" and i'm like \"uh... that's butter\". Then they are like \"who puts butter in their mac an cheese?\" then go into a discussion of how they made their mac and cheese for holidays... this, this, this, butter, this, this... seemingly forgetting that they put in a whole lot of butter. Butter makes everything better, as does bacon. mmm bacon butter. \nI dive into my burger, I also got fries with that, fries are delicious, but unnecessary after eating some of the mac and cheese and the whole mushroom cap. I finish my burger. I have blue cheese sauce throughout my mustache and beard. Thus is the struggle I deal with. A drippy delicious burger, all throughout the beard. \nI have another beer. Everyone else finishes eating. The ladies sit around and wait for the sisters significant other to show up because... she locked her keys in her car when she parked.

If I had stuck with that I might have had a very different experience.  Unfortunately, I tried to range farther afield and came away feeling like everything except the wine and cheese came from Costco.\nCheuvront gets predictably high marks for the range of the wine list and the varieties of cheeses--if Wallace and Gromit decided to move to the desert and become social drinkers, here is where they would do it.  I took the menu's advice and paired a Queso Iberico cheese plate with a pinot noir (Cartlidge & Browne '07) and liked both very much.  Actually, I liked the cheese.  The rest of the \"plate\"--almonds, dried cranberries, and a few grapes in their twilight years--evoked no real response at all.  My accomplice in dining chose the Pascual Toso Malbec '07 (accurately described as a full-bodied red) and summer salad.  The wine was great--complex and dry without being acerbic--but the salad tasted like the chef had just given two weeks' notice.  The chicken was bland, the \"mixed field greens\" had clearly just come out of a bag, and the roasted shallot white balsamic vinaigrette was the middle school marching band of dressings: yes, I recognized what was being attempted but still felt bullied by it.  The pumpkin bread pudding was good, but not worth making a trip for.  The latte and cappuccino were fine, but here's a tip for the kitchen: if you want coffee to stay hot, warm the cup first.  By the time our friendly-yet-overwhelmed server came back with the cinnamon, the drinks were lukewarm.  \nSpeaking of service, let's not.  We got menus, we got food, we got the bill.  We also waited a lot, heard several rationalizations for said waiting times, and had to repeat requests.  We spent two hours for a snack-sized meal that required no cooking except for the bread pudding that had obviously been made much earlier.\nIf I could send one message to Mr. Cheuvront, it would be this: It doesn't require any particular talent to sell good wine and good cheese at above-average prices.  It does, however, require talent and skill and desire to create an experience that keeps folks coming back.

When we sat down my friends and I were making comments on how the staff looks like they hate each other and how it made an awkward work environment. We are all server so we understand a bad night but seriously it was really uncomfortable in the place. All the servers and host giving each other dirty looks. The food took a while to come out which I get sometimes the kitchen is slow. New cook, under staffed whatever not to big of a deal the issue was our server.

Except that nobody seems to know my name there in spite of how frequently I come. But then, I'm not part of the 30-something clientle who sets up shop at the bar.\n\nI roll into a booth or a high table that has the best view of the games that are on. It's a great place to come down and see local sports or tie one on after a terrible local sports performance. Not great because of the televisions or presentation of the games in any way(which is just two smaller flat screen TVs with no sound in the main room), but because of the laid-back, true-to-its-locale atmosphere it emits. It just seems perfectly in place and makes it feel natural  to hang out and throw some back more then any other bar around town that tries to force its motif into a Phoenix landscape it just doesn't jive with.\n\nAnd of course the food and beverage there don't hurt its cause at all. I do agree with some people's sentiments about particular beers not being up to snuff compared to other breweries. My particular complaint is with their Pale Ale, which tastes like an IPA, and their IPA, which tastes like a medicinal strength IPA. But in spite of some quibbles with the beers here, they really do have some fantastic stuff. For some reason, the beer that is my standby there is the Light Rail Cream Ale, which is in stark contrast to the Brown and Amber Ales I typically get at other breweries. Its got that perfect taste/refreshment balance that acts as a Siren's call to bring me back here at least once a week.\n\nThe burgers, salads, and pizza's are also fantastic. But the real find here is the bread pudding, which has got to be one of the best bread pudding's in existence. I always try to eat slow to make room for it. Luckily, this is a place that won't care how long you cement yourself to a seat.\n\nWhich again, makes this place perfect for some Suns action or whatever is going on. But I probably remember my trips here best after catastrophic defeats. Last year after the Sun's officially bowed out of the playoffs without a championship for yet another season, and with my brother after ASU (he's an alum) lost to Oregon are the first that come to mind. The classic rock and the atmosphere and the beer (don't forget the beer) seem to breath new life into me during such trying circumstances.

Even if you are allergic to corn, take the plunge and try these...unless you might die, then stay away as that might be bad PR for PCG.  Topped with smoked ham (that's what I had), chicken, or bacon and served with maple syrup, it was beyond good.  I could eat this dish every day of my life.

Yep, you read that right...4 bucks!\n\nSecond visit for dinner, and I ordered the cedar planked salmon.  A generous piece of fish perfectly cooked and served with a delicious lemon aioli.  The accompanying roasted beets were not my thing, and the mashed potatoes were okay (maybe I'm picky about potatoes?)  I also tried a bit of my dining companion's beef tenderloin and it was butter-knife tender (that's what I cut it with).

But while going through a pile of mail I had set aside as junk, I found a $50 off postcard from AM-EX to Capital Grille. We decided to give it a try and save Mastro's for another time.\n\nThe service was fantastic. Our waiter, Reuben, was just the right amount of attentive (I hate being asked after practically every bite if everything is ok), and the other staff was also excellent.\n\nWe got a basket of bread to start, which also held some matzo-like crackers. Don't pass by the dark bread- I thought it was regular pumpernickel at first, but it had a wonderful crust with a soft and slightly fruity center- totally unexpected and delicious. We also received an amuse- a great little bruchetta topped with micro greens.\n\nI ordered the caprese salad which was good, especially the yellow tomato slice, but I have had better mozzarella at Cibo. Hubby had the French Onion soup which came with a ridiculous amount of torch-melted cheese on top. The soup itself had great flavor (one of the best I've had), but could have been a little hotter for my taste. Hubby liked it the way it was.\n\nFor our entrees, Hubby got the Kona crusted sirloin (which was rubbed with a blend of decaf coffee powder, cocoa, and cinnamon) with shallot butter. He really enjoyed the flavor, although about half of his steak was really much more medium than medium rare. To me, the flavor was unexpected- I thought I would taste any one of the rub flavors before I tasted the steak, as they are all strong flavors. That was not the case, however- it was a subtle yet complex addition to the beef. I had the classic Delmonico rib-eye. Mine was perfectly done and quite tasty, although I must say that I have enjoyed my rib-eye at Bobby Q's every bit as much. The sides were fine- we tried the mushroom mix and the lobster mac n' cheese. We have been spoiled by our CraftSteak hen-of-the-woods mushroom ecstasy experience, so all else pales in comparison. I expected more from the mac- it was sort of mild and bland. I'm not sure what it needed- something that wouldn't overwhelm the lobster, but something nonetheless. Because we wanted to try a dessert, we took home plenty of food (the sides are large, and all share-able by 2-4 people).\n\nWe shared the coconut cream pie, which again was more than enough for two. It was in a tart style with a sugar cookie type crust, topped with a layer that we felt had cream cheese in it, then a layer of custard cream, covered by a mountain of fresh whipped barely sweetened cream and toasted coconut flakes. It was really delicious. The house blend coffee was truly outstanding, without even a hint of acidity. Hubby added Frangelico to his, and it was so good and rich that it did not need the cream he would have otherwise added. \n\nAll in all, Capital Grille gave us a very pleasant dining experience (aside from a couple of wasted chicks who were way too loud), and very good food.", "business_id": "QdbZyl-LWFS54u93Vjd5SA", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-01-19", "type": "review"}

They bring you a hot cup of the bisque, and then pour some sherry into it for you after they put it on the table. Many bisques include sherry but I liked how adding it after it is already on the table adds to the presentation.\n\n I had a dry aged, kona crusted, filet for an entree (Bone-in). The steak was prepared medium, as I requested. This was a great steak, the rub gave it a nice flavor, and they brought out a nice shallot butter sauce with it. We ordered the South African lobster tail as a side. This is the best lobster I've had yet, it has a distinct sweetness to it that I hadn't previously experienced. If you get a chance to eat south african lobster, don't pass it up!\n\nService was pretty good, very knowledgeable and attentive. Nice atmosphere.\n\n5/5 all around", "business_id": "QdbZyl-LWFS54u93Vjd5SA", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-12-04", "type": "review"}

Do not be fooled by the ho hum exterior and questionable location, their food is beyond delicious authentic Italian mastery! I brought my very picky Sicilian friend for dinner once and she was impressed. Yes, yes.. the bread basket is lackluster, but the run of the mill rolls in no way reflect on the caliber of the actual food. Try the osso bucco, and definitely ask about the special!\n\nWhat about the service you ask? Oh my....don't get me started, they treat you like their best customer who has been a patron for years (and they have been open for that long too). Each server we've had has been friendly, attentive, knowledgeable and downright charming. \n\nOn a side note, the 80's elegant interior is just a bonus! Black and white floors, mirrors galore, dark, moody and strangely intriguing. If you're lucky you might land on a Friday night with Jersey Joe at the piano belting some Sinatra cover giving the place a definite Copacabana (right out of Goodfellas) mob like feel. \n\nSo, do yourself a favor and make a reservation for an evening at Avanti...and be sure to order a godfather on the rocks while you're at it (It's not like you can get away with it anywhere else in town).\n\nP.S.

As much as I'd love to give a neighborhood sports bar props, this place just did too many things wrong for me to comply.\n\nWent there with a bunch rowdy Yelpers to watch the NFC Championship game on Sunday and was fairly disappointed.  For starters, as a sports bar and Cardinals viewing destination that had been promoting themselves as \"the place to watch the big game,\" they seemed grossly unprepared for the crowd they got.\n\nFor starters, I sat at my table for about 15 minutes before I gave up on a server coming over to take my drink/food order, and went up to the bar to order and take the middleman out of the equation.  Only when I went up to the bar did I learn that they had run out of glasses!!!\n\nThis is where it gets good though.  Their drink specials that I was interested in were their $2.50 20 oz domestic drafts, pretty good deal if you ask me.  And since they had run out of glasses (definitely not my fault as I am not their barware supplier) and the bartender asked me to get a bottle instead, I naiively assumed they would honor at least a similar deal to the one that they were promoting.\n\nThis is where I was SORELY mistaken.  Not only did they not give me my 12 oz bottle for the same price as the 20 oz draft that they were unable to serve me, they actually had the nerve to upcharge me to $3 per bottle!!!\n\nNeedless to say, I was a bit incensed.  And it had nothing to do with the extra 50 cents per drink, I just thought it was poor business practice...a bit of a bait and switch, if you will.\n\nAfter the initial poor service and swindling of my hard earned $$, the bar ended up being okay.  Of course I will have to attribute at least 75% of this to the wonderful company of my yelp compadres, who I hate to disappoint with my less than stellar review, but I have to keep it real.  The TVs were big and plentiful, the food was fair.  I ordered a Buffalo Chicken Wrap which wasn't bad but my fries were SUPER cold and therefore inedible to me.  But the bar's sorry excuse for a smoking section is what threw me over the edge and made me want to puke on more than one occasion.\n\nWe had the bad luck of being sat in the general vicinity of the door that led outside to the smoking section, and every time the door was opened either by a server or a patron, you could literally see plumes and plumes of smoke wafting into the restaurant.  It was disgusting.  I couldn't stay even 5 minutes longer after the Cards won to celebrate because I was coughing and my eyes were starting to water.\n\nI am willing to give Gallaghers 1 more shot under the parameters that there can be no special event going on because they were terribly ill equipped to handle it, and mainly due to the fact that they had tons of TVs and it is relatively close to my house.\n\nAs long as the don't run out of glasses again of course...", "business_id": "F-ykHfGY9lWr12OJ_Ofy7A", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-01-19", "type": "review"}

Not that we're trying to get out quickly, but there's a point where it gets absurd. Here's a little example. P and I came in one rainy night around 7:30. It wasn't too busy and we found some nice, comfy seats and waited for a waitress to bring us some menus. And waited. And waited. Don't forget, they're not busy. Twenty minutes later a friendly waitress comes by (they're always friendly, haven't had a knowledgeable one yet, but they're always friendly) with some menus. Another ten or fifteen minutes she comes back to take our order. P had a question about one of the wines so the waitress offered her a taste of it. How nice! Another ten minutes she brought me my glass and P's taste and mentioned that they opened a bottle just for her taste. Unfortunately, P didn't like the wine at all (if I remember right, it was on the list in the wrong place, and P was looking for something much, much different) so instead of waiting again she russion-rouletted it and just ordered something. It came, we chatted and enjoyed our evening and she catches my eye and nods at the next table. it seems they have ordered the wine P didn't like and the waitress stands at the table popping the cork out with great flourish saying, \"here's the bottle of wine you ordered\". Why no one questioned it not needed to be uncorked, I don't know. It's a classy place like that though (underlying sarcasm). My Wine Cellar I mean.

The same sort of affection you would feel for your \"special\" cousin. The one that can't seem to move out of your aunt and uncle's house and never seems to make smart life decisions. Oh, I know we've all got one. You want to strangle him in one breathe but the next you can't because he's always got such a sweet grin on his face and small animals really seem to take to him. A lot. Anyway, My Wine Cellar is right here in Ahwatukee and they have survived and you can go and have a glass of wine and just hang out. Reasons like that keep bringing me back. Once I'm there I don't know why I came, but I keep coming back.", "business_id": "Our6bzte5W1wlIeOu9luug", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-12-20", "type": "review"}

Nice decor, great service, AMAZING patio and view, 5 stars all the way.  Haven't had their food yet, but I will be back for sure and looking forward to trying the menu (sounds like they have a good variety). Wish I lived closer so I could come here all the time.

We have no food to review, because the food we wanted for our Valentine's Day take-away dessert was not available to us! I can't tell you how disappointing it is to finally zero in on what taste we are craving on a holiday, load up the car to first eat mediocre Chinese food at a fast little place so we have money left over for the \"BIG DESSERT IDEA\", drive to Elephant Bar, park the car, and get to the hostess station to order our mud pie......only to be told they've already sold out at 7:15  :(\nIf something's that good, there should be a LOT of it on special days......agreed, yes?\nI trust the next visit will produce more exciting results.

But we're renovating the kitchen and needed to eat - husband was simply hungry, and I was looking for basic low carb food that wouldn't totally blow my diet. We both found what we were looking for. \n\nFor a sports bar, it's amazingly cozy; all the booths enclose you in privacy, with adequate, but not overpowering lighting. \n\nI was hoping for adequate - and found really good food; good enough that I'll be back regularly from here on in. We have tried several burgers, with the mushroom burger being our favorite so far. I went for the grilled salmon entree, which comes with grilled asparagus and broccoli (a perfect  low-carb meal, perfect for anyone watching what they eat, frankly) and it was so good that I've eaten it three times in a row. I just can't get enough of it!\n\n\nThe wine list is pretty good for a sports bar; I'm not a beer drinker so can't comment on that, but the staff is friendly, knowledgeable and will bend over backwards to accommodate your wishes. \n\n\nI only moved to the area from the San Francisco area in July, apparently while Legends was undergoing new management and renovations, so I can't compare it to the old Legends, but so far this is one of only three restaurants in Anthem that I am willing to recommend to my out-of-town friends.

It is tucked away in a mostly empty strip mall. The first few times we went it was mostly empty because we went early ( between 7 and 9 pm) It tends to pick up closer to 11 or so. The bartender is great, and the drinks are cheap. They have a ton of different weird flavored vodkas, which I am generally not a fan of, but Chris has some great uses for them. We like chatting with him and getting is opinion on all the flavors. (cilantro= wetnap.)\nIt is a cash only bar, so keep that in mind.
