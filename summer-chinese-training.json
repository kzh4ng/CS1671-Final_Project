I had the Almond and Cashew Chicken with brown rice. The $10 meal comes with a bowl of egg drop or hot & sour soup. There was plenty of chicken (not fried! yay!) and a large serving of rice - enough to take half of the meal home in a nice container. The sauce was very flavorful, though it seemed to be a little light on both the almonds and the cashews.\n\nOne friend ordered the Combination Lo-Mein from the main menu and was very satisfied. He said that there was plenty of beef, chicken and shrimp in there.\n\nThe waiter was attentive without being overbearing. He mentioned that each of the staff has their own recipe for the condiments, preparing his own recipe in front of us. If you ask me, it seemed a little silly, but it's part of the charm that is PF Chang's. After the meal, he brought over the dessert tray.

The shredded Szechuan spicy pork was a close second though it should be noted for people who don't know how Chinese pork is shredded, it is cut into thin slices and THEN cooked versus the famous bbq shredded pork in America which is slow cooked and then shredded by hand.  This leads to a more solid texture in the meat and it great when paired with thinly cut vegetables as they do with this dish. The ziran beef had strong flavors and wasn't drenched in a sauce like Americanized places.  For those who are afraid to try it, ziran means cumin so if you like cumin you will love this flavor of beef.  \n\nThe ambiance is great for large groups as most tables are large and plates are obviously meant for sharing.

I started working on Central and Indian School just around the time China Chili closed prior to the lightrail construction, so my first experience was at the new place.  I wish had gotten the opportunity to eat at the original location just to see if the experience was any better.\n\nI have ordered two things at China Chili: the orange chicken and the sesame chicken.  I only order the former now.  I have never had to wait longer than five minutes for an order.  This is good yet slightly unnerving.  It makes me feel as though everything is ready-to-serve in the back, even though the freshness and temperature of the food says otherwise.  The orange chicken is out of this world.  An entire breast fillet is battered, deep-fried, sliced, and covered with a really delicious orange sauce.  If you ask for it extra spicy, be prepared to feel your face melt off.  The consistency of the heat level is a bit hit-or-miss, but when they get it right, you'll be simultaneously pleased and in pain.\n\nMy biggest beef with this place is the wait staff.  Very rarely is service pleasant.  Most of the waitresses are brusque and a bit too efficient for my liking.  When the dining room isn't full, they tend to huddle up near the kitchen and watch the patrons as they eat, usually talking quietly amongst themselves.  It is quite unsettling and makes me feel as though I'm not welcome.  The one exception is one of the very sweet older women who reminds me a bit of my grandma in that she always has a smile and is always so quick to ask if I need a refill.  I don't know her name, but I always hope she's there when I go.\n\nSo, visit China Chili when you're in a hurry and craving the best darn orange chicken you'll ever have.

Always clean and a friendly staff. The food is always fresh and hot! Not sure if they changed their prep cooks or their standards but I was a little dissapointsed today. The teriyaki chicken was cut up in all funky sizes...all their food is usually prepared close to bite sizes. Today some I could barely fit in my mouth and some I couldn't put my fork in since it was so small. Maybe I'm too picky? Not sure but that is one thing I've always enjoyed about this place was their prep of the food. Even the orange chicken...golf ball size...yes I know that is what knives are for but I guess I tend to notice little things like that. And way too much sauce over the orange chicken too.\nOk, let me stop badgering them...their food is always delicious and we will continue to go their. Today was just a little off-eh! Everyone is entitled to a bad day here and there.

My favs:  Orange Chicken, Chicken with Mushroom, and Mandarin Chicken.  Tip:  if you are on a diet, buy the kids meal.  It comes with one side and one entree, plus a cookie and a drink.

The prices aren't bad and they do have some pretty good lunch and dinner specials. \n\nMy boyfriend isn't a fan of their friend rice so he usually orders orange chicken and I tend to toss up between mandarin hot chicken (aka general tso's) and hour lo mein.
