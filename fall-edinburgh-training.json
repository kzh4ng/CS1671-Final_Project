We went to the check in counter, and they were able to locate the ticket, and she decided to purchase the souvenir book like I had reserved. We walked around the grounds, the ruined abbey, and the state rooms. While in the state rooms, I was taking pictures when I was approached by someone who works there. She informed me that no pictures were allowed, and I thought I was going to be asked to remove them. I was not. Therefore, I am glad I purchased the souvenir book, because the items we saw, the rooms we walked around, and the art we viewed was breathtaking. I was happy that I walked up the 25 steps to see Queen Mary of Scots chambers. The Abbey was breathtaking, and your ticket is good for a year.", "business_id": "F1-S8DkAsFIyrkfTl9MmlA", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-10-05", "type": "review"}

And I mean that in the literal sense that it is a spectacle, rather 'really, really good'.  If you're under 10, both of those are probably true, but older visitors will probably feel in places that it's a little bit of a wasted opportunity.\n\nGood things first: it's obviously been tremendously well resourced. Divided into discrete rooms, every space in Our Dynamic Earth is a lavishly produced multi-media extravaganza, from the moment you step into wobbly-floor 'time machine' to the moment you leave. \n\nIt also doesn't seem to suffer from Millennium Dome Syndrome (too much cash + too many cooks + lack of clear vision) - the whole thing is totally consistent and very creatively executed. My 5yo spent the entire visit with his mouth open, full of questions and really enjoying the interactive elements.\n\nBut here, I suppose, is my one reservation - although I wouldn't say it was *shallow*, the actual content sometimes doesn't justify the presentation. In several rooms (the 3D theatre for example, or the section about water erosion) the science is shunted off to the side like an embarrassing necessity.\n\nFor each room like this though, there are another four where information and presentation gel perfectly, and my son really learned a lot from the experience. We've been back again since and I'd thoroughly recommend it.", "business_id": "Rza-FztnKi8YfcSkn1KxgQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-11-24", "type": "review"}

Well, if you can start with a love of sandwiches, it's a good sign. Caffe Espresso - Bingo.\n\nThe \"Number 9\" baguette has long been legendary in my workplace and so I toddled in with high expectations. When the lady before me ordered something simple, the man behind the counter served her with cheery mock-disapproval, claiming that the order was not a sufficient challenge. When I then asked for the legendary Number 9, he lit up. \"The Number 9? That's my BABY!\" he declared in delight, and immediately set about compiling its various delicious ingredients for me (grilled chicken, taco sauce, cheese, rocket and jalape\u00f1os).\n\nI don't know about you, but for me, a fellow who can talk so passionately about a sandwich is definitely the person I want making my lunch.\n\nHis infectious enthusiasm led me to explain that this was my first sampling of the legendary Number 9, and his mood elevated still further. \"It'll change you,\" he promised, and began explaining the spiciness options. I pondered a moment over Entry-Level or Smokin'. \"You know what,\" he continued, \"I'll do you a half-and-half if you like!\"\n\nOh, I do. I do like. Thank you.\n\nI had a moment at this point to glance around the weeny shop - about the size of my bedroom, the walls covered in boards reciting the most mouthwatering sandwich combinations imaginable and some pretty spectacular-sounding smoothies. It's homely, colourful and cheerful, with even a tiny bit of space to sit and eat if you can't bear to take your sandwich away from its birthplace.\n\nFor less than \u00a35, I was - as promised - lifted to a higher plane of sandwichness. Another previously Un-Number-Nined colleague, beholding my delight as I returned to my desk consuming the legend, ran straight out to get one for herself and found herself equally transported. \n\nI don't think I've ever been so overwhelmed with joy by a mere baguette; while the enthusiastic service and jolly establishment go a long way toward this score, the proof of the sandwich shop is in the sandwich. The baguette: warm, crusty and soft. The filling: rich and perfectly balanced. Don't expect to eat it elegantly, though; there's a lot stuffed into that baguette and it tends to behave with the same wild exuberance as its creator.\n\nI can't wait to try the rest of the options on offer, and some of those amazing-sounding smoothies. Until then... this has been a YUMinator review, starring Sarnie Schwarzenegger.
