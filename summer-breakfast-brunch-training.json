The individual rooms, all named for varieties of apple, are spectacular.  We were in the lovely Northern Spy.  The bed was wonderfully comfortable, the linens unbelievably soft and luxurious.  L'Occitane bath products smelled divine.  The Shadyside neighborhood outside of downtown is quiet but still conveniently located to all the Pittsburgh doings.\n\nBreakfast each morning, cooked by the hospitable Chef Jackie, is pure pleasure.  Each night on your pillow a menu card appears; check off what you'd like in the morning, what time you'll be eating, and drop it off in the dining room.  The next day, Jackie is ready and waiting with a fresh fruit plate, the pastry of the day, and fantastically strong and flavorful coffee.  Omelets and fritattas are made with local produce and eggs.  Irish oatmeal is served with milk from a nearby creamery.  Toast bread changes daily but is always whole-grain and delicious.  Breakfast meats are lean and filling.  \n\nAfternoons, iced tea and cookies are set out, and in the evenings wine and cheese served.  Enjoy them in a rocker on the front porch, relaxing on the back deck retreat, or in the privacy of your room.  \n\nStaff is not only eminently professional, but warm and gracious.  Heidi at the front desk was beyond helpful in making suggestions for what to do in the city or where to eat (I will be forever indebted to her for recommending what was probably our best meal of the trip at Soba).

I know they are a busy place so I went a few minutes early to grab a table since my friend was driving from N Scottsdale.  \n\nThe Hostess was friendly and told me it would be a 15 min wait for a table so I headed to the bar to grab a drink.  15 minutes pass and I see others that came in after me being seated.  20 minutes pass and I ask the hostess how much longer it would be.  She told me that she couldn't seat me because the rest of my party hadn't arrived yet.  I said yes I am waiting on 1 other person but I came early to get a table while she drove down.  The hostess told me they were busy and can't let people just hold tables all day for their friends.  She rudely said she would seat me now since I complained and lead me over to 2 lounge chairs with 2 wobbly end tables pushed together to make a table.  The idea was cute but made for an awkward eating experience since I was leaning forward and bending down to enjoy eating my lunch.  I had specifically asked for a table so I wasn't sure if we got seated at this table because I had complained as there were other more eating friendly tables available.\n\nThe whole ordeal was very off putting so my friend and I stayed for a bit and then went to another restaurant", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-08-15", "type": "review"}

She wasn't much for experimenting with wild exotic food like me.  She always suggested either Floridino's or Denny's, or take out from Boston Market.  We always had good meals here.  One of my fav's was the shrimp skewers, which I got more than once.  I think they were only $5.99 or $6.99 for 10  shrimp and two sides.  It might have been from the senior menu.  Whatever, it was always delicious and just the right amount of food, well cooked and well-flavored.  The service was efficient and friendly also.  Pretty consistent, which was probably what she liked.  No surprises.  \n\nI miss going there with her.

Don't be fooled by the rough exterior as the inside is the inside is very clean and nicely decorated with colorful mexican tile.  You order from the counter and take a seat where the friendly staff will soon deliver fresh chips and very good salsa.  Your food will also be delivered on a real plate - not wrapped in paper or in a styrofoam box like many of the other area taco shops.  \n\nThe Al Pastor and Carnitas are top notch.  I usually go with Al Pastor tacos but sometimes like get Carnitas into the mix.  I'm normally not a huge fan of ceviche however I really enjoy Mucho Taco's ceviche tostada.  The beans are excellent and I've had a really good chicken soup here as well.  Other reviewers have mentioned the Horchata and I'm looking forward to trying that on my next visit.  According to the server all of the aguas frescas are made fresh on-site, so if you're looking for Horchata Ole! (or Orange Bang! for that matter) you'll have to try somewhere else.\n\nAlmost forgot to mention that the prices are very reasonable.  My only complaints with Mucho Taco are that the taquitos are a little small and that Al Pastor is not available in a burrito (only tacos and tortas).  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking for cheap but tasty mexican food in a casual environment.", "business_id": "qgJZUKNVY-LbGKk6XEP3JA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-08-06", "type": "review"}
