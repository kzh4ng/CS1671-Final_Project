It was a hand-made shell filled with mousse & cake, with ganache drizzle, cream and berries. Rich and moist. Smooth and fluffy mousse. Not overly sweet. A nice marriage of creamy, rich, and sweet. Loved this delight. I also had a tasty cupcake. The cake was not as rich as that in the tulip. Yet, the frosting was a divine passion fruit. Yum.\n\nI'll be back.

This happens often, especially with the whole wheat, which is downright incredible.

It has something to do with French occupation resulting in my older relatives knowing how to speak French and eating my curry with bread. (Grammar-wise, why are all my relatives eating my curry? I refuse to fix the previous sentence.)\n\nI went on a journey through Pittsburgh in search of a good baguette. Of course, being a student, my first destinations were Giant Eagle, Whole Foods, and Trader Joes. After I finished sobbing with swollen gums, curled up at the bottom of my bathtub, I was determined to not give up. Then I found the outdoor bread stand at Strip District, Allegro, and BreadWorks Bakery. All three make fantastic bread and specialize in their own things, but the award for best baguette goes to BreadWorks Bakery. For now... DUN DUN DUN.\n\nSo of course, with every bakery, there is the option of buying and eating right away. But there is also the option for half-baked baguettes at BreadWorks, where the bread is not fully finished and you finish the rest of the baking yourself. Now, if you hear yourself saying, \"Why would I do the rest of the job for them?\" I don't want to be your friend. Who would not want freshly baked bread at home? Ugh, who are you? Anyways, I buy a bag of those, put it in my freezer, then finish it off in the oven whenever I need my baguette fix. (Seriously, I love this bread. My girlfriend is worried about my waistline).\n\nSo what makes a good baguette? It has to be crunchy and thin on the outside, but delicate, light, and soft on the inside. You don't fight the bread when you eat it (and it shouldn't win, for that matter... your poor gums after sub-par bread); instead, it should break and tear easily. The bread here has those qualities.\n\nThe rest of the breads are good. There are tons of varieties. The mini rolls are adorable. And I LOVE BREAD.\n\nBesides the delicious bread, this stuff is also cheap, so huge bonus of awesomeness right there.", "business_id": "Z7HNl4Gz00cA0_wt0S-vSw", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-01-11", "type": "review"}

Well, in the past 9 years or so, I have seen their quality rapidly go further and further downhill. Worse and worse quality to the product, declining taste and poorer ingredients are plainly evident. Sloppier and sloppier decorating, ruder and ruder counter staff.\n\nWe have continued to shop there simply due to the location being convenient, but these days you are really TAKING YOUR CHANCES as to whether the items you buy from them will be somewhat tasty or TOTALLY INEDIBLE. Still, I try to support neighborhood businesses as much as possible so it does break my heart to trash them in a review like this, but these things need to be said.\n\nThey continue to have a lot of customers due to their location and due to people remembering how good they USED TO BE, so when folks are back visiting their old neighborhood, they return to this bakery for the memories. But oh, how the standards have fallen!\n\nWe got some cupcakes for a party last year in November that we literally could not eat, they were so dry and bad- they went in the trash (not cheap either). Thank goodness it was just a small kiddie birthday get-together and not an important occasion with guests I would have been embarrassed in front of.\n\nWe considered getting our wedding cake from them (again, in order to support a neighborhood place) in 2008 but they gave us such a hard time regarding even getting an appointment for a cake consultation that we went with another baker, out in the west end. Looking back, I am glad it happened that way.\n\nAs for daily items, their breads are usually decent and their donuts are edible (not great, just satisfactory) but have way too much sickly-sweet frosting. Cookies are usually fine but sometimes their cake decorating is clearly being done as such a rush job that it's sloppy beyond description. Danishes and many other items give the impression that something went sort of wrong with the recipe, items are heavy and greasy when they should be fluffy or flaky or soft and moist. Items seem overcooked or undercooked. I wonder if they ever really taste test what they are producing. Also I don't know how they get away with serving such pathetic cannolis in an Italian neighborhood- pastry cream and zero ricotta, plus just in general- funky ingredients that are blantantly, obviously pre-fab, no fillings seem freshly made, it's all out of some mass-produced tube. And for this low quality, they make you pay premium prices, OF COURSE!\n\nNothing is marked with price or name of the item, and when you ask, most of  the counter staff consistently take a disgusted tone with you and treat you like you are stupid, rolling their eyes at you (the only exception being the youngest girls that work there, in their early 20s, who are consistently very good at being polite when helping customers). The more mature ladies frequently say snarky things to me like: \"That's not a cinnamon SPIN, that's a cinnamon DONUT. That's not a DANISH, that's a FRUIT PASTRY.\" If you don't want to have to answer questions, then put up labels and tags with the names and prices and info, so customers can read what terms you are expecting us to use!\n\nMost recently, I picked up a birthday cake for my father's birthday, and it looked like a child decorated it. Seriously. I could have done a better job myself. Maybe they are employing the cheapest bakers and decorators rather than the more talented ones. If this is the case, it certainly shows.  \n\nI think I am DONE with continuing to try to support this \"neighborhood landmark.\" Any time you complain, it seems to do no good-- they do not see the need to heed customer comments and improve.", "business_id": "Msfys8NloDpAsWmhvC9T6A", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-01-04", "type": "review"}

This weekend, my mission to try out every bakery within PGH city limits (or at least, in the neighborhoods I frequent) brought me to Paddy Cake, since I was in Bloomfield to pick up some items at Donatelli's.\n\nHaving sampled several of their baked goods, if I had to sum up my impression in a word, it would be...inconsistent.  The baked goods I tried ran the full gamut from excellent to mediocre to awful.  Despite having covered 1/3-1/2 of PGH's bakeries and several in other towns, I've never been to one before where I came away with such a mixed experience.  Here are my assessments of the individual treats I tried, in order from best to worst:\n\nTiramisu: 4.5 stars--This tiramisu is right up there with Groceria Italiana's as one of the best I've had.  If you enjoy this dessert, you won't be disappointed--just eat it within a day or so, since the ladyfingers dry out after that, even in the fridge.\n\nLemon tart: 4.5 stars--The filling struck a perfect sweet-tart balance and was smooth and thick and creamy, but not overly so. The only part of this pastry that could bear improvement was the crust, which was forgettable.\n\nChocolate iced chocolate mini-cupcake: 4 stars--I wasn't expecting to care much for this 69 cent cupcake, but I was pleasantly surprised.  The cake was soft and velvety, and the buttercream icing was okay to good.  I only wish I'd picked up one of the cute ones decorated like a groundhog for Groundhog Day!\n\nChocolate iced donut: 3.5 stars--Despite their apparent popularity and what other reviewers have said, I found this cake donut to be mediocre, only slightly besting Dunkin's versions.  The dough was a tad on the dry side, and the icing had a very commercial taste, similar to icing available in the grocery store.\n\nDanish: 3 stars--I found the cheese and raspberry danishes pretty average in flavor, and on the small side for the price ($1.29 each).\n\nCinnamon roll: 2.5 stars--For reasons beyond my comprehension, many bakeries in PGH, including this one, don't seem to get that the key to a great cinnamon roll is...wait for it...lots of cinnamon!  Aside from being skimpy on the key ingredient, the consistency of the dough was too wet/oily, making for a disappointing version of my favorite bakery treat.  (They also had non-fried cinnamon buns, but they bore a striking resemblance to Entenmann's, so I decided against trying one.)\n\nCookies: 2 stars--It befuddles me how one cookie I ordered (triple chocolate iced, which looked amazing in the case) was gooey in the middle to the point that it was clearly undercooked, while the other one (peanut butter chocolate chip) was overcooked to the point that it was hard and brittle.  Also, both cookies were iced with the same commercial-tasting chocolate icing used on the donuts.\n\nIn terms of the offerings, as others have mentioned, there's nothing that really sets Paddy Cake apart, since they don't have any unique products (e.g., Prantl's), and they don't seem to focus in any specific type(s) of baked goods (e.g., Colangelo's, Vanilla Pastry Studio).  Having said that, service was friendly and efficient, and prices were very reasonable (all of the above came to slightly north of $10).  Thus, while I may stop by occasionally while I'm in Bloomfield, I wouldn't go out of my way to come here specifically. 3.5 stars.", "business_id": "Msfys8NloDpAsWmhvC9T6A", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-02-04", "type": "review"}

Based on my experiences from when I've stopped in, I'd have to say that Paddy Cake is an a-ok place. The baked goods I've purchased here have tasted just fine - they haven't always been particularly unique (I've admittedly been spoiled by the range of goodies available at other bakeries as of late), but I've got nothing against a well made basic treat. Most recently I left with a pre-made box of cupcakes and I found them to be moist and topped with the right amount of icing; the icing wasn't overwhelming in flavor, either, which was a plus in my book. While waiting in line during my most recent visit I also saw a range of cookies and some bread just waiting to be eaten, and a number of boxes waiting to be picked up as well. Considering the sugar craving I had at that point, everything was mouth watering - I would've tried it all if I could have.\n\nThat said, while this place is just fine for what it is, it's just not as extravagant as some of the other bakeries that we've been spoiled by as of late. I admit that I haven't been super impressed by the availability of baked goods here during my last few stops, either; maybe it's just me, but during my visits there haven't been a ton of goods ready to go in the store. All I've ever really seen are variety of cookies, a couple danishes, some bread, and a lot of empty shelves. Basically, while goodies I've picked up have tasted pretty good and I've been impressed by the special order cakes I've seen other people pick up, the immediate availability of goods has been generally lacking. Not necessarily bad, but again, when you're spoiled by the availability of treats at other bakeries it can be a little disappointing to stop in at a smaller one and to have to choose from a smaller selection.\n\nAll in all, this place is a pretty solid \"a-ok\" in my book - not always extraordinary but they're good at what they do. I concur with another review who said that this place is worth stopping in at occasionally but not worth going out of your way for. I also recommend special ordering your cake or other goodies when you can here - otherwise you'll just have wait to see what they've got in stock on the day you're stopping in.", "business_id": "Msfys8NloDpAsWmhvC9T6A", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-02-17", "type": "review"}

First thing my friend asked about was a particular type of cake that he had been craving for a while.  Of course they had the Yellow Cake with buttercream frosting that he wanted.  She boxed it up and then we asked her to give us 12 assorted cookies, bakers choice but no nuts.\n\nFeeling happy about our current collection, I happened upon what appeared to be an apple purse.  It was in fact an apple dumpling (a whole apple inside rather than diced apple) and it rounded our order for the night.\n\nWe couldn't wait, we started munching on the cookies.  They were fresh and good.  I particularly like the oatmeal raisin that she put in and the mint chocolate chip tree was the most unusual one.  After my fourth cookie, the box was removed from my hands and I was told that I couldn't have any more until after dinner.  That is not made-up.\n\nAfter having eaten some of the cake and the apple dumpling, I must say that I will return.

If they filled their cases and maybe added some decor to the place I might give it a 4, but it gives me the feeling that it could close anyday which isn't worthy of 4 stars.

I was missing one of my favorite breakfast treats as I haven't indulged in them since moving here from Chicago.  They had been open about an hour but there was stuff that belonged in a store room on some of the tables.  Someone was mopping around me constantly and there was a rolling rack filled with Christmas cookies in the middle of the floor.  It's pretty drab and the 3 boards with their offerings are really hard to read.  The chalk is really light and it's really dim.  It's hard to know where to go when you walk in or what you're supposed to do.  I didn't really feel all that welcome honestly.  There were some old salads in a sparsely supplied case.  The bagels were in another.  I thought about getting a breakfast sandwich but didn't see a flat top or gas burner.  I did see a microwave and assumed the worst.  Microwaves take the micronutrients right out of your food.  I don't go out and pay restaurants to throw my food in a microwave.  There's no place for them except Panera!\n\nI ordered an everything bagel and a sesame bagel with cream cheese.  I'm giving this place 3 stars because for Pittsburgh, these are good bagels.  They're better than Einsteins or Bruggers by a long shot and I don't ever recommend you go to Panera.  I support local businesses so this place gets my vote as the best of these but it's not too much to choose from.  They don't have that nice thin crisp crust I like, they are chewy but a little light for me.  The flavor was a shade doughy.  I'm not sure they have the space to retard them overnight or exactly how they're being made so I can't go into their failing in specifics.  The everything bagel doesn't have everything!  Where's the salt?  Where was the onion and garlic?  It's not an everything bagel.  The 2 bagels and cream cheese were $6.  Seems like a lot to me.

In the last few years I've definitely seen them getting more and more attention, not just locally but nationally as well. Their burnt almond torte desserts in particular receive a lot of well deserved attention.\n\nThis particular Prantl's Bakery is one that I admittedly can't get to easily, due to the number of people who visit Shadyside (a neighborhood with very limited parking). So when I was in the area this weekend I absolutely had to stop in and take advantage of the fact that I was nearby. After walking in I thought I was in heaven - the smell of the baked goods was just soooo good! The place was pretty hopping so I was able to browse and see what was available while waiting for my number to be called; during the wait I watched fresh muffins, cookies and more being set out for people to buy. So I can definitely testify to just how fresh the goods here are - even one hour before closing they were putting out trays that had just come out of the oven.\n\nFair warning, the hardest part about visiting Prantl's is leaving with a reasonable number of goodies. I dare you to try to stop in for \"just one treat.\" They have cupcakes, cakes, \"cups\" (which are basically mini cupcakes with lots of amazing icing and toppings), pastries, muffins, and more, all made in a range of flavors - all fresh, all baked to perfection in my experience.\n\nI ended up leaving with 8 cups (2 cookies & creme, 2 almond torte, 2 peanut butter and chocolate, and 2 white chocolate and raspberry) that I've left in my car so I'm not tempted to snack on them all at once. So far I've eaten two of them and they've just melted in my mouth...exactly like a really good, fresh and moist dessert should, as far as I'm concerned.\n\nSo seriously - Prantl's is amazing.

Loving all things carbs, I checked online and they were open early. Such a nice change for a morning person like me since many things in Charlotte don't seem to be open early on the wknd! I walked in there and this place is HUGE! Of course the other thing I noticed was the smell of fresh breads being baked, so many flavors, so little time. IHowever, it was filled not only with bread but an inventory of dips, chutneys, sauces, etc. They also have a cart with dry soup mix that is gluten free and looked pretty tasty. \n\nI wasn't sure what to get there so I went with Rosemary Garlic loaf to get something with flavor. This girl cooks a lot of Italian food so I am sure I can incorporate it in a meal somewhere. They have toaster and round loaves-which just mean the size of the loaf (I had no clue what they meant when they asked this so I just said toasted in an inquisitive way). Their bread has no artificial ingredients or preservatives and according to their website, shouldn't be refrigerated but can be frozen (they gave me extra bags when I told them I want to freeze mine). \n\nThey also have a bread card where you buy 12 loaves, you get one free. When I saw others put three $$$ for price on here, I don't agree. The loaves are about $5 a pop and most bread at the supermarket is an average of $3 so I don't think the price is too high, especially for freshly baked bread without preservatives or artificial ingredients. I dig how they have the nutritional info on their website so you can see what you're taking in. They also have sandwiches there besides bread so if you're looking for a quick treat, you should stop on in! \n\nTwo Citipass coupons--one for a free loaf, the other is for BOGO sandwich.", "business_id": "q6liXMxYTMYx7evcgz1eQQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-01-22", "type": "review"}

Besides a small and rotating selections of freshly baked breads, this shop also offers a number of sweet treats and other baked goods, all of which deserve a try.  They also offer lunch sandwiches, made with their bread and your choice of meat and/or veggies.  \n\nFor me, this is usually a breakfast time stop, especially on Saturdays.  They make some of the biggest cinnamon rolls I have ever seen- in both a low fat and a fully-leaded version.  If you're not feeling so sweet, their scuffins (that's a mix between a muffin and a scone) are a solid choice.  Add in a cup of their fresh-brewed counter culture coffee and you're all set to start the day in the right way.\n\nDo check their web site or stop in and pick up a monthly calendar to see what their baking for that month.  Speciality breads change monthly, but there are standards that remain- such as Friday's cinnamon chip and their honey wheat loaves.  On certain days they also do gluten free breads, for those who need it.  \n\nBe aware that on some baking days breads may not be available until about noon  You can always stop in and place your order early to make sure you have it waiting for you.  You can call in your order too.\n\nPrice wise, you'll pay a little more than your average supermarket, but then I think you are getting a better product that you know was made locally and fresh.  Their speciality breads are also things you won't find at the average market (cherry and white chocolate chip anyone?).  \n\nI also love that the owners are big supporters of the local running scene.

The staff also isn't particularly outgoing, though not downright rude... until today. \n\nToday is Sunday, and I arrived around 8am. I usually try to get there kind of early and leave before it gets busy so I'm not taking up a table. I bought a big breakfast (as described above) and sat down to work. Just over an hour later, I was approached by a middle-aged man whom I assume is the owner or manager but whom I've never seen before. He asked if I was aware of their \"new policy\" about Wi-Fi on Sunday mornings, and how they don't want people just hanging out using the internet when it gets crowded. (No sugar coating, that's almost verbatim what he said.) For the record, I wasn't actually using their wi-fi, I was writing. Whatever. His point was obvious. I stared at him for a few seconds because I couldn't believe that a proprietor was actually asking me, a paying customer, to leave when I had been there only an hour and in fact still had toast on my plate. He suggested it was fine for now but that when it started to get crowded I should get out. I said that if that's how they felt I would leave now, and he responded, \"That's exactly how we feel.\" I was shocked, and still am. I have never, NEVER been treated so disrespectfully in a place of business. And I'm a regular, paying customer!! I always leave a tip! I still can't believe I was treated this way.\n\nI will no longer recommend this place, now that they've shown their true colors.

They sounded good, so I stopped in for a dozen a while back.  Those simple little cake donuts were over $1 each ($1.20/ea, I believe), which I thought was too high, but I was already committed, so I bit the bullet.  Yeah, they were good, but not enough to buy them again for that price. \n\nI won't bother with their other baked goods - the large danishes, coffee cakes and pies are just too expensive for my taste.  For less than half the money, I can snag a $5 apple fritter from Greenbush that is amazing.  I'm sure Scott's stuff is good, but personally, I have a limit to what I'll spend on that sort of thing.\n\nFor the freakish treat, the $1.90/ea for a maple & bacon long john is worth the novelty.

Total hole in the wall on East Wash in a strip mall behind some Mexican buffet, with the name People's Bakery, you'd never guess this place would have the best Middle Eastern food in Madison.  \n\nStart with the wife of the wife and husband team, who greets you warmly as you come in.  The menu is on the wall, but there are hard copies for those who need an explanation of the nicely blended mix of Lebanese, Armenian and Syrian dishes.  No matter your experience with food of the Middle East or Mediterranean, you'll find dishes you recognize, perhaps by different names.\n\nThis was my first visit, I'm sitting here eating my takeout order as I type this because it's that good.  I ordered the lentil soup, and several appetizer portions including hummus, moohamara, sarma, and falafel.    \n\nQuick review:\n- lentil soup.  Awesome, just awesome.  Beautiful saffron color from the cooked down red lentils, just the right mix of cumin and lemon, and a back end of heat, I'm guessing from Aleppo pepper.  This is some thick soup, and filling, and for 2.50, you get a pint\n\n- Moohamara.  I wasn't going to get this.  I like roasted red bell pepper, and I've had dips and purees made of them, but I've never sought it out.  Mary, one of the owners, told me it was her favorite, best on the menu.  And holy COW was she right.  A smack of roasted red pepper is quickly deepened by a sweet hit of pomegranate and walnuts, ubelievably complex and wonderful.\n\n- Falafel.  Huge portion, perfectly deep-fried, with a really nice, light texture.  Love the falafel, but I prefer tahini sauce, and these come with a yogurt mint sauce.  Don't get me wrong, this is clearly their regional interpretation, Im all about the authentic experience, and this was good sauce.  But, I confess that for my leftovers I'm making some tahini sauce.\n\n- Hummus.  You know, hummus is always a crap shoot for me.  I make my own, from dried chick peas, and I've been working on this recipe for 25 years (along with my Bloody Mary recipe and about a hundred others). This is another of those regional interpretation issues, this was my least favorite today.  I'll try it again, because my own hummus has on and off days.  This was just more on the bland side than I expected,  No one distinct flavor dominated so I felt like it was left with an almost indescribable flavor.  Not bad, totally edible, just oddly unflavored.  I added some lemon and salt, which helped some.  \n\nSarma - if you're expecting dolmathes this will be familiar in flavor, but it texture.  These are served cold with a yogurt dipping sauce.  I'm okay with the temperature, but I just like a little lemon on mine.  These are veg, the rice filling is cooked down to a coarse 'risotto-y' consistency.  I dig them, but those who prefer the snap of dolmathes will find these softer, but just as flavorful\n\nAll in all, outstanding.  Next time, shish tahouk and baba ganouj.", "business_id": "Ryq600aoE3h8_qRQGIed9A", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-12-08", "type": "review"}

Well, my Shish Tauok was plump with heavily marinated, tender chicken slices, tomatoes, tahina, and lettuce.  In short, it was outstanding.  Aggressive herbal flavors perfectly matched with a spike of lemony acidity.  My wife LOVED her falafel sandwich...which is really saying something, as she's somewhat of connoisseur.  The hummus was really good, and the spike of sumac was a nice touch, although it was tad bit to lemony for me.  \n\nNonetheless, this is an AWESOME Madtown ethnic eats spot...and oh yeah...how can  completely dismiss the incredible homemade donut selection?

For example, if you choose buttercream for your frosting, it will be smooth and sweet and creamy awesomeness in your mouth -- but on the cake, any colors will run and it can't hold complex shapes, so you're limiting yourself to very simple designs. Other frosting options exist, such as fondant and rolled white chocolate, and they each have their own set of benefits and limitations as well.\n\nIf you're good at research, you have some time to kill and you know what you're looking for, you can find a lot of this information on-line -- but when you're in the midst of the overwhelming task of planning a wedding, it would be so, so much easier to just sit down with a professional who can lay out all your options and explain the benefits and limitations of each one.\n\nUnfortunately, you won't find anyone like that at Carl's Cakes. Oh, Carl seems friendly, helpful and optimistic when you first meet him. The samples he gave us at our cake tasting were better than I ever knew cake could be, and when we asked about decorations, he was quick to assure us that he could \"do anything you want\". \n\nAfter our initial meeting with Carl, we surfed the Net for examples of memorable wedding cakes and cherry-picked the ideas we liked best until we had put together the perfect cake design. I'll admit it was on the moderately complicated side, but nothing exceptional by wedding cake standards; and after Carl's repeated assurances at the tasting that he could \"do anything you want\", we thought we were safe.\n\nBut once he has your deposit, his attitude changes. He's difficult to get ahold of by phone, and impossible to get ahold of by email. Suddenly, any design requests more complicated than the average birthday cake are answered with a simple \"I can't do that\". Even something as simple as multiple colors will be refused on the basis that the colors will bleed together. He never tries to suggest compromises or alternatives, and if you ask for them, he'll only tell you to come in and pick something from his generic book of designs.\n\nWhy all the limitations? Because Carl frosts his cakes with buttercream frosting -- and ONLY buttercream frosting.\n\nI've lost track of how many hours we spent on the phone going back and forth with Carl over the cake design, struggling to find something he could do that didn't leave us cold. Dealing with him wasted a large portion of the limited time we had to plan our wedding, and drastically increased our stress during an already stressful time. If I was rating his business purely on Customer Service, I'd have to give him 1 star.\n\nBut I'll also give credit where credit is due. In the end, he delivered our cake on time, in the flavors, size and design that we eventually agreed to. It was beautiful, if vastly simplified from our original design, and the flavor? To this day, our wedding cake is still the best thing I've ever had in my mouth. If I were rating his business purely on taste, I'd have to give him 5 stars. Heck, I'd give him 6 if it were possible.\n\nSo if you want the best cake you've ever had in your entire life, consider Carl's Cakes -- But consider very carefully. Give him an exact cake design and make ABSOLUTELY SURE he can do it without modifications BEFORE you give him a dime.", "business_id": "tE8MQ9I7E2_Xvm4AvykXrw", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-02-26", "type": "review"}

Carl also is very stuck in his ways when it comes to design.  He's not on the cutting edge, he will only do certain designs that he's been doing since the 80s.  There will be no rolled fondont ribbons or pulled sugar flowers or bright colors.  If you want a simple cake, and don't mind that it is frosted with fake buttercream because that's what is more shelf stable and easy to work with, then go to Carl's.\n\nI see that since I posted my review Deb R. from Carl's Cakes commented.  Thanks for your comment and those pictures.  I can definitely tell which ones Carl decorated as opposed to other cake decorators working there.  The cakes with a very simple piping design and love birds have Carl written all over them.  The cakes that are more creative and interesting are done by other people.  Oh, and you guys must go through a TON of shortening for all that \"buttercream\"!", "business_id": "tE8MQ9I7E2_Xvm4AvykXrw", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-02-10", "type": "review"}

I especially have a propensity for anything with frosting or that's fresh baked goods. I had heard that Carl's Cakes were fantastic with people getting them for their wedding and other family events so when I saw one at the local grocery store called grasshopper torte, I splurged and bought it.\n   The description on the cake says \"chocolate cake filled with chocolate and mint buttercream, iced in mint buttercream\". You see, I have a real weak spot for buttercream, real buttercream.\n   After dinner the family is pretty excited because we have cake for dessert so I took the lid off, sliced it and took my first bite. It was totally disgusting. At this point, I peeled back the store label to reveal the ingredients.\n   The ingredients read as follows: flour, sugar, eggs, milk, margarine, shortening partially hydrogenated soybean oil, partially hydrogenated palm oil with mono and diglycerides added baking powder, baking soda, cornstarch, salt, cocoa. The mint filling contains: alcohol, water and oil peppermint. Fudge filling contains liquid sugar, partially hydrogenated soybean and cottonseed oil, corn syrup, cocoa, water.\n   This ingredient label should just read crap, crap, and more crap with a side of hydrogenated crap and filled with trans fatty crap. This so-called super duper cake has no butter cream has no butter and barely has anything that's natural whatsoever. \n   So Carl, just a word of advice.

For those of you unfamiliar, it's pretty much a filled donut, but they're really good, and made even more special because you can only ever get them 1 day a year.  \n\nI was told on good authority that Europa is *the* place to go in the valley for real Polish fare, and it certainly didn't disappoint.  They had a whole case of authentic looking Polish baked things like Paczkis and Kolachkis and other things I can't spell or pronounce, but also have lots of Ks, Zs and Is in their names.  From what I saw, the paczkis they had were:  raspberry, prune, cherry & cream cheese, apple, custard, strawberry & probably a few more I'm forgetting. \n\nThey also had a little Polish deli with more food I won't even attempt to spell, but it certainly seemed authentic.  Lots of sausages and meats and things.   \n\nAlso, even the people that worked there were authentically Polish!  Well, I'm assuming so, at least.  They were white and spoke with accents I couldn't understand, but reminded me of the northwest side of Chicago.  \n\nGo forth and enjoy the fatty deliciousness that is the Paczki before you have to do the whole \"Lent\" thing, if that's the sort of thing you're into.

I ordered the mozzarella sandwich minus the prosciutto, and the pasta salad for the side.  Regular readers may know that in my opinion, nothing beats a good mozzarella sandwich, so I was absolutely thrilled to find that it was delicious.  Nice crunchy baguette, fresh mozzarella, and flavorful tomatoes.  The pasta salad was also very good... very simple, just cold pasta with some olive oil and seasonings.  I'm not a super adventurous eater, so while I loved the pasta salad I would guess that others might find it a tad boring.\n\nToday I had the tomato basil ravioli soup, which was very good except that it was a little skimpy on the raviolis.  Flavor was delicious, though.  It comes with a few toasted slices of baguette.  Personally, next time I'll just order a fresh baguette to go along with it.\n\nThe entrees and full sandwiches are a little more pricey, but I'm a light eater, so the half sandwich/side deal is an absolute steal for me.

The wife ordered the Weekend special only to find they were out of that too? It's the Weekend special on Friday! She settled on salad and Beef Borguignon. The salad was wilted and the dressing was so mild it was hard to tell what it was. My best guess was a quarter-teaspoon of Grey Poupon and 2 oz. of olive oil.

The Chef / Owner had the nerve to come out and ask what was wrong with my sandwich! No joke, a grocery store hamburger bun, smashed flat in a Panini iron, and he is wondering why i didn't want it? This is a bakery, Right? This is the first time I have ever written a review. This is the first time I have been so moved to write one. The sweets may be good here but why was there no fresh bread? What self-respecting Frenchman would serve a Panini on a grocery store bun?

I wish I could review it based on flavor, but I cannot. Here's why: My mother-in-law, thrilled at expecting her first grandchild, ordered Tammie Coe cakes for my baby shower. When she went to pick them up...WHOOPS!! Tammie Coe forgot to make them. 30 guests, catered lunch, no desserts. She ended up giving us pre-made cakes out of her freezers, and we forgave...after all, mistakes happen, right? Even to very high-end bakers with huge followings and even huger price tags....right? Fast forward a few years to my sister's bridal shower. Sister's having a destination wedding in Switzerland, in a castle in the Alps. Hostess throwing the shower wants to go along with the theme and have 30 individual Swedish \"Princess Cakes\" for dessert, which happen to be a favorite of the bride. We search high and low all around Phoenix to find someone other than IKEA who makes these unusual cakes (IKEA's are frozen, and who's got freezer space for 30 cakes??). But guess who makes them to order? Tammie Coe!!! She even remembers us from the baby shower a few years prior, and has the good sense to redden in the face over that embarrassing memory. We all share a good laugh over silly mixups, place the order, and pay nearly $300 for it. Shower day comes, we go to pick them up, these delicious, bride-requested, dream-wedding themed 30 cakes, and....WHOOOOOPS!!!! Tammie Coe forgot to make them. AGAIN. Seriously???? Yes, seriously. At this point, either Tammie Coe has some weird passive aggressive objection to my family's happy occasions, or she just sucks and can't get her business together. Note to Tammie Coe: if you're going to make a habit of forgetting to make pricey, occasion-driven baked goods, DON'T DO IT TWICE TO THE SAME FAMILY. Or maybe this is just how she rolls, and forgetting to follow through with orders is a common theme? Either way, bad business model. Ta ta, Tammie Coe.

I was pleased with the whole shebang. For my graduation from nursing school, my mom decided to order me a specially made cake from Tammie Coe's. She requested \"jewel tone\" colors; emerald green, deep blueberry purple, and a garnet like color. The lady who helped her was rude, cold, and short. She told her to \"remember that this is fondant, and those aren't jewel tones, jewels don't come in those colors.\" My mom just urged that they make sure they are rich, deep colors because those are my daughters favorites. Welp, I picked up a lime green, hot pink, and baby lavendar cake.\n\nAND AS IF THAT'S NOT BAD ENOUGH:\n\nMy mom paid extra to have a stethoscope and graduation cap placed on top of the cake. There were obvious thumb prints all over the stethoscope and the silver from the stethoscope was smeared all over the top of the cake. When I got home I took out my painter's brushes, cleaned off a fan brush, and then meticulously cleaned up their mess with water and patience. As they should have done.\n\nFor the price, I'd expect the Tammie Coe staff to be respectful and courteous to all of their customers, but especially to my mother.

You know where you should go? You want a completely different breakfast experience in Phoenix than the usual stuff you can find out in Goodyear, or Peoria, or Mesa?\n\nGo to La Grande Orange. (pronounced Oh-rahnj) Seriously. While more than half the spots in Atlanta would rival La Grande Orange, in Phoenix it's absolutely hands down one of the top three spots for breakfast. Honest.\n\nOkay. So the parking lot is too small for how many people come for breakfast. This isn't LGO's fault, there's actually a lot of parking - there are just too many people coming for breakfast. Okay. So the prices are technically a little more than you're used to paying by about $2. Get over it. The food is better. Well, okay, there's only one item on the breakfast menu that's actually worth the money. The Commuter Sandwich - but it's worth the money.\n\nUsing the largest, most flavorful and softest english muffins you can find, they place very fluffy folded eggs in a sandwich along with avocado, and bacon, or turkey or whatever else you'd like. Seriously, the english muffin alone with the egg is enough to make this worth the price of admission.\n\nSure the lines get long, but I'm sorry, that's what happens when the locals know a good thing - and it's the locals, the people who live in and around the Arcadia district that come here most often. Sit outside or inside, there's enough traffic to people watch while drinking your latte and eating your sandwich.\n\nWhile you're waiting for your food to arrive, walk around the store and check out all of the french imports that you really can't get anywhere else. I'm not saying they're actually worth the price, but there are a few greatly unique items which you may decide are definitely worth the price. My girlfriend bought a $25 wallet there which she still uses and gets complimented on everytime she pulls it out of her purse. (Okay I know, $25 for a woman's wallet is nothing, but you should see this wallet.)\n\nThey also have a selection of wines and cheeses. I've never bought either and I'm not sure they're worth the markup they have on everything at LGO, but it's nice to see, especially after you've wandered one too many times around the Cracker Barrel store.\n\nThere's an attached pizzeria which isn't open during breakfast hours, but you can sit in their space when you get your commuter sandwich and coffee. It's quite awesome. La Grande Orange is honestly a hidden jewel in the Phoenix suburban food wasteland. It's not for everyone, but I'd say that if you're in your mid 20's to early 40's even, and you're wanting to seem a bit trendy without trying too hard, go here.

So, I go through my favorite three options: Vincent's Farmer's Market, LGO and Over Easy.\n\nI gave him a brief description of each and when it came time to give my rant about LGO, it went a little something like this....\n\n\"La Grande Orange! Oh my gosh, you'll never see anything like it...Look for all the cars and the full staff of parking attendants. Look for the line going out the door. Even more fun, go through the back door and say hi to the kitchen staff (very Durant-ish).  Have the French Pancakes, The Commuter Sandwich, a croissant, or an English Muffin. Go look for great cheeses, fig spread, or affordable, small production wine options, buy your next birthday card or something you don't need there. Look at all the cute families, dogs and have a double cappuccino.\"\n\nHe looked at me realizing that I've probably already had one too many double-capps that day and as I said goodbye, and we both pulled out of the gas station, I couldn't help but wonder which of the options he and his family would choose.

Both of us we pleasantly surprised on the nice little location on the corner and little picnic style table outside. \n\nFirst we walked around and looked at all the specialty items that were scattered around the store. Being a wine enthusiast, I got to see some interesting wines sitting in their beautiful wine racks. \n\nFor how busy it was in there, it only took us 2 minutes to order, because of their employees to help guide you though. Both of us ordered delicious egg sandwiches on english muffins. Having choices of different topping I went with avocado, sausage, tomato, and cheese. With Jamie doing the similar, but with bacon. (There was a jealously generous amount of it too!) \n\nWhile we waited for the sandwiches, we got coffees from their espresso bar, and walked around the shop some more.

You will find me here most weeekdays with my laptop enjoying the free WIFI and some yummy food. This place tends to confuse people, so here is the deal. La Grande Orange is owned by the ever so easy on the eyes Craig DeMarco. He also owns Postino Wine Cafe (2 locations), La Grande Orange Pizzeria and Radio Milano in the valley in addition to a few in California.\n\nFirst of all the Grocery or LGO is not really a Grocery. It is a self-serve restaurant featuring Breakfast and Lunch all day. In addition they sell lots of Wine, Specialty Grocery items and lots of stuff you never knew you needed. Once you get your food you may sit outside or at the few inside tables or you may also sit in the Pizzeria side till 4pm. This is where it gets fuzzy. On Fridays you can also order Pizza in the Grocery starting at noon  and eat it in the Pizzeria until 4pm. At 4pm they start full service and then you have to be seated and are waited on. Confusing to newbies, but it works. \n\nThis place is full of regulars. Mostly business types, Self Employed or others than can take a 2-3 hour lunch. They have WIFI and so people come and get some work done while having a bite and there are always several tables with casual meetings or get togethers. It is a comfortable inviting place once you know the drill. My only beef is they don't serve Breakfast Alcoholic drinks like Bloody Marys or Mimosas, but I would never leave if they did, so all is well, Try their Havana Latte, Croque Madame, San Danielle Special Sandwich, any Salad...

The english muffins are great if you don't have the time/patience to make them at home, good for a quick fix.

Also the coffee wasn't hot and the bar girl had an attitude when I asked if she had any newly brewed.  Nothing verbal just a snippy push of an airpot in my direction.  They have tried to improve service, still some mistakes on take away, ie; wrong pastries.  Parking is insane as it has been for several years. \nI think they should get rid of one of the retail displays and allow just a tad more room in front of the coffee bar.  I thought a fight would erupt one day recently when the place was packed and there was a girl waiting to get coffee and her friend asked if she was ready, she replied that if she would be if people would stop hogging the coffee bar.  I thought she was being funny and must know the guy in front of her, but by his look when he turned to look at her, I realized they weren't together.  I waited for the verbal burst of profanity, but none came and I applaud his patience with the uppity little wannabee.

We were in line to order and only had two people ahead of us, one of the LGO girls approached us and recommended that we go outside and place our order with the barrista (AKA coffee lady) because it would be 'faster'.  So we did and ended up waiting for another almost 10 mins just to place our order.  Maybe she meant it would piss me off 'faster'.  \n\nThe breakfast I received was barely room temperature.  The eggs were supposed to be accompanied with avocado which (technically) I suppose they were, however, I assumed that this meant more than 3 dice sized pieces of avocado.  I felt like Gulliver; was I growing or was my food just getting smaller?  \n\nI asked one of the girls who work at LGO if the three ultra-mini cubes of avocado was considered to be a normal portion, she just looked at me like she was coming down off a pot binge and said she wasn't sure and that if I was 'OK with it', I should just go ahead and eat it.  Duh...ya think?  I'm thinking she didn't quite make the cut when they were recruiting at NASA.   Then I went to the guy at the pizza oven and showed him my mini food and he just laughed out loud and asked someone to throw some more avocado on my plate.  Anyway, I finally ate my now almost cold and fairly flavorless breakfast and must say that LGO seems to be resting on its laurels.  The food quality is just so-so.  \n\nI think this place is just another case of the 'Emperor's New Clothes' with people thinking 'Everybody else is in orgasmic rapture over this place, I guess that means that I should be too'.

She looked both of us up and down for a moment then said, \"I think you two would get this place. La Grande Orange.\" \n\nWe thanked her for the recommendation, then chuckled and asked ourselves \"What did her comment mean, exactly, about \"you two\" and \"getting this\"?\" I guess folks who stay at swanky resorts (this was our first time springing for such a place) eat different food? LOL. \n\n\"Get it\" we did! \n\nWe ordered a pizza to go from the adjoining pizzeria and while we waited on it we had a chance to shop for wine, pastries, salads and other take out from this charming little grocery.

After some deliberation I went with the reuben (always my top choice) and a glass of iced tea. I was needing a pick-me-up meal, and this seriously got the job done. The reuben was huge and was piled high with juicy corned beef and a layer of delicious cole slaw, and was on some of the softest marble bread I've ever had. I was amazed! As if the glorious sandwich creation wasn't enough, it came with some sweet pickles and a big slice of pineapple. I couldn't believe how perfect this lunch was! It had me full and back to life in no time. And don't even get me started on the iced tea.\n\nThe atmosphere here rocks and is totally conducive to knocking out some work projects.

Well first and foremost, you will avoid the lines from inside the store.\n\nWhat else is good or even delicious ? I love their coffee or espresso. I notice they no longer carry Mr. Espresso from California and have rather gone much more local with ROC (roastery of Cave Creek). \n\nThe staff is super nice and very welcoming.

Readers of this review should realize that should there not be parking on the front, rest assured that valet is the way to go!  \n\nThe grocery has some of the most fun and random items that are great for any special occasion.

Consider it to be a casual cafe-cafeteria-ish where you can order fresh baked, homemade goodies and comfort meals from breakfast, lunch and dinner. They use ingredients that are pure and natural - nothing here is made with preservatives or additives! They also have items for those who are vegan, vegetarian and gluten-free. \n\nLa Grande Orange (LGO) reminds me of Elephant's Delicatessen in Portland, OR. And if you know me, I love Elephant's Deli! So as you can imagine, I fell in love with the atmosphere at LGO. I came to visit one morning for brunch with the parentals and also met up with an old elementary school friend who lives in town. You pretty much order your food at the cash register, pay and wait by the pick-up window for your plate/orders, afterwards, you just find a seat anywhere. \n\nThe atmostphere of LGO is hustlin' and bustlin', they are quick to serve and food is made within minutes! As you can imagine, the place is quite loud, so stay tuned for your name being called as they serve your dish at the pick-up window. \n\nFYI: They have a second location at the PHX Sky Harbor Airport (Terminal 4-D). I'm kinda glad that they have a location in the Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport, so I can grab a few goodies to go on the plane and devour!\n\n[devour]\n*LGO FAMOUS ENGLISH MUFFINS ($1.95/each; $9-half dozen; $16.50-dozen)\nOhhh emmm gee! Their English muffins are large! Lightly toasted and sliced in half, the English muffin was served with a side of their homemade preserves and butter. You can tell this stuff is homemade by the texture as you chew into each carbalicious bite. I found out that they sell a bag of them at the airport, so I was able to grab a half dozen to share back home with my foodie friends! *highly recommended*\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-grande-orange-grocery-phoenix?select=N1JQGiauJS_Wgt-ozRdB2w#bJEjXkOfQmAZdkt106R1QA\n\n*FAMOUS FRENCH PANCAKES ($6.75; **4 STARS**)\nThe French pancakes were very light and fluffy! It sorta reminded me of a crepe texture. The pancake was made with honey and creme fraiche. It was topped off with several slices of fresh strawberries, which made the meal quite delightful and refreshing! \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-grande-orange-grocery-phoenix?select=N1JQGiauJS_Wgt-ozRdB2w#3RCEJaMiE1A7SYjfmw-Gsw\n\n*BIRCHERMUESLI ($5.25; **4 STARS**)\nConsider this breakfast dish something you can also grab on the go! (Also served at the PHX Airport!) Here you have chilled Swiss oats, mixed with raisins, slivered almonds and organic vanilla yogurt, all combine to make a healthy and fulfilling breakfast! I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for something to grab on the go and wants something that is healthy!\n\n[dessert]\n*RED VELVET CUPCAKE (**3 STARS**)\nWas kinda dense. The cream cheese frosting was very thick and delightfully complimented the cupcake. I wish the cupcake had a bit more fluffiness in the cake's texture. But nonetheless, it was a decent sugar fix - but nothing to go wild and crazy about. \n\n*SEA SALT CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE (**3 STARS**)\nThis cookie was recommended by the employees. I didn't think the cookie would be uber salty! I like salty-sweet mixtures, but there was too much salt in the cookie for me to eat. The chunks of snow-frost-like sea-salt, had to be dusted off so that the cookie was bearable to consume. I think this cookie would've been awesome if they decreased the sodium content. I did prefer this though over the red velvet cupcake. \n\n[imbibe]\n*FRESH SQUEEZED ORANGE JUICE \nWhy not get orange juice from a place that has \"orange\" within their name and logo! The orange juice was very refreshing and full of pulp! I wish I had ordered a larger cup of this instead of a small! They also sell this item at PHX airport so you can grab a cup of it to go! *highly recommended*\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-grande-orange-grocery-phoenix?select=N1JQGiauJS_Wgt-ozRdB2w#OWoA9xTlsGQf9iC_uN5kRw\n\nFYI: parking can be quite limited in the front, there are spots in the back and sometimes they offer valet (no charge).\n\nIf I lived in the area, I would probably be a frequent flyer! Seriously!!! If I'm in the area again, I would try out their burgers and pizzas since that's also a popular item on their menu. If you're visiting Phoenix, definitely make a visit to LGO (or at it's airport location!)

Coffee at a grocery store?  Well, I guess judging by the long lines of people, it's a very popular joint.  We ordered some Coffee, Muffins, and some other sweet stuff (I don't know what it was, they ordered it).\n\nI had a Blueberry Muffin, which was awesome.  The Coffee was some kind of Organic Ethiopian blend...it had a distinct, sharp flavor to it and was pretty strong, but very good.\n\nThe store part of the place was very busy and so was the dining/sitting area.  We sat in a large booth which was comfortable for 4 of us.\n\nThe absolute worse part of visiting this place is the parking.  The parking lot simply cannot handle their volume.  I had to park across the street, which is a pretty busy street.....sounds like a petty thing, but I wouldn't want to do it in the Summer when temps are 115+ and you have to wait for the crosswalk light.\n\n5 Stars for the Food/Coffee, 1 Star for the parking.\n\nReturn Factor - 60%", "business_id": "R8VwdLyvsp9iybNqRvm94g", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-02-17", "type": "review"}

My comfort zone needs to expand. \n\nAs soon as I figured out the ordering process and just how this place operates, it was easy to fall in love... With the food. I have been fortunate enough in my quarter century to dive into the pizza Arizona has to offer. I had no idea LGO offered pizza. It doesn't fit with their hipster market persona you feel in this area of town. I caught a glimpse of a couple of their pizzas as I did my customary 'I'm gonna walk around, and look at people's food so I can make up my mind without making people feel uncomfortable' and ordered \"the gladiator\" pizza which easily feeds 2 people. Wow. The sweet crispy chewy crust is outstanding and easily rockets to the top 5 of pizza in this town. I also tried their cheese burger on their homemade english muffin. Another fantastic item on their menu. \n\nThere is a hectic feel to this place as you scramble from the main counter to finding a seat, and picking up your order from different parts of the market but it all seems to work.

Now I reside In Dallas, Texas. This is the one place in all of Phoenix I truly miss the most. I lived within walking distance to Chelsea's kitchen, literally across the street. Same owners as LGO, a little further down the road, still in walking distance. I actually moved to the worst apartment complex in Arcadia just for this place!  I cannot describe my love for this place. When I try, it all comes down to that cold, ready to go salad case.  For 1 year I ate the shredded kale,evil princess Thai and tuna Ni\u00e7oise salad 5x a week on average.  The champaign dressing on the shredded kale salad is the best dressing I've ever had. During morning hours they'd even do a breakfast kale, hard boils egg addition To the grapes, red pepper, sunflower seeds, and Manchego cheese. The Thai salad has an  incredible dressing as well, fish sauce based, yum! The chicken is minced to get into every bite equally, the lettuce is perfect size, w/ red pepper, lemon grass, red onion. The whole salad comes together exactly how a salad should, you could eat it with a spoon. The tuna Ni\u00e7oise doesn't miss either.   Contains all the proper Ni\u00e7oise ingredients! Potatoes, green beans, capers, Kalamata olives, tomatoes. \n   Ok, so let's get on to those home-made English muffins. They are all the rage for a reason. Unbelievable. My favorite thing to do with them was to make a sandwich  with them using their perfect chicken salad they sometimes have in the salad case. They use their in house rotisserie chickens from Chelsea's kitchen and add the perfect amount of mayo, grapes, and spring mix. Small amount of the best dressing ever and a toasted English muffin, mouth orgasm.\n\nThe ginormous peanut butter cookie is ridiculously amazing. Never found a better one.\n \nThey have soup de jour, my favorite was the mushroom or New England clam chowder. \n\nEveryone loves the breakfast, personally for me it wasn't their strong suit. I had almost everything but I cannot rave about any of it like I can with the salads. Still, I ate it a lot. The jersey girl omelette not on the menu was my favorite, it's like a pastrami sandwich in an omelette. The croque Monsieur was my favorite breakfast item featured on the hot menu. Open faced, grain toast, ham, egg and gruyere cheese with Dijon and bread n butter pickles. Side of fruit, Fresh squeezed o.j. Mmmmm.. \n\n \nDinner:\nBesides the pizza, reviews in LGO pizzeria.. \nIf available due to limited quantities, the rotisserie chicken melts in your mouth and tastes nothing like a grocery store. Half is $6 whole is $12. Get some sides du jour and dinner is ready and impressive!\n\nThis places motto should be, \"what recession?\" If you have never been here and want to fit in, come in work out clothes on Saturday or Sunday for brunch. Lol, it's like everyone's stop after a run or bike trip.  \nEven though the parking lot is tiny, hard to find parking, and easy to get hit (I was there like everyday, bound to happen, not my fault!.) the call ahead curbside service is great. I abused it.  The girls are great though, never had any problems with them, always cheerful and gracious of tips. \n \nI miss you LGO!,", "business_id": "R8VwdLyvsp9iybNqRvm94g", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-12-05", "type": "review"}

It's one of those places that seems like it has to be good from the, uh, uppity nature of the people who've mentioned it. (Uppity: more money than I have) So since I'm obsessed with trying to look cool and like I have more money than I have, (what kind of hipster would I be if I didn't?) I figured I needed to try it out. So what better night than when I am too tired to cook anything, too lazy to go too far, but trying not to eat my stress in Arby's 5 for $5? I read the reviews and the grab and go aspect sounded like just what I wanted. \n\nHere's how it went down, straight first impression style. Parking- uh nope. No parking, went down the street looking, then realized, I just wanted to grab something and go home, no way am I parking and walking in this situation. Went back and snagged a spot in front of the paper store, which was closed, therefore I say it's up for grabs (plus upscale paper stores are bullshit). Go inside La Grande Orange grocery and whoa, that's a lot of stuff, piled to the ceiling, everywhere. In my head \"grocery\" means some aisles and a display here and there, not pyramids of god knows what. I'm afraid to walk around for fear my big ass will knock something over that costs more than my hourly rate. Ok, grab and go spotted, yay! Oh it's kind of empty, ok it's 8 pm, whatevs. Selected spicy chickpea lettuce wraps, and looked around trying to figure out where to pay, there's like 3 different counters. Ok I've figured out where to pay, but what is there to drink? Iced tea or lemonade apparently at this counter. Side note: I did not see an easily accessible path to this drink case they motioned to, so maybe I look next time. Pay, go home, enjoy. \n\nHere's where I am most lost: order food to be made at a counter but coffee is at a separate counter? Like I can't buy food and coffee at the same time? Wth... Maybe I'm overthinking it, but, that's just it, If I wanted to think about food I would have made it myself. Will probably try again for breakfast one day when I'm feeling like a fight to the death. \n\nP.S. Not sure where the hipster vibe is coming from with some people, to me this was all uppity white folk, complete with heads so far up asses that \"excuse me\" is lost on them.", "business_id": "R8VwdLyvsp9iybNqRvm94g", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-12-11", "type": "review"}

The pizza was pretty darn good, we ordered half gladiator and half fallen angel with all of the free add ons! This includes garlic, fresno peppers, onions and an egg!! The trick that one of the staff recommended to us (that we completely forgot yo do but will do next time) was to have the egg cooked over medium since they typically serve the egg sunny side up which can be too runny for most. I personally liked the gladiator more than the fallen angel. We also decided to go with a growler which you can decide to keep or just drink at the table (of course we decided to keep it for am extra $12). It is such a uniquely shaped growler!

This last trip I did two out of the three!  I had a delicious lunch and grabbed some gifts.  I have to say that if I owned a restaurant, it would be just like LGO.  I love this place and am always happy to be in LGO, whether perusing the wine or the groovy items in the store.  I am the MOST happy when I am eating some yummy food.  For years, I have been mildly obsessed (my friends will know I am underplaying my obsession) with the commuter sandwich.  It is so very good.  Pretty much perfection. The delicious English muffin, the eggs, bacon, tomato and mayo.  It rocks my world!  \nThis trip, I tried something new (gasp!).  I was also so happy I did and will now have some debating to do when I am having a bite to eat at LGO.  This time I had the brown rice bowl.  I was opting for something on the healthy side.  This dish was some seriously tasty ingredients combined in a bowl.  Such great flavor!

It reminds of a combination of Anthropologie meets a hipster coffee joint + farmers market.  Not only do I love their food, but I love their shop - they have the best gifts that make for tons of entertainment while waiting for your food.\n\nI've had several items on their menu, though I love their tuna salad the best.  It's got a few unusual items mixed in, and it's wonderful.  It's a little on the sweet side, definitely a unique twist on a standard lunch item.  It's great on a sandwich or atop mixed greens.\n\nThe parking here is pretty crappy, which is the only reason I didn't give this place a fifth star.  The lot is teeny tiny, and because LGO is so good, it's always packed.  They do have 'complimentary valet,' but who has cash to tip them? I don't, and so valeting, while convenient, is always a pain.\n\nI highly recommend going here for breakfast or lunch - their food/pastries are amazing, their coffee/chai tea/green tea are awesome, and they have a huge dining area, with plenty of seating.", "business_id": "R8VwdLyvsp9iybNqRvm94g", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-02-06", "type": "review"}

The experience was overall very odd. We have been to 3 tastings before this one, and this was by far the weirdest. We sat in a front room with a bunch of fake cakes. We waited 5-10 minutes before the owner I suppose came out to talk with us, but instead of getting right into the cake info, she got all of our personal info first. She asked me if I had pictures of any cakes that I liked, so I showed her some pictures while I explained what I liked about each one. After showing her and telling her, she asked me 'what do you like about that one?' Ummm...I just told you. (ex: Me:Here is a cake I like, I like that it is square and has different size proportions for the different layers....her: oh, ok what do you like about it?). She then set up a laptop computer and played a slideshow of their cakes. I'm not sure why they do this, especially when I came in knowing what I wanted. Also, the pictures were not awesome...the cakes all looked the same, there must have been 50 cakes that were white with red roses sticking out of the layers. It was some serious boring cakage. Also, some of the cakes had writing on them, but instead of looking flush to the cake and professional, it looked like it was piped on at the Fry's bakery (read: birthday cake for a child). So then she brought out the cake samples, there were thin slices of vanilla vanilla, vanilla strawberry, chocolate chocolate, champagne raspberry, and lemon raspberry and maybe some others I can't remember. Honestly, the cake ranged from ok to very not good. The vanilla strawberry was by far the best, and the champagne raspberry was by far the worst. That raspberry filling was atrocious. It tasted chemically or something and the combo with the champagne cake was terrible. The chocolate was boring, tasted like grocery store cake and I'm pretty sure the 'frosting' that was on the outside of all the cakes was cool whip. It definitely was not butter cream and it was light like whipped cream, but was clearly non dairy. When the owner came out (after letting us sit out there for like 15 minutes or so...a very long period of time), we told her straight up we just didn't really like the cake, no offense, but it was not for us. She then told us that they only make the samples once every 2 weeks and we were at the end of that time period. Wow. Just so you know, they charge 15$ for tastings. For 15$ we got the equivalent of 1 slice of 2 week old cake....and they're trying to gain my business? That is definitely unforgettable, but not so much in a good way. So anyway, the owner was gracious and offered us a second tasting if we wanted, but honestly there is no way I would buy my cake from them after what I experienced. \n\n\nPS My brother got his wedding cake from this bakery a couple years ago, which is why I tried it and I remember it being fairly good, so maybe something has changed, or maybe it really is better when it is fresh, but I'm not willing to take that risk.", "business_id": "Rd5SDxM3S9QUvRayhqZl4Q", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-02-22", "type": "review"}

Jana's has them and you don't have to go to Chicago to get them. If all you know about pierogies is Mrs. T's then you should try some of Alexandra's meat or mushroom ready to make at home pierogies. So damn good. I'll tell you how to make them at home if you need to know. It involves lots of bacon and onions and a cast iron skillet.\n\nMany, many types of good cold cuts (gypsy bacon is my favorite) and I was lucky enough to get a loaf of bread on the house to try with my Polish ham- courtesy of the nice woman who rang me up.\n\nIf you are in need of oplatki to celebrate Christmas with, I'll bet they could find you some.", "business_id": "x_9nxwoGl7NBSzpBsD4iVA", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-12-18", "type": "review"}

You almost miss it driving up or down Cave Creek. They do open later (after or around 9:30 ) and close early in the late afternoon so plan ahead, and I believe they are closed on Monday's so call ahead before stopping in. You can tell they are open only when the white front doors are open to display \"OPEN\" on both sides. Otherwise, keep on driving! Hey, it is THEIR business and they can run it any way they wish, especially when their product is so very good.\n\nThe deli stocks various smoked linked sausages/kielbasas, along with ham and other cuts. Not terribly extensive but rare, tasty and reasonable.  Breads are varied but fresh made and just like one would find in a European bakery. Ask for a sample. The baked goods, no matter what you get, are off the hook, especially the cookies. Back east, our Italian in-law family had a tradition of having large cookie trays at all their weddings- HUNDREDS of cookies.They were baked by the best in the east and were very expensive per pound. Well, for all you traditionalist transplants,  call Jana's, they are that good and in most cases even better! The other cakes and such are very good.  Some pastries are an unknown taste to alot of people so they do not know the true texture and taste of authentic European delicacies. Do not judge or bash herein. Ask what the product IS, eat it, then if you do not like it, post it here but with the NAME of the delicacy and what you do not like about it. A Cinnabon is not a European cinnabon, my friends!\n\nYou can also find some Polish jarred sauerkraut or cabbage with carrot, regular kraut, frozen goodies like pierogies (from Chicago, okay I winced but once tried I am hooked) in many flavors. Again, Jana's is small inside but the delights you will find are huge. Give it a try. The service is lovely. Chat it up. CC/debit use should be greater than $10.00 but seriously,  if you leave there empty-handed, there is no sun, sky or moon! Enjoy Jana's! No, I am no paid spokeswoman, paid critic or the like. I am just a foodie who loves great service, food, and mom n pop stores. I support them any way i can!", "business_id": "x_9nxwoGl7NBSzpBsD4iVA", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-01-03", "type": "review"}

The seating is tight and awkward.  It was too chilly and rainy to eat out doors so we made it work.  \n\nWe decided on the half sandwich and soup of the day special.  The sandwich of the day was a roast beef with a cream cheese spread that was supposed to have horseradish and we had 3 soup choices, Tortilla soup, tomato basil bisque and chicken veggie pesto pasta.  Mom decided on the tortilla soup and while I told the lady tomato bisque I was thinkin the chicken pasta...and typical as it is when I picked up my meal on the tray instead of the tomato bisque, they served me the chicken pasta.     \n\nThe soup was plentiful.  Mom made a meal of the soup (her's was heartier than mine) and saved her sandwich.

Here are some of my favorite food choices:\n\nSandwich: I typically build my own sandwich which I like to call Old Faithful. It is a perfect combination of turkey, provolone, lettuce, tomato, with their parmesan pesto spread on a baguette. The parmesan pesto spread is OUT OF THIS WORLD - you haven't lived if you haven't tried it! Their chicken salad is also fantastic. They serve it with lettuce and tomato on their walnut raisin bread, and it is great! They have all kinds of great sandwich creations, all of which I've tried. I am being completely honest when I say I haven't had a bad sandwich at Breadcrafters.\n\nSalads: My favorite is the Napa Valley chicken salad. It has sliced marinated chicken with bleu cheese crumbles and grapes and is served with a champagne vinegrette. It's delish!\n\nPastries: All the pastries are great, but I love their scones and muffins. They are huuuuge portions, so you could make a breakfast out of a scone and cup of coffee. Their desserts are out of this world as well. I highly recommend the apple fritter, brownie (insanely chocolatey), lemon raspberry bars, and their molten chocolate chip cookie (it's a dark chocolate cookie with raspberry).\n\nBread and Dips: My favorite breads are the sourdough, french country (a lighter sourdough), viennese (an egg bread), garlic parmesan and regular baguettes. The dips that they sell are beau monde (a delicious herb/dill dip that's great with veggies), parmesan pesto (my fave!), roasted onion gorgonzola (another fave), and an olive tapenade. \n\nAs far as the service goes, everyone is always SUPER friendly. It's one of those \"cheers-esque\" places where everybody knows your name :) I will be a life-long customer, because this place really knows how to do good, fresh food!", "business_id": "j5HLcBru7FEirYJPbKFVWA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-01-08", "type": "review"}

It was very yummy. The only problem was that biting and chewing the sandwich was a bit tough as the crust on the (yummy) sourdough bread was tough, but it was worth it, cause it was good. \n\nHowever, two or three times I have ordered roasted red pepper (which costs extra) and received green pepper instead. I've usually been too hungry to bother asking for red pepper and just eaten the sandwich as is. \n\nI've gotten some sourdough bread to go before, makes for yummy sandwiches at home. \n\nThe other negative is that one of the women who works there before has been a bit standoffish and not very helpful. In one instance, my grandma ordered coffee only to be told they were out of it, in a not so nice tone. \n\nOverall, their bread makes for yummy sandwiches, but starting to wonder if it is worth it to go out of my way for a sandwich and mediocre service.", "business_id": "j5HLcBru7FEirYJPbKFVWA", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-12-11", "type": "review"}

Lots of great patio seating outside.  They seemed slightly understaffed for the steady trickle of guests - just one girl taking the orders AND running back making all the food - I saw a couple other people working, but had no idea what they could be doing, since she was doing it all. (she was great btw and I didn't mind waiting for her)\n\nI wanted half a sandwich with a cup of soup, which they do offer except it has to be a cold sandwich.  I also had my heart set on a hot sandwich that I saw on their website, but when I scanned the menu it wasn't even up there.  Oh well.  I got the half focaccia sandwich (turkey ham and salami with parmesan pesto) with the cup of chicken tortilla.  The soup was okay - it had potato, which I thought was odd, and they didn't give me any tortilla strips or any kind of topping for it.  The bread on the sandwich was awesome.  The meats were alright.  I liked the parmesan pesto (it definitely wasn't a pesto though - it was white instead of basil-green), but it was layed on super thick so I couldn't really enjoy the sandwich.  I got a scone to go (ended up not being very scone-like) and also a sliced loaf of the raisin walnut pecan bread.  I like the bread a lot.  Even though I didn't love my meal, I think I just got the wrong things.  I will definitely come back and maybe try a hot sandwich and another kind of soup.

Weird thing is, we noticed empty tables and booths all around but didn't want to be a pain and say anything, maybe they were short staffed even though they seem to have quite a bit on staff.... We sat down and we instantly started to notice how disgusting and dirty the place was.  The floors were disgusting and we were able to see the display case for their pies.  The case was nasty.  You could clearly tell the glass was not cleaned inside or outside for quite some time.  The inside of the case where the pies were, you could see food and other things on the bottom.

Their menu has the basic essentials and then sum for soups, salads, sandwiches and baked goods. They advertise everything is made from scratch and always fresh which I know first hand as I am a frequent patron here. If your passing through Phoenix Sky Harbor and would like to satisfy your appetite this will be the place I highly recommend. For starters I would order a \"half combination\" which consist of a half sandwich half soup, half sandwich half salad or a half salad half soup. Paradise has a variety of sandwich choices from chicken, turkey, ham or even a vegetarian sandwich to go along with a wide selection of your choice of bread. Soups? take your pick depending on what day of the week it is is what they have available, however they always have their house special soup called the Roasted Tomatoe soup which they top off with crispy tortilla strips and a drizzle of sour cream and given a freshly oven baked dinner roll to compliment your soup. If a light salad is what your more in the mood for they can assist with that at the salad bar where you will feel empowered to make your choices known of what you would like your salad to turn out to be and while your at it don't forget to pick up a chocolate chip cookie, carrot cake, bagel or cinnamon roll all freshly baked from the oven.\n\nOASN: Soups are not permitted through security, however salad dressing in packets or small containers 3 ounces or less then are TSA and Airline permitted. Lastly, Paradise also has a just for kids menu which consist of Macaroni and cheese, Turkey or Ham sandwich or Peanut Butter & Jelly.\n\nNow go and get a taste of PARADISE!", "business_id": "Cm1jT60fxb1DjwpqjWJ8EA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-02-16", "type": "review"}

The expectation is about as basic as I'm ever going to have regarding food.  Paradise Bakery, which apparently is a very well-regarded local chain, really needs to assess how to translate their successes into an airport setting.  Although she appeared to be very bored, the young lady at the counter was friendly-- no attitude problem.  I wanted mayo instead of their \"Paradise Sauce,\" and she delivered here, as well.  The sandwich was reasonably thick with meat, greens and tomatoes.  Bread, which was understood to be their strong suit, was over-sized and a bit stale; perhaps I waited too long to eat it.  There were no bottles of unsugared soda, but water was fine.  Where did things go wrong?  First, there wasn't enough paper used to wrap the sandwich and keep it intact; how expensive would 3\" of additional paper on a $7.50 sandwich have been?  Next, no napkins were packed; this should be an automatic at airport carryout.  Third, for some reason, a chocolate chip cookie was thrown into the bag.  For reasons which will be clear in a moment, it was very broken (but very tasty) when I found it.  Finally, although I specifically asked for a cheap plastic bag, I was given a froufrou paper mini shopping bag with an \"adorable\" paper handle.  I don't need to impress my fellow passengers with my good taste in shopping bags, I needed something which will neatly compress to be stowed.  If you have ever tried to reassemble a sandwich while in the middle seat of an airplane, you get the picture.  The end-product was adequate, with mayo and tomato covered hands as an added bonus.

Top this bad boy with green sauce and dive in to find kernels of corn complemented by the perfect sweetness. The green chile is also superb and highly recommended. \n\nThe staples even stand on their own. Your meal begins with crispy chips fresh out the fryer! Throw a little salt and green sauce on them and enjoy. The consistency and flavor of the beans is just right and they are not offensively overwhelmed with cheese as so many other restaurants. The rice always has great flavor, but can range in moisture from slightly dry to very moist depending on the day (I'm assuming different cooks.) And lastly the flour tortillas. These goodies are concealed by foil to keep them piping hot. Every time I unwrap them I get a little giddy. The smell is just so damn good! There are few things better than flour tortillas with rice and beans.
