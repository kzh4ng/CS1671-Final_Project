The first time I went in there, I was 19 years old on summer break from college and working at the ice cream factory up the hill.  All of the union guys from the ice cream factory went in there after work, and I immediately found out why.  MANY, MANY years later, I stopped in there with some fond memories, and once again felt welcomed and valued as a customer, even though they didn't know who I was.  THE SANDWICHES are done Pittsburgh-style, sort of like Primanti's, and they are as perfect today as they were back in ancient times when I first started visiting the place.  Alexion's is a clean and peaceful little place in the Rook Station part of Green Tree, the oldest part of the town.  I recall that some of the sandwiches I got there were ordered at a pretty late hour.

Took them almost 40 minutes to serve 3 sandwiches and a salad.

Iced tea was good, though I've never seen a place dispense sweet n low like they were giving away their last rock of crack. Asked for sugar but never saw any, they don't carry any other artificial sweeteners besides the pink stuff.\n\nI may give the place another try in the future for a Reuben or hamburger, assuming today was some aberration possibly due to a cook having a family emergency or something like that.

On my last visit to Pittsburgh I was looking for a nice bar/pub/lounge to grab dinner and watch a Penguins playoff game.  A friend of mine who lived in the area recommended Rocky's.  As I walked in the door I was pleasantly approached by the server and shown a table. It was clean, welcoming and the lounge was busy. It was Friday night and the special was the fish fry.  I ordered the fish and in the meantime I sipped on a draft brew.  The order was delivered to my table in no time.  The fish and sides were tasty and the portion size was large. As I was watching the game and enjoying the heck out of my dinner I noticed a dessert case with a nice selection of cakes.  Well needless to say I got a togo box for what was left of my dinner and ordered a slice of cheesecake.  Another good choice!  At the end of night the Penguins couldn't pull off the win over the Rangers but I definitely have a new \"go to\" when I'm in town.  Another star could be added for a smoke free environment.

Our server, Carla, was very attentive and friendly- making sure we were aware of the specials and checking back often when our glasses got to the half way point.  The other server back there was working equally as hard but I never got the chance to get her name.  \n\nI had been here one other time for an organized happy hour for a past employer and remember very similar service but I never got the chance to give them any credit.  I think D&B is an awesome place when you need some space for your next event.", "business_id": "sbW8qHJgzEIH42B0S-3New", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-07-08", "type": "review"}

I went to D&B last night for a post wedding party - which, side note, is a great idea!\n\nIt was around midnight and the bar wasn't really populated. There were three bartenders and only one was actually making rounds to see if anyone needed anything. The two other bartenders were chatting on the far side of the bar that no one was sitting at. Kind of counter productive if you ask me. \n\nI stood there for about 5 minutes, which for a busy bar is fine but when I am the only one with my card out then, it just seems a little ridiculous. I made eye contact with the one girl twice and gave her a smile and she literally turned away. I finally had to walk to them to get their attention.  I was standing right in front of them smiling and they didn't ask if i need anything. I finally said, \"Are you working?\" and they gave each other a weird look. I felt like i was the crazy one. I asked for a beer/got the beer.\n\nIn between that time, the other bartender brought food over and set it down. She took a fry from the plate (right in front of me) and then served it to someone on the other side of the bar. What the hell! I felt like i was in some grimy bar in out in the sticks - not an established D&B. \n\nI was just really turned off from that experience. \n\nThe good is that D&B provides a different type of entertainment when you want to mix things up. I remember going here with my grandparents when I was a kid and it was the best treat ever! We would eat at the restaurant and then spend hours playing games. This place holds some really good memories for me. \n\nIt's a shame that my experience last night has spoiled the high standards I held for it.", "business_id": "sbW8qHJgzEIH42B0S-3New", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-07-27", "type": "review"}

I go there just about every other week.\n\nPros: Great comedians all year round! The food/drinks are very good and the wait staff is wonderful! The Improv is a great venue for upcoming and new comedians, I always see new, local talent opening for national comedians. In one show you will see 1-2 local comedians, and 1-2 national touring comedians. The Improv has a nice environment inside with general admission seating (first come, first serve). The EMAIL LIST is essential in order to receive free ticket packages and perks, as well as reminders of upcoming comedians!\n\nCons: Prices can be steep (it is expensive/difficult to be a regular). Food and Drinks are not cheap (no specials). Expect to pay $15- $40 for tickets depending on the headliner with a two item minimum. Waiting in line before the shows wouldn't be bad if you weren't forced to stand outside in any and all weather conditions. If it is raining and you'd like a good seat, you will pay the price. \n\nOverall: This 21+ venue is a great place to spend a night out with friends or loved ones. You may buy tickets in advance online/phone or buy your tickets at the box office at the location. I highly recommend joining the mailing list to receive free tickets! Check the calendar for upcoming shows and open mic nights during the week! Support local comedy, and enjoy The Improv at the Waterfront!", "business_id": "tv8cS4aaA1VDaInYgggb6g", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-08-19", "type": "review"}

Our four items total came to about $30 (two appetizers and two beers) and the apps were really nothing to write home about and the servers aren't even very friendly.

Blah.\n\nFirst off, If you go to a show, please note there is a two item per person minimum.  This means that from their extensive menu of overpriced bar food and drinks, you are REQUIRED to choose two items each.    \n\nSecond, the sodas are NOT FREE REFILLS!  I learned that one the hard way.  Get water. \n\nThird, before tipping your server, please make sure she hasn't already taken her cut out.  Even after paying for two very bland, overpriced meals and way too many Diet Cokes, I thought that my bill was rather high.  Upon further inspection, I noticed that my server had taken an 18% gratuity.  The menu explicitly says that an automatic gratuity will be taken out for parties of six or more, but there was only two of us and we weren't even drunk.  I found this tactic awfully presumptuous and left her tip at the 18% even though I typically tip well over 20%.    \n\nOverall, I don't like the idea of being required to purchase food just to see a comedy show.  I can see why they do it, but if I were required to buy a crappy popcorn and overpriced pop every time I went to the movies, I would be far less inclined to go as I am not inclined to go to the Improv again.", "business_id": "tv8cS4aaA1VDaInYgggb6g", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-08-09", "type": "review"}

Incidentally, \"The Hangover\" is one of the funniest movies I've seen in years and worth the $10 to see it in the theater.  Okay, back to the restaurant the space itself is very nice.  There are plenty of hightops, plasmas and a few booths.  It's spacious and they have outdoor seating and open windows.  We sat at the bar and were greeted relatively quickly by the bartender who was tending a pretty much empty bar.  I ordered a guinness as usual, Rob ordered a long island iced tea and Matt had a miller light.  Make sure and tell them if you want a top shelf tea else you'll be getting the stuff in the plastic bottles.  I sampled Rob's long island tea and it was not that good way too much sours.  The next one he ordered was much better after a little guidance to the bartender.  The bartender herself was okay, not too friendly but quick enough with the pours.  I don't remember her name which is usually not a good sign.  We ordered a few things from the appetizer menu.  We started with the chips and salsa.  The chips were crisp enough, but not served warm and the salsa had some spice but the colors were a little off kind of looked like the color of pea soup.  Rob then ordered the philly cheese steak sliders.  I tried one it was okay I guess  the bun was warm and it was pretty loaded with cheese and onions.  He asked for a side of mayo and they said they were out, which is bizarre because there is a giant eagle a couple blocks away.  This pretty much sums up my experiences at the Bar Louie's I've been too.  They kind of do just enough for me to come back but rarely make any real effort with service.  Maybe I'm being too critical... I tried to order the baked goat cheese, but they were out... So, I settled on the hummus appetizer.  This was surprisingly pretty good.  The pita was warm and toasted the hummus had lots of flavor and the tabouleh was edible.  It's probably best to stick to simple stuff when dining here.  Matt had the hot wings which I tried one and it was okay, your pretty standard mass produced chicken wing.  All in all this place isn't that bad.

I was here last night and on a Monday this place was doing brisk business (definitely a good sign).  The space itself is beautiful.  You  enter from S. Highland into the outdoor dining area, which because of the heaters is viable almost every day of the year.  There is plenty of seating outdoors and a few tables indoors.  The design is contemporary.  The bar is large and has a nice area opposite for more informal seating.  The one thing I dislike about the bar area is that the \"stools\" are actually chairs that are not moveable, so your distance next to your \"neighbor\" is pre-determined.  I also prefer to stand at  the bar instead of sitting and this set up makes that more difficult.  The wine selection is pretty extensive and they have a good happy hour special that any wine or premium cocktail is just $5, which is really good when many of their wines are priced at over $10 per glass.  The hostess was very nice and professional even though she was young taking our names as we went to the bar for a drink and then anticipating our return with two menus in hand.  The server was a nice enough guy and helpful when it came time for our dinner selection.  We ordered a bottle of conundrum which is a delicious choice and I guess in line with what others charge.  We were started with an olive tepenade (sp?) and some crusty toasted thinly sliced ciabatta I think.  The tepenade was too oily and salty for me, but I guess it's what I should expect since it's ground up olives basically.  The bread was great.  It was warm really hearty bread that was wheat I think, definitely not white.  It was served with room temperature butter with some sea salt on top.  Really good start.  We then tried the smoked salmon appetizer.  I'm a huge fan of smoked salmon and was pleased with the quality of the fish, served nicely with capers and chopped egg.  It also was served with a patatoe pancake that was crisp on the outside with warm and delicious  filling.  The only thing I was a bit perplexed about was why it wasn't served with some type of bread or crouton to put the salmon on.  However, the waiter was happy to oblige by bringing out a few of the toasted ciabatta.  We also tried the lamb mac and cheese (omg was this good).  The pasta was cooked al dente' and definitely made in house.  The sauce and lamb were amazing.  This would make a fine entree' in my opinion and is total comfort food reinvented.  The only detraction I'd say is that it is a very heavy dish to serve as an appetizer on a summer menu.  Fiona had the arugula salad which was nicely prepared with pork belly (kind of like bacon), feta, and a few other interesting ingredients.  We also tried the short rib ravioli, which was incredible as well albeit a heavy dish.  By the time we got to this I think we only tried one ravioli each (plenty of leftovers).  This is such a rich dish, because shortribs are like the epitome' of richness and then to wrap them in ravioli and add cream sauce is really indulgent.  But, then again this is my chef not my cardiologist.  I tried the Elysian Fields Lamb which was cooked perfectly medium and then served with their homemade pasta wrapped around some of the lamb as well.  This was really good and the pasta was a surprise.  I actually would have preferred a green vegatable on the side instead of pasta and mashed potatoes.  The bartenders are good, especially FionaOverall, a really good place and a nice flagship of the big burrito group.", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-06-24", "type": "review"}

Citing a mix of Mediterranean and Northern African influences with a bargain Piccola Gusto Menu for lunch and the option for indoor or al fresco dining it seemed as if Casbah was a can't miss option...well, sometimes things don't turn out quite as you expect - almost everything that transpired from the moment we arrived until the moment we left was a failure.\n\nWhen our server, a young woman named Amanda L who would prove quite inept and inefficient from start to finish, finally did arrive our menus were delivered with a brief hello before she wandered away - another server later stopped by to fill our water and drinks were never even offered.  When Amanda finally did return she was capable of answering a couple questions about portion size and our orders were placed.  With my mom and sister opting for the two-course Gusto lunch and myself choosing two courses a la carte we sat and sipped our water.\n\nWaiting approximately 10 minutes another ancillary server arrived with bread and butter - a light and airy white bread with a hefty crust paired with a sweet and salted cow's milk butter - decent, but nothing to write home about compared to the myriad bread options at Eleven.  After this point we would not see another staff member for 30 minutes...well, we would see them, they just wouldn't be walking anywhere near our table - instead bussing tables and running around while the hostess flirted with a man at the bar...I'll note that my water glass remained empty for greater than 15 minutes.\n\nFinished with our first courses approximately 10 minutes would pass - long enough for me to actively collect each and every plate and stack them at the empty seat of our four-top - before Amanda would finally return to collect the dirty plates...we'd not see her again until 15 minutes later when she filled our water glasses and told us our main courses would be \"right out.\"  While I guess she didn't define \"right out,\" what this actually meant was \"in 25 minutes.\"  Starting first with my mother's combo - Jumbo Lump Crab, pepper bacon, avocado, radish sprouts, on a paesano bun and Orecchiette Pasta with grilled chicken, dried cranberries, Riverview Farms goat cheese, sage cream. While the sandwich may not be memorable, the pasta was actually quite impressive.  Using a less salty cheese and mild cream to flavor the al dente little ears of pasta worked wonders while the sweet/savory m\u00e9lange of craisins and grilled chicken were a nice match.\n\nVastly less well done than my mother's plate would be my sister's option - the Grilled Vegetables, portobello, zucchini, eggplant, arugula, chickpea hummus, on baguette and Maccheretto pasta with wild mushrooms, white beans, sun-dried tomatoes, rapini pesto, fontina, walnuts.  Beginning with the sandwich, the bite I had was good in taste but rather mushy in consistency - too many similar vegetable textures and the hummus spread too thickly.  Moving on to the pasta - we all tasted it, but I'm still not sure what we were supposed to be tasting - it tasted like watery cheese...no spice, no salt, and certainly nothing resembling pesto or tomatoes.  For the first time in the meal Amanda actually opted to check on us approximately 10 minutes into our main courses and when told of the watery pasta she did apologize and offered to replace it with something else - more Orcchiette.\n\nFor my main course I received a simple side salad-fresh greens, crispy onion strings, and a pleasant vinaigrette.  The salad, of course, was served alongside Elysian Fields Lamb \"Mac and Cheese\", tubetti pasta, mascarpone, cheddar, Pecorino-Romano, and bread crumbs.  Piping hot and browned with crispy bread crumbs the dish was a decent Macaroni and Cheese, but honestly the lamb was so scarce and thinly cut that it added little.\n\nCompleting our mains approximately 110 minutes after entering Casbah we again waited nearly ten minutes before anyone would stop by to collect dirty plates-a different ancillary server this time.  With my mother and sister already deciding enough was enough they stood up to use the restroom before leaving-by the time Amanda would stop by to ask if anyone would care for dessert our two course meal had lasted 2:05 and I skipped on a menu entailing bread pudding, carrot cake, and panna cotta with \"just the bill.\"\n\nSettling the bill via credit card no tip was left because no tip was deserved - in reality Amanda may have actually be the worst server I've encountered at a fine dining establishment in the last 2 years.  I will note that when I wrote to Big Burrito was met by a (seemingly) sincere apology without excuses - the Manager stated things don't' normally happen like that and he'd be sure the issue was addressed.  He closed with \"I hope you will join us again.\" I will not.", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-07-06", "type": "review"}

And voila, indeed, it's another excruciatingly overpriced bistroid in da burgh.\n\nThe atmosphere is actually quite lovely, inside or out. The colors are comfortable, the noise levels subtle, the seating comfortable, and the service staff looks professional (YOUNG) with no Coney Island side show appearances.\n\nThe service was good. Not overly friendly, but not uppity like young people waiting tables in more upscale restaurants tend to be in da bugh.\n\nThe menu was short, but did have a list of pretty unique offerings.  My friend had a salmon salad, and I opted to try the Farm Lamb Mac-n-Cheese.  The waiter brought a small basket with bread to the table accompanied by a single medium sized pat of salted butter to spread.  For a beverage, we both opted for just water.\n\nI have to say, if I actually had to pay for this, I would have been pretty miffed.  \n\nFor LUNCH, the prices were all around the $15 range, and the portions were NOT large.  The portions were actually fine for lunch, not overly filling (by any stretch of the imagination), but they didn't leave you hungry.\n\nI can't speak for the salmon, as I have NEVER had salmon in any form other than lox that didn't taste like a dried sawdust version of some strong fish. She seemed to enjoy it very much, so there it is.\n\nThe Farm Lamb mac n cheese was tasty. The lamb was tender and moist, and the mac n cheese was a tiny tube pasta with a very nice creamy cheesy sauce, all topped with a bread crumb covering when it was broiled until crispy.  It was accompanied by a 'pinch' of mesclun salad topped with another pinch of fried onions.\n\nBasically - take one large spoonful of mac n cheese with a higher end cheese sauce and a fancier noodle than comes in the average box - mix in about four cubes of roast lamb, sprinkle on a layer of bread crumbs and toss it in the broiler until the crumbs are toasted - then using your index finger and thumb, pick up a pinch of mesclun and sit it on the plate next to the mac n cheese bowl - and you have a bistroid expensive art project on a plate.\n\nSeriously? $15 for lunch? It's mac n cheese people!\n\nI also have to call into question the name and theme.  Mad Mex is bistroid Tex Mex.  Soba is bistroid Asian.  Kaya is bistroid Caribbean-ish.  Casbah? Farm Lamb mac n cheese? Sure, I can see this as a box lunch while riding a camel through the desert...not.\n\nI can't say the experience was awful. The company was awesome, and we had a nice unpressured amount of time for fun chat.  The atmosphere was comfortable, and the food was tasty.  But was it all worthy of a return trip or recommendation?  I honestly can't say 'yes' with any kind of cheerleader rave.  \n\nI'm not quite sure that I comprehend the mindset of people in this burgh who think paying that kind of money for food is worth it, when honestly, food with just as much flavor can be found in abundance around town for half the price and twice the portion. \n\nWho are all of these easily dupe-able rich people, and where do they come from?

The sea scallops would have been delicious except for the \"cured egg yolk\" which was infused in the avacado sauce.

No complaints at all.\n\nOverall, a very pleasant experience.  Good atmosphere.  Our waitress was very friendly.  The place was busy and had a nice vibe to it.  Unfortunately, some of the food was a slight disappointment.", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-07-21", "type": "review"}

It had been a couple of years since I had last been to Casbah and while I remembered it being decent, it differed a bit from my fiance's opinion that this was the best of the Big Burrito restaurants.  Due to that it had been on my list of restaurants to visit so that I could get a better opinion of it.  The restaurant looked the same that I remembered it with a large outdoor seating area and a smaller one inside with the bar on one side of the restaurant and the dining room on the other.  It was all nicely and tastefully decorated.\n\nI arrived shortly after 5 PM and immediately made my way into the bar area of the restaurant as I hate taking up a table if I am eating by myself.  There was no one else at the bar at this point and the bartender quickly greeted me and gave me a happy hour menu while explaining it to me.  I had not been planning on getting a drink but one of the $6 cocktails caught my eye and I ended up ordering it.  The bartender was pretty friendly guy and explained how he came up with the drink while he made the drink and we chatted for a bit.  For my entr\u00e9e I decided to order the Long Island Duck which was a roasted breast, braised leg, gnocchi, spinach, rosemary, black mission figs and duck jus.  Whenever I had ordered it I had actually missed the fact that it came with a braised leg and was excited to see that extra unexpected portion of meat on my plate whenever it was delivered to me.  The whole meal ended up being incredibly tasty with the duck breast being cooked perfectly with nice seasoning and not greasy at all.  This was in stark contrast to the leg which was incredibly juicy and greasy which I absolutely loved.  Normally I am not a fan of greasier duck but the two preparations really helped to enhance the other.  Finally the figs provided a nice touch of sweetness while the gnocchi was pillow like and tasty.  It was also nice to be able to taste a hint of rosemary on them which I had forgotten about between the time I had ordered and when it was delivered.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here again in the future.  Both my cocktail and my meal were really good and I would actually consider this to be one of the best meals that I have eaten in a little while.", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-06-27", "type": "review"}

Casbah is located on a wonderful, neighborhood street in the Shadyside area of Pittsburgh. We got there a little early and waited a little in the lot. Our reservation was for 11 and they open at 11. We were still told the valet had to move our car. I get they have a way they do things and it must work for them but the lot has about 40 spaces that you can see from the street so I don't know why valet is necessary. We are particular about our vehicles and we don't valet anywhere. Not that the valets weren't nice and it's not like we could not see them move the car but anyway...the main reason they get a 4 and not a 5 star. Onto the meal...\n\nWe waited just a few minutes in line to be seated. As I said our reservation was at 11 & that is when they open. We were seated promptly requesting the inside area of their dining room. They do have a very nice, shaded patio area as well complete with ceiling fans. We requested to sit inside and the hostess happily obliged. We were greeted quickly by a happy and knowledgeable waitress who was on it. She was not at all intrusive but our water was never empty and we didn't have to wait long for our check when we were done. She asked if we wanted any other beverage. I got an iced tea and the hubby requested iced coffee. The waitress noted they could make one for him by adding ice to coffee and he said yes. He was very happy they would accommodate his request. \n\nWe ordered our food and were promptly brought a basket of bread (oh the wonderful bread basket!). We got 3 types of amazing breadly goodness that included cranberry scones (wow), biscuits (warm, soft, & the Hubby's favorite), and (my favorite) the lime, coconut muffin (sweet, lime, coconut, what's not to love). Oh, and let us not forget the maple butter, yum! I ordered the smoked salmon app. The combo of salmon, capers, aioli, and truffled potato cake - absolute perfection! There was a salty, smokey, sweet flavor that was sheer joy on my taste buds. The hubby chose the creamy polenta which he thoroughly enjoyed noting it was very oatmeal like. For my entree it was the sea scallop fry minus the caramelized onions. I would SOOOO get this again! The scallops were cooked to perfection with a wonderful golden outside that makes my heart sing with joy (can you tell I love a good sea scallop?). The combo of English peas, fennel sausage, and white corn grits...it was something special for sure! I could eat that sausage by the boat load every single day! And the grits - smooth, creamy, and perfectly seasoned. Not that it needed it but the dish comes with scrambled eggs and a beautifully, buttery croissant. My brunch was so satisfying, Heaven! The hubby chose the eggs Benedict with prosciutto. He liked it but noted he should have gotten the spinach not the prosciutto. He said the prosciutto seemed vinagary. The dish includes paprika roasted fingerling potatoes which were mild and perfectly cooked. And for dessert we chose the chocolate stout cake on a wine caramel drizzle served with a little dish of creme brulee ice cream. Holy cow! What a terrific chocolate cake & the ice cream rocked too. \n\nOverall, I would recommend Casbah to everyone noting their brunch was fabulous! The valet (even though the need for valet is questionable) and wait staff were super nice, attentive, & knowledgeable. The apps, brunch, & dessert were yummy and delightful.

My friends and I went here for one of my friend's birthday. The food was simple yet delicious and transported me back to Greece. Upon being seated, they offered complimentary bread with butter and mascarpone spread. The waiter was very knowledge about the menu and recommended his favorites which included the pork chop entree and that soft shell crabs and corn were in season. As a result, my friends and I shared the soft shell crab app. The soft shell crab was fried to perfection with a small side salad of sliced asparagus and basil with tapenade. The only complaint I had with this dish was that there was only one to share between the three of us. \n\nFor the entrees, I decided to heed the waiter's advice and selected the pork chop while my friends ordered the gnocchi and cioppino. What I am about to describe for the pork chop does not do it justice. The pork chop was cooked to the right temperature and did not lost its juiciness unlike most of my experiences with pork chop. It was also huge because it was double cut. The riscotto and braised kale complimented the pork chop well with the braised kale giving the pork chop an herbal component. I did not think I would be able to finish the dish but when I looked down again, everything was gone. I had the opportunity to try my friends' dishes and they were also prepared in an exceptional way. The veal and lobster in the gnocchi added a welcoming heartiness to the dish and the sauce reminded me of a curry. The unexpected combination of the gnocchi and curry-like sauce pleasantly surprised me. Since I have never tried cioppino until that day, I did not have anything to compare it but I was satisfied with the amount of seafood they gave. The only complaint from my friend was that the grilled bread that came with the dish was too hard for her to use to soak about the sauce. She used the complimentary bread instead and loved the sauce.\n\nWhile we were ordering our dishes, we mentioned to our waiter that it was my friend's birthday. He brought out a dish of caramel with \"Happy Birthday\" written on it with dark chocolate sauce for her even though we didn't expect anything from them. I am grateful that they brought that dish out. I do not know if the caramel is on their menu but it melted right away in your mouth. \n\nIf you managed to read all the way to the end of this review, you probably are asking why I didn't give Casbah all five stars and I will tell you the reason. Although our waiter went above and beyond to get my friend a birthday \"plate\", the service overall was not satisfactory. Throughout the meal, he did not come over to our table and took a long time getting our checks to us even though we blatantly had finished our dinner for awhile. I have gone to less delicious restaurants who offer better service.\n\nOverall, the food at Casbah is exceptional. They change their menu based on what is in season. Here's a tip: if you sign up for the Big Burrito emails (the parent company of Casbah at https://secure.bigburrito.com/Register.aspx), you will get a free meal voucher on your birthday which is good at any of their restaurants. When my parents come into town, I will be subtly hinting that they take me here.", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-08-11", "type": "review"}

Being that it is a little out of my price range normally, I figured it was the best place to use my coupon and celebrate my birthday! Believe it or not, this was the 2nd Big Burrito restaurant that I have ever been to, Kaya being my first (and I only visited the Sunday prior to coming here on Friday). \n\nMy boyfriend and I made reservations for 6:30 pm on a Friday. We only made them the night before and it wasn't a problem at all. When you arrive, there is complimentary valet parking- how awesome is that? We were sat on the covered patio area, which I really loved. It was a little slanted, which was weird, but our table wasn't thankfully. It was really beautiful- plants and art all around. We started off with drinks- I ordered the white wine flight. Having had a wine flight one other time, I found these to be pretty reasonably priced. I received three small glasses of white wine for $11. Each one was delicious and I really loved how they were all from different places (Austria, Italy and Spain). \n\nNext, we received bread and two types of butter. One was more traditional and the other was a homemade lemon and herb butter. I really liked them both! For my entr\u00e9e, I ordered the pork chop. It came with a magical mix of sauces and two side dishes- one that was mainly potatoes and the other being saut\u00e9ed kale. WOW. The garlic cream sauce was unbelievable, the pork chop was HUGE and literally cooked to perfection. The kale was perfect, not bitter at ALL (how do they do that?)- it was amazing. The portion was huge and I somehow engulfed the entire thing. My boyfriend ordered the short rib ravioli's and loved it- although he preferred my meal over his. I was so full that I skipped the desert. They noticed my birthday coupon and presented me with an adorable little plate with \"Happy Birthday\" written in chocolate and two salted caramels- what an adorable touch! \n\nService was perfect, the wine was perfect, the food was perfect... now I see what the fuss is all about. This might be one of my new \"special occasion\" spots-  and we are planning to come back next month for my boyfriend's birthday (I need that pork chop in my life again, stat!).", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-06-18", "type": "review"}

My last experience at Casbah was excellent (minus the dining partner but that's another story) so I suggested dining there for this occasion and, since he is not from the area, he trusted my judgment (and my Yelp elite status lol) to choose a great restaurant. I actually made reservations for 8:15pm this past Saturday while I was on the way back from my vacation. Personally, I was quite surprised there was still same day dining availability, but of course I didn't question it. We arrived right on time and used the complimentary valet (get your ticket validated before exiting the restaurant) which was great, particularly since it was raining. We were seated inside and normally I would have rather dined outside but due to the rain, I actually appreciated the inside spot. \n\nI began with a glass of Malbec (my new favorite go-to wine) and my bf had a Cab. We were brought bread which came with regular butter and another seasoned spread which was more flavorful. The bread was fresh and warm, much appreciated since we were both famished. We started off with a cheese tasting and chose the Jasper Hill \"Harbison\"; Vermont, cow's milk, soft; the Sardinia \"Calcagno\"; Italy, sheep's milk, hard; and the Misty Creek Goat Dairy Leon \"Leonora\"; Spain, goat's milk, soft. The tasting was accompanied by bread (I believe the same we were first served upon sitting down) and three spreads-a mustard, a fig spread, and an additional sweet spread, pinkish in color-possibly pomegranite spread. We both LOVED the tasting and all of the cheeses paired excellently with our red wine! We easily cleared the cheese board. For entrees, my bf had the Ricotta Cavatelli( house-made fennel sausage, spinach, crushed tomatoes, ricotta) and I had the Orecchiette (grilled chicken, dried cranberries, Riverview Farms goat cheese, sage cream). He devoured his pasta, however, I was able to sneak a small bite for it was entirely consumed and it was quite tasty! The sausage had a bit of spice to it that was very flavorful. I absolutely loved the orecchiette! The savoriness of the goat cheese compounded with the sweet tartness of the cranberries was heaven in my mouth! The chicken itself was quite flavorful and the pasta was cooked perfectly, not too firm yet not too soft. Another testament to the greatness of this dish is that my leftovers, heated in the microwave the following day, tasted just as good as the meal did when dining at Casbah! Unfortunately, we were stuffed to the brim and too full for dessert, which will be on the agenda for our next dining experience here. The only criticism I had this go-around was the service. We had a male server who was just not personable, unlike the last time I dined here and the server hit the ball out of the park with her friendliness, multiple suggestions and explanations, and knowledge of the menu. This server never introduced himself, mumbled and talked so quietly it was difficult to hear him, and rarely checked on us. My wine glass sat empty for quite some time before he came around and I had to ask him for a glass as he didn't offer if I'd like another. The main reason for dining out is the food, which was incredibly delicious so I will return, however, I hope next visit the service can match or exceed that of my first visit here since that exceptional service contributed to my wanting to return here again and this particular service made me feel quite undervalued as a customer.", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-06-24", "type": "review"}

I enjoyed the food at that event so I settled on coming here.\n\nThe atmosphere of Casbah is really cute.  It's slightly upscale, but you will still feel comfortable in nice jeans.

Plenty of lamb and lots of cheese.  It was on the creamy side of the mac and cheese scale.  I would order it again, but I would also like to try other things on the menu.

The scallops were cooked well and it was chock full of crab. It was very rich. Nothing about the preparation was special, and it wasnt spicy and it was green with pesto so the name red pepper is somewhat of a misnomer, but for the pure weight of fresh lump crab makes this dish 8/10, even with a pretty high price for pasta of $35.\nDessert- milk sponge cake- small and fairly dry, which again, with name \"sponge\" one would be disappointed to expect a moist cake. 3/10.\nservice- the service was fine, not amazing, seemed like waiter was a little too busy for the higher prices of food. although the ambience on porch was nice, they seemed to have a hard time regulating the temperature, with various times of sweat building on the brow, throughout the meal. 5/10\ntotal: 30/7=4.something and given the price, how good everything looked on the menu and the disappointment of anticipated greatness, I'm rounding down. \nbig burrito is a shooting 50% (props to mad Mex), curious to see how they do in the rubber match.", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-08-15", "type": "review"}

It is my birthday month and Big Burrito offers a great deal for anyone who is on their mailing list, providing their patrons with a free entr\u00e9e up to $30.00 at any of their locations beside Umi.  I chose Casbah since I have been to all of them but this one.\n\nOur reservations were early at 5pm on a Sunday.  We arrived seated quickly in their outside seating area, which is very nice.  We were brought some water while we reviewed the menu.  I decided to start with a Manhattan to drink.  It was very nice, and strong.  Next we decided to order.  Earlier I looked online at their menu and I decided I would be ordering either the Cioppino, littleneck clams, mussels, shrimp, scallops, halibut, grilled sourdough -32 or their Long Island Duck, roasted breast, braised leg, gnocchi, spinach, lavender, peaches, duck jus- 29.  I have had the duck dish at Soba before and loved it, but I wanted to try the Cioppino despite that, since I also love seafood and shellfish.  This I would discover was a mistake.  My partner got the Pork Chop dinner.  We placed our orders and waited.\n\nDuring our wait they brought some bread.  It was a nice touch; the bread was warm and served with two types of spreads.  By the time our entr\u00e9es came I wanted another drink and asked for Boyd and Basil - 10 Boyd & Blair vodka, fresh lemon, basil, soda, Angostura bitters, this was one of their signature cocktails.  So we began to eat.  The scallops in the dish were excellent.  Perfect sear and seasoned, as well as the shrimp.  The tiny piece of halibut in the dish and I mean tiny, was so overcooked.  I choked it down but completely unappealing and tiny.  The sauce in this fish soup was also not that great.  The dish came with bread to soak up the juices but the bread itself was burnt and hard.  It actually hurt my mouth to bite it and that was after dipping it in the juices.  I was going to ask for more bread, hold the burn, but our server had not come back.  So I finished the meal and said forget it.  \n\nAt this point the drink I ordered was still not delivered.  I was done eating and had to use the restroom so I told my husband if he came back without my drink to tell him forget it and just bring the check.  When I got back to the table that was indeed what happened.  Except he told him he was sorry and if we ordered dessert he would comp my drink.  So when he finally returned, he ordered the Chocolate Cheese Cake Bombe, Pinotage syrup & whipped cream, hazelnuts, praline ice cream, gastrique, when the waiter asked me I simply said no thank you, can I just have the drink I ordered?  He brought dessert and my drink and explained it was \"on the house, and it was their/his fault.\"  No biggy really, I was way more annoyed with my meal.  I think what really bothered me was one, how small the entr\u00e9e was.  It was more suited to be a lunch portion in my opinion.  And then how much it was, but I did have the coupon so I guess I can't complain that much about that.  Simply put if I had spent $32.00 on the meal I got I would have been very upset.  Lastly, the halibut was so overcooked and dry, same with the toast, and the sauce wasn't that pleasant.  All in all I wish I would have gone with the duck.

Not bad. If you're hungry, you can either grab some complimentary popcorn or peanuts to snack on. \n\nThe bartender was very good, as was the variety of music.

The place was pretty full with people participating in their weekly Trivia night. Although it looked like a lot of fun, we didn't take part.\n\nMy boyfriend was hungry and thirsty. I was just thirsty\n\nAlthough it was only around 9 in the evening, the majority of people were drinking - not eating. As I mentioned in my first review of this restaurant, the menu is pretty small. Also, all of the food is pretty much prepared by the owner at one end of the bar. He uses microwaves to heat up just about everything. The food isn't bad, it's just not great and there's absolutely nothing special about it. So, do yourself a favor and come here for beer.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the gyro and hummus platter. I noticed that the tzatziki sauce had been sitting out uncovered and underneath a hot light for a significant amount of time before finally being covered by the owner. I found this to be a bit gross, especially since there is dairy in the sauce. By the way, we learned that the sauce is not homemade, but is doctored up by the owner.\n\nThe hummus platter came with two warm (microwaved) pitas. The owner noted that he makes his own hummus. It was pretty tasty, but definitely wasn't a plentiful portion.\n\nWhat I didn't like about this experience at The Park House was that the owner was eating food behind the counter (with gloves) and seemed to be preoccupied with a woman that was sitting near us. I wanted to say something to him about eating with his gloves on, but I felt extremely awkward.\n\nWe'll continue to come here, but in the future we will pass on the food.", "business_id": "YRDKsBFYP7G0E8BLJKIkvA", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-08-19", "type": "review"}

Somehow, even though we have both been to Max's quite a few times before neither of us had ever seen the sampler platter option on their menu.  For just a bit more than the cost of the regular entrees, you can choose three entrees and two sides.  Obviously the portions of each selection are smaller than the individual meals, but the size is still generous and there were only a couple things not available for the sampler platter.  Between the two of us we selected six different items and four different sides to try and shared everything - and still had enough left for a full meal each the next day.  I can't even decide on my favorite of all the items we tried.  If you aren't sure about some of the entrees, this is a great way to see what you like.

My partner has been in the basement before for various work-related functions, but I had never been there, despite driving by on numerous occasions. \n\n    We easily found on-street parking and entered the restaurant. I immediately loved the decor in the entry room/bar area, and those pleasant furnishings continued into the more intimate rear room where we were seated. We enjoyed the beautiful wall tapestries, and I thought the old newspaper-like menus were pretty cool! I was surprised (in a good way) at the old-fashioned urinals in the men's room. In a city that has struggled to nourish and revitalize its history over the years I was already a fan of how unique Max's was in the regard of feeling \"authentic\" in an era of predictable chains.\n\n     We were initially enticed by the prospect of ordering fried soft pretzels stuffed with cheese as a shared appetizer only to find out they were not available. We settled for the non-cheese-stuffed version, which were \"melt in your mouth\" good and were handsomely complemented by tangy honey mustard. We were a bit dehydrated after walking miles around the city, yet our waitress was very attentive in consistently replenishing our water glasses as soon as they were half-empty. I was craving a burger but was tempted instead by the fried fish sandwich, which I ordered with a side of potato pancakes and applesauce. My partner ordered a fried chicken sandwich with the same side I did. \n\n    Our food arrived surprisingly promptly. My fish sandwich was HUGE! I had enough to take home and enjoy for a post-work meal the following evening. The fish tasted fresh, although I wasn't a fan of having to pick small bones out of my mouth in exchange for enjoying that freshness. The bread it was served upon was tasty as well. The potato pancakes were thick, fresh, and were delicious when enjoyed with the chunky applesauce. My partner also thoroughly enjoyed his own sandwich. \n\n    As if this wasn't good enough our check was only $22!

There is usually a decent selection of meats, and the potato pancakes are almost always featured.

The sauasages of all varieties have been great.  The weinerschnitzel also great.  Sandwiches all good as well.  I really like the cheesy spaetzle dish that is just like macaroni and cheese but with spaetzle noodles!  I don't get too crazy and order anything complicated, though.\n\nSides-  I love love love their sides.  I could live on the spaetzle and potato pancakes.  Don't pass the sides up!\n\nDessert:  Also love their desserts.  There is a chocolate chocolate cake that they heat up with homemade whipped cream that is TO DIE FOR.  Not so shockingly, the apple strudel is wonderful as well.\n\nBesides the food, the servers are always very friendly and efficient.  There is also ample street parking, which is really nice.  Definitley check this place out if you have not yet.", "business_id": "IxQ1ATP_Wg_QujO9nywzcQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-06-03", "type": "review"}

I hate writing a less than stellar review of a business. It actually makes my cold goth baby heart sad. No one WANTS to go somewhere and get bad service, thats just ludicrous. (Not Ludacris, close but not the same.)\n\nI have just recently moved to Beechview and the best part of moving to a new part of this wonderful city is giving new businesses a try! I have sampled so many tasty and amazing new food items and coffee drinks etc etc. I am always in search of a non-smoking bar where I can hang out, eat, drink, and get to know the locals. I prefer small bars with \"yinzers\" as they tend to be a true gauge of a neighborhood for me. \n\nWe have many friends in this area, which means that we got some great tips before we even moved in about different types of food, stores, laundromats, and bars. One of these tips, repeated from friend to friend, was The Huddle. As the name implies it is a bar where you can be certain you can watch a sports game of whatever sport-ball type you're interested in. It is indeed non-smoking, a handful of tables suitable for 4 people and a \"U\" shaped bar right in the center as soon as you come in. It is a cash only establishment with an ATM on site for quick transactions. The have free popcorn from a popcorn machine which makes the place smell amazing. It's been around quite a while which means that there is a great group of locals who frequent the establishment. \n\nThis is truly everything I need in a local bar. We had been in for the very first time for drinks shortly after moving in and happened to be in there on one of their two weekly wing nights. This are not the wee tiny wings, more a weird in between of some of the \"full\" size wings I've had other places that clearly came from giant monster mutant chickens (I mean maybe they were goose wings, who even knows... they were huge) and the teeny tiny wing night wings you find most other places. They have two options; buffalo (sloppy) and \"tanned\" which are buffalo then cooked again so they are drier and crisp and un-freaking-believeable. The prices are mega cheap and it's so filling and delicious we've been back more than once for them. I like this place so much we have even taken the handsome-boyfriend's mother there when she was in town for the weekend. (P.S. She loved it too!) \n\nMy dear sweet lovely readers, here is where I have to talk about something less than all of the amazing parts I've already mentioned. Tonight, both ravenous from too little food and too much work-day, we trekked up the monster that is Coast Avenue for beers and food and a chill environment (that would undoubtably involve pre-season football). We walk in the door and aside from an employee (other than the bartender) and a few people in the back at tables, we are the only patrons aside from one regular. We belly up to the bar on the far side and say our hellos. This is where I get a serious case of the sad. The bartender working seemed annoyed by our presence. Ok, I get it... I work sort of indirectly with the public I have days where I can't handle people. It happens! As customers come in and sit down, she greets them with a warmth that was clearly lacking. Ok. That's sort of disappointing but still fine. When we got to the point that we asked for a menu three times while she retrieved menus and took orders for the people next to us an hour after we came in... thats where I start to have an issue with the service. Eventually we decided to leave because I was tipping over the line to \"hangry\" and was afraid I'd lose my temper after the 3rd time we had asked for menus and didn't get them while she continued to warmly greet other patrons and provide them menus and take their orders while refilling our beers seemed to be an annoyance to her to the point of not even asking if we wanted another or the same beer and just taking the glass and starting to fill it (wherein I had to stop her because I hadn't asked her for another one and actually just wanted the tab cashed out).\n\nYes, of course I'll give it another try, I want this to be my local hang out bar. My service in sitting at the table or being served by the woman I presume is the owner has been great. The food is amazing. The prices are great. Don't let me down, The Huddle.", "business_id": "wan0X-oHpLgGTPXqaICZCw", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-08-21", "type": "review"}

Place also has a solid beer selection, which is reasonably priced.  That said, we've found that it's a total mistake to order anything else off the menu -- except at breakfast, which again is pretty good.  (Their omlets are huge!)  For example, we once ordered a spinach-artichoke app.  Sounded delicious.  Um... it was creamed spinach (probably of frozen origin) with some canned artichokes in it.  Disappointing to say the least.\n\nAlso be aware that they close the kitchen ... when they feel like it.  I didn't know that until we were drinking a few beers there a while back and they made a kitchen last call.  My sister asked the bartender when the kitchen closes -- he said, when we feel like it.\n\nOne thing is for sure, though, if you go with what they do best (Pizza and beer), you won't be disapointed.  Plus, the servers are true Pittsburgh and generally very sweet.", "business_id": "qemCNgjeYGcFsRwxW9x4xw", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-08-15", "type": "review"}

My dad got a meatball casserole which is something I would have never ordered...meatballs and casserole aren't a selling point for me, let alone as a package deal.  This meatball casserole dish was just pasta and meatballs...thankfully for my dads heart. \n\nMy sister got a salad (again just iceberg lettuce, croutons, cucumbers) with chicken fingers.  She also split a small mushroom pizza with my dad which was above average. \n\nI guess pizza is what Bados is known for so you should just stick with that if you go.  \n\nPro: Spicy bloody marys, decent pizza, cute waiter, wide beer selection\nCon: bland salads, noodleless noodle soups, not many healthy options, no dinner entrees besides pasta,", "business_id": "qemCNgjeYGcFsRwxW9x4xw", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-08-22", "type": "review"}

Once, a friend and I stopped in for lunch with her kids and ended up waiting for the check 18 minutes after we'd asked to receive it.

Another time, my husband and I came in 15 minutes before the ordering deadline, and watched as the waitress did not approach our table until exactly the cut-off time.  She proudly announced that we could no longer order food (we just wanted pretzels, for god's sake).  Food is pretty lackluster, although it's a nice touch that they have veggie dogs.

I love their wings and their hot dogs. \nEverytime I go there i am greeted with fun young employees ready to serve or offer suggestions about their latest brews. Their draft list changes constantly so there's no sense in trying to remember which beer you had there the week before. Plus their beer cave is great with hundreds of different bottles to choose from all listed by the region from which they came. They also have a small cooler with about 150 different varieties of beer that are already chilled for your liking. Even if you get a warm beer, they have this ice cold dunk tank to put your bottle in that gets it nice and chilly for you in just a few minutes. That by far is my favorite aspect of D'z. If you choose to take beer home with you they also have a discount of $1.00 per bottle of every beer you take with you(excluding the pre-made six packs). So sometimes we get a six pack of variety beers at a lower cost than paying for them individually. On to the food:\n\nI love their wings and hot dogs and my masterful veggie burger creation. We always order the BBQ sauce because it taste so gooooood and their wings are nice and crispy and hot and smothered in plenty of sauce that you will be licking your fingers. We've tried almost all their dogs expect 2 and my favorite is the mac and cheese dog(w/ ketchup) and the chihuahua dog which is avocado, shredded cheddar cheese and jalapenos, my fiance enjoys a classic Chicago dog. The have delicious sauerkraut that i enjoy as well so i usually get a side for only 99 cents. Can't beat that price. Now when it comes to the veggie burger i love the way it taste. I do it up real nice by getting that black n blue topping which is blue cheese and cajun seasoning. I add bacon, onion, mushrooms, avocado, tomato, lettuce and their spicy mayo/double dip sauce. It is hands down the best burger i've ordered in a loooong time. \n\nIf your looking for a fun hangout spot for you and your buddies or even a tasty treat for the kids then D'z is where it's at!!! It gives you the feeling of just a fun place to be on the weekend or even the weekdays. \n\nDue to an unfortunate circumstance of eating at a different hotdog shop during restaurant week, my fiance would have proposed to me at D'z. We truly regret not waiting to go here but time was of the essence.

I got a chicken sandwich named the chihuahua--chicken, avocado, cheddar cheese, salsa and jalape\u00f1os. It was amazing! Their sandwiches automatically come with chips (which I'm never a fan of) but I was able to substitute them for French fries.

Everyone (kids, grandpa) loved them.  They were even better than I remember - fantastic fresh bread stuffed with meat and cheese, lettuce and tomato, just the right amount of oil and vinegar, salt and pepper.  Like other people say, you'd think that such a sandwich would be easy to find, but for some reason good simple  things (basic awesome bread) are hard to come by.  The cheesesteak was fantastic as well.  We felt that the cheesesteak was better than Danny's.  We have NOTHING like this in the west.

Wow, a martini bar not named the Blue Martini?  OK, I'm in!\n\nSo I strolled over and walked in.  First impression was it was a cool, cozy, and trendy joint.  Liked the exposed brick walls, lighting, etc.  Only problem is, I don't go to a restaurant or a bar to eat and drink the atmosphere!\n\nSo I grab a table in the bar.  It was about 5pm and there might have been 15 people in the whole place.  Two bartenders made eye contact with me so I figured they would be waiting on me.  I figured wrong.  I sat there for a good ten minutes and was getting ready to get up and leave when the younger tender came over and said with a \"deer in the headlights look\", do you want a drink or something????  Well hell, what was your first guess?  I refrained from quoting Foxworthy and saying \"here's your sign\"!\n\nSo OK we were off to a bumpy start.  I didn't have a martini, however there was a few options on the drink menu.  I was just here for a bite, so my review is based on that.\n\nA few minutes later the other bartender comes back with my water and gives me a menu.  I ordered some turkey wrap with a fruit salad for a side.  I say \"some\" turkey wrap because it was really that unimpressive!  \n\nIt seemed to take forever for it to arrive.  Given the fact that it wasn't busy, it did take a long time to arrive.  When it did, it looked OK.  The fruit salad looked as if it was ready for the trash, so I bypassed that.  The wrap just had zero flavor and was loaded with lettuce........way to much.  The only flavor that presented itself was blandness!  It was very disappointing.\n\nAll in all, I think this is probably a way better bar to have a drink in then a restaurant.

I had been to Olive or Twist for drinks and really enjoyed it but had never been there for a meal.  I was going to a show at the Benedum with a friend and made reservations about a week and a half before the show.  We arrived about 15 minutes early for our 6:00 reservation expecting we may not be able to be seated yet.  The problem is that even though I called and made a reservation (including the person answering the phone taking my name and phone number and repeating the date and time) we were told there was no reservation for our name.  The hostess said something along the lines of \"are you sure you called here to make a reservation and not somewhere else\"  Yes, I'm pretty sure I called the right restaurant...  She kept looking at the room of empty tables, looking at the book and then looking at us.  After a few minutes of back and forth, she told us the lounge upstairs was open and we were welcome to grab a table up there.  So we trudged upstairs.  All that was available were small high top tables.  Being a Friday night, it was packed with the happy hour crowd and was pretty noisy.  Not really the environment we were looking for but we decided to make the most of it.\nWe started with the Buffalo Chicken Dip appetizer.  It is served in a martini glass with toasted/fried pita chips.  It was tasty and we were surprised at how much dip there actually was.  \nThe problems with food began with the pacing of the meal.  We had our appetizer for under five minutes when our entrees came out.  It may not have been a big deal if we were at a real table in the restaurant downstairs, but being at the high top bar tables, we had no room for our drinks, appetizer and meal.  We found ourselves stacking stuff and pulling things off the table in order to fit everything.  It was frustrating.  Not to mention that we would either have to let our entrees get cold as we finished the appetizer or let the appetizer get cold as we ate our entrees.  \nWith as much as we enjoyed the appetizer, we were looking forward to our meals. Unfortunately, they were very disappointing.  My friend ordered the french dip sandwich with a side of mashed potatoes.  Her potatoes were ice cold and sandwich luke warm.  When she mentioned it to the server, the server said \"so would you like me to take them back or are they ok\"  When would cold mashed potatoes ever be OK?  When her potatoes were brought back warmed, she was disappointed because they were called \"garlic mashed\" but she said they were pretty bland with not much garlic at all.\nI ordered the Caribbean Jerk Chicken.  It was described as \"grilled chicken seasoned with jerk spices, pepper jack cheese, garlic mayo and pineapple chutney on a Kaiser roll\"  No mention of a tomato.  When I got the sandwich, there were three tomatoes on it.   Thankfully I just dislike tomatoes and it wasn't an allergy issue.  There was also no pineapple chutney.  When I asked about it, the server told me they use a sauce and it must have been soaked into the roll.\nOverall, very disappointed.  I wanted to love Olive or Twist because I really enjoyed the time I had visited for a drink, but the dining experience was sorely lacking, especially for a dinner that was supposed to be a nice laid back start to our girl's night out.", "business_id": "OxIeMVcop5oxBUWANi-1Rw", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-06-16", "type": "review"}

Before you judge the $27 price tag, just realize that they have the type of crab cakes that are actually made with real crab.

I finally decided tonight that I had to try it for myself.\n\nWhile the food is above average, the ambiance does leave a little to be desired. The evening started out with a bread basket, which was (oddly) comprised of three somewhat bland pieces of white bread and about 20 little squares of butter. Very strange. Even in my most gluttonous days, I find it impossible to average 6+ squares of butter per slice of bread, but maybe that's just me.\n\nMy dish, the linguini with house-made cream sauce and mushrooms, came with a soup or salad, of which I chose the broccoli and cheddar soup. As a vegetarian, I was pleased to see plenty of options on the menu for me to choose from. The broccoli and cheddar soup was rich and creamy, albeit a bit salty for my taste. The linguini however, was great. I could immediately tell the sauce was homemade - it had a certain fresh and rich flavor that pre-packaged sauce tends to lack. (Unfortunately, I'm sure the amount of calories I consumed in that dish reflected the amazingly rich flavor, but I'll just ignore that.) As pleased as I was with my own menu luck, I found my boyfriend's dish - the gnocchi with pomodoro sauce - to be a tad bit lackluster. The pomodoro sauce and the gnocchi itself were forgettable. While I loved my own dish, the lack of consistency throughout the menu makes ordering a bit difficult.\n\nOverall, this is a pretty good neighborhood Italian restaurant that is priced rather decently. If you aren't adverse to a bit of cheesy mom-and-pop restaurant decor, I recommend it.", "business_id": "-Nanlb7SYXObqQ6dZ49UOg", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-06-27", "type": "review"}

Yes, this place looks like it hasn't been updated for many decades. However, I find that kind of charming -- I imagine all of the steel workers of yore, boots dirty and hands ragged, gathering at the local watering hole after a long day's work to unwind with their neighbors and enjoy a cold pint and some good food.\n\nAnyway, I digress. I've been to the Pleasure Bar several times, and I have always left relatively satisfied. I've never encountered any service issues, and the food has always been decent. Now don't get me wrong -- the food isn't super modern, light, amazing Italian cuisine. It is, however, good \"Pittsburgh Italian\" --  and by that I mean that many of their dishes are heavier, richer, and more dense. Yes, I just made up the term \"Pittsburgh Italian\", but for a city that puts french fries on its salads, I think it fits. For example, one of their more popular and delicious appetizers is their potato balls -- as the name suggests, these are deep fried balls of mashed potatoes. Delightfully crispy on the outside, and warm, smooth and creamy on the inside. Their gnocchi is delicious, but very dense -- it's not the light, pillow-y type of gnocchi that some other Italian restaurants serve. That being said, I have no problem with starchy, dense gnocchi. I often get it tossed with mafalda sauce, which is one of their signature sauces that is a combination of marinara and alfredo. Sinful!!  So yeah, their food is the type of food that is rich and delicious, but you're definitely not going to be running a 5k after eating it (then again, running a 5k is overrated anyway ;) ) \n\nSo for what it is, I think Pleasure Bar's food is actually pretty good. However, the last three times that I've visited, I've had -- hmm, how to say this politely? -- \"intestinal issues.\"  The first time it happened, I thought maybe it was a fluke, but then I went again a few weeks later, and once again it was a gastrointestinal race to the finish home. I gave it one final try, but met the same fate.  So there is clearly something about their food that doesn't agree with me (and for the record, this doesn't ever happen anywhere else). To be fair though, it's very possible that my body is just weird, because in all cases my dining partners have not gotten ill.\n\nSo I'm kind of torn -- my brain wants to give Pleasure Bar 4 stars, maybe 4.5, because I really do like their food. But my GI tract wants to give them a 1 or a 2. So I'll split the difference and go with 3.", "business_id": "-Nanlb7SYXObqQ6dZ49UOg", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-07-21", "type": "review"}

It was very crowded due to Little Italy Days in Bloomfield. I didn't mind waiting 45 minutes for a table as it was busy, but they seemed really understaffed which was strange since it was Little Italy Days.\n\nOnce we were seated, we waited 15 minutes for our waitress Misty to greet us and take our drink orders. She complained about how busy they were and how this was the second double in a row she was working. She told us she was thinking of getting wasted that night and coming in the next day hungover... I can not stand when waitresses/waiters see that we're younger (I'm 25, my friends are in their early 30s) and assume that they can drop all professionalism and talk to us like we're their friends. I sympathize with you being slammed but I don't want to hear you complaining nor do I want to hear about you getting wasted. We should have requested another waitress at that moment.\n\nTwo other tables who were seated 10-15 minutes after us got their food about 20 minutes before us. Two other waitresses were working the room and seemed fast and competent. We were the only table with Misty, who was working both the bar area and us. She never checked on us, took forever to get our food to us (which I'm assuming was sitting back in the kitchen for quite some time) and after we finished, we sat there for 20 minutes before we finally flagged down the hostess for our check. From the time we walked in to the time we walked out was a little over 2 hours.

One of my biggest annoyances with eating at bars is getting an extraordinarily small, wobbly table. Our waitress came over pretty quickly and provided us with the draft list and specials for the night. The beer choices weren't amazing but certainly adequate for a neighborhood place. I ended up ordering the California chicken wrap with regular fries, and my boyfriend got chicken fingers with waffle fries. I absolutely loved my wrap and fully intend to order it again! It had guacamole, (an all too rare thing to find in wraps or sandwiches in Pittsburgh) bacon, general chunks of grilled chicken, and tomatoes. Those are four of my favorite foods, so I was very pleased with my choice. I eat my wraps with a knife and fork so I had no trouble with the messiness factor, but the wrap was quite large and I had leftovers for the following day.

And here's where things went south- like I mentioned before I arrived starving and we did not see our waitress for a good 10-15 minutes. When the waitress finally arrived I ordered a diet coke which came out 5-10 minutes later and tasted flat (come on people! Change the machine!) The next time the waitress appeared I quickly ordered the tuna steak salad with cilantro lime dressing which was actually pretty good- it contained won ton strips, a pretty well done piece of tuna which I asked for medium, and an assortment of what tasted to be pretty fresh vegatables. \n\nAs we wrapped up the evening and received our checks we realized that the waitress didn't give me a bill but instead took it upon herself to add my salad to someone else's tab at my table without their heads up. \n\nSadly to say even though my salad was pretty decent, I'm going to have to give them just an ok review due to the terrible service..Here's to Lot 17..I hope you redeem yourself.", "business_id": "7XXmky6YYjsvKFwho_eavg", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-08-22", "type": "review"}

But make no mistake, this place is a great bar. Lots of fun beers on tap, good cocktails, cool atmosphere. You can sit at any of a few high top tables, at the bar, or back in the back of the bar at a few booths. \n\nI've tried a few different appetizers in the few years I've been coming here. Standouts to me were the fried zucchini and the fried cheese wedges. These are somehow are leaps and bounds more delicious than any other fried goodies I've ordered at a bar. I've ordered a few different veggie options of entrees, of which they have a few tasty choices. The veggie burger is amazing, the veggie pita is nice crunchy mix of grilled veggies and asiago (mmm), and my new obsession is the Lot 17 salad, which I had never tried until recently. Wowwwwww. Huge portion, fresh berries, feta, fried leeks (!!!!), and a very fresh raspberry vinaigrette. \n\nDo yourself a favor, order anything. It's ALL good. But don't skip the fries. The regular fries are good. But I have no idea why you'd get those when you could get the cajun fries. They taste like the Andy Capp Hot Fries that you used to be able to get by the bag (I have no idea if you still can, don't really care, these are better). Spicy and crispy and a nice accent to whatever you choose. Not your thing? Then the sweet potato fries should be perfect for you. So. Freaking. Good. And the brown sugar/butter sauce they are served with is like crack. I've tried to duplicate it at home with little success. Worth the trip alone. I'm salivating right now. \n\nThe staff is always friendly and helpful, service is usually great. A few TVs line this place so it's a good place to watch a game. I'd watch anything there if it was served with a side of that sweet potato fry sauce.", "business_id": "7XXmky6YYjsvKFwho_eavg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-08-04", "type": "review"}

I WANT to go to Lot 17. First of all, it's a terrific atmosphere - one that makes you feel comfortable as soon as you walk in. A great beer selection with rotating specialities on tap always creates a welcoming feeling in my mind. But its the food that draws me back over and over and over again. The menu is predominantly sandwiches and wraps but the selection is VERY good. There are dinner entrees as well and I've ventured there a few times and was pleasantly surprised.. But the sandwich is king here. Oh yeah, I like 'em!! The jerk chicken with pineapple, provolone, and roasted red peppers is a HUGE hit. The crab cake sandwich is amazingly good - who would have thought?? The jalapeno steak wrap is so good I have a hard time straying from that. I've had about half the list and can tell you I've never regretted my choice. All very good. And they're not shy about size. You'll get full. I've tried their soups too and they're delightful and rich. Another winner. But I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the fries. Not just typical bar fries, but superb, specialty fries. Your choices are cajun, regular or sweet potato. The Cajuns are coated in a spicy dusting of Cajun seasoning. Yum. The sweet potato fries come with a brown sugar butter dipping sauce that will have you smacking your lip for hours afterwards. You'll wake up dreaming about that sauce. Addicting.

It's a pretty small space with plenty of wood surrounding the bar up front and a small booth filled dining room in the back. We've eaten here well over a dozen times and have always enjoyed our experiences here.\n\nThe sandwiches are killer!!!! I enjoy a good chicken sandwich and their Jerk Chicken Sandwich with grilled pineapple, provolone and roasted red peppers may just be my favorite chicken sandwich ever! I've also had the crab cake sandwich which is pretty darned fantastic, too. The jalape\u00f1o steak wrap is so delicious and spicy that it also ranks near the top of delightful choices. It's real steak cooked to order inside, too. The fish tacos are also a tasty option.\n\nI'm not much of a French fry eater unless I'm at Lot 17. Their sweet potato fries are served with a side of brown sugar honey butter dipping sauce that I wish I could make at home. Tried and failed many times. It's the perfect compliment and I now refuse to get sweet potato fries anywhere else because I'd just flat out miss that sauce too much! Occasionally it shows up runny or less than perfect & I get sad but its still better than my best attempt to copy it.\n\nBeer selection is good but could be more extensive. We've sampled some of the items off the appetizer menu in our early days coming here and realized they were totally unnecessary based on the amount of food you receive off the sandwich menu. We did manage to score some free chicken wings by texting Lot 17 using a sign on our booth once. Fun!\n\nOverall, love this bar.

We each ordered a beer and were promptly served. After taking a moment to glance over the menu, we decided on the pita pizza app, the special (beer battered fish/Mac and cheese) and the fish tacos. \nThe pita pizza: a soft pita shell with pesto, tomatoes, chicken and cheese. BORING. \nThis appetizer reminded me of my mother's Irish cooking: tasteless. A simple addition of caramelized onions would have solved this problem. \nEntree 1: Beer battered fish and Mac and cheese. Ruling: BLAND. My husband ordered this one and described the fish as \"wet\" and the Mac and cheese as \"play-doh\". They also served the dish with lettuce, tomato and onion, as if it were a sandwich. \nEntree 2: Fish tacos. Ruling: OVERCOOKED/COVER-UP ATTEMPTED. Ok, so they weren't bad, but the fish was dry. Covered with tomatoes and a bit of lettuce, the tacos were, again, on the tasteless side. The attempt at adding flavor came with the chipotle mayo and sour cream. \nThese only helped to moisten the fish. The corn relish was masked by jalape\u00f1o peppers and the rice came shaped as if out of a small flowerpot.\nThe service was quite friendly, so, no fault there.

Yes, it's in Shadyside, which I usually avoid at all costs, but I never have a problem making an exception for this spot.\n\nI don't think I've ever had something on the menu that I didn't fall in love with.  My husband and I are huge fans of the 'goat in a boat' (cheese and pepper dip served with yummy hot pita triangles), but there's nothing more satisfying after a few rounds of drinks than their baby burghers and horseradish mashed potatoes.\n\nSpeaking of drinks, they have one of the most extensive mixed drink lists in the city.  If you find conversation with your dinner mates a bit dull, you can just page through the 'Grill Swill' menu for a few good laughs, and even some conversation starters.  I love the 'Surly Temple,' and my husband prides himself on sampling each and every type of Manhattan they offer.  Harris Grill is home to some of the best bartenders in the city (and also one of the hottest ;).\n\nTuesday night at the Grill is Bacon Night, which means you can get unlimited (until they run out) bacon.  It's free in a basket at the bar, or $1 per basket at your table.  And if that's not enough bacon for you, they've even got bacon-tinis.  Yep, bacon, in booze form.  It's every Yinzer's dream.\n\nTheir other booze specialty is the frozen cosmo, which is like a Slushee version of the original.  It's good, but as a girl who can't even do frozen margaritas, I seem to get a brain freeze every time I try one, and usually wind up sticking to the classic version, which is always perfectly mixed.\n\nLately, I've been getting their chicken salads there, Pittsburgh style, with crispy fries on top.  There is something about their ranch dressing there that is just amazing.  See previous comment, re: everything here tastes like heaven.\n\nIn nice weather, you can sit on their patio and put in some serious people-watching.  It gets crowded on the weekends, but all the more opportunity!  There are a lot of stairs at this place, and let me just say: drunk people trying not to fall down stairs... well, they're funny.  :) \n\nAnd the best part about Harris Grill?  You can hang out there without any of the Shadyside rubbing off on you.  So go forth, and bacon away :)", "business_id": "rgmptwPbBH1wLpiBHcbIhA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-06-21", "type": "review"}

Massive improvement over the old ones!\n\nI've never ordered the entree mac and cheese, but it makes for a tasty side. My sister had the Henny Penny sandwich. Just know....it's spicy as all hell. We thought my sister was going to explode. She couldn't finish it. So, if that's your thing, go for it but be prepared. The Pulled Pork sandwich was also a hit with my family.\n\nAs for desserts....they have root beer floats. And that's enough for me. Do they take any skill? No none at all. Is it still wonderful to see one pop up on a menu? Oh yes.\n\nService has always been very efficient and polite, no complaints or rude servers. Atmosphere is nice but a little too dark and loud for my tastes.

I visit Ellsworth ave plenty and I have been to Harris grill on numerous occasions. After working all day, and driving 2 hours to get home I was a little grumpy and wanting a good drink.\n\nMy two friends and I decided on the sangria. I've had it on numerous occasions and it can really hit the spot. The waiter suggested the caraf but HB warned us saying that they stuff it full of ice. The waiter insured us we would get around a glass and a half. We bypassed HB and ordered the caraf. Upon arrival we knew it was no bueno! The caraf was heaping full of fruit on the top followed by way too much ice. Our serving glasses also were heaped with the stuff even though we had asked for lite ice. I asked the waiter to pour for us bc I knew sangria was going everywhere. We ended up with our glasses 3/4 full and a watered down juice cocktail. We all told the waiter that it was pretty awful but he did nothing to correct the insult. Never ever order the caraf!!\n\nTo eat I had the pulled pork sandwhich and a side of mac n cheese. The flavor of the pulled pork was good and the pasta was delish. I will say the pork had some fatty bites that I didn't care for.

If you go, see if you can sit in Justin's section.  \n\nThe Harris is one of the few bars in Pittsburgh open late night if you're looking for food.  While most area kitchens close at 11, the Harris is open and serving until 1 am--full menu!\n\nTuesday is Bacon Night and if you go for happy hour get there early, or be prepared to wait.  Bacon and beer are fantastic together until you have that moment where you realized, \"I've just had 15 pieces of bacon.\"  Order another beer, you'll feel better about yourself.\n\nPeople rave about the frozen cosmos and they're ok but not really my thing.  Try the drink with the muddled cucumbers--it is fantastic.  \n\nThey also have a good Sunday brunch.  In the summer months its a buffet which I dont like as much as the regular, menu style brunch they have in colder months.  Bloody Mary's are half off after 2pm, so I often like to work out in the morning and then spend the afternoon having a \"Sunday Funday.\"\n\nThe food at the Harris is generally good, but they change their menu a lot and while that can be a good thing I've found it frustrating as several of my favorite menu items ie Shawshank Redemption and the Crawful of Falaffel are no longer offered.  The food is somewhat consistent, although sometimes it is over seasoned.  I ordered the meatloaf once and it had so much rosemary in it I found it almost inedible--although my boyfriend tried it and loved it.  The DelMonico A Go Go is so fatty I don't recommend it.  It's a good sandwich, but it owuld be better if they made it with different/better meat.  Several times I've gone to order a menu item and they're out of it.  The staff is usually pretty good about letting you know what's off the menu ahead of time but sometimes you want to ask.\n\nWhat the Harris does well they do fantastic.  The Lasagna, the burgers, the greek salad, the gazpacho, the fish tacos, the steak, the hummus-- all excellent.  Try the gazpacho, it's excellent!\n\nThe staff is fantastic.  I think the Harris has the best bartenders in town.  If you get to know them, they'll take fantastic care of you.  Even if htey don't know you, you can expect to get your drinks quickly, and your cocktails mixed correctly.\n\nThis place can get expensive.  If you're drinking craft beers be careful bc your bill can creep up on you quickly.  It is, in my opinion, priced right for what you are getting.\n\nThis is my favorite bar in Pittsburgh and I hope you check it out if you havne't yet.

However, my last visit left an impression and I couldn't forget to share thoughts with all of you! \n\nWe started with an appetizer of hummus, pita bread and vegetables. I was actually introduced to hummus at Harris about a year ago and judge other hummus selections in comparison to Harris'. It's sooooo good. It's thick, a tad bit spicy and perfect to munch on before and during your meal. \n\nDuring my last visit I ordered the Henny Penny and I was definitely satisfied. From the description, I knew it would have a \"zing,\" but I didn't expect to be a fire breathing dragon (it's all good, though! I like spicy stuff!). They used a certain breading that almost reminded me of a wing-dust seasoning to bread the chicken in and topped it off with vegetables and a delicious homemade mayo that added to the zesty-ness of it all. Of course what sandwich isn't perfected without fries! Yum!\n\nMy only complaint is the crowd. Maybe because it was a Friday night? Maybe because it was during the Pride Pub Crawl? I don't know... I just don't do well with screaming and obnoxious people as I'm trying to eat my sandwich and have a conversation with my friend. We were even upstairs and away from the bar.

I really go here just for the atmosphere at night. When I'm feeling lively, I'll choose to sit inside and let the thumping of the music and cacophony of voices take over as I indulge in my meal. However, during those off days where I just want a place for (somewhat) quiet contemplation, I'll decide on the outside patio. If the weather doesn't permit and I still want that solace, they also have a lounge with a fireplace directly above the bar. It really does have a place for any sort of mood.\n\nThe food is decent. Their menus do change quite frequently though, so it's best not to get *too* attached to a certain dish. One aspect that I love is how they name and describe their food. There's so much thought and effort put into each item as they come up with the most interesting of names and elaborate stories to introduce them to their guests.\n\nTheir drinks are very good. They have a small little book dedicated to the cocktails and other alcoholic beverages they offer. It's always an adventure, choosing a drink as they offer a wide range of quirky mixes and cocktails. My personal favorite would be the Happy Ending, which is a cucumber-mint based cocktail that entails the magic of vodka and a few other liquors. It's perfect for refreshing the palate between dishes. \n\nSadly, Harris Grill is a bit on the pricey side and the service is a tad inconsistent. But their unique menus and overall atmosphere is what keeps me coming back. \n\nPS.

They are quite large so get ready to take a to-go box home or share some of yours with a friend.  The sandwiches are great in my opinion.  I've never tried one that I didn't enjoy.  My sister is a vegetarian, so if this is your case don't worry, there are lots of options for those who don't enjoy a big burger or chicken sandwich.  \n\nPrices:\nThe prices are fairly cheap for being in Squirrell Hill.  I would advise anyone to eat there because I don't think the prices are out of the park at all.  Very affordable and the portions are quite large so it is well worth your dollars spent. :)", "business_id": "DkX3YoxhH4uADsgVgQThew", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-06-15", "type": "review"}

It is just your average bar (another reviewer described it as \"the bar back home,\" and yes, exactly, it is,) and I love it for that.  \n\nCappy's is nice and unpretentious, which is something that sets it apart from a lot of the rest of Walnut Street.  Not far down the street, you can get a tiny morsel of ice cream for a stroke-inducing four dollars, but at Cappy's, you can spend a reasonable price on a reasonable meal.  \n\nSo far, food-wise, I've tried the Alamo sandwich (I think that's what it's called,) and the bacon-and-bleu-cheese burger (Big Bleu?)  Both of them were definitely satisfying, and the Alamo, with its fried chicken strips and barbecue sauce, was at the very least pretty good, even if it took a few years off the end of my life.\n\nGetting outdoor seating is key, though.  They air-condition the bejeezus out of the inside area, and one time we accidentally showed up on karaoke night, which made us REALLY glad we found a table outside.  Karaoke night is great when you're expecting it, but when you're not, there are few fates worse.\n\nService is usually kind of slow as well, but the wait staff is nice.  One waitress we had was a little thick, though, when it came to splitting our checks.  Nobody paid what they actually owed that night, but we didn't want to fight it out with her.\n\nAll in all, Cappy's is a nice, unpretentious little place to grab some food.  I'll definitely go back.", "business_id": "DkX3YoxhH4uADsgVgQThew", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-06-29", "type": "review"}

Cheese fries, burgers, some salads, mediocre pasta, etc.  Although some of their dishes in the past have been much better than I anticipated, the food isn't something I leave the place remembering.  \n\nThere is smoking allowed on the patio upstairs so if you don't mind smoke then no worries.  However, if you don't like to breathe in smoke while you're eating, pray that there is no one smoking in your section when you go.  There are space heaters upstairs in the winter for when it starts to get cold before the snow comes.

I suddenly felt ill (didn't know at the time, but it was a sudden attack of vertigo), alas, I digress. I felt as if I were going to pass out. Sent one of my companions to get me some water. The waitress came over and said \"Oh, I would have gotten that for you\" in a very snotty tone, as if we breached some etiquette by NOT asking her for it when she was clearly not attentive. We ordered cheese sticks in case it was low blood sugar, but it was not. They were frozen and certainly not worth the price.

It isn't located on the Riviera, or anywhere near Shadyside or any other trendy nose-in-the-air (which is STILL laughable in Pittsburgh) acceptable neighborhood. It's in Blawnox, and it's called Bob's GARAGE...\n\nBob's isn't the penthouse lounge at the Carlton...it's a neighborhood bar. And as a neighborhood bar goes...with the karaoke...it was actually a very pleasant little joint to hang out in for an evening with friends and sing our guts out.\n\nYES...they still allow smoking...YES, people drink well drinks there...and yes, the food has gluten in it and probably comes out of a freezer bag.\n\nGordon Ramsey didn't rescue the joint, and the decorating most likely involves sales at Party City and a hot glue gun.\n\nBob's Garage does not pretend to be anything that it isn't. Wanna pretend? Go hang at a Big Burrito joint, or dial up Kevin Sousa. Bob's is a funky and cool little joint to hang out in with a group of pretty decent people, all ages, who are out for an evening of a few drinks (I saw no drunks) being served by a bartender who was very friendly and helpful, in a location that does kind of look like Pool City exploded during Christmas time and landed in the middle of Party City during high season. It's comfortable, laid back, and the karaoke guy on Thursdays, John, was very kind and friendly, and did his karaoke like a pro. He also had a very nice singing voice himself. He didn't rip apart his karaoke singers like another 'Oke' leader in the burgh, who mostly caters to the gay bars.\n\nThe other revelers that night were in a range from very good to ouch, but the atmosphere is such that if you can't carry a tune in a bucket...sooooooo what. People clap, and allow you to have a good time.\n\nI can't say I'd ever look at this place from the outside and say 'HEY - let's try it for lunch!' Or dinner for that matter. \n\nBut for a fun evening just hanging with friends in an unpretentious atmosphere, and jumping up to sing...bring it on. The drinks aren't terribly overpriced, and no one is looking down on your for what you're wearing, or how badly you sound on a microphone. The more, the merrier.\n\nMy only suggestion would be for the karaoke guys to bring back the 'books'. I know that everyone is staring into their palms on their smart phones these days, but really...not EVERYONE. And we had a very hard time scanning a songbook online when the signals were weak and the batteries were draining on the cell phones.\n\nAnd to be honest - for the smoke whiners - maybe they've upped the ventilation since the last reviews were written, but even though I smoke, I generally hate smoking indoors. And I didn't walk out with the usual smoking bar sensation of having a nicotine trail follow me home.\n\nBottom line, if you're regular ol' folk, and would like a comfy location to have some fun with other regular ol' folk...park it in the Garage. Bob's Garage.\n\nADDENDUM: Went back for a second dose on a Friday night, and had just as great a time. The difference was that we tried the food. I had a Reuben and my friends had a fish sandwich and the other a steak. Reasonable prices, not uppity gourmet, and not horrible. Just plain ol' decent bar food.", "business_id": "9VtaTbTKVK9sQVy4j2RO-w", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-07-04", "type": "review"}

She said she would put the order in and bring our drinks right back. She left for a few more minutes, came back and checked in with another table without our drinks. She then went to get our drinks. She checked in with us multiple times throughout our meal just in passing, and not acknowledging when we needed more drinks and forcing us to either put empty glasses to the end of the table or request them. About halfway through eating, she brought us the check, never inquiring if we would want dessert. When she came back 5-10 minutes later, we had long since finished eating and asked for 2 boxes. She brought the boxes and my 6 year old had decided to take her leftovers home as well, so we asked for a third, only for her to promptly roll her eyes at the table and walk away without acknowledging our request verbally. When she came back, a member of my party outstretched her hand to take the box and begin packaging the leftovers, when Chrystal looked right at her and put the box on the end of the table, just out of her reach. After the check was paid and we stood up to leave, I witnessed Chrystal do a celebratory dance that we were leaving. Very visible and inappropriate.

Despite being far from authentic, I typically enjoy their food about once or twice a year.  This time we had a gift card, so that was incentive enough to go.  They currently have a 2 for $25 which is okay, but the portions are a lot smaller than their regular entrees.  Yes, you get unlimited salad and breadsticks, but it's just iceberg salad.  The deal also comes with either a small app or a dessert to share.  It was enough for the price, but they should mention the portions are reduced.  Contrary to LR's review, I have ALWAYS taken leftovers home from OG.  I easily ate the whole entree after eating salad and breadsticks.  Unless they just reduced their portion size since the last time I went, these were definitely skimpy and did not come with that much chicken either.  The smoked chicken was decent.\n\nOur friend got the unlimited soup, salad and breadsticks for dinner (yes they offer it for dinner for $3 more) but our less than friendly waitress snagged 2 of her breadsticks off of the table before she was finished. Why would you snag breadsticks from right in front of someone in the first place, let alone someone who has them as part of their meal. The spicy sausage soup she first ordered was mostly broth.  \n\nAll in all, it's not that good and there are better places you could go and not have to wait 45 minutes for a table.  Try a real, local Italian place, like Libretto's up the road or Portofino's on Park Rd.

It is tucked away in a residential area and if the food didn't smell so good you might walk right by it. We sat at the bar and needed to pull the candle closer in order to read the menu.

They had a great selection of micro-brewed beers in addition to the usual suspects, so my fiancee was happy from the moment we sat down.

The star oddly enough was the salad, she said all their dressings were homemade and it certainly tasted that way.  The \"What it is\" was just ok in my opinion. I have had my share of amazing pasta dishes but never have been much of a rotini fan. The dish has a lot of dried herbs and I just prefer fresh...the chicken seemed almost too rubbed in cajun spice for my taste. That being said, I would like to give it another shot and order something else besides pasta ..I really am a tough critic in the Italian department. \n\nMy biggest gripe of the night was the pace of service. I don't know if the server (or chef) had somewhere to be but she was going a mile a minute. I wanted to relax and enjoy my meal not be rushed in and out in less than 45minutes. My dinner came as half of my salad remained uneaten...and the salad was literally brought out in less than a minute after I ordered it.

It also is DNC week and parking is off limits except for a few places along the street. Luckily we found one after circling 4 times. We walked in and it was awkward. One of those moments that you see in movies where a bar is noisy everyone stops and stares then goes about their business. Normally this isn't an issue but when the waitress and bartender does this its....awkward. We found a booth and sat and waited to be greeted. We waited, looked around and waited some more. Began looking around saw a bartender and that was it. No waitress no one else walking around. Wasn't sure if we should have sat at the bar to be noticed, or like in elementary school raise our hands to have permission to speak. It would have probably made a difference to recieve a smile or simple hello from the person behind the bar, then we probably wouldn't have felt forgotten. After 14 minutes we finally met our waitress who asked us if we needed more time to review the menu. Really? We counted 3 parties, thats it...in a otherwise bare restaurant. Food was good, received it pretty quickly. Our drinks were refilled often without being asked. First impressions really do matter. It wouldn't have mattered from that point if service was perfect. Don't ignore someone intentionally when they obviously know you can see them. From reading other reviews it seems that we aren't the only ones who experienced the same issues. Really felt like we were being intentionally ignored. We did something we  have never done. Intentionally left without leaving a tip.

I told him I didn't want this, and wanted something else. He obliged, took my plate of sliced mushrooms, and went to place my new order. I called the manager over, to let them know the situation. When I explained my side of the story, he rebutted with something \"Well the server told you we were out of portabello mushroom patties, and said you agreed to sliced mushrooms\". WHAT?! I told him, no, that was incorrect, and that I was unware of them being out of portabello patties until I was brought a plate of sliced mushrooms on a bun; my wife agreed. The manager stood by his server. I firmly told him again, that I did not know/agree to having a sliced mushroom sandwich, and that the server conveyed no such message of running out of portabellow patties. I asked him how he could rectify the situation - free meal or something? No he would not, because I was aware of the situation (but I wasn't!), although he did comp me the original portabello mushroom burger...gee thanks.\n\nNow I'm not the type of guy who tries to find fault at every little thing to get a free meal.

I probably would have given it 4 or 5 stars on the food alone. I ordered the grilled bruschetta chicken. Juicy and flavorful - excellent with the tomato and mozzarella. My friends' dinners looked really good as well- I had a bite of the bacon, chicken mac and cheese and the country fried chicken. Excellent food all around. \n\nThe problem with this place was our waitress in particular. Korin. She started off really sweet and cool.... And then went B*TCH on our table of 6. A bunch of rude comments and all and all unpleasant experience. My friend had ordered the house root beer before and when she took a sip this time, the root beer was flat and watered down. When the waitress was told, she immediately got defensive and said \"it's our house root beer\" so excuse me, it is supposed to be watered down and flat? My friend then said she had the root beer before and it tasted different. The waitress decided to blame the soda machine and check and get her another. \n\nHer second mistake was when she came over to take our orders and said she would start with ladies first, the first lady she was talking about was chatting and the waitress said, \"um, can someone tap her...\"\n\nThe last and final mistake was that she mixed up all of checks or credit cards, I don't know what happened because when our cards were returned to us, we all had been charged the wrong bills! She didn't seem to know what to do, except suggest to run the cards again. But BLAMED US for the mix up and that we put our cards in the wrong bill. No! Rude rude rude!!!!\n\nOn our way out, I guess she had told the manager to cover her own behind. \n\nI would go back for the food and that's about all I was happy with.", "business_id": "ym9QwkmB5ZKTyj7q5huTDw", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-06-28", "type": "review"}

Ever.  Definitely more a bar - though the business name here is \"tavern\", they have a sign that says \"deli\".  I'm not sure I'd call them a deli.  Not by a long shot.  They have food, and they even have subs, but a deli?  I don't think so.  You go to a deli, and you expect a fat greasy guy named Tony to slice some meat and slap it on a roll.  Not some coed to take all your money.\n\nNonetheless, we were there hanging out - with the kids, actually - after I gave blood prior to the Zombie Walk.  Decided to get a bite since we picked up a discount due to the blood drive.  There is a tiny little area for dining if you don't want the total bar vibe.  And when I say tiny, I mean tiny.  I think it was one table.\n\nThe rest of the place is really a bar.  Or tavern if you want to feel more upscale.\n\nService wasn't too hot.  Or maybe it was hot if you're into that scene.  But it wasn't very good.  They were nice enough and all, but they were definitely not into serving a family of four food - they were wanting to get back to the bar (tavern, sorry) side and generate some better tips.\n\nDespite a proclamation on the menu that they had been rated \"uptown's best burgers\", I wasn't all that impressed.  Maybe I'm burgered out.  It wasn't bad, but like many places they let it cook too long.  Some of the rest of the family enjoyed it, but ultimately we decided that they liked the grease, not the juice (and there is a difference!).  The meat itself was dry - anyone can get greasy burgers.  It's more of a challenge to make it tasty and juicy.\n\nSweet Tea Report: Blech.  Possibly the worst in town.  I have had unsweetened tea at places that was sweeter than this stuff.

This did include two bottles of mid-priced wine, though.  I had the 10 oz. Filet Mignon and it was very good.

The hubs out did himself this time :-) \n\nLet me begin by thanking our server Alissa, who was cordial, attentive, and upbeat the entire night. It was our first time at Capital Grille and I was so impressed with the ambiance of the restuarant. It looked like there were enough \"suits\" in the place to write a check to clear the federal deficit, but I liked that. The decor had an old world feel blended with a wall street vigor. The hostess was gracious and we were seated immediately and noticed the restaurant was quite busy for a Wednesday night. \n\nAlissa explained the chef features for the night and we agreed to try it. We received complimentary champagne and I ordered the smoked salmon as an appetizer. It was a good portion and was served with aioli, capers, chopped onions, and crisp pita triangles. I enjoyed it immensely as smoked salmon is one of my favorites. The hubs ordered a salad, and we ordered the lobster mac-n-cheese and truffle fries for our son, the Gabe-meister (I kept theifing the lobster out of the mac-n-cheese it was soooo good) and the truffle fries were amazing, it had this parmasen flavor to it. I do not eat red meat regularly but wanted to try the feature 4 oz filet medallion at medium with a fennel based sauce. The hubs opted for the 12 oz. filet mignon at medium rare with crab (out of the shell) in butter sauce. Needless to say we enjoyed the meal and left completely satisfied and impressed with Capital Grille. The food was great but it was the service that really impressed, two managers came by and wished me a happy birthday and checked on us to see if everything was ok. VERY NICE TOUCH! :-)\n\nFor dessert, we brought our favorite cheesecake creme  iced cake from Harris Teeter, and yes the restaurant was fine with it. We shared cake with Alissa and she enjoyed it as well.\n\nAll-in-all, the Capital Grille has managed to produce quality, flavourful food and white glove service as a chain restaurant.

The salmon was a very generous portion that was very well done. I'm very picky when it comes to salmon and I found this to be fresh and delicious. The salmon also came resting on a generous bed of asparagus, onions, etc. which was an unexpected surprise as we'd been told that all sides were a la carte. I definitely could have skipped the spinach salad, just because I already had so much food and we were staying in a hotel without a mini fridge. But the salad itself was delicious- more of a dinner portion than a side, actually.\n\nMy husband ordered the steak and lobster. At $49 it was one of the more expensive entrees on the menu, yet is was a LOT smaller than my salmon (which was $33). He was disappointed at the size for that price, actually.

Your dining room is very nice and your staff so very polite and accommodating as saints.\n\nI'll echo what Adam R. said and say that steakhouses are not usually my dining preference when choosing a place to eat at but I had really enjoyed the good eats at the Capital Grille Generous Pour event recently I decided to give it a shot. Warmly greeted at the door and reservations confirmed even though we had arrived a bit earlier than expected, their hospitality is as good as ever. The problem is I didn't exactly enjoy my meal as much as I would have hoped even though I still had a good time surrounded by friends and family.\n\nAppetizers came out in a very timely manner once menu choices were made. I chose clam chowder based on a recommendation. Well it wasn't amazing but it wasn't bad either, a well made clam chowder is one of my favorite things to eat so this was a bit of a let down. My entree a Kona crusted dry aged sirloin was perfectly cooked and served with a nice composite shallot butter how old school! The only problem is that they didn't cook all the steaks as well as mine. One person had ordered a medium steak and it came out well done and extremely charred (It was comped when she mentioned it and the waiter and manager were very sorry and concerned about this so I'll have to thumbs up them for handling a situation so graciously). The shallot butter though didn't really add anything to the dish for me and the steak wasn't so flavorful that it could stand on it's own. The best part of the meal? Dessert! But not my dessert, I was talked up on the ice cream and decided to order it instead of creme brulee. Well that was a major mistake on my part. My whole meal had been heavy and if I had went with sorbet I might have been able to finish it, but I decided on ice cream. Peanut butter, chocolate, and vanilla ice cream was just too much to handle for me and I called it quits after a spoonful of each. The creme brulee was still as addictive as ever from what I tried on someone's plate though!\n\nI would go back here just for the service alone. It's really nice to be treated like they really care about your visit.

Now that I am in Charlotte, I was able to try out another Capital Grille location and enjoyed a lovely lunch with my mom in uptown Charlotte. This outpost of The Capital Grille was bustling before noon on a Monday. Many business meetings and lunches are held here and the obviously enthusiastic staff kept things running smoothly and truly went above and beyond even with a close to full a house. At lunch parking is validated for the lot behind the Dunhill Hotel, making it a reasonable $2.\n\nThe Plates menu features choice of a soup or salad, an entree and a side dish for a set price of $18 at the Charlotte location. For the summer menu, a new entree of seared scallops with sweet and sour tomatoes is available. I love how the scallops are served with a grilled lemon wedge for a citrus taste that goes perfectly with the beautifully presented and cooked shellfish - delicious. The other new additions to the menu include a carrot ginger soup (hot) which I also really liked (the tasty classic New England clam chowder is still available as well) and a tomato and watermelon salad with feta cheese - a refreshing option for a side dish. The Wagyu beef burger with fried egg and crispy onions is back on the menu following multiple requests after it was featured last summer and then removed. My mom ordered this and LOVED it - and she is not usually a fan of burgers at all. The truffle fries go great with the burger, which is really a treat.", "business_id": "CChwRoYVXA3QZulS8a6xOQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-07-30", "type": "review"}

Reposting here...\n\nEvery once in a while, you have an experience at a restaurant that's so lovely, you know you'll remember it for years. The meal we ate at the Capital Grille this week doubtlessly falls into this category.\n\nI know that Capital Grille is a chain, and an expensive chain as well. I'm not usually super excited about corporate steakhouses (Ruth's Chris: meh), and I usually wouldn't have chosen one for a Restaurant Week outing. However, Capital Grille treated us so well during the Yelp Generous Pour event, we decided to return. I'm glad we did: the food and the service were both amazing.\n\nI'll talk about the food first. Their Restaurant Week menu is not very varied: they offer three steak entrees and one salmon dish. However, I don't see that as a downside, since if you're looking for something lighter and/or vegetarian, you're not going to go to a steakhouse, anyways. For my entree, I ordered the Kona-encrusted sirloin with shallot butter.. oh my. This was a good steak, folks: tremendous flavor and perfectly cooked. I've learned that this steak is on their regular menu as well. This could be bad for my credit card. The appetizer of clam chowder was good, if not exceptional. My dessert of creme brulee was delicious. Nevertheless, it was all overshadowed by that steak.\n\nOk, now let's talk about the service. Yes, my steak was amazing, but you can get an amazing steak at other venues. What really set this night apart was the level of service we received. Even though it was Restaurant week, and even though we had nibbled and sipped for free the weekend before, we were treated as well as they could have treated any bank executive or local politician. Our waiter, James, was unobtrusively attentive and poured us multiple glasses of wine on the house. The manager checked in on us and shook our hands on the way out. I've never been treated better in a restaurant, especially when eating a meal at such a considerable discount.\n\nIn case you can't tell from the above, we really had a fantastic evening. I suspect that we'll be back the next time we have an excuse to splurge.", "business_id": "CChwRoYVXA3QZulS8a6xOQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-08-01", "type": "review"}

It's rare I feel like I've been \"wowed\" when I go out, but The Captial Grille had that effect and they did so in a way that seemed effortless and second-nature.\n\nWe were lured in after the recent Elite event (and actually made our dinner reservations within an hour of the event). The ambiance is exquisite without being extravagant, with many formal-looking portraits, iron, and a wealth of masculine darkly-stained wood.\n\nThe kitchen was spot-on during our visit - not a single thing came to the table that wasn't outstanding. We both started with the bacon clam chowder - smokey and rich. My entree was the filet Mignon, a timeless classic (and a personal favorite). I ordered mine medium rare: my first experience in Charlotte where my steak was brought to me a true medium rare. It's a tender cut that the chefs worked wonders with. A had the dry-aged Kona crusted sirloin - his was equally amazing with explosive flavors. Dessert brought chocolate espresso flour-less cake. Exceptionally rich and decadent - the perfect end to the meal.\n\nAs an experienced oenophile, I am in heaven at The Capital Grille. The wine selection has no comparison in the area - many, many phenomenal producers represented from around the globe, a survey of the best-of-the-best in wine. We mentioned we had attended for the summer Generous Pour event earlier and paid for it again tonight. This time, though, the server turned it into a guessing game: we'd order one, he'd bring two, seeing if we could identify the mystery wine from the list he recommended with our food. \n\nSpeaking of the service, TCG is in a league of their own in the area. The staff, who had or reservation, greeted us by name at the door and at our table. The manager recognized us from the week before and made it a point to stop by and welcome us and to wish us well at the end of the evening. Down to the very smallest detail of folding your napkin if you need to leave the table during your meal, this team embodies every stellar trait of the service industry.\n\nWhile The Captial Grille is not in the budget for a regular meal (yet), they are now my first choice for a venue to celebrate and to show off everything Charlotte has to offer.", "business_id": "CChwRoYVXA3QZulS8a6xOQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-08-08", "type": "review"}

I thought is would be a very nice meal and someplace I had not taken them before.  Eating in the best restaurants in town and when we travel is not unusual.  The food was very hit-and-miss and so was the service.  \n\nLet's start with the food.  We ordered two appetizers for the table that were not part of restaurant week.  The Calamari and the Mozzarella wrapped cheese.  The calamari was excellent and cooked perfectly.  The Mozzarella was good but not the tastiest or smoothest mozzarella I have eaten.  Both were worthy.  For the first course, my oldest son had the clam chowder which he enjoyed.  The rest of us ordered the mixed field greens salad which was awful.  I have had a better side salad at Wendy's.  It was totally tasteless and un-inspired.  None of us even finished half the portion.  When the waiters helper asked if we were done, we told him to please take them away and how horrible they were.  The three men had the filet for our main course.  It was a very middle of the road filet.  I am not sure if they lowered their quality for restaurant week but it tasted no better than an Outback Steak.  Even my 15 year old recognized the poor quality of meat.  My wife had the Salmon which was better than the filet but nothing exciting.  She only ate half the portion and it was not worth packing up to take home.  The mashed potato side was amazing and the creamed spinach side was average.  The creme brulee and flourless chocolate cake for desert were both amazing.  I would recommend just hitting the bar for these late night after a show.  \n\nThe service was also only marginal.  A big let down compared to the service received at lunch.  The waiter reached across the table versus walking around, and he plated the food close but not just right so you had to re-arrange the positioning of every dish before eating it.  The atmosphere is beautiful.  I would return for a business lunch but don't waste your time or money on dinner or taking someone you want to impress.", "business_id": "CChwRoYVXA3QZulS8a6xOQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-07-29", "type": "review"}

Bone-In Kona Crusted Dry Aged Sirloin - with shallot butter, which was far more steak then I'd normally ever have in one sitting but wow! It was so good I couldn't even leave a bite left on my plate. Cooked to perfection the meat with sharper taste of the shallot butter just melted in my mouth. It cames with the Sam's Mashed Potatoes & Fresh Creamed Spinach.  The potatoes were really tasty but the spinach I could've done without. This is easily enough food for two!\n\nOrdered a Stoli Doli to go with my meal. It's the signature drink at Capital Grille and definitely worth having more than once. \n\nAnd the Flourless Chocolate Espresso Cake! Oh the cake...

The waiter was a little overly friendly and was a bit uncomfortable toward the end of the meal.\nThe setting, environment, and welcoming staff were the highlights.  For the price I felt the food could have been better.  For starters we ordered mozzarella and tomato salad and the Caesar.  The salads were both chilled, crisp, and the vinegar and spice balance for the mozzarella was very good.\nFor the entrees we got the salmon and the special bleu cheese encrusted fillet with grilled shrimp.  The salmon was cooked perfectly, but lacking on seasoning.  Where they were short on flavor on the salmon they made up for on the shrimp.  They definitely weren't shy with the seasoning which left something to be desired for the surf of the turf.  The steak was cooked to perfection and was extremely tender.  The waiter had sold the bleu cheese as a cream base infused with pepper and garlic.  Unfortunately it was just a few morsels of blue cheese pressed into the top of the meat.  Still, a VERY good cut of steak.\nThe meal and a bottle of wine ran me $150 which for the service and ambience I believe is fair.

We asked the other gentleman that was supposed to be assisting with our table as well and he brought it about 15 minutes later.  \n\nOur glasses of water were empty the majority of our time there.\nWe both ordered Filet Mignon which was very tasty.  It was warm, not hot when it came out but still very tender and nicely flavored.  We both ordered it medium rare and it was cooked perfectly.  Two sides came with our meal and I think they were supposed to be family style but they were really what you would see if they were served on an individual plate.  The mashed potatoes were sticky/gummy and lukewarm.  They were served in the smallest family style portion I have ever seen.  Unless it was a small family of ants, I would say we got screwed on the potatoes.  The string beans were cold and hard (undercooked) and inedible.  Didn't touch them.\n\nThe desserts were decent.  The flourless chocolate cake was so rich it was unbearable.  It was the dark bitter chocolate flavor that just wasn't very good.  The small bite of cheesecake was good though.  Just....small.\n\nOverall, I would say this experience was subpar, especially for the reputation of the restaurant.  Why does service and quality AND quantity have to suffer because it is restaurant week?  They did all seem overly busy so I understand that everything isn't going to be perfect but we didn't even see our waiter the rest of the evening until he flung our check at us.  I guess I would say it was just overall disappointing.  The steak saved the day.  That was some darn good steak.\n\nNot in a hurry to come back....other competitors have won my heart.", "business_id": "CChwRoYVXA3QZulS8a6xOQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-07-31", "type": "review"}

We chose to go out to eat here as we had only heard great things about Capital Grille. We will never return to this establishment for a meal again. \n\nOur waiter was very nice and the decor of the restaurant is beautiful as well. For starters I got the mozzarella basil tomato salad. It was pretty good so no complaints there. I chose the special of the night for my entree which was three small steaks prepared in three signature ways. I loved two of them the balsamic one was pretty bad but not inedible. Our water glasses were left empty several times which I thought was weird considering how much a meal like this costs. My husband ordered the porterhouse and he asked for it to be medium. Well it was bordering on the side of well-done and I tasted his and didn't like it at all. He thought it was very dry and it wasn't hot it seemed as though it had been sitting around before they brought it out to us. Honestly the steaks he grills from Teeter have more flavor than this dish. This was obviously very disappointing but we just thought ok not worth the money but we would possibly return for the specialty dishes at a future date. \n\nThe main reason I am giving a one star review is because I woke up in the middle of the night with awful stomach pains and have been sick for the past 10 hours. My husband was nauseas but not as sick as me.  We didn't sleep practically at all last night and because of this i would never ever return here. I would recommend grilling steaks on your own grill and not wasting a ton of money to get an underwhelming sickening experience.", "business_id": "CChwRoYVXA3QZulS8a6xOQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-08-03", "type": "review"}

All the wines are on a tablet, which was really neat cause you could easily scroll through the bottles and filter. We ended up settling on a Zin/Shiraz blend. It was absolutely delish....I wish I got the name of it!\n\nSince we were dining for restaurant week ($35 per person), the menu was limited. However, I would love to return cause I heard their lobster mac was fantastic! I decided on the clam chowder, 8oz filet mignon, and chocolate flourless espresso cake. My husband picked the wedge salad, ribeye (i think it was crazy big like 14 oz) and chocolate flourless cake. \n\nUnfortunately, the clam chowder wasn't anything special. I have a huge love for chowders and this one simply didnt do anythign for me. I took a bite of my husbands salad and it was very good. Our steaks came out next. They were cooked absolutely perfectly! The filet mignon literally melted in my mouth. My husbands steak was seasoned so well. This is definitely where Capital Grille shined! The shared potatoes that came with it were perfect. Additionally, the meal came with shared green beans. I thought the green beans weren't cooked enough, but that is just a personal preference. The taste was excellent though. Lastly, the desserts. Oh my gosh, rasberries, cream, and the fudge like cake. Perfection. That dessert was spot on!\n\nThere was one small incident that I wasn't super thrilled with how it was handled. The waiter brought over our steaks and sides. In the few seconds it took me to grab my fork and knife and almost cut into my steak, my husband (and at the same time, the waiter) realized he brought over the wrong steaks. Like, our entire order was for a different table. Literally, not a big deal at all. Misstakes happen. However, without even an apology he grabbed all the plates, including the veggie sides (that come with all restaurant week meals!) and cleared our table. It was just awkward cause he made something that wasnt a big deal into a scene. Our neighbors sitting beside us literally leaned over and said they couldnt believe he did that and took the sides off the table too. Additionally, I would never complain about this, but the new steak I got was definitely not as nice looking or as large of a cut (not that it completely mattered cause I didnt even eat all my steak anyways) as the one that was accidentally served to me.

Corn hole is set up out on the patio which can help pick up your a portion of your tab if your competitive and into gambling.

Me and a few friends decided to go last night. I usually have a good time when I go to Buckhead. If you don't wanna pay a cover, get there before 10pm. I believe it's only $5 after 10pm. They had Coronas for $2.50, so that was definitely refreshing. The employees/bouncers/bartenders (male) were all meatheads though...not trying to hate or anything. They must have some rule when hiring that says \"you must be a workout buff to work here,\" haha. Anyways though, this was definitely COUGAR CENTRAL, if that's what you're into. Unforturnately, I got hit on by a cougar....appeared to be about mid 50s and I just felt violated for the rest of the night, haha. I had to use a female friend to kinda shield her off me, haha. The live band that they had was very good, playing the usual popular classics (3am, Sweet Home Alabama, Play That Funky Music, Don't Stop Believing, etc). I think what impressed me the most this night was the upgrade in the music selection. They went way beyond the typical top 40 that they usually play when the live band isn't performing. The DJ kinda sucked though....he was mixing in other songs halfway through songs that just didn't blend in well, and he played some songs twice within a 30 minute time frame. There was some really good hip hop (some old Snoop, Luniz, etc) being played that night. I'm really hoping it's like that from here on out b/c although I believe I could dance to any genre of music (tooting my horn a little), dancing to hip hop is a lot more easier, haha.

Out of the reviews that are on here it looks like most were geared toward the night life, which we didn't stick around for. We came solely to try the food. \n\nEverything on the menu sounded so good, and they had a decent range of dishes for you to choose from, with the countries that the dish is from written on the side of each choice. I think it would be hard to come here and have a hard time finding something that sounds good to you, even for the pickiest of eaters. \n\nOur waitress was very friendly and had our drinks out pretty quickly, and she was great at helping us choose which dishes to go with. For appetizer we had the crab con queso - you MUST get this!! I can't even tell you how good it was, you just need to go experience it yourself. It was a crab dip blended together with cheeses, (hence, the name), and it was amazing. They serve it with nachos, and the waitress made a joke about how she literally needed to pry it from our hands because our entrees were about ready to come out and she wanted to clear our table. We also got the Dim Sum as an app, which were basically shrimp dumplings, and they came with a thai peanut dipping sauce that was very tasty. \n\nThen our entrees came out - Oh my Wild Mushroom Ravioli! I have to admit that when it first came out I was doubtful, because it didn't look like much, but it was a deep dish and the raviolis were a decent size. The mushroom brown sauce that the ravs were buried in was out of control. SO good. My fiancee ordered the Tuna Filet Mignon, rare, and it was excellent (of course I saved room for a sample). The only thing that wasn't so good was the \"mashed potatoes\" surrounded the filet, and I put it in quotations because they were definitely questionable. They tasted totally artificial, and if you hadn't told me they were mashed potatoes I would be stuck wondering what it was. Looked like someone stuck microwaveable cauliflower mystery mix and stuffed it through a pastry gun to make it look pretty. I'd order the dish but skip the \"mash\". \n\nOur bill came and we were pretty stunned that we had drinks, 2 apps, and two entrees, and it was only around $60. Definitely not bad! We will be back for sure, for dinner and to stick around for the night scene. We also liked how it had a casual vibe, yet everyone was dressed really nice. Just as a side-note about uptown: I am finding that about a lot of the places we visit; everyone looks really good, the girls dress so cute, but it's not uptight.", "business_id": "e5J3s-xxs1S6PPHJhldBEA", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-08-02", "type": "review"}

Now when NY boys are out of state, we gotta represent to the fullest.  The nightlife in Charlotte was interesting to say the least but it had a ton of potential.  \n\nThe city's bars and clubs almost emulate Manhattan and it's a 50/50 type of feeling one gets.  You think it's cool that it's ALMOST like NYC but then you're thinking \"Be Original\".  Anyway, after checking out a few of the bars and clubs, we hit Dixie's Tavern. \n\nOf course, the thought of two \"brothas\" walking into a spot with that name may make you shudder with fear and anxiety.  The place was very laid back and popping with a really nice sized crowd.  I purposely wore my College of Saint Rose t-shirt to lure out the New Yorkers in the crowd and there were plenty.  Albany, NYC, Long Island...we probably met close to 15 of them.\n\nThe music was mixed and that was OK with us.  It bounced between old school hip hop, top 40, country and classic rock.  It's almost like VH1, BET and CMT got blended into an interesting recipe and the dish was plated as Dixie's Tavern. \n\n It was the typical NY vibe were we argued with NC people about the Yankees, the Giants, Biggie, Jay-Z, pizza, etc...all good and fun drunken joking with the locals.  It was almost like an old school New Paltz type of night.  We saw a couple of fights, some vomiting, slow bar-tending...typical NY college town stuff.  We also discovered that we were there the LAST NIGHT they were open.  I guess they've closed and I have no idea what's there now.

Well those were our thoughts exactly so on came the leg warmers and the tacky scrunchies and off we went to experience 1980 once again!\n\nThe venue was obviously trying to cash in on the Speed Street crowds as it charged us a whopping $10 to park our cars ....and then another $7 (for girls- more for guys) to get in! I can completely understand charging for parking if we weren't entering their bar to spend money- but they obviously weren't out to please customers. \n\nSo I walked in the door after spending $17 expecting at least maybe a break on the drinks -WRONG. This was definitely not the 80s as they accounted for inflation big time! This was more/as expensive than even some of the trendier clubs in Charlotte (and nothing can be said for quality by the way). I ordered a red bull and (well) vodka - $8!\n\n.... We excitedly exclaimed we were celebrating a special Bday night but the bartender did nothing to make it special or exciting and actually gave us really bad service! \n\nI have to say my breaking point was  when I attempted to get some water for myself and my friends to which I was rudely told they only had bottled water. I mean seriously?! How irresponsible is that to serve alcoholic drinks and then not have a glass of water available!\n\n Around 12:30 I wanted to close out my tab and literally waited (trust me I kept track) twenty minutes. I can understand if for whatever reason it is packed and there is only one bartender - but they had two bartenders and a bar back (who couldn't even bother to acknowledge my presence) and the place was fairly empty! I have worked in the service industry through college and trust  me when I say I can empathize in almost any situation but I had had enough. \n\nWhen the bartender went to another group who had just walked up to the bar instead - (thankfully they pointed out that I had been waiting long before them...even though I know he saw me) ...he was not a good bartender. \n\nThe ONLY redeeming quality (hence the two-stars) was the music and the theme of the venue itself. Unfortunately that wasn't enough to save them in my eyes, as I will NOT be returning.", "business_id": "Zw-sWBbL3Z9zyZ0ri9UT_g", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-06-01", "type": "review"}

We didn't have to pay cover, and the staff was amazing awesome to us. The drinks, while a little pricey to Charlotte people's standards, were great for an LA girl's standards ;) I LOVED how they were served in glow in the dark cups (that you could take home if you wanted) and that they were all named after 80's songs. The decor was great, including the neon hand chairs, the hanging rubix cube and the pac man made of red bull cans ;). \nThe dj was pretty awesome, and i especially loved the fact that they played videos. I have to admit that i have definitely not danced that much in a long time. It was totally worth the soreness I woke up with the next day! \nAnother thing I loved was how awesome it was that so many people dressed the part! It was so cool to see an older woman dressed as Jane Fonda, a pair of guys dressed as the guys from Miami Vice, and a Richard Simmons in the mix!

Also so awesome is the fact they have all your favorite music videos on while they play the songs, so in case you don't really know quite how to Push it real good, you can cheat and look. \nYa, so they have a cover and parking fee (boo) but then you walk in and you are transported back in the 80s, and you have beer specials at $1, $2 and $3 and friends greeting each other. You have bright lights and posters of your favorite 80's actors, you have a humongo rubik's cube and Fast Times at Ridgemont High playing. The downstairs has sort of open booths where you can just chat and upstairs is the dance floor, with an additional top floor. \nThis is the place to come unwind and let go of your inhibitions because nobody cares - so what if you're too old, too young, too un-stylish, too dolled up, you have everyone from your mother, to the young break dancers to the John Cusack wannabe's to the born again Michael Jackson's at this joint. \n\nJust come here and let yourself go and test out those dance moves that you secretly practice in front of the mirror at home. I love the diversity, I love the fact that you can come and dance and not worry about what you look like. Although, if you are really concerned, there's a whole wall of mirrors for you to check yourself out, also useful if you want to perfect that Sprinkler move.  \n\nI love it and I will definitely be back. I guarantee, even if you're not an 80's aficionado you will find one song to love.

They play only music from the 80's, which includes a lot of good stuff AND a lot of bad stuff. Michael Jackson and Bobby Brown just doesn't do it for me, but they did play good stuff too, like Duran Duran, New Order, the Cure, and Depeche Mode. My only gripe with this place is the parking. When we drove in, there was a sign that parking was $5, but my friend said parking was free, and the $5 was only for special events. So we didn't pay anything. When we come out, everyone had a parking ticket on their windshield! And it was for $25! My friend went to complain at the door, and they said to email the contact on the ticket and appeal it and you don't have to pay. What a pain.

Thanks for that! \n\nBlue was the only of my three Restaurant Week stops that was successful. Why, you ask? Well, one of the main reasons is because Blue offered a nice variety of their standard menu items on the Restaurant Week menu. No subtractions, no reduced portions no half-assed attempts at bringing back customers. Normal portions and great food. Four of my girlfriends and I made a reservation at Blue before heading to a show at the Stage Door theater. Here's how it went down.\n\nAmbiance: Blue is just pretty inside. They have a lovely bar, spacious tables and an overall upscale \"chill\" atmosphere. \n\nService: Our server was great. Dealing with a table of five women is probably not the easiest task of the night but he did well. He was friendly, polite and offered great suggestions. \n\nStrawberry Cheesecake Martini: Meh, I've had much better martinis from Blue. It was a little too strong and had bit of a burning aftertaste. This is all on me though, as I made the choice to order a martini with cream in it. Next time it's back to dirty. \n\nTega Hills Mixed Green Salad: Delicious. Organic mixed greens (according to our waiter grown in Tega Cay especially for Blue), chunks of goat cheese boursin, roasted tomatoes and a tasty vinaigrette. This was all topped with a pistachio tuile, which looked like a cookie and tasted like a crouton. \n\nAlaskan Halibut with a Lobster Succotash: I'm copying exactly what was in this dish straight from their menu \"pan-seared, potato-crusted halibut over lobster, corn, fava beans and tomatoes in a creamy lobster broth.\" It was delectable, friends. The halibut was moist, perfectly encrusted and perfectly balanced with the succotash. I would have loved a bit more lobster, but who wouldn't?\n\nSticky Toffee Pudding w/Salted Caramel Ice Cream: Our waiter mentioned to me that he hasn't seen anyone actually finish the \"cake\" part in this dessert. Now I know why. While the salted caramel ice cream was beautiful with the sticky toffee pudding, there just wasn't enough to go around and cut the sweetness of the cake part. The dessert was generous and tasty, but I needed more 'scream. And by the way, if they offered to sell this salted caramel ice cream, I would buy it in a heartbeat. \n\n*Note to Blue, your food was great but please don't tease us with a list of desserts on the Charlotte Restaurant Week website that you aren't going to serve. While the desserts were great, I and some of my fellow diners had our hearts set on a few of the desserts listed online but were not served that evening. Sad face.\n\nOverall, this was a very, very good meal and a great deal for Restaurant Week. Adding up all of the components, this meal (post tax, pre-tip) would have normally retailed for roughly $60 and I paid $41. Would I pay retail for this full menu, sure, I probably would. I just wouldn't order all three courses in one sitting. \n\nSee ya soon, Blue. I'll likely be the girl in the corner hoarding the chocolate martini and two desserts.", "business_id": "eaqJQP6bp7rQJQt5KqfvxQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-07-24", "type": "review"}

Ok, I'm lying.  I made one stop on the way home - Barnes and Noble -  to buy a dictionary so I could find the words to explain just how bad this place was for me.  If not for it being restaurant week, thus having reduced pricing, I might have 'made a scene.'\n\nSo I'll start with a service review since I can sum it up with one simple fact: 2 hours and 15 minutes into dinner (restaurant week I remind you - simplified menu, 3 courses) we were still waiting on stuff to be brought to the table.  The service was atrocious and incredibly slow.  At the 2 hour and 15 minute mark, we finally just flagged down the waitress, told her to box up the food, box up the desserts that hadn't arrived yet, just so we could finally get the heck out of there.  Initially I thought this was part of the \"Blue experience,\" but its not.  The waitress came by every 30 minutes, took the order for the next course, and it took an hour for each course to come out.  \nSo the food is boxed and i come home, nightmare over, right?  Wrong! they boxed up my friends food and gave it to me, boxed his up an gave it to the 3rd couple that was with us, etc, etc, etc.  So NOBODY went home with their own food.  I love my friends, but I'm not nibbling at their food scraps.  \n\nSo, food, how was the the food?  Not quite horrible, but not quite good either.  Edible is a better word for it.  I got the \"Grilled Niman Ranch Pork Rack Chop - with a Tuscan white gigante bean and kale ragout finished with a sweet Italian saba.\"  sounds fancy, eh?  Well, it was basically lukewarm vegetable soup, with a hint of chef boyardee, and a dinky pork chop dropped right in the middle.  It was so boring and bland, i question the chef's competence and would openly challenge him to a cook-off if this is as good as he could do.  I could walk into a grocery store blindfolded, randomly grab something, bring it home and microwave it for 3 minutes, and I would still like my chances.  Nobody at the table was impressed with anything they ordered.\n\nSo let's circle back for a second, and return to service.  The waitress was very nice and knowledgeable I have to say.  Maybe she was just over capacity?  I don't know.  But she recognized our frustration and had the manager bring our to-go boxes to us and apologize for the delays and long waits between courses (I think).  This is how that conversation went:\nManager: \"hey guys, sorry things took a little long, you know uh, restaurant week and the kitchen got backed up.  But how was everything?\"\nMe: \"Well, it was ok.  some things were pretty good i suppose, some better than others.\"\nManager: (blank stare)\nMe:  (awkward moment)\nManager; \"well sorry again, and uh i mean, you know ehhhh....\" (blank stare).\nMe: (still awkward so I'm just going to stand up now and leave).\nManager: (blank stare and walks away).\n\nneedless to say, I will never come back here again.  If it were free, I would probably still pass.  If asked what could they do to make it right, i would respond with a full refund of the entire dinner, plus compensation for the 2 hours and 30 minutes of my life that I'll never get back.", "business_id": "eaqJQP6bp7rQJQt5KqfvxQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-07-26", "type": "review"}

It feels fancy, but isn't overly intimidating. \n\nThe menu is decent sized, offering many options for appetizers, salads, and both seasonal entrees as well as year-round favorites. The beer list included some great options. The table started off Flavors of the Mediterranean - a hummus, baba ghanoush, olive tapenade, and white bean salad plate. There were also some stuffed grapeleaves (non-veggie) and a few goat-cheese stuffed peppadews served with pita bread - everything was delicious - very different flavors in each, amazing. I could have eaten the app as a meal. I think the olive tapenade was my favorite - just a very crisp and not over-salty flavor. I gave my grapeleaves away - but was told they were flavorful. The others ordered the Mussels with Chorizo and Piperade - and what a HUGE amount of mussels there were. I was told they were really good. They also served bread, a cranberry walnut and a cheese focaccia with an olive butter - this was also amazing. \n\nFor an entree I ordered the seasonal Alaskan Halibut. It was amazing. The fish was cooked perfectly (slight crisp to the outside, and tender inside) over crab, sweet fresh corn, red thumb potatoes, fava beans, and cherry tomatoes in a creamy corn broth - the flavors went very well together for an interesting dish. \n\nDessert was an amaretto dark chocolate cheesecake - it was good, not amazing. The consistency was a little drier than a cheesecake, and i wish it was a bit more chocolatey - but with the salted caramel the flavors slightly reminded me of a german chocolate cake. \n\nI will be back.", "business_id": "eaqJQP6bp7rQJQt5KqfvxQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-07-12", "type": "review"}

The Hummus... Well I've had better. But the peppers with the goat cheese!!  Delicious!\n\nMain course: Pan Roasted Scottish Salmon with a Shrimp and Baby Artichoke Barigoule - with a stew of shrimp, artichokes, carrots, onions and bacon - I was more impressed with the broth the Salmon was cooked in then I was with the dish itself. \n\nHowever, desert was amazing!

There's a regular bunch on the stage that provides backing by way of piano, drums and bass.

I had never been here and wanted to try it so $15 for $40 worth of food was a great incentive. It took me until last week to give it a try. \n\nThe atmosphere was dark and a bit drab. The art on the walls was nice but I was here for food. The menu was concise but could have been a bit more extensive. The prices were on the high side of expensive. Thank goodness for the coupon. \n\nService was prompt but about as drab as the atmosphere. I could have used a smile from someone but it didn't come. The portions that came with my meal were just the way I like them. Not too much but enough for a good dinner. The flavor of the oysters and shrimp was above satisfactory. \n\nAll in all, the trip was worth it, but with the coupon. I would have kicked myself if I had to pay full price for the experience received. That being said, I doubt I will be returning on my own accord.", "business_id": "jTGQUWGIVvL-aY03C5BEmw", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-07-01", "type": "review"}

Absolutely adore the BBQ shrimp with the only problem being the \"gravy\" is so good that I end up eating too much bread cause I can't stop sopping it up!\n\nThe gumbo is good though on my most recent visit it could have used a bit more salt.  Same for one of the specials we ordered which was blackened mahi with a crawfish, artichoke, tomato sauce.  It was flavorful with perfectly cooked fish and very lemony artichokes though.  Also got the Etouffee (secret... you can order it 4 way where they add andouille to it to go along with the 3 way version with shrimp, crawfish and chicken).  It was really good with a perfect dark roux and just enough spice to get my forehead sweating.  The shrimp in it could be better/bigger/fresher but that's a minor thing compared to the whole of the dish.\n\nI've had the New Orleans's seafood platter before and it's deep fried goodness to be sure.  No matter what you get, portion sizes are more than adequate.\n\nOverall this place is not New Orleans's good, if it were, it would be getting 5 stars but it's definitely good enough for me to make it a semi-regular stop when craving those flavors.", "business_id": "jTGQUWGIVvL-aY03C5BEmw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-07-07", "type": "review"}

Having said that, what I do know is the difference between Bad food, So-so food, and Good food.. and the food at Cajun Queen is definitely in the Good food category. I was there over the weekend, and got to try the BBQ shrimp, seafood gumbo (appetizers) and the \u00e9touff\u00e9e (entree). Yes, we got a little greedy and tried the \u00e9touff\u00e9e not just with chicken or shrimp or crawfish, but with all three! Every dish was so full of flavor and spice - not the 'my mouth is on fire' kinda spice, but the kind that is enjoyable and goes perfectly with their sweet fruit punch rum cocktail - the hurricane. I could taste the heat in the food, and the basic, yet strong flavors of salt and black pepper, paprika,  herbs and onions, and if that's what Cajun/Creole food is supposed to taste like, I need to get down to New Orleans and indulge in some more of this amazing food! In addition to the food, the service was great and quick. The restaurant was packed, but we never found ourselves sitting around looking for our waiter. He was also kind enough to replace my cocktail when I wasn't pleased with my initial choice (I ordered a Cajun martini, and now I know that that's obviously not the kind of drink you want with spicy food :) )", "business_id": "jTGQUWGIVvL-aY03C5BEmw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-07-23", "type": "review"}

My entree, Crawfish Etouffee, was really good (though I should have tried it with some of the spices on the table), but later on, didn't quite agree with my stomach. I don't typically eat shellfish, so that is most likely the reason. I would have tried one of the fish entrees, but they're pricey. Our server Bob was okay, but kind of standoffish sometimes.\n\nThe most disappointing part was that NONE of the seafood is domestic.

Delicious.  My girlfriend was hit and miss with her entrees in the 2 times we've been.  The shrimp Diane was just OK.  It's a lighter consistency than the \u00c9touff\u00e9e and doesn't have the kick I look for when I'm in the mood for Cajun.  The shrimp and grits weren't good at all.

We rarely venture outside Lake Norman and into Charlotte, but the thought of some spicy grub was enough to entice me. Man, I'm glad we went!\n\nWhen we first arrived at 6pm the place was hopping. I highly recommend making reservations. As for parking, they have a complimentary valet service right next to the restaurant, so I recommend using them rather than driving around looking for street parking. The restaurant itself is a converted home, and has a great, quaint feel to it. However, the small rooms lead to tight quarters, and the neighboring tables will be in pretty close proximity to you. We ate upstairs, and if the close tables didn't make the room loud enough, the live band playing behind us aided in turning tableside conversation into a shouting match. Now this would really get on my nerves at other restaurants, but here it worked. I didn't mind the music, and had no problem forgoing conversation for a bit while enjoying the ambiance of the little room and smooth music. Also, they only played about four songs or so, and took a five minute break in between each, so it wasn't a constant barrage of noise.\n\nOur server was quick and efficient, and our food was brought out in a timely manner despite the bustling customer count. For once I did have a cocktail rather than beer or wine, mainly because the mixed drinks were about the same price as a glass of wine. I ordered the Lynchwood Lemonade ($8) which consisted of Jack Daniels, Triple Sec and lemonade. It was a nice, strong drink and went great with the meal and music. The missus ordered a melon martini that she enjoyed quite a bit. It wasn't too sweet and still had a good kick to it.\n\nAfter placing our orders some complimentary bread was brought over, which consisted of three rolls. These things might have well been hockey pucks based on how flavorless and hard they were. I think they might have fallen off the \"bread pudding\" rack and into the \"fresh daily rolls\" basket because there was no way these things should have been served as they were.\n\nFor dinner I ordered the steak special of the day ($24). It came with salad or gumbo, and I went with the salad. Big mistake, because all I got was a bowl with chunks of romaine, a slice of cucumber and some shredded carrot. The vinaigrette that came with it was extremely potent and way too strong. After picking at this salad the main course showed up, which was a 10oz sirloin, crawfish etouffee, mashed potatoes and broccoli. The steak was cooked to order, and despite it being a large (as in tall) cut of meat it was still tender. The blackened seasoning rub added a good deal of spice and flavor to the beef, and I was quite a fan. I was equally happy with the crawfish etouffee, especially since I've never had crawfish before. The etouffee consisted of peeled, small crawfish pieces (smaller than popcorn shrimp) tossed with veggies in a dark, spicy sauce. I really liked the crawfish, which tasted more like lobster than shrimp, and the spice level was perfect...not too much where I couldn't eat it but enough that I felt it after each bite. The mashed potatoes were decent, but nothing out of this world. The broccoli was done kind of poorly, as it was just some huge hunks of slightly steamed broccoli. While the sides and salad were nothing spectacular, the entree was one heck of a spicy, tastetacular bite.\n\nThe missus' went with the  Crawfish Diane ($18.95) and enjoyed it as well. The Diane was done in a lighter sauce that was not as spicy as the etouffee, so if you want something that's a little milder this would be the dish. This was her first bite of crawfish too and really enjoyed it. The Diane had a little more substance in that it added rice to the protein and veggie mixture, and there was so much that she had leftovers for lunch the following day. While it was tasty, I thought it was just a bit bland compared to the etouffee.\n\nWe ended up splurging for dessert when we saw they offered bread pudding, which has become something we can't pass up when dining out. Cajun Queen makes one heck of a Bourbon Bread Pudding (5), and if you are a fan of bread pudding you shouldn't pass this up. The dessert came in a decent-sized ramekin and was filled with this warm treat. The bread pudding had chunks of peach and raisen going through it, and they became hot and gooey from the heat of the bread pudding. It had great taste and texture, with a nice crust on top. There was also a pile of whipped cream and caramel drizzled across the crust, making the dessert a visual and edible offering. \n\nCajun Queen dishes out some great grub. While some things can be improved upon (sides and rolls), the stuff that counts is pretty banging. Our entrees were delicious and the cocktails were done well. This is one of those places that we will definitely be bringing friends and family to when they visit from out of town.", "business_id": "jTGQUWGIVvL-aY03C5BEmw", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-06-29", "type": "review"}

We've been coming here since we were in high school, class of '99, so...that's quite some time. Gosh, now I feel old. \n\nThere are several reasons why this continues to be a favorite of ours. \n\nFirst, the neighborhood is utterly charming. An old home converted into a restaurant is adds a bazillion points to character of the restaurant. It's not brand spanking new. Nothing's been razed to the ground and rebuilt in that new minimalist style. I'm a big fan of repurposing without losing the original charm. I love love love that this place is still in a house. Take a chance to walk around the neighborhood if you like old historic homes. Some of the architecture will bring a tear to your eye. \n\nSecond, live jazz band. Do I need to say more? There's something about a live band at a restaurant. It provides an old world elegance. I feel like I've taken a step back in time. Like I'm Dolly in the classic movie \"Hello, Dolly\" and Louis Armstrong is about to serenade me while walking to my table. \n\nThird, the upstairs bar and patio. One of my favorite things to do is get there 15 or 20 minutes earlier then our reservation and hang out at one of the tables in the bar. We order a plate of fried oysters with remoulade sauce, a couple drinks and just enjoy the atmosphere till our table is ready. We've had some of the best conversations just leaning against the counter sipping on sweet tea and munching on oysters. \n\nFourth, is the bread. Once you make it to a table (be sure to make a reservation or you will wait forever especially peak times on the weekend) you will be blessed with a basket of hot rolls. These rolls are the perfect combination of crisp and chewy. I believe they come from Nova's bakery, or at least that is what I've been told by the waitstaff. It's rare to get bread service at a non Italian restaurant or chain steakhouse. Again, it's a throwback to old classics and deserves a hand clap! The only bummer is the butter. It comes ice cold which makes it difficult to spread. \n\nFifth, is the food. I could say that food should be in the number one spot, but all these things listed prior are working together in its favor and is why this place is our favorite. The food here is a delight. I love heat and all things spicy. However, when they use spice, it doesn't over power the flavor. It isn't just spicy. It's packed full of flavor with a bit of heat that catches you at the end. One of my favorites is the chicken Diane. Sometimes I switch it up and get shrimp Diane or all 3 Diane (which is chicken, shrimp and crawfish). The Diane is rich and flavorful with mushrooms floating in buttery goodness. It is all things pleasurable. It is a mouthful of happiness and rainbows. Seriously, it's really good. If you are not a fan of garlic and mushrooms, then do not order this. Also, plan on smelling like garlic for a day or two after eating this. No vampire will want to come near you and your lover may avoid your kisses if you don't pop a mint. Trust me. Dragon breath is imminent. \n\nThe blackened chicken is well seasoned and not dried out. It is hard to blacken chicken breast meat and still have it juicy but they nail it every time. The blackened catfish is a favorite and is a huge portion. In fact, almost all the dishes here are giant and unless you are The Rock (can you smell what The Rock is cookin'?), you might be taking home a box or two of leftovers.\n\nDefinitely try the fried oysters with remoulade. They are lightly breaded and fried. Every time we visit we just have to order them. They are tender and sweet. Perfect start to the meal. \n\nI've had the gumbo a couple of times as a starter. I love gumbo and the one here is good. It's not the best gumbo I've ever had but it's not the worst. I like okra and andouille sausage in addition to the shrimp and I don't think I've ever had a bowl with any of those in it. However, the rice is perfectly cooked every time. So, the gumbo might be a gamble. \n\nThey do have a decent Ceasar salad for a starter. Nothing fancy. Just a good salad. \n\nI'm usually too full for dessert, but we have had the bread pudding and the key lime pie. Both are a great way to end the meal but I'd rather have the plate of oysters. \n\nFor all the reasons stated above, this place holds the number one spot in our date nights. Cajun Queen Forever!! \n\nP.s. - I miss seeing queen gator. :*(", "business_id": "jTGQUWGIVvL-aY03C5BEmw", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-06-09", "type": "review"}

I really, honestly, truly love this restaurant.  \"What makes this place so special?\" you ask.  For me this place is the perfect marriage of great service and great food, and aren't those the very reasons we go to all these restaurants in the first place?  Service. & Food.  \n\nThe food was nothing short of pure, delectable bliss.  We (my dad and I) started with a few drinks and the New Orleans B.B.Q. Shrimp, \"Saut\u00e9ed with Butter, Garlic, Beer and a Variety of Cajun/Creole Spices\".  It contained, 5 juicy, succulent pieces of shrimp; swimming in a small bowl of \"cajun/creole spices\"  for $8.95.  Very spicy + very tender = very good.  Don't forget to dip your bread in the broth!  \n\nFor the main course, my dad and I split the Shrimp Diane.  Now the Diane sauce contains, \"Mushrooms, Garlic, Butter, Green Onions, Parsley and Queen's Magic Spices saut\u00e9ed together. Moderately spiced and served over Rice.\"  They give you the option of splitting it for only $5.00 more bringing the entree price to 23.95.  Certainly not cheap by any means, but well worth the cost.  The best way to describe the taste, is to image garlic, butter, onions, and a bunch of \"Queens Magic Spices\" working harmoniously to perfectly marinate the shrimp with the rice keeping things from getting to sloppy.  Its Cajun food at its finest.  \n\nAt that point, things were so good we just HAD to get dessert, right??  We decided to order the pecan pie.  I mean, pick an adjective - amazing, spectacular, splendid, etc.  It was served to us warm and moist (that's what HE said - LOL), as if it was just taken out of the oven, with dab of whipped cream.\n\nThe service was on point from start to finish; from the valet to the host/hostess to the super friendly bartender upstairs.  Everyone was really kind and polite. What exactly separates the staff here from other restaurants?  Its all in the details...for example, every single person said, \"be with you in one minute\" or \"be right with you\".  No one ever ignored us, or expected us to wait until we could be helped.  My drinks (adult/H2O) were never empty. We didn't have to think/worry about parking.  There was a plethora of condiments, hot sauces, etc to satisfy even the most particular taste buds.  Bathrooms were immaculate.  They had live jazz.  ...See what I mean about the details?\n\nI'm hooked.  I'll be back very, very soon, maybe even tomorrow!  I love this place.  There.

Pulling up it looks like a old historic house. I'd never eaten in a restaurant like this so I was excited to get inside. When you pull in, they have complimentary valet. They work really hard so I always make sure I have cash to tip them. One weekends you have to have a reservation as they are normally booked to capacity. Immediately at the door they have someone waiting to seat you. And inside, the layout is just like a house! I love it!! Tables are spacious and the atmosphere is very nice. I've eaten upstairs once and I will never do it again. The reason is because they have a band upstairs every night. While the music is nice, it is loud. I left with a headache that one time from trying to yell over the music along with all the other conversations going on as the bar is upstairs as well. Downstairs you can still hear the music so I prefer to eat there. I've never had a rude server. They are always so nice. I've tried a little bit of everything here, and the only thing that I can say left me something to be desired was the BBQ Shrimp. Not that flavorful, wasn't really exciting, I'll pass on that from now on. The popcorn Crawfish is soooo good! So tender! They just melt in your mouth. I wasn't a fan of the shrimp scampi. While it was delicious!! It was pretty much shrimp served in a soup of oil and butter. Was wayyy too much! And the seafood Gumbo is really good. It has a small kick of heat and you'll get a couple shrimp in it if you're lucky. My favorite meals are the All 3 Diane and the Special where you pick your fish and either Shrimp or Crawfish topping. Just about everything is served over rice but I prefer Mashed Potatoes. And the hands down best dessert there is the Bourbon Pecan Pie!!! OMG!!!!!! Just think 21 Jump Street in my mouth!!

Great beer, wine, and mixed drink selection. They have a small kids menu and there were kids in the restaurant but it was more of an adult place in my mind. I don't think you can overdress because it's a nice (and pretty pricey) restaurant, but you can also come in with a nice pair of jeans. \n\nFor appetizers our group split the BBQ shrimp and fried pickles. The shrimp was wonderful, spicy but bearable:) it was large, juicy, and cooked perfectly (not rubbery). The broth is amazing especially using it as a dip for the rolls. Fried pickles were typical fried pickles with ranch dip. Nothing unique, but still delicious.\n\nEveryone loved their meals with the exception of one person in our party. First, the good. I ordered the special for $25- blackened tilapia over rice with a sauce of crawfish, sundried tomatoes, lemon, and artichoke. HEAVEN!

I can't imagine the poor ladies having to hover over the toilets there, afraid of the as-yet-undocumented pathogens lurking on the seat. Seriously folks, the bathrooms here are BEYOND NASTY! And points off for cutting out indoor smoking. They used to not care about the NC statewide ban on indoor smoking (\"yeah, like the cops ever come HERE\", the bartender told me), but a few months ago they decided to ban it... thus removing the one thing I really liked about it. \n\nDon't get me wrong folks.

My first impression, a while back, was a little disheartening from how many people were smoking inside. Now, so I hear, this has been done away with. Good for us non-smokers and maybe a blow to the cigarette-goers. However, this paled to the happiness I found in the small bar with cheap PBR and the even tinier stage. I've seen this stage packed with 6 member outfits with hardly enough room to play and smaller rockabilly bands tearing it up! So much personality there could be a novella written about the days it has seen. Goodness what a cool joint. \n\nThis place isn't glamorous, folks. It's an old, converted house, turned-venue. If you're into punk, metal, or anything in between, check their website. Always booking shows and plenty of variety. You can buy tickets online or pay at the door. \n\nBeware on rainy nights.

It's got a large bear encased in glass who watches over the crowd, and a bar to serve up some inexpensive drinks. I was very pleased with the prices, but they only take CASH! Keep that in mind. If you are like myself and hoard all your cash in lieu of a plastic rectangle, no worries... they have an ATM, with a $2.00 fee to start your  night out right. \n\nThe middle area has another bar, and some seating areas, but not much, and the back area has the famous mechanical bull, great for people watching. There are funny things throughout the place to catch your eye, like a pair of legs hanging out of the ceiling and a guy sitting on top of a deer or some other animal head.

Upstairs are some pool tables to get your hustle on, and yet another bar to keep you from being thirsty while you're, hustlin. hustlin. hustlin...every day I'm hustling.. Oh wait, that's Rick Ross, wrong venue. \n\nThe only reason for the lack of that fifth star is the seating, and the cash only. I was wearing heels and my feet were sore by 11!

I used to live right down the road from the Saucer and went there several times a week in order to earn my own gold plate up on the wall (something you get after drinking 200 different beers). The selection is unmatched in the Charlotte area, and the wait staff is usually really knowledgeable about all the new beers they get in. Monday nights are $2.75 \"pint nights\" where everything on the wall (and we're talking nearly 100 beers here) is only $2.75, and considering the quality of some of these this is almost impossible to beat ANYWHERE!\n\nThe glass program on Wednesday night is really cool, and if you go to their website there is even a big trading community so you can find some pretty cool stuff that the local one doesn't offer. The tracking system they use is actually really great too. It's awesome to be able to see every beer you've ever had there, including the date, and your rating and comments about it.\n\nThe food at the bar is, well, bar food. If you're expecting something amazing for dinner here then you're definitely here for the wrong reason. While not quite as bad as you would expect, it's still the standard grease-laden goodies that just seem to go great with beer.\n\nThe one detriment to this place for me was that they allow smoking inside. I would dock them a point for this normally, but the reasonable person in me still realizes that it is a bar, and it is in NC, so it's almost allowable.

There is an area for live music, and a couple of dart boards, I did not wander around or to take in the entire place, but I was told that there is an area with billiard tables as well. Really, it's a nice change from some of the Charlotte area drinking establishments that lack character and are littered with TV's...\n\nThe service was terrific. The waitresses are wearing school girl outfits, complete with tiny little plaid skirts, knee high argyle socks, and skin tight tank tops. Somewhat similar to the outfits worn by the Tilted Kilt girls. Quite appealing. Aside from thier appearance the wait staff seem to have at least a rudimentary knowledge of the beers on thier list.\n\nThe beer selection was outstanding, somewhere around 100 taps, and at least as many bottles covering a wide array of styles. If only they planned thier food menu as well.\n\nThe food was uninspired, and fairly plain. Fairly standard chain pub fare, and not terribly well executed at that. Not that the food was bad, just not terrific. And definately not worth the prices.\n\nThey do have some specials, I think they have a couple of days a week where drafts are $3, but overall I found the beer and food pricing to be a bit high.\n\nOverall, I would definately go back.

So, you know it must be good.

Seating is a first come, first served basis so you really do have to fight to get a seat when one becomes available.  People are freaking aggressive!!

In fact, there is nearly anything you could possibly want.  I am craving a beer thinking about it!  The food is pretty good too!  I have had most everything on the menu and have enjoyed it all.\n\nAside from the beer, it is the atmosphere that sells the place.

Who's counting.  \n\nMy friends are beer connoisseurs or enthusiasts if you will.  I on the other hand am not.  I don't know the first thing about beer except that what I've had in the past I didn't like.  Fruity cocktails are more my speed.

Who knew.  Maybe you did but I sure didn't.  \n\nI had the Hummingbird H20 and it was yummy.  I then tried the Snakebite which wasn't as yummy but it wasn't terrible.  Our server was great and really knowledgeable about all of the drinks (the Snakebite wasn't her recommendation for me but I was being adventurous).  Which is quite impressive since there are hundreds to choose from.    Greatest part was that the drinks were cheap.  Only $5 a piece for my tall glasses of brew.

My GF's \"Rocket Tots\" were tasty, although she only got like... 14 of them for $6.99 so it wasn't a good value at all. I ordered a burger, which was the worst I've had since I moved to Charlotte in 2003. The meat had a sour, \"off\" taste, and the meat was cooked within an inch of its life. It was so dry that it was impossible to eat without liquid. What's more, I ordered it with Red Dragon cheese (and extra $1), and it was a depressing, congealed mass on top. The 9 fries that came with the meal were served at a less than ideal temp, but were nice and salty in spite of this.\n\nThe bottom line is that the waitresses are cute and in skimpy outfits, and the beer selection is good.

On certain days, you can pay $3-4 and get some sort of mystery beer.  What can I say - I love the mystery of it!  I got a Mexican Logger and thought it was pretty good.\n\nTheir menu has pretty standard bar-fare, with sandwiches, wings, and pizza.  Their pretzels were decent, but I had a River Rocket sandwich and was thoroughly unimpressed.  For the portion sizes and quality, their food is seriously overpriced.  One Sunday, my partner and I came in while he got an oil change.  It was probably a little before noon, and we came here because we thought breakfast places would be busy.  We intended to just get lunch, but lo and behold, we say people with plates and breakfast food on them.  Not knowing anything about it and asked the waitress, who did not tell us much except that apparently it is $11 if you are not a member.  It turns out this was a TERRIBLE idea.  So, I asked if they had coffee, which they did - SERVED IN A REGULAR BEER GLASS.  It was a very weird situation for us.  All the food on it was cold, it had only eggs, sausage, potatoes, and some muffins.  First off, it was GROSS.  Second, there was barely anything left on it and they were not refilling it (when we left, it was all gone).  It would have been nice for our waitress to tell us this before we ordered, but she looked like she could not be bothered.  I probably would have complained, but we decided instead to pay and leave.  It was a lesson learned to check the buffet before just blindly ordering.  Another family came in afterward for the buffet, which turns out had no food on it by that time.  I can't believe the waitress did not warn us of this before we ordered.\n\nBecause of this last experience, I don't think I'll ever go back.

The years have been fine to this location, it was just as I remembered.\n\nLocated at the end of Rea Crossing shopping center just past the 485 exits on Providence Rd, if you are heading towards Waxhaw, it will be on your right.  If you are leaving the shopping center during peak drive times, or would rather not cross 4 lanes of Providence Rd, you can drive behind the gas station and hang a left, which will take you to a stoplight for safe crossing.\n\nI was greeted by the hostess and after asking not to sit at a high top (I realize I am alone and will take up a table probably meant for 4, but I typically have on a skirt and no one wants to see that while they are trying to eat) I got a little bit of an eye roll, but that's okay.  Some girls get mad at how pretty I am, so I am used to eye rolls (ha).  Hickory Tavern is FULL of large flat screen TV's and usually have whatever the prime viewing for the time is on a huge projection screen on a rear wall.  When I was in around 6 on a Thursday night, it was SportsCenter (da na na) so I could read the crawl along the bottom of the screen.  I was quickly greeted by my server, Katlyn, and she was fantastic - my drink was kept filled and she checked up on me periodically without helicoptering around me.  As I put in my Tip for this location, I believe she said on Thursdays that shrimp were $.60 and oysters were $.75, bit since I don't eat either, I wasn't exactly tuned in.  The table next to me got oysters and he commented that they were tasty.  \n\nThe food:\nTurkey Club w/ Tavern chips ($9.50):  Turkey with melted cheese, bacon, lettuce and tomato, served warm.  The bread, if you are a Costco person, is one of their torta rolls that are deee-licious.  The sandwich was good, and I like that it was served warm, but it needed a little more flavor to it.  Maybe next time I will ask for a side of BBQ sauce or the like to punch it up a bit.  The house made chips were thick sliced potato chips, crispy, but not hard and served with a slightly spicy dipping sauce - they were good and not overly salty, which was perfect.  \nKey Lime Cheesecake ($6.95):  This tasted like another Queen City Pastry dessert and was delicious.  Served with several swirls of whipped cream, this light key lime cheesecake, on a graham cracker crust, with a thin layer of lime sauce on top, was the perfect somewhat light dessert the finish the meal.  \n\nExcellent service and the food was slightly above average for this type of restaurant.

If you're hungry be sure to order some starters as soon as you arrive. They still might take 20+ minutes.  Wings, nachos, and other bar food is usually pretty consistent though there are exceptions.  Usually their chicken tenders are outstanding--among the best I have ever had.  However, sometimes they serve a substitute which are among the worst I have ever had.  Service is also hit and miss.  Even with a good waitress we find that they are \"gone\" far more than they are circulating.  They tend to congregate at the bar, particularly when things are slow.  Some are good at their job and seem to be competent and happy that they are in food service.  Others act like they despise being in food service and seem like they'd rather be doing ANYTHING other than waiting on the general public.  The place does need a really good clean-up and re-fresh.

The drinks haven't changed much, the pool tables are still plentiful, and the servers are still friendly (for the most part). So, you're probably wondering why the sudden change of heart about this place. Well, Bailey's recently underwent a change of management due to the former one getting transferred. Things sure went downhill after that! They are simply trying WAY too hard to lure in customers now. DJs, bands, unnecessary events, most of which nobody cares about are a regular occurrence here. This wouldn't be too big of an issue, but you have to pay a cover for these! And that is just annoying. Bailey's, you just need to keep it simple! Stick with alcohol and pool, ditch the new frills, and I'll be back then.", "business_id": "IbWfpebkP64zWgc9-ZVtZA", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-08-16", "type": "review"}

This restaurant does not realize that there are too many restaurants in the immediate area for both the food and service to be subpar.\nThe restaurant was fairly empty (approximately 7 occupied tables), however, the server was not attentive and slow to serve. She barely came to the table to check on us. She never once refilled our waters. And, she never cleared the table of the appetizer plates; we were eating our entrees and she never came back to clear the table of those plates. It was a crowded mess. Speaking of entrees- the sizzle plates that come with grilled orders were dirty. Dried cheese and muck from another diner were stuck to these plates. We advised the manager. His response was, \"well, the plates are supposed to get washed- there are two piles in the back, one clean and one dirty....sorry, you did not get clean ones.\" And, that was it. He did not offer to take the meals off the bill, or anything else. He said, \"thanks for the feedback,\" then he left.\nThe food itself was eh. The spinach artichoke dip, which we would normally get, must be a new recipe. It was bad. We ordered two caesar salads, and she brought two house salads. Sure, she changed them- after we clicked that mechanism on the table that flashes, and then waiting another five minutes for her to reappear from some where and us vigorously flagging her down. The bread that came with an entree was like a brick- one bite was enough to determine that you could break your teeth on it. And the chicken that I ordered, had a funny taste.\nNeedless to say, if you want a decent meal with at least decent service, DO NOT come to this restaurant.", "business_id": "98hOHm56D0Boz2LCg0-irg", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-07-02", "type": "review"}

No matter what you're interested in, if you want to have a drink the guys and girls here can help you find the perfect match for your palate. The wine selection is hard to beat, and you definitely won't find better deals anywhere else in Charlotte. The beer selection is also top notch, and they even do a yearly tasting outside with close to 100 beers to sample from.\n\nOne of the best things about the Wine Vault, and something that really sets them apart from the other contenders in this genre, are their weekly tastings. For $5-10 (depending on the quality of the wines that week) you can taste up to 6 wines, and learn a little bit about each one while you do it. There's a large group of regulars who come to almost every tasting, so if you're new to the area it's also a great way to meet some really cool people. There's also an extensive wine cellar (hence the Vault name) downstairs with private bins that you can rent to store you own wine, in addition to a much larger seating area that I think most people don't even realize exists. They do lots of private events down in the main cellar room, so if you want to do a big corporate event like a private tasting it's a really cool atmosphere and something your friends or employees will remember for a long time.\n\nMy favorite aspect though has to be the almost monthly wine dinners that the shop puts on in conjunction with some of the best restaurants in the Charlotte area. They are always extremely reasonable in price, especially when you compare it to similar offerings around town.

This is a tasty sauce I've had many times so I knew what I was given.  The wings were brought to me pipping hot and the ranch was thick and cold.  There's nothing I despise more than a warm, runny ranch.  The wings were cooked with the perfect amount of crispiness but were not overcooked by any means.  \n\nMy only complaint with the wings is that they are not charred.  I'm sorry to say, but if you're not throwing your wings over an open-flame and charring them at this point then you're simply behind the times.  Plenty of establishments such as Fanz, Hickory Tavern and Mac's throw their wings over a grill before serving them.\n\nIf your looking for a chill and relaxing WEEKDAY evening to watch your favorite team, Picassos is the perfect place.  On football Sundays, Picasso's University is nothing short of perfectly organized mayhem.  Fans often arrived at 11am-11:30am even though their game doesn't kick-off until 1pm!  Furthermore, you are very likely to see a skirmish or a squabble as Sunday day turns into Sunday evening and patrons start to get that liquor courage. \n\nBefore I close, I want to make an important distinction in my rating.  I give Picasso's Sports Cafe as a whole  5-stars.  The staff is always friendly, prompt and efficient.  However, I am not giving their Cajun Garlic Wings 5-stars!  Though their wings are good, there are not \"5-star\" worthy.  On a scale of 1-10, I'd give them a 7.\n\nAt its soul, this is a classic, American sports-bar.

Oh yeah, the A/C worked perfectly too. \n\nI had a pizza while watching two baseball games and the golf tournament. The pizza was pretty good, not great, but I ate it all so it was good enough.  Great crust.  The menu seemed to have some other things that looked good. I heard somebody down the bar mention the Calzone was good so next time.  Another guy had some good looking wings too.\n\nJust as I was leaving, a major thunder storm blew up so I turned around and had another beer.  \n\nGreat place to hang out and have a few brews and a bite while watching a game.

Heck, I am not so much of a sports person.  But I am a huge fan of wings, and thus I sought out a place that had pretty decent ones.  This led me to try Picasso's to see what it's all about.  And I have got to say, they have some pretty good ones.\n\nThus far, I have tried three different kinds.  The Caribbean Creepers were like eating a jerk chicken wing, but they were just a little too different for me.  The medium garlic were pretty good, but the best I have had, by far, are the Cajun Garlic.  They are the perfect level of spiciness, not too spicy but plenty of flavor.  \n\nI have tried some of their other things here too.  Their bacon cheese fries were kind of 'meh' when I had them; they were pretty skimpy on the cheese and bacon.  Their pizza was pretty decent.  We had the Masterpiece, had a lot of good toppings.  Still, I am not a huge fan of New York-style pizza (I originate from the Midwest, and am quite partial toward Chicago-style or deep dish), but it was pretty standard for pizza.\n\nService has been ok here.  I have never had bad service, so that is definitely a plus.  They do have a decent amount of seating too, and it's not overly crowded in there.\n\nI plan to try a few more things on their menu, and that definitely includes other styles of their wings.  Their wings are good, but I must continue on my quest for amazing wings here in Charlotte.\n\nOverall, I would give Picasso's about 3.5 stars.", "business_id": "3xdV-7di_YD3MVqs3Pa7-g", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-08-08", "type": "review"}

I come here to play poker and spend time with my poker buddies a couple of nights a week. BUT, for those who are sports fans and like to eat/drink while watching a game,  you should be very happy with this place.\nPicasso's is very popular with the college-aged sports fan crowd -- particularly since it's located just up the road from UNC-Charlotte.\nThe food is standard sports-bar fare. Wings, pizzas, sandwiches, wraps, fries and other appetizers. These are of fairly average quality -- though I have heard some of my friends comment that they particularly like the fajitas. There are no desserts.\nThere is a good selection of beer & mixed drinks -- nothing fancy, but adequate and fairly priced for your average sports fan.\nThe staff is very friendly and professional and are able to accomodate large crowds with ease -- given a little advanced notice. As I mentioned, my poker league plays here twice a week (on Mondays and Wednesdays, 2 games each day at 7pm and 9:30pm FREE) and we usually have crowd of 20-30. Often, other college groups (clubs, fraternities, sports teams, etc.) share the same space.  It's a spacious establishments with lots of TVs and even a huge (I'd say 10 ft or bigger) projection TV for the big games.\n\nIn addition to the games on the TVs and twice-weekly free poker, there is also an electronic darts board and a \"shuffleboard\" game. The covered outdoor seating area is convenient if you happen to be a smoker or have smokers in your party. \n\nSO . . . being a foodie, I'd give Picasso's 3 stars.

It is where boaters come to watch and to be seen. It is common to have quite a few beers while watching the boats try to aimlessly dock in a narrow slip with amateur boaters.  I will refer to this event as the bumper boats at T-Bones.\n\nI am perplexed at the statement that they take reservations, but they do not do call ahead seating.

I give this a 1/5 stars,yes one star.  The bacon was burnt (black) and the rice was very dry and hard.  The sauce did not really help, but it did add flavor to a very bland dish.  Definitely not worth $9.99 ( I have added a picture) \n\nNow for for the Burgers / Chicken sandwiches.  The burger was very nice, juicy, the provolone cheese was properly melted and the bacon was cooked perfectly.  The Chicken Sandwich, which I requested plain, was very juicy, moist, and without any extra help, from condiments, lettuce etc, was very tasty and flavorful.  \n\nNow you may ask,how can bacon be burnt black and then be cooked perfectly at the same time.....remember that one was on my appetizer (burnt) and the other was on the hamburger.\n\nOur server was very friendly, prompt with the drink refills and attentive, all the way up until we were ready to leave......after she took our plates away, it was 5 minutes before she returned with the check.   She apologized, but by that time.....I was ready to go!\n\nHere's the breakdown of my rating:\n\nLocation: 4/5 Stars  \nIt is right on the water at Buster Boyd Bridge.\n\nAtmosphere: 3/5 Stars  \nNeeds to be updated somewhat.

I think the salmon took on the flavor of the smell of the inside which was nasty. I have enjoyed the chicken quesadilla and drinks before, but that's about it. Actually, I forgot, their Sunday brunch is pretty good and they do a bloody Mary bar that is good too. Don't take a large group because they act like accommodating you is painful. They also took forever when the restaurant seemed fairly dead. They need to remodel and hire a new chef to re-write the menu because you cannot beat the location.

So we thought we would try the Sunday breakfast buffet and Bloody Mary bar. My advice - go to IHOP or Denny's instead. The breakfast \"buffet\" was no more that a glorified lets-throw-some-typical-mediocre-breakfast-items on a couple of tables and call it  Breakfast Buffet. I went expecting rather a brunch - i.e.: breakfast AND lunch items - after all, they weren't even open until 11 and I'm not much of a breakfast food-type eater anyway. For the price they charged the following was served: fruit (nothing special- cantaloupe, strawberries and honeydew), your typical institutional scrambled eggs - rather plain, bacon, sausage links & patties, biscuits and gravy- thin gravy, short on any sausage mixed in, frenchtoast sticks - which were hard as rocks already and they had only been open 20 minutes! It took a while, and I do mean a WHILE for our server to even show up to begin with and she didn't come back to check on us very often. I had to ASK about the Bloody Mary Bar to which she replied - \"oh yeah it's in the back there\" - this server was NOT really hawking the attributes of the restaurant like one would expect - even when we mentioned it was our first time for the Breakfast buffet. It's an eclectic place, and the food is typically good for the most part - but the same old thing menu. Ribs are good and as I mentioned earlier the prime rib is excellent... but that's probably all we will get there from now on, if we return at all.

You can tell that the place is wiped down but never deep cleaned.  \n\nSo now to the food.  I had a Carolina burger. It was tasteless, unseasoned, and poorly made.  Tasted nothing like a Carolina burger should.  The slaw had carrots in it which is weird on a burger and I've never seen carrots in homemade burger cole slaw.  The chili was tasteless.  The bun was tasteless.  Bad all the way around.  The burger was low grade meat, more suited for McDonalds and truthfully tasted worse than a McDonalds burger but cost me 10.00.  What a sham.  That burger cost them 2.00 and they charged 9.99.  Which I'll gladly pay for a fresh ground beef patty.  Pitiful excuse for a restaurant. No leadership in this place.

Here, of course, they are boar's heads. Ew. At least they're small and unobtrusive. Other than that, I like the interior, it's all wood siding, floor to ceiling, in a natural walnut tone, not that ugly fake orangey finish that some places use. I like the setup, there's lots of big windows and natural light, easy to watch the volleyball games going on just out the back door. Tucked away in a mature tree filled lot, I really got the feeling that I was in the Dells and not just off a busy street in Middleton. The trivia announcer sits on a little triangular stage in the corner, which is probably where they have bands. Lots of tables spread out on the floor in front could be easily moved for dancing. The trivia was good, not too hard or too easy, and we came in 2nd place after a tie breaker (sports question, of course, oh nooooo...!) Even the tables here are made from the same rough-hewn planks, and one of my party was grossed out by the accumulation of crud in the spaces between the boards. He did have a point. The tap list is unremarkable, mostly mass produced standards with a couple of local seasonals. Luckily one of them was a Karben4, so I was happy. The food seems like standard Sysco issue. I just had the waffle fries, which were 1000% salt. I asked for the ketchup, and friend asked, \"do you mean this FANCY ketchup?\", which is what the label said. Turns out, fancy means tomatoes and high fructose corn syrup, upon further inspection. Who knew. Friend had a burger, which he described as tasteless. He tried dumping a lot of fancy ketchup on it, but finally gave up. They also have pizzas and other things, and another friend said the cheese curds are good. The table service was slow and perfunctory, but the one female bartender I interacted with was friendly and fast.

Thursday nights feature Westside Andy & Mel Ford, and that is always a good time.  There are decent taps, though last time I was there I believe they had removed Esser's Best which was my go-to every time there.  Most of the specials tend toward the $1 shot variety, but I especially like that Capital pints are $2 on Wednesdays and you can get pitchers of Spotted on Fridays for a crazy $5.  I also learned that your second drink before noon on Sundays is free, and domestic taps are 50 cents.  More on that later.  The bartenders are for the most part good, but if you're there on the wrong day they seem to forget about you in favor of talking with the regulars.\n\nThe food is pretty standard: not too fancy but good.  Sometimes the food doesn't come as advertised in the menu.  Once I ordered a Reuben that strangely was lacking Swiss cheese, though I didn't notice until halfway through as it was still a tasty sandwich.  I like the bison burger here, but the last time I ordered this it came sans tomatoes, likely due to the salmonella issue at the time.  Also that day my sister found the Hody Chicken's buffalo sauce to be beyond her tolerance for spiciness.  My sister's boyfriend was suitably impressed with the Hody burger, but he thought that they had left of the special Hody sauce.  It might have just been a bad day, because most of the other times I've been here there were no problems.  I do believe that the overall quality depends on the day you stop in.  Some of the bartenders kind of throw things together, while others take their time and do a decent job.  I haven't been there regularly enough to establish a schedule, so it's been hit or miss for me lately.  I've also tried a few of the appetizers and the onion straws and quesidilla wrappers are very good every time I've had them.  \n\nThe main drawback with the Hody is the regular crowd.  On Thursdays when Westside Andy & Mel Ford are playing the crowd is great - a variety of people, young and old, some dancing to the music, some sitting at the bar or nearby tables.  Other nights the crowd can get a bit too townie for my liking.  It can be uncomfortable, especially when half the bar turns to look at you when you walk in.  Sundays can be the worst.  I think that some of those people nearly live there.  The place is pretty open and there is a lot of space, but it still can get quite smoky.  There is a few outdoor tables along Elmwood, and these are perfect for a weekend afternoon.  I would probably return to the Hody more if it weren't for the small inconsistencies in the food and the slight hostile feeling that I sometimes pick up from the regulars, but overall the Hody is a reliably good time.", "business_id": "xbJ9tdGbcVJIUkNgHSCwZQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-06-27", "type": "review"}

Limited tap selection, although they have a few interesting items: Great Lakes Ale and Esthers Best were two that stood out as fun and not what you'd normally find at a more mainstream location.  They also have daily drink specials - we tried the Lemon Smash (hand squeezed (with each drink) lemonade + vodka) and the Whiskey Old Fashioned Sour.  Both were great.\n\nFood? We tried the famous chili - meaty, slightly spicy, and delish.  Not the best I've ever had, but not bad by any means.  We tried the vegetable beef soup - hearty, loaded with veggies, and the meat was tender and of good quality.  \n\nFor our entrees, we went a bit conservative - grilled chicken salads - but they were huge and tasty.  Fresh, fresh, fresh veggies - the tomatoes were wonderful as were the onions (red, and soooo sweet).  The salad was definitely an unexpected surprise - I'd get it again in a heartbeat!  \n\nOur dining companion ordered some chicken strips which he requested be tossed in their hot wings sauce.

I will stick to TGIFridays, Texas Roadhouse and Outback Steakhouse from now on;they never disappoint and we have no problem putting down $50 or $60 plus a $10+ tip.

This means that you may have someones poorly trained dog licking your feet during dinner.  This also means that all of the servers and staff will pet the dogs while handling your food.

Brats, right? Of course! What? No? It's just me? Well, that's what happens when you're at Olbrich Beach catching some rays and are subjected to the craving-inducing scents from 1,000 Father's Day celebration BBQs going on at the park. \n\nSurprisingly it's not that easy to find a local place on the east side that you can just walk into and order a brat. Enter Harmony, the harbinger of good things to come. I'm not one who enjoys going out alone, especially to bars, but that's something I'm trying to get over. So it was a relief to see the place only half filled with low key, relaxed people who barely noticed I was there. I was however, immediately noticed by the friendly, smiling young bartender (who looked all of fourteen), so I was put further at ease. Also delightful was a live band playing happy zydeco music in the other room, a genre which I adore. I sat at the bar and ordered my 'beer brat'. With sauerkraut, it's only $5.25. Win! They also had a fairly good selection of craft brews on tap, and mine was cold and delicious. Brat, beer and fries for $12.\n\nThe brat is pre-cooked and then browned in the tiny kitchen just off the bar, and it's always fun to watch food being made (if you're me). They also grill the kraut, a nice touch. It's served on a big, somewhat fluffy sesame seed bun, which seemed like an odd choice, but it worked. The fries are good, too, and the order is huge. I would have sprung for the deservedly popular pub chips and bleu cheese dip, but they were twice the price of the fries. It was a lot of food, and totally satisfying, and I finished every last bite. I think this is a place I can feel comfortable going to alone or with others in the future, and I plan to, often. :-)\n\nNote: cash only.\nFive stars instead of four if only they had a fire grill and not just a flat grill.", "business_id": "KHOHjA8HOcTlFBCtMQFv8A", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-06-22", "type": "review"}

At 2am I still had not received my order. I called to check on the status of my order. At first the employee didn't see an order from me. I told him I ordered online. He then found my name. I was told that two orders from grubhub came in at the same time and that \"he only placed the one order and not yours.\" The individual didn't offer to make my order and get it out to me right away. All he could say was \"I'm sorry\" and it didn't sound very genuine. It sounded more like an \"I'm sorry. I'm not going to do anything to make this better.

After sitting there for ten minutes we were led to a dinig area that was maybe 1/3 full of customers. I was a bit confused on their use of host and hostesess. There was one person taking names, another checking the names, two other standing their alternating taking the diners to their seats in the dated dining room. Christ the only reason we went to this place is because we had a gift card and I'm hoping the gift giver next year makes a better choice. So my wife ordered the fettucini alfredo with Chicken (she has a standard) and I ordered some sort of entre that appeals to men that only eat beef, toss it with some pasta and voila, Dinner!  The humorous moment was when the server asked me how I would like my braised beef done-it's braised, look it up. Anyhow the sauce with it was a cream base, had some portabella mushrooms with it and some fresh parsley (to make it appear fresh) though my entre looked like it has been sitting under the hot lights for a good 10 minutes. The salad we got was marginal (I don't get what the big deal is) and the breadsticks seemed like they'd been sitting in the basket for 10 minutes (not so hot)- While our food  wasn't absolutely horrible, I don't understand why this place is full all the time.

Salad did have pepperoncini peppers, which were a nice touch. The waitress was polite but seemed to be either new or overwhelmed.

After about ten more minutes the waiter showed up with the breadsticks and salad. At that very same time our main entree came out. We sent it back since we had not had our salad or even our appetizers yet. I then ordered another drink. Ten minutes go by while we gnawed on old cold breadsticks and soggy salad still waiting on my drink and our appetizers while intently listening to our waiter recall his hometown antics with the table next to us. Finally the drink and appetizers arrive after about five more minutes, shouldn't have waited for it though The ravioli was cold and chewy, I mean cowhide chewy... Then our main course comes back out.

Half the place is taken up with pool tables, and there is a pretty expansive arcade room with at least 10 different games, as well as TV's everywhere. 1/3 of the building has the bar and restaurant seating - the seating is a 50 foot row of huge booths (good for 8-10 people) across from the equally long bar. Both the booths and bar are deep mahogany, the ceiling is black, and there are only very dim lights over each booth, so it's a rather dark, relaxing atmosphere. Bartender and servers are late-20s age and very charming. None of that rushed, overzealous high school service.\n\nMy partner and I have gone twice at odd times - 1:45 and 3:30pm - so I think we saw the lunch menu both times, which was basic bar food with a couple extra options. Burgers, chicken and fried fish sandwiches, salads, and some appetizers - all ranging $6-8. However, they do have excellent Chicago style hotdogs, which is actually a (weekly?) lunch special. Also have a white pizza with olive oil, mozzarella, fresh garlic and fresh roma tomatoes that's pretty decent - a soft flavor that accentuates the tomatoes more than anything (personally, I love a strong garlic taste, but this was OK). It's even better with grilled chicken, which, by the way, is not some 1/4 inch thick, pinky-long piece of meat. My grilled chicken sandwich was a good couple inches wide and had no trouble covering their generous-sized buns. That goes for all dishes, actually. Huge portions. The turkey club is a 4-inch stack of turkey, bacon and toast with 4 handfuls of fries; carrot cake is a 4-layer, 1/5 of the cake slab of moist cake layered with cream cheese icing and perfectly roasted pecans, carrots, and coconut (good for 4 people). The white chicken chili is another \"extra\" offering that is not spicy, but chocked full of beans, chicken and tomatoes served with sour cream and shredded cheese. The beans were almost crunchy, which signaled they were not cooked long enough, but the soup was still unique and served as a good meal starter.\n\nBasically, relaxed and charming atmosphere with lots of entertainment options for college students, or perfect ambiance for quiet conversation and an American meal. Tons of food for the money.

Pico de gallo and shredded lettuce!  I struggled to put my biases aside, but sure enough, I found the salsa and jelly too sweet for my taste - the whole thing really could have used some more spice.

The suffix \"feel\" was a little generous, I thought.\n\nImagine yourself fumigating in the strong smell of cooking oil, garbage, perfume, and B.O. because that's what you'll get in this poorly ventilated basement.  \n\nThe decor here is what happens when you operate a business for years and stop really seeing what it looks like.  (At least that's the best excuse I can think of.)  Burnt-out lights.  Chipped paint on the walls.  A mysterious traffic light.  \n\nThe furniture was ordered out of a 1970s catalog probably titled: \"Crap Tables and Chairs: Dive Bars and Outdoor Taco Stands Our Specialty.\" Combine that with hopefully-arty-but-not-really-arty framed black and white photography, deep maroon paint and bathroom-grade tile flooring.  So it's more than a basement, it's a partially destroyed bathroom in a basement that's trying too hard.\n\nGiven all this, the $16 entrees on the specials menu were surprising.  One was a taco dish that appeared to be made with that pre-shredded cheese that comes in a bag and Old El Paso store-bought flour tortillas.  The catfish in the catfish sandwich special was good, but the bread was, in a word, unconscionable.  \n\nI came back after a disastrous previous visit because someone told me the specials menu had the good food on it.  Not so.  On the previous visit I had watched them make the blue cheese burger by adding a scoop from a giant plastic tub of gluey industrial blue cheese salad dressing.

Everyone seemed nice, but improbably busy with things that didn't involve customers.

For those who don't know, it's a small restaurant in a space carved out next to the parking garage on Randolph behind Nitaya Thai.  It's in a basement, with no windows, a small bar, and a kitchen that is basically open (you generally walk out smelling like the place).  It's been around for awhile, but when I tell people it's one of my favorite restaurants, I typically get a lot of blank stares.\n\nSome people do know about it though, because it is not uncommon to wait 15 minutes or so for a table (they do not take reservations).  The food is well... American.  They are known for their burgers (incredible), but they have great specials that change often.  I have had elk and rabbit sausage, venison burgers, and really good cuts of fish.  The house salad they usually serve as a side is one of the best around. \n\nThey usually have 4 or so good beers on tap, and the place is very laid back.  Servers are not assigned tables, so you can just flag down anyone when you want a drink or need your check.  Admittedly,  I have had some slow service here, but I am not the type of person to get too upset about it.  The staff are typically on point and friendly, so I feel like that is how they should be judged.\n\nReally great place overall.

The host is funny and they give good prizes: $10 off your bill for winning a round, $50 for winning the night. Pretty generous.\n\nTrivia is a cross between the way Boltini's and Canopy does it. 6 rounds of 10 questions where the host reads the questions and you write the answers down on sheets of paper that you turn in. 6 max per team; you pick your team name. Team names are not as creative as Boltini's nor as vulgar as Canopy, but in time they may be. It is faster and better organized between rounds than the meandering cluster of Boltini's, possibly because the geographic layout, possibly because the skilled an efficient host. There are breaks for bathroom etc. \n\nSo why two stars? The format needs significant tweaking. The first question of each round is worth 1 and the last 10 points. IMO, they should all be worth one since trivia, by nature, is worthless knowledge. Why should some worthless knowledge be more highly prized? Why should one team that gets 9 answers right lose to a team that got only 6 answers right? The #10 question is not necessarily tougher than #1 for everybody, and even so, should missing one question cost a team almost 20% of the points for a 10 question round? This problem is compounded as points rack up for the final calculation. Really, this scoring makes the night about luck: if you know the bigger point questions, or do really well in a particular category, you will win, even if you get less ?s right.\n\nAlso, the strict adherence to narrow categories doesn't work. A good category might be 'ancient history', but not 'the 2nd Punic war'. The time I went, there were 10 name that hair metal band from listening to a clip and 10 questions about former World Cup champions and host countries. Unless you had a really deep knowledge (10 point question: name every single team to ever win the World Cup) of both these somewhat arcane topics, you are basically screwed out of competing for the overall prize.\n\nLastly, I ordered the gazpacho. It was bad. It was really just pico de gallo with more cucumbers.

The catch, though, is you don't get your money back for a few days.  I'm still out $20 to them, three days later.

I don't dance, but I've been there plenty of times for food or for the Sunday-night trivia. I'll get my biggest complaint out of the way first: their kitchen is closed during the winter. What the hell? I understand why their beer garden isn't open during the winter, but the kitchen!? At least they're okay with you bringing your own food for that part of the year. When the kitchen *is* open their menu is Mexican with a couple of tweaks, and I've enjoyed everything I've had to eat there. The liquor and beer selection is about average for Champaign. The beer garden outside is pleasant; it's closed during the winter but on cool fall nights they set up space heaters so you can stay fairly comfortable.\n\nI went to Cowboy Monkey for Big Dave's Trivia Night every Sunday for a long time. Trivia officially started at 7, with Dave usually getting there around 7:15 and the thing actually starting at 7:30. On trivia night the place was packed, though, and you had to be there by 6:30 at the latest if you wanted a seat.\n\nThe bar has a pretty limited amount of seating, and they don't seem to know how to use it. There were multiple occasions when we found an empty table in the bar but there were no chairs, so either we'd stand the whole time or we'd have to wait thirty minutes for one of the bartenders to go grab some chairs from Guido's (which I believe has the same owners). We got there one week and the inside and beer garden were both full, but there was an empty table outside with some patio chairs stacked up nearby; the guy working told us that he wouldn't set up the chairs for us because he didn't have enough servers working. We offered to go inside to the bar when we wanted drinks, but he still said no. Some weird management decisions at this place.\n\nAs long as I'm griping, I want to mention the bathrooms. The locks on the doors were always broken, making it seem like the restrooms were intended for multiple people--they weren't. This became clear after you washed your hands and realized that the paper-towel dispenser was located above the urinal some guy was currently using. Fix your locks, cheapskates.\n\nDuring the summer this is a nice place to sit outside and have dinner and drinks. If you can't find a table, though, don't sweat it; just walk to one of the many other good bars in downtown Champaign. We started going to the Tuesday-night trivia at Jupiter's at the Crossing, which is run by the same guy but which offers year-round food and unlimited seating.", "business_id": "mJxu0USvbwSHcGsmwWh22A", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-07-17", "type": "review"}

My suggestion would be getting there around 6:30 or 6:45 because Trivia lasts until 10 and 3 hours is a long time to sit at one restaurant. The rounds are weighted from very easy to impossible. Some of the general knowledge trivia  is so random. There is no way you can really study for trivia.

The combination of guac, salsa, and cheese was pleasing to the taste buds. However, the chips tasted a little old and the cheese outweighed the other ingredients, masking the other flavors.

We politely and discreetly asked her to bring wine out with or right before food and I think that ticked her \noff. After that, she was aloof, barely explained the wine or the dishes we were being served. Water was slow to be refilled. The real kicker was the 20% automatic gratuity she added after tax on our bill! When we asked to speak to the manager, she told us \" he's busy dining with a client\". Say what??? I believe your customers are your priority! We asked a different waiter to see if he could find the manager and low and behold, out he came!  Tainted our experience and maybe our waitress was just having a bad day but when you are dropping that kind of money on dinner- you had better train your wait staff on how to properly serve and deal with customers.

It is connected to Club Downtown which has two other floors that play latin pop/rock/hip hop and reggaeton. The cover is $10. They are open til at least 3 am (and the other floors stay open even later I think) so that is an advantage over the clubs that close at 2pm. To get to the Palazzo floor, you go in through Club Downtown's main entrance and then go out on the front patio and then back in to Palazzo's dance floor. Ask if you get lost and the security or bartenders will point you there. I like the size of the floor, which is tile. It is not as hot and crowded as other salsa places like Pepins on Saturday. Drinks vary from great to weak (mainly the mixed drinks) depending on the bartender, they do have specials sometimes. As a long time salsa dancer who goes with friends (male and female) but no set partner for the night, it can be hard to find a good salsa dancer here if  you don't already know one. So salseros/salsaholics if you will be going without a partner you might want to try to find at least one good dancer to go with you so you will have fun.  Or if you look on www.azsalsa.net or www.meetup.com (check for Scottsdale or Phoenix salsa groups) there are plenty of socials and lessons where you can meet others if you are new and want to meet other dancers or go out with a group. The music is good but since I go a lot,  I start to hear the same songs over and over. I think they should bring in different djs, rotate them or make sure the music gets mixed up to keep people coming back.  Also note there is a strict dress code - it is posted outside. I know several guys who had to go back home to change cause they couldn't get in. I don't remember all the specifics but I believe some things to note are no hats/sunglasses, tennis shoes, tee shirts, baggy pants, bandanas, etc. I'd say collared shirt (tucked in), nice slacks/pants and shoes and you'd be okay.

First I totally agree with previous reviews that complain about the location of the TVs. They are in such awkward spots and are only tuned to like two different things, which is semi-annoying. However I can't complain too much when one of them is tuned to Sportscenter which is all I really need as I eat my lunch. My major complaint about Majerle's is that it is a very awkward space. There is a hostess stand out front on the sidewalk but no one is ever there, so you have to walk in and then BAM you are like on top of the bar. So you're in the way while waiting for a hostess which I hate.\n\nOther than that main complaint, I'm not going to hate too much on the food. It's a freaking sports bar. They serve sports bar food. I am not expecting five star cuisine...I just fried goodness that will clog up my ateries and beer on tap. If they have a salad or two so I can feel better about myself, great. For the most part everything I have tried has been good, including the potato skins, grilled chicken caesar wrap, fried chicken salad, kids grilled cheese meal (hey I wasn't hungry that day!) and the house salad. The french fries are really good especially dipped in ranch. The only thing I didn't really like that I have tried has been the chicken tenders. Something about them was just a bit off to me.  Prices are decent considering the proximity to US Airways Arena and Chase Field.\n\nOverall a good lunch spot to grab a beer and get my sports fix, but not somewhere that warrants a special trip. I'll have to check it out before a game sometime to get the full effect.", "business_id": "45puCRQ6Vh_IIAy7kkfFDQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-06-06", "type": "review"}

First of all, it was July and for people like us who live in Arizona, the heat is here to stay and we learn to deal with it. However, for visitors from all around, the 110 degree weather means that they will not eat outside. So we had the choice to wait for an indoor table or take the patio seating that had immediate seating -- and I mean, every seat was available on the patio. The hostess looked at us like we were crazy as we took the patio and we proceeded to order food. Now, contrary to common belief, just because a sports bar is named after an athlete, doesn't mean that athlete frequents there every day. But on this particular day, Dan Marjele happened to walk into Marjeles. The irony cracked us up because we knew that the out of towners probably assumed this is a regular occurrence. And hey, maybe it is! \n\nAnyway, this is the perfect bar to grab a quick and decent bite to eat before a sporting event downtown. The buffalo chicken is delicious, as is the Chicken Teriyaki sandwich and any other wrap on the menu. It's one or two notches above generic bar food and the drinks also flow nicely. They have plenty of TVs inside so even if you don't go to the game, it's still a fun atmosphere to sit and watch the game on the TV. \n\nI wouldn't drive to Downtown Phoenix just to visit Marjeles, but this is definitely one of my choices when I'm looking for a sports bar before or after the game in Downtown Phoenix.", "business_id": "45puCRQ6Vh_IIAy7kkfFDQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-08-11", "type": "review"}

We waited for over 45 minutes for our COLD food to arrive, only after we asked the bartender where our food was.  Your manager walked over with our ticket and said \" I see you've been waiting for over 45 minutes for your food\" When we responded that we had never waited that long, she replied \" well we're busy and short-handed\" There was no upfront apology to the fact that our food was late, making us in turn late for the game.  Your bartender is not a pleasant person as she would ask what we wanted and not wait for the answer before turning and getting another customer a drink.  Unfortunately, we were seated behind one of the beer taps to begin the afternoon and seemed to be forgotten as we sat with empty glasses.  We did NOT demand to speak to the owner.  He had said hello about 20 min earlier and when the manager came over, my mom asked to speak to the owner.  She said he's not working today, and my mom replied,\" I just saw him\", your manager then said \" I'll go get the owner for you.\" There was no demanding there.  Also please learn to read before posting replies as I stated the owner BASICALLY said to shut up and stop whining.  The way he spoke to us is the reason why we would never come back.  Also you posted in my mom's review that our food and drinks were comped.  We sent the food back as it was cold, so it wasn't comped, and we only had 3 beers between the two of us, the last two were just poured and left undranken.

Even then the place was packed and we promtly order some food. Warning to the wise if your hungry do not order a pizza! The guy who took our order never happened to mention that the rest of our party of 8 we all be finished with their plates long before our pizza would even arrive.

Wood paneling, that weird color orange, and a little bit of tackiness thrown in for good measure.  So far, when eating here, I have had good experiences.  The girls are nice, the place is clean, and service seems to be prompt and efficient.  I usually can be found here during lunch hour only, and so far, those have been my only experiences.  No happy hour, no dinner, no weekend service.\n\nMy only \"complaint\" is that I have carried out a few times from this location.  A handful of times, I felt like I have had terribly slow carry out service. Waiting forever for someone to take my order, waiting just as long for food, and feeling \"less important\" then maybe the dine in patrons.", "business_id": "qsWxbgQwuomXvMseg23DGg", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-06-02", "type": "review"}

In any other eating place I could care less about appearances and focus on cleanliness and friendliness of our server. But this is after all...Hooters.\n\nThe uniforms are mentioned in another review and this is what caught my eye as well. Shorts either baggy or just not flattering to the shape that is squeezed into them. Runs in panty hose...very tacky...and the tank tops were dingy.\n\nThere was only one cute girl that was serving and the hostess was adorable. The rest were frightening. One girl's face was peeling from what looked to be a horrible sunburn...it was so disturbing. Our waitress had acne all over her face and chest...very unappetizing.

As most should know by now the food here is one cut above average at best, my nephew once found remnants of a feather in his wings! TASTY DUH!

All three times our waitress was rude and largely absent.  I'll add that we are really not into the whole TnA aspect of this restaurant, and treat our waitress like any other waitress.  No ogling, no rude comments, none of that immature bullshit.\n\nWe went here last night from 7pm until a little after 10pm, and didn't get a refill on water until just before we left, even though I'd downed the first cup within ten minutes of arriving and also ordered \"hot\" wings (the Daytona, which is hot sauce and bbq sauce mixed together, I guess.  Not hot at all).  The wings are tiny and completely overcooked.  I do not recommend these at all.\n\nFriend #1 ordered the boneless wings, which are a joke.  I ordered them last time and assumed it was just a fluke when they brought out a plate of ten tiny (smaller than Chicken McNuggets) hardened pieces of overcooked chicken.  I'm not the type to send things back at restaurants, so I just tried to pretend that I was eating some sort of food, and not little pieces of rubber.  However, Friend #1 received the same thing this time.  Tiny pieces of very chewy....chicken?  Maybe.  I do not recommend these at all.\n\nFriend #2 ordered a dozen hot wings.  Took just shy of an hour for them to arrive.  The waitress would pop up every fifteen minutes or so, and say something like, \"Oh my gosh, they haven't brought those yet?\"  When they did come out, they were tiny and overcooked, and also quite cold.  I do not recommend these at all.\n\nOverall, the worst restaurant in Phoenix, I think.  If they didn't offer the fight with no cover, they'd have literally no redeeming value.  I'm just going to Buffalo Wild Wings next time (they have a $5 cover and a drink minimum, but it has to be worth it).  This place needs to close down for a few months and reevaluate, or just go away entirely, like every other business in the AZ Center.\n\nOh, PS, they have never brought out our correct bill.  Always has a bunch of random crap that no one ordered on it, and the girls act all put out when we point out that no one ordered half of the bill that they're trying to charge us for.

There hasn't been a time where I have had a bad experience here. The food has always been on point, customer service was not bad, and really nothing to complain about. I've always ordered the medium/hot wings along with the curly fries with cheese and a side salad. I've brought friends with me on several occasions, and they never had anything negative to say.\n\nIt's been a month or so that I've been here and decided to try the take out. Same order same expectations. Now I know every business will have their bad days but this is the first time here that has probably made me decide I will not return.\nI open the to go boxes and let's just say I was surprised. The fries looked extremely dull and I picked one up to try it; cold. Cold, dull fries that had an old taste to them. Not like they were sitting around but old as if they were out for a long time. Super soggy and just absolutely terrible. The wings were undercooked and the hot sauce that I usually get tasted bland and cold. It was as if they just battered them up with canned sauce. No flavor, and not the amazing wings I usually get there. I am thinking is this really the place I talk so good about?\nI read the negative reviews thinking this is not true. I now believe the \"hype\" regarding the issues they are having here. It's amazing how down under it has gotten since I've last been here. It's not like the food was waiting for a long time, I got there before it was even ready.\n\nHonestly, I am extremely disappointed. The manager was not much help and that just comes to show how down under this business is heading to. I don't know what else to say, 30$ that has gone to waste. Ate a few of the fries and maybe half of a wing that was disgusting.\n\nTo simply put it, it is very unlikely that I will return anytime soon.

Its hard to believe that I'm downgrading them now that they have liquor available, but it's happening. \n\nThey normally have local draft brews at this place for 2 dollars, but apparently when they have a show they don't sell it at all. Only bottles for 3 or 4 dollars. What's worse is that every bottle I ordered wasn't cold, tasted like they just threw it in the ice bin 30 minutes before. AND they kept running out of beers. What's even worse is that the mixed drinks run 6 DOLLARS for a really tiny glass. This place needs to get its act together. I'll be drinking beforehand and elsewhere in between sets from now on. I don't get why the music venues in Phoenix don't understand how much more money they can make at a show with drink specials.\n\nThey also apparently haven't invested in air conditioning which makes summer shows not even worth it. Okkervil River still put on a great show to my surprise, which is the only thing (along with the other great shows i've seen there) that kept me downgrading this place to 3 stars or lower.\n\nThey are also in the middle of remodeling so the place looks kindof like crap right now.", "business_id": "4WcxnNv_lzCIG2eb8O5Mlg", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-07-26", "type": "review"}

Downtown following another amazing Mercury victory.  Hungry.  Group includes toddler. We'd like to walk to food but it's warm so we can't walk far.  It's sad how few options actually presented themselves.  We tried Coach and Willy's first, but as of 6:10 their kitchen was closed.  So, we were led back to Hard Rock Cafe.\n\nI've been here several times after games and all for the same reasons.  It's close. We didn't feel like parking again. The food is ok.  Think Apple-bee's for a few bucks more.

We asked what food we could order to ensure that it would be fast.  To his credit he checked in the kitchen.  After immediately ordering a sandwich and salad, the food arrived 5 minutes before we were supposed to walk out the door with no apology (and a server who hid from us for most of that time). We were 15 minutes late leaving just trying to get to-go containers and our bill.  \n\nThis time - our service was actually wonderful.  Our server was great.  Happy, conversational, refilled drinks much more than usual though the place was quite busy with post-game activity.  The problem came when she had to leave to move her car. You see, with D-Back and Merc games, parking was expensive and full so she had to park several blocks away where the gate closed promptly at 8pm, which we totally understood.

Well, after flagging down a hostess, a bus boy and another server who all said they would look for the manager, and we did see them scurrying around looking for the manager, it took 25 minutes to find her and have her walk over to the table.  That's 25 extra minutes with a toddler who was getting tired. How much did we love that? Finally, as our waitress walked back into the building 30 minutes after she left, we were finally paying our bill and leaving the table.  She was so apologetic.   She was wonderful.  The fact that we heard from several folks there that waiting 20 minutes to FIND the manager was not out of the norm was scary. \n\nThey have such an amazing location in the heart of the action after events.  Their food is decent enough that I'd be willing to grab something there again purely for convenience if only I knew what to expect when it came to the service.

It was a Monday, and there were only two other couples there, so it was nice and quiet. The ambience is relaxed and warm, and our server was attentive and informative, but not smothering.\n\nWe started with a three-cheese plate. They have a long list of cheese varieties from which to choose. We got the Truffle Tremor (goat), Abbaye (Sheep) and Three Sisters of Serena (cow). It comes with baguette slices, pear slices, strawberries, grapes, dried cranberries, almonds, and a delicious candied-syruppy-dried-fruit-and-nut combination.\n\nI ordered the duck for my entree, and it was superb. The duck breast was excellent, but the best part was the blue-cheese-potato croquette and the diced mango and poblano relish. I could have licked my plate. \n\nWe were too full for dessert, but they looked great.\n\nI loved that you can order half-glasses of wine. It gave me a chance to taste a couple of different kinds without a)breaking the bank, and b)getting so sloshed that I couldn't drive home.\n\nI enjoyed everything about my experience here. The only drawback to the entire meal was that the server told us that the mac-and-cheese plate was big enough for a meal, but when it came, it was actually pretty small (perfect size for a starter). Husband insisted that it was just enough, but I would have preferred he have a bigger main course. But I digress.\n\nExpect to pay upwards of $50/person if you go all out and order wine, starters, and entrees, but this could easily be an affordable dinner at happy hour or if you just get a few starter plates to share. The portions are adequate, but not really big enough to take home leftovers.\n\nI can't wait to go back to sample some more wine and cheese!", "business_id": "muCl5p-9ut1sY0aKeUeRhw", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-06-02", "type": "review"}

Ken Cheuvront is extremely knowledgeable and has travelled to most of the places where the cheese is made and has personally met most of the cheese makers.

At least the outside and inside exterior merited one star. What a waste of 90 minutes of my life. \n\nI have been in the food industry on and off for several years, nationally and internationally. I have been in both managerial roles as well as a server. I also worked as an assistant food editor for Cuisine Magazine in New Zealand. \n\nI was excited to try Cheuvronts as it supposedly had received accolades years before. This was absouletly not only one the worst meals I have ever eaten, but also, the reason I joined YELP. Whenever I experience substandard service or food, I attempt to speak to the manager or chef in order to give them my concerns, in order for them to thoughtfully consider my critiques. In this instance, when I attempted to voice my concerns, I was met with an inept and apathetic attitude from a manager who was skilled at giving excuses and apathy versus solutions. \n\nI am happy to explain my meal in detail. Firstly, one of my pet peeves is when you are seated to a table and a server asks you what you would like to drink as you are being handed the menu. REALLY? This is a \"wine bar\". Am I supposed to know every wine and which one I would like before viewing the menu? Or would you like me to just order a water???? \n\nWhen I stated to the waitress that I would like to view the menu before deciding on wine or a cocktail, she asked if I wanted water, to which I felt compelled to accept as I was being prompted to comply with ordering at least something before my bottom hit the chair. At this point, my niece and I were given waters before the waitress disappeared to continue her conversation with a patron at the bar. \n\nApproximately 12 minutes later (being an ex food critic, restaurateur, server, etc...I notice such things as time) I tracked down another server (where was he hiding?) and asked if he would mind taking our order. As the menu looked appetizing, I asked for recommendations. (Something I relished doing for my customers,but hey, that is just me). He annoyingly responded that he could not recommend anything, it depended on what I liked (really, wow Einstein. Does your chef not have a specialty? Is there not anything you are aware of that is commonly ordered? Are you not aware of your customers comments regarding their meal? Do you not eat there? What do you like to eat? HOW DO YOU NOT KNOW?) \n\nCurious, I asked the server about the Muffalata sandwich, which I have had in New Orleans and enjoyed... for its abundance of meats and lovely olive spread which soaks into its bread. On the menu, it specified 3 meats, provolone, olive spread and pepper-dews. The server had no comment, only to say it was a new item on the menu which people had ordered. It was $9.50. Thinking it was perhaps popular, I ordered it along with a fillet blue cheese salad, which I ordered medium rare ($12.00.) Of notable mention was a basil sangria, $8.00...the only thing I enjoyed besides the decor. \n\nIt took 17 minutes to get our lunch, and the steak was well done. I promptly gave this to our waitress who sent it back to the kitchen. My niece and I then attempted to eat the muffalata sandwich, which Sheriff Joe Arpaio could serve in the jail, as it probably cost only a fraction more than the bologna Ladmo sandwich's he serves in Tent City. The sandwich consisted of one piece of salami, a piece of prosciutto, half a piece of provolone and a smattering of olive spread (not tempanade) on stale dry foccaccia bread. The bread was so stale, we could not eat it, and besides, with the poverty of filling, we wanted our meat (where was the peppedews?). The bread was brick like and more suited to being a construction material versus a food item. \n\nI asked our waitress if we could please speak to a manager, to which she sent over the unhelpful server from previously. I explained I wanted to pass along my comments as it was better that someone told the chef and owner versus going on YELP. He offered nothing but excuses and more apathy...stating he did not know what was going on in the kitchen (as manager shouldn't you KNOW????????) further stating he only manages the lunch hour every 5 weeks (excuses are not professional)! He offered me no solutions, care or even concern....instead he acted as if he was put out and equipped to deal with critiques. \n\nSoon after our medium (still not medium rare) 2 oz fillet (really for $12.00?) appeared on the salad and I no more portioned out a spoonful on my plate when the waitress asked if I was finished and if she could remove my salad. I am sorry but there was no napkin in my plate, my silverware were not placed to indicate I had finished and there was still a full (small and expensively overpriced) portion of salad left. What would indicate I was done??? Hello? \n\nAt the end of the meal, I noticed our salad was removed off of the bill, but I am sorry, this was not good enough! I will NEVER go back again.", "business_id": "muCl5p-9ut1sY0aKeUeRhw", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-07-21", "type": "review"}

I have grown weary of all the so called wine bars around that boast more college students and second rate wines than actual good ones. I've been meaning to try this place for awhile. It feels super fancy but you can show up casual. When I walked in I felt overwhelmed ( in a good way ) about the great selection of cheeses and wines. You can also get champagne by the glass! Real champagne from France. I felt silly trying to pronounce all the names of the different cheeses and such. Good for them. It's about time my know it all butt was put in her place. I ordered a glass of sparkling white wine called Gruet Brut from New Mexico. Light, airy, refreshing and paired really well with the Abbaye de bellocq. This is a french cheese that was creamy and practically melted in my mouth. To top it off I had one of the best martinis of my life. A chocolate martini. Just imagine: Godiva liqueur, FRESH mint and actual little rounds of chocolate in the glass so you had a reward for finishing. Two complaints: first is what is up with the bathroom? I found it slightly confusing and hot as cuss in there. That should definitely be fixed. Second: according to yelp happy hour started at 9pm but when I arrived i was told that it didn't start til 10pm! I even showed them the yelp announcement.

I'll be honest, I love my wine and I love my cheese. Bonus points if its melted over mac.\n\nAnd they do great mac and cheese.

I'll be honest, I'm no connoisseur, but they had a moscato from Israel that the bf still drools over. It's enough that the next time I was there I picked up a whole bottle, just for him. I've also had one of their mojitos and that was great as well.\n\nAs a note- if you're in for happy hour and get a cheese plate... I really do think its better to splurge and get a regular cheese plate. I got a happy hour cheese plate, and it's... miniscule.

Other than that, the ambiance is nice- but no panties dropped on this date.\n\nThe service was good, and the waiter seemed like a nice guy and was polite. The wine I ordered was pretty good as well, but when I asked my server about 2 different wines, he didn't seem to know how to describe their nuances very well. It was more like- this one tastes good that one tastes better. Well, thanks for that articulate recap... blind leading the blind.\n\nWe ordered some bruschetta- Not good. The fig was way too sweet. It tasted like overly sweet fig jam had been used. When I've ordered this dish in restaurants before- it has come with fresh fig, and for the price- that's what I expected. They could at least put that in the description, because I wouldn't have ordered this if I had known. I choked it down to be polite to my date. It may have been more edible if there was actually some brie on it to counter the insane sweetness. All I could find was a little smear of brie rind, but no actual cheese. If it's brie and fig- put some brie on it.\n\nThe bread used for the bruschetta is very thick- as far as bread is concerned, it does taste good, but it is so thick that each bite of the bruschetta is incredibly dry and I  just felt awful after eating it- too much bread for an app. The other bruschetta we tried was ok. I can't even remember what it was, maybe it had red pepper and goat cheese... it wasn't memorable at all, but compared to the fig one that actually was hurting my teeth due to the sugar level- it was a welcome palate cleanser.\n\nMy date also ordered the cheese plate (cheese on cheese- what was he thinking?). The cheeses were good, but I've had better and more interesting selections. I love cheese! I used to visit my local cheese counter everyday in LA- I have little reservations. It would've been nice to see some Cypress Grove selections, or Sea Stack or Epoisses or Barely Buzzed... something actually interesting- maybe less mild. Phoenix demo may not be into that though.\n\nI guess the point is, it's okay, but I've had better.

Often, celebrity-themed restarants have much to be desired on the food front -- overpriced for what you get -- but we were pleasantly surprised. \n\nOnce in a while the classic rock music background is punctuated by a ringing school bell and everyone shouts \"The Big Unit!\" which signals that someone has ordered the signature monster hot dog as featured on Man vs. Food on the Travel Channel.\n\nOverall a fun good time.

My 1st thought,,ooohhh yummy getting BBQ!!!! Everyone from the valley knows Copperstown gets down on BBQ, regardless if you're a rock n rock fan or not.  So I said let's roll!! \n\nOne of the things that Copperstown boast is that it's a one-of-a-kind sports bar, when we walked in I 1st thought eh Hard Rock Caf\u00e9 feeling,,,the guitars  on the wall, other rock banks & Alice's memorabilia on the walls and a store for those would like to buy Copperstown related items (sounds like Hard Rock right?). So that one of the kind feeling was lost on me but he does also have sport related memorabilia hanging on the walls as well and I have to say I was digging the blue glass behind the bar.\n\n All the staff has the \"Alice Eyes\" which I though was kinda cool, our waiter was very nice and friendly, when we got to Copperstown I checked in on Facebook and got 10% off our bill, which I thought was pretty cool too.  \n\nThe menu items are named after people, and I did catch a glance of the \"Big Unit\" hot dog, yes it is 22 inches, if I was with  a bigger party I wouldn't mind trying it, it looks loaded with everything and its 18 bucks, but if you split that between 3 or 4, that's really not bad,,,unless you're the type that can eat the entire dog, Im a Man Vs Food fan and I know Adam had his turn with the Big Unit,,,but anyways back to my trip to Coopertowns.  \n\nSo after scanning the menu, I was ready to try one of the bbq sandwiches, because it said messy but good , and I'm all about a messy bbq. I ordered the Gonzo's BBQ Beef which is beef brisket that had been slow smoked all day then shredded & tossed with bbq sauce and the sides were the nightmare chili and fries. I noticed they had drink specials so I ordered a drink or 2 lol. \n\nWhen I ordered I asked the waiter if the chili was spicy hot, he said yes, because something called nightmare chili gotta hurt right?? And I'm a fan of heat, so bring it on! Well sorry to disappoint yall, it hot at all, and maybe the name nightmare is from one of Alice's song and not for the heat it could have had, it but it was very favorable with a smoky taste to it, I wasn't let down by the absence of heat because I did enjoy the chili, in fact I wish I had more of it. Ok now the fries, I wasn't too keen on the fries they were deep fried and like had been dipped in batter or something because it had little nuggets on them, but cover them in bbq sauce and it's all ok, but I'll try the slaw next time. \n\nThe sandwich which I had been yearning for since ordering it came and I removed the top bun and expected to see a saucy meat mess and was let down I saw shredded beef and little sauce,,,,how is this messy? But the beef tasted so dang good; I just asked the waiter for more bbq sauce and got messy! Over all my experience at Cooperstown was enjoyable, was watching the NBA playoffs on all the screens except 2 screens had the Diamondback game on, the staff was friendly and fun and that right their makes a place Great!

It is so big that it can serve for dinner tonight and lunch tomorrow.  Plus it makes for a good story latter.  If you get it ask to have the toppings on the side that way you only put one those that you want.

St. Louis cut pork ribs smothered in dry rub and slow smoked to perfection, then lightly sauced with Cattlemen's BBQ sauce, and flashed on the flame broiler.\"\n\nI was hungry and came in about 20 minutes before close and was waited on by Matt.  I ordered ice tea and asked Matt if the ribs had been cooked recent or a long time ago and reheated.  And told him that if it was the latter that I wouldn't be having them.  He said he would ask the chef, came back and proceeded to say \"the bartender had them and said they were good\".  Hmmmm, that wasn't what I asked, but noted his answer in my mind and proceeded to order......Yes the ribs with two sides.\n\nThe food comes and it was exactly what I was afraid of, Ribs that had been boiled, then cooked in a oven and braised in marginal bbq sauce.  I ate them and it filled my stomach.  When he came by with the check, he asked \"so how were the ribs\".  I made him go get a menu and read the above quote. And then nicely without being a jerk told him that the establishment was falsely advertising the ribs.  I explained that I have smoked all meats in a wood fired barrel smoker for over 20 years and I would welcome the opportunity to go in the back and see where the ribs were slow smoked, if what I was saying was wrong.  I also explained that I had been out of tea for 10 minutes and I was a big boy and could handle the truth of how old the ribs were.  He then said that he didn't know how old they were.  Then without apologizing, asked how I was going to pay?  Really?????\n\nThe check was $20.45, and Matt got NO tip.  I had breakfast yesterday at a very popular, very busy establishment...No Relation....Matts BB, Great service and added a $5 tip to a $13 bill...no I'm not a cheapskate.\n\nI would welcome a management response to the ribs and the service!!!!!!\n\nSean Gast", "business_id": "oCA2OZcd_Jo_ggVmUx3WVw", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-06-05", "type": "review"}

I just began going to the Symphony on a general basis this year...already three times! All have been a great experience, and now I will pass off to you what I think about the Phoenix Symphony...\n\n~What To Do~\nListen to sweet sweet music. The business model for the symphony is interesting. I want to quickly point out in this section that they hold concerts at numerous venues in the valley, the prime and good 80% of them being at Symphony Hall. The variety of performances is fresh, not too much of either genre or historical music eras.\n\n~The Good~\n They offer other types of events that you simply don't expect. I saw South Pacific in both a significantly stripped down play format, accompanied by the Symphony itself, was truly exciting to see such a different performance. It makes me into a real music buff, and I truly enjoy sitting back and listening to the great vibes and sounds these amazing musicians provide. The site itself is very pretty and classically done up, and as always, the location is perfectly situated right by numerous restaurants you can stop by at. But once again, before I go further, they are a complete symphony offering all the different types of music, including newer acts which you would usually see in other formats. Its comprehensive music viewing!\n\n~The Bad~\nNot too much. The prices are as is, can't whine about them when the music is top notch quality. They have to make their money somehow. But being as is, prices do scare me away a bit. That's OK. The drink stations are also a bit expensive, and they barely give you anything. I always thought they could extend the food options further to light o'dourves and such...nothing too much. Honestly I am being picky at this point, really not much to be upset about.\n\n~The Down Low~\nIf you are interested in having a sweet date night or simply looking to tickle your eardrums with outstanding ear vibes, come here. Its a chance to get dressed up as well. They get 4 stars for variety of acts, a wonderful facility, proximity to restaurants, and the unique special events they put on.

When I met my fiancee I was more excited to come and see his mentor, John Ebinger the bassist. I was lucky enough to watch Michael Christie before he left his tenure with the Phoenix Symphony Orchestra. We were very lucky to have him for eight years. I cannot recommend highly enough the Pops series for a bit of fun with the family or friends. The orchestra plays almost 200 concerts every year, so there is always a ton of concerts to choose from. They offer a regular series of Classics, Symphony Pops, Chamber Orchestra, and Family offerings. They also celebrate the holidays with special events and community celebrations. \n\nI get tickets for free from my honors program, but they offer a college club program where you can attend unlimited Classic concerts for only $30! They also offer a special price of $11.50 one hour prior to performance (excludes special event/family concerts) for students with ID, and 25% off for seniors. Teachers get 50% off any ticket! Yay!\n\nDress: This is America so you can pretty much do what you want in terms of dress, however, I prefer to dress formally when I go to the symphony, it makes the experience for me. You can dress business casual and feel quite comfortable, though I usually notice that people dress up when they come (conservatively, not Jennifer Lopez navel baring, Versace dress wearing). \n\nWhen to clap: look at the conductor's arms, are they down? Good, more than likely the piece is over and you may clap your little heart out. It's always amusing to see people go crazy in the middle of a piece. Woooo! You conduct you little conductee!\n\nCome ahead of time to attend the pre-concert chats before every Symphony Classics, and Coffee Classics concerts, where members of the audience get to interview guest artists, and members of the orchestra! Allow time for parking, the main entrance and will-call window is located on the West side of the building. \n\nThey have a full bar, including coffee and tea if you choose to imbibe before, during, or after the concert.

We had a one-hour wait at Bianco's, and as I walked over with my friend, I said, let's check this place out, but if every drink on the menu is $10 we'll just go across the street to Rose and Crown. \nThankfully, draft beers were about $5 and they had a good selection of local brews (Four Peaks) and imports (Stella). The wine selection had plenty of bottles but only a few options by the glass. They had apps too, that ranged from $5 to $15. We ordered the Goat Cheese Crostini ($5), which ended up being a rather small piece of toast but with a handful of black and green olives on the plate too. We split it between four girls and it was just enough to give us a taste without ruining our appetite for the delicious pizza to come. Though no silverware or plates came out with the app -- so we each had to really man-handle that piece to break off a bite. We all know each other quite well but would sure have been awkward on a date or with acquaintances. \nService was so-so.

Though I'd probably end up with a few extra pounds to go with my empty bank account.  But every day when they post their daily special up on their Facebook page, I just sit and drool over it.  I've eaten here a handful of times and everything is so freaking good.  Its comfort food at its best.  And the staff is super friendly and helpful.  They treat you like a regular even if its your first time.  I love the fact that they source all their ingredients from local farmers and purveyors.  I initially thought the prices were a bit on the high side, but once I realized just how well the locally sourced ingredients were prepared, I now feel like its a bargain.  And I also love that they are open until midnight every day (except Monday).  This is just the coolest little place to grab some great food, a good drink, and chill with really friendly people.  I hope this place is around for a very long time.", "business_id": "tb24fvNJfHhyKEXkKn12Xw", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-07-24", "type": "review"}

As for seating there are two options either outside on their \"patio\" (felt like someones front yard with chairs) or inside which gave you more of an old school dining car feel. I ordered there PB + B burger and my husband had their shrimp Po'boy special. I had heard eating Peanut butter on your burger was good so of course I had to give it a try. I must say it was a bit odd but very good, the burger was very juicy and flavorful, the bacon and cheese gave it that salty taste that went great along side the crunchy peanut butter. I would say it probably isn't for everyone and fair warning it is very heavy on the stomach... about half way through it just hits you and realize just how full you are lol. My husband's Shrimp Po'Boy was very good, the bread was super fresh and the tomato base spread gave it amazing flavor, I would say it was more of a \"Prawn\" Po'boy because the shrimp were so big. Overall the food was very good, I am a bit skeptical about the outdoor seating it was just a little too weird for me, I would definitely go back but would prefer to sit inside if there is room. I hope they continue to do well and maybe they'll be able to expand.", "business_id": "tb24fvNJfHhyKEXkKn12Xw", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-07-26", "type": "review"}

The menu is good ol' Southern comfort food with a twist; they have Deep Eddy alcohol's and they make amazing homemade lemonade...well it's a little page right out of the South (Austin, TX to be exact).  We need more places like this.  \n\nThey have a vegan po-boy sandwich with fried avocado that I could eat everyday, it's just that good.  They use the freshest veggies, no really, so fresh that it was probably picked that very day from the Garfield community garden.  That's right, fresh AND local.  I also can't get enough of those delicious collard greens!  I was impressed with the staff because they knew exactly what was vegan (right down to which bread I could eat).  Any time I find a staff educated about ingredients, it's a win.  And anytime I have gone with my non-veg friends they rave about the menu as well, so I think it is safe to say that it is all yummy.\n\nAll in all, this place is simply adorable, quaint, fun and delicious.  It is small inside so if you can get in there, I highly recommend it.  The staff is very friendly and attentive which makes for an even better dinning experience.  There are also plenty of seats outside and a to-go window which makes it even easier.

This is one of the first places I drag out-of-towners... usually for brunch. And when I have brunch at Welcome Diner, I usually cannot resist ordering the same thing, the Holy Puerco. Pulled pork, cheesy grit cake, pure heaven.\n\nThe best thing about this place, especially if you get one of the rare seats inside the luncheonette, is that it feels like you own the place. The staff cooking and carrying on are an arm's length away. I love the communal \"Hurricane!\" cheer that resounds whenever somebody orders one of these fresh-squeezed fruit cocktails. Welcome Diner is one of those places that the ambiance overwhelms you so suddenly that you are drawn in to the fun atmosphere... and though you may not be a morning drinker, you can easily be convinced that it's time for a beer or cocktail with breakfast.\n\nI can't say enough about the wonderful poutine here. Other places may just smother their fries in brown gravy, but this place used the white breakfast sausage gravy. Although the cheese curds get a little lost, this is a great way to eat poutine! I also like their choice of either sausage gravy or mushroom gravy if you order the biscuits and gravy (or, do half-and-half, if you must).\n\nThe crowd that dines here is cool, the staff is righteous, and the food is spot on. If you want something funky and delicious and scratch-made, you would do well to pound a path to this wiggity-wack little diner in the middle of a dusty old Phoenix neighborhood.

Probably my new favorite summer whiskey drink! Also to die for is the bumblebee, imagine an amazing chicken sandwich on a top notch biscuit drizzled with honey. Yum! I'm full as I write this waiting on beignets that were comped because our side of fries didn't make it out, but I could eat a bumblebee because it's that good.

However, the food is AMAZING. We came here on a Friday night at around 7 and it was decently busy. The thing about this restaurant is they make you tip before you get your food. I made the mistake of tipping 17%. While the food came out pretty fast, the staff forgot my boyfriend's drink, and left a whole entree off of our order (which we paid for!). All we got was a \"sorry\". After finishing our meal, we had to wait a whole 15 min for the side of fries we ordered to be brought with our sandwiches. No offer to make up for their mistakes. Being in the service industry for over 10 years, I have to say that that is no way to treat a first time customer whos experience was ruined due to lack of attention to detail. I would have expected a free drink or dessert, but it seems like the staff could care less about keeping patrons satisfied. I can't blame them though, they are super understaffed. I feel bad for any bartender who also has to wear the hat of a food runner AND a busser. Be weary of tipping over 10%, you don't want to regret it like I did.

Fat, old, bored, and heinous looking moms and meth-heads giving not-so-discreet handjobs to shifty patrons... nobody tipping at all (which begs the question, \"why do they come to work?\")... and an overwhelming cloud of depression and angst looming over the whole nasty parade.\n\nThe place was surprisingly active for a Wednesday afternoon. It took several minutes for my eyes to adjust to the darkness - I imagine keeping it so dark can only help given the sorry state of the girls. There's no VIP room that I could tell (unless you count the shabby bathrooms), but that didn't stop the shenanigans going on out in the open for my virgin eyes to see. There were definitely men being \"gotten off\" here which disgusted me to no end. I have no idea how much it costs, but it can't be terribly expensive (and yet it's surely too much). \n\nAnother possible \"up-side\" to this place (depending on your perspective) is that they will serve you an illegal amount of alcohol... the law be damned. This is perhaps another aid to help make the beasts on stage easier to stomach. \n\nSpeaking of stomachs, Eric was right - there were definitely some very pregnant ladies here. Kinda disturbing. My friend decided she wanted to get a dance from either the oldest girl or the fattest girl in the joint. The girl she picked put her mouth on my friend's vagina through her pants and did some sort of heavy breathing and moaning... my friend looked mortified and all she could do was let out some uncomfortable  panicked laughter. She was also groped and molested beyond her comfort levels. \n\nNothing in here was sexy at all - it's basically a really dark and moderately scary dive bar with a bunch of whores walking around with their ugly boobs out willing to do whatever for a few bucks. These girls clearly don't make much money (unless the special services pay well)... my friend and I would tip 5 bucks to the stage dancers (and their center stage is a joke) and they would thank us with a surprised look as though it had never happened before. \n\nThe seating looked like it was purchased from a conference hall at the Ramada Inn that was shut down 10 years ago and the girls looked like they wandered in off Van Buren 10 years ago. I suggest you stay away, however I can attest (as Eric P pointed out) that this was a source of some amazing comedy and laughter... hence the extra star.\n\nEdit Dec 2014 - \n\nI feel bad about saying \"whores,\" \"fat,\" \"ugly boobs,\" \"heinous looking,\" and \"beasts.\" Those are ugly words and I wasn't raised to talk like that - I was just trying to be funny. Also, I regret not mentioning that someone brought in some shrimp cocktails in styrofoam cups to sell. Like, where the hell did they come from? He came in through the front door. The regulars and bartender acted like it was a normal thing for a dude to walk in off the street selling seafood in a dark, dank strip club.", "business_id": "q9B1h5eGBvHjQLF10puUkQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2008-06-04", "type": "review"}

I have to admit because it was nearly 100 degrees outside the garden was a little more vacant but this actually proved to benefit our experience. We noticed several creatures walking around the garden and foraging for food. At one point, one of the large squirrels was walking around right in front of us, practically posing on a tree branch! We took several pictures of our squirrel friend. We also noticed several lizards wandering around just a few feet away from us! Overall the experience of the garden was fantastic and very relaxing. Stop by on a cooler afternoon, or early evening for a wildlife experience you surely won't forget.", "business_id": "qMkIbQFrROSnPaQ7at85-w", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-06-07", "type": "review"}

Set in Papago Park, next to the Phoenix Zoo, the Desert Botanical Garden features a wide variety of cacti, succulents, and other desert plants on extensive grounds. Many of these plants are native and some are exotic to the Sonoran Desert. They recently created a dramatic entrance, with a front display of large cacti, including saguaro, ocotillo, and organ pipe cactus, that greet you the moment you enter the Garden. The pathways are winding and wonderful, but not so rugged that a person in a wheelchair could not navigate the terrain. Some of the inclines lead you to remarkable views of the cityscape and the surrounding mountains. They also have an excellent gift shop. \n\nThe spring and early summer months, when the desert flowers bloom and it is not too hot during the day, are an excellent time of year to make a visit. Just as good are the holiday weeks in late November and early to middle December, when the Garden holds Las Noches de las Luminarias. This event is similar in concept to the Farolito Walk in Santa Fe, New Mexico, when luminarias (farolitos) line the walkways to softly illuminate your path, hot beverages are sold, and musicians perform throughout the Garden. The year that Chihuly's glass artwork was featured alongside the luminarias was just incredible.\n\nThe Desert Botanical Garden is a great way to spend the day and learn about the beauty of the desert.

In my mind, the question formed quite clearly:  \"What kind of a botanical garden can they possibly have in the middle of the desert?\"  As a Missouri native, I still have a great deal to learn...and this experience was most informative.  \n\nJust as with so many other delightful surprises, I found that Arizona can (and does) host gardens every bit as captivating as those in other states.  Despite great variance, they are beautiful in their own way.  This was a very novel encounter for me, as I found myself immersed in a land of cacti and thick islands of stalwart plantings yielding flowers of unexpected beauty.  Tiny creatures (lizards and geckos) darted here and there beneath some of the plantings, offering amusement to visitors.  Birds fluttered amid the trees, and butterflies came to sample the sweet nectar of the desert blooms.\n\nThis was both a beautiful experience and an educational moment that I've continued to build on.  My knowledge of gardens had been far more limited that I realized, and even after exploring tropical and \"classical\" botanical gardens across the Eastern United States and the West Coast, I still have a LOT to learn about what a successful garden can actually consist of.  \n\nYet even for those who wish to simply relax and drink in the peace and serenity of this magical wonderland, this will prove an ideal venue for quiet reflection and enjoyment.  Children also were enjoying the cacti and the lizards, and there was plenty of room for a diverse assembling of visitors to use the gardens in their own way, at whatever pace they found best.  There was also plenty of shade in most spots...a definite consideration given the terrifying Arizona sun!  \n\nI will make it a point to come back here during future trips.

Tuesdays they run a free poker tournament through goallininc.com. \n\nThe joint is in need of a makeover, but it's not completely awful. It's actually very comfortable. That's why I've given it 3 stars. It's warm and inviting there... plus, the drinks are cheap and the food is good (for bar food) and super cheap. If you want to hit up karaoke, it's usually a pretty safe crowd and it's a lot of fun. Bring a group of friends. \n\nIt's a perfect place to go when you don't feel like getting dressed up or impressing anyone. It's not like going to TT Roadhouse where it's packed and everyone looks at a non-regular like they are an alien. It's also not like going to Jugheads where it can be dark and scary if you're not a regular. Breakroom is the kind of place where it's just really easy to walk in as a non-regular and belly up to the bar and order a pint. Don't let the crackwhores and pimps scare you off. And don't let the fact that it's a bit of a dump turn you off... or do.", "business_id": "W41CEzdKJe8wdDB-Rd6KJQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2007-08-31", "type": "review"}

It was our first concert here -- and we had a blast.  \n\nEven pushing 60, Heart puts on a great show.  The 'theater in the round' concept made it all the more awesome.  \n\nThere are a few things I wish somebody had told me ahead of time, so I'm going to share them with you now:\n\nMoney:\nPlan on having cash on hand for parking, concessions, etc.  Tickets can be picked up / purchased from the box office with a credit card.\n\nParking:\nParking at the theater is $5.  Cash.  Get there an hour ahead of time to get a good spot.  Pull through in the parking spot so that you can put your car in 'drive' when exiting the spot.  Choose a spot that is well lit if you're going to an evening event -- you're not in the greatest part of Phoenix.\n\nFood:\nI'm not sure if it's entirely obvious from the 'show nearby businesses' in Yelp, but there are NO RESTURANTS nearby.  When you get down there, it will be fairly obvious why -- you're in an industrial part of town.  Plan on eating ahead of time, or bringing your dinner with you.  \n\nGear:\nThe theater doesn't let you bring backpacks in, but will let you bring a purse in.  (I personally think it's a double standard).  I was a little disappointed that I had to pack my backpack in the trunk -- I would have left it at home.  \n\nSeating:\nI'm a big guy -- about 6'4\" -- and the seating IS NOT FRIENDLY TO LARGE PEOPLE.  At all.  Seriously.   I literally could not fit into my seat -- my legs would not fit.  Luckily I talked with an usher, who directed me to a red-shirted supervisor, who made a spot for my wife and I in the handicapped section.  The people who made this accommodation for me were very friendly about it.  I was told that in the future, I should actually instruct the box office to give me tickets in this section, or in the front row of the rear section (there is only a bar in this row -- so it would be more friendly to my legs).\n\nFood at the venue:\nThey have a full bar with premium brands, Coke, wine, Budweiser, Bud Light and many imported beers. Also, pizza, hot dogs, popcorn and other snacks are also available before and during shows.  So if the line is long before the show (and you can stand stepping out quickly during part of the event) you'll get a MUCH shorter line during the show.  You might even get no line (like I did).\n\nWhat I liked best:\nThe best part about this place is its intimate setting.  I know people have mentioned that before -- but it really can't be overstated.  You might have seen an act before -- but not 40ft away on a rotating stage.  \n\nThis place will definitely give you a night to remember.", "business_id": "BcBxTyj09Wu-w0KA1QvKTA", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-08-02", "type": "review"}

After almost 50 years of playing, you can bet he has his act perfected. He may not pack the show with that squealing guitar or technically complicated rifts that some bands feel they need to impress.  Of coarse, that doesn't mean he doesn't have his moments.  It's just that there is more to performing music than just playing technically difficult music and Bob, as well as his fans, figured this out a long time ago.  As a one-time musician, I know the magic of jamming freestyle with friends. There are moments when the emergency broadcast system sounds better. And there there are moments when you make magic you can't ever repeat. Every show Bob puts on is unique and will never be repeated. Every show has its own moments of magic. This is the beauty of watching true jam bands.  The reason I love the Blues is because you can't auto tune the Blues.  Just like the Blues, Bobs music has an emotion and feeling that many strive for but few achieve. There is a honesty and purity that some have and some don't. Bob had it...and still does.  Combine that with some of the nicest and most open minded fans around and you have yourself a good evening. Where else can you get a 20 year old hippy who doesn't know what day of the week it is with a 35 year old wasp and a 75 year old holding onto old glory days and everyone not only gets along but are friends for a few hours. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars, and I feel bad because it's not the bands fault, but some of their fans don't bath themselves.  Just because you can't smell yourself, doesn't mean I can't either.\n\nOh yeah. The venue is cool too.", "business_id": "BcBxTyj09Wu-w0KA1QvKTA", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-07-07", "type": "review"}

Parking is $5, collected as soon as you arrive.  If you want to avoid the mad rush getting outta there, strategically park near the exit (or near where you entered).\n\nThe line wasn't terribly long but the wait for the 8:30 show (2.5 hours)  was unendurable .  If you use either a walker or wheel chair, I don't believe this place is handicap accessible as I saw no ramps for either.  You only have the option to walk upstairs or downstairs.  The facility had minimal air conditioning and with the crowd it was very hot both inside and outside on the patio.  You would think they' would at least have a mist sprinkler system outside along with more chairs!  Also, you could see the patio is desperately in need of structural repairs. Obviously, the facility expected us to buy drinks while we waited.  But who wants to drink over priced alcohol drinks when you're uncomfortably hot and dehydrated? \n\nWhile everyone raves about getting a good view from any seat, the seats themselves are packed closely together.  I'm 5'5\" and my knees were scrunched by the seat in front of me.  Also if you've heavyset, the seats are small.  Acoustics are good.

I have been to good concerts and walked away feeling like this was a five star venue.  I have been to others and I hated it and vowed I would never be back.  \n\nPros\n-not a bad seat in the house and since the stage rotates you always have a good view\n-drinks are pretty reasonable for a venue (not reasonable in general, but compare it to say US Airways Center)\n-There are plenty of places to get concessions for such a small venue so the lines for them are never too bad.\n-The downstairs lounge is pretty cool before the show and it is fun to look around at the stuff displayed on the walls.\n-security does a great job here.  I never feel harassed, but at the same time I have seen situations break out and they handle them ASAP.\n\nCons\n-Parking.  The last two times I went they had increased to $10 for parking.  At this point I think they have the highest priced parking I pay for any venue in the valley and they have their own lot, so it is not even necessary.\n-Will call lines are ridiculous.  If you have tickets at will call, plan to get there an hour early.\n-Security lines to get in take forever as well.  My advice for this though is walk around a bit.  They have quite a few entrances and you may be able to find a short line at one.  People tend to follow the crowd.\n-The seats are small and uncomfortable.  If I have general admission tickets I tend to go to the back to have more space, but sometimes it is unavoidable.\n-I wish they were in a better location where there were near by bars to have a drink and a bite to eat before or after the show close by.\n\nThe last thing I wanted to include, but don't want to put it as a con, is there sound system is very inconsistent.  I don't know if it is the sound men touring with the artists or what, but I have been to shows that have had great sound and pulled me out of my seat.  Then I have been to others where I knew the artist and their songs and liked them, but left early because of how bad the sound was.  Like I said if you really like who/what you are about to see then by all means go to this venue and you will have a great time, but if you are on the fence about the entertainment, you might want to stay home.", "business_id": "BcBxTyj09Wu-w0KA1QvKTA", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-08-21", "type": "review"}

My daughter said there were only 3 stalls in the women's restroom.  I was excepting the sound system to be top notch but a bit distorted at times but ok with the slower softer songs were played. I know some love the revolving stage which I kind of liked also but when Nancy Wilson went into her solo at the beginning of Crazy on You all I saw was her back. Disappointed but I knew that could happen. Jealous of those who could see her going for it.  For paying $144 for 2 tickets and $10 for parking I expected an up to date venue.

We decided to go to Applebees, once again, for some food and drinks. Since this location was nearer, we decided to give it a shot.\n\nI ordered the nachos. Because I'm a vegetarian, I ordered it without the chili cheese sauce. How hard is it to get nachos wrong? My boyfriend ordered the two for $11.99 meal and got the blackened steak and chicken parmesan pasta. To drink, I ordered a strawberry daiquiri and he ordered a Dos Equis beer. The drinks sat at the bar for ages as we waited for the waitress to deliver it. By the time we received them, they tasted watered down- even the beer. \n\nFinally our food arrived. The nachos looked great, as did his food. However, looks can be deceiving. Everything about the nachos was disgusting. The cheese (queso blanco sauce) was cold, as if the nachos had been sitting around. The chips tasted old and stale. My boyfriend's steak was tough and very small. And the chicken pasta was cold as well.\n\nThe waitress (I believe her name was Taylor), wasn't very attentive. I don't blame her for the quality of the food, but the service could have been better. When we asked for the check (after I could only manage to eat some of the nachos) my boyfriend decided to inform her about the old taste of the chips. The waitress informed us that we needed to tell her earlier, which was understandable. She went on to explain the old taste could have come from the fact that the fresh batch of chips were just currently being fried, so my batch was most likely older, which obviously did not sit well with me. \n\nWe paid, and even tipped decently (15%), left quietly, and vowed to never ever go there again. We will drive out of our way to go to a different Applebees if need be.", "business_id": "hzUOqxpcnYYBgLlrgvjQYQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-08-16", "type": "review"}

There were maybe 6 or 7 occupied tables--it wasn't busy.  So we stood there, unsure of wether we sat ourselves or waited to be seated.  3 servers were present as well as a blonde bartender who totally ignored us.  Finally we asked if we sat ourselves and the bartender said to go right ahead.  We picked a booth facing the bar and sat.  And sat........and sat......and sat.  One male bartender seemed to be working in a back room only.  Another girl stood alongside the bar, staring out @ us, drinking a soda as we sat there with no menus.  The bartender, who was maybe 15 feet from us, would look @ us sideways, and look away.  My boyfriend works for the City of Phoenix.  He's a HUGE tipper.  Maybe we don't look like much, but...???????

Even though I'm a regular, I've only had the food here a handful of times, so I can't really offer too much insight in that aspect. However, I can tell you that the experience you get at G&D is superb. From the time I first started coming up until now, I've had several different waitresses--all of whom are super friendly and provide great service. Our current waitress, Ashley, have already memorized our regular drink orders. I always get a hot tea with lots of extra lemons and some extra napkins, and she never fails to get all of that to me as soon as we are seated. Trivia nights are amazingly fun. Even though we're a group of young girls competing against 40 or 50-year old men who knows every obscure fact on the face of this planet, it's still great to test your knowledge and learn some random new information you might not have known before. For example, I now have it ingrained in my brain that \"Nights in White Satin\" is by The Moody Blues (as they've asked that question more than a couple times in past trivia nights...).\n\nDavid, the owner of G&D is a great guy who's very personable. He comes around to each table and chats with different groups, and sometimes offers hints to questions if he doesn't consider you to be a \"wanker\" (a term he often uses to call out the really obnoxious customers). He also tells a couple of dirty or \"offensive\" jokes every Thursday, all in good fun!\n\nOne more thing...the bathroom toilet seat covers have the British flag on them! It's pretty cool. Also I heard that the women's bathroom in the back is haunted, but the scariest thing I've ever seen in there so far was only a cockroach, so I'm not sure how accurate that rumor is.\n\nI love G&D because it's not at all pretentious. It's just a comfortable place where you can come hang out, relax, enjoy a few drinks with friends, chat and play games. It's got its little quirks, but that's what I love about it, and when I walk in I feel completely at home. :)", "business_id": "3xEB9FyFXolq1b_Qn_BFtg", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-06-07", "type": "review"}

The menu offers several different beer, wine, and liquor options, from several different regions of the world. Food options are a mix of American, Irish, and British pub type foods.\n\nWe started with the medium hot wing drumettes as an appetizer. They were the right amount of heat level- not too hot, not too mild. The sauce itself was very vinegary and the meat tasted a little on the dry side.\n\nAs for entrees, I decided on the fish and chips, and tried some of the shepherd's pie. The fish and chips came as 2 sizable pieces of battered fillets, with a heap of fries. Although I ordered it with peas, it came with an extra side of coleslaw. The batter was excellent on the fish: A beautiful golden brown, and very crisp. The fish though, tasted dry. The coleslaw was crisp, but had no flavor. \n\nService was somewhat lackluster. Although our server would take away plates, he did not bother to check on our table to refill drinks (Sodas). Even when asked if we could get a refill he forgot to go to our table until we were done with our meal, and by that time it didn't matter to us if we had refills. In addition, it took a long time to get our check.\n\nI wasn't too impressed with the fish and chips, but I did like the shepherd's pie better. The mashed potatoes, ground meat, and veggies meshed well together with the gravy. \n\nWhile I wasn't very impressed with the fish and chips, I'd like to give George and Dragon another shot.

We both order the same meal, steak and shrimp with broccoli. My girlfriend asked to substitute the broccoli with mushrooms and add grilled onions. I want to add more shrimp to my order. Our meals arrive, mine looked fine but hers had two orders of mashed potatoes,  mushrooms and onions. Looked strange at first but whatever we went with it, we were hungry. \n\nHere is where it gets interesting. As my girlfriend was eating her mashed potatoes she feels a chewy piece in her mouth. She takes it out and it looks like a piece of toilet paper or some kind of white paper. (We had brown paper napkins only, not a single white napkin or paper on the table.) The bad part is, this was one of her last bites and didn't think of returning the food at that point. So, to not make scene we just inform our waiter about the piece of paper and advice him to let the cooks know to be more careful. He grabs our plates, grins and doesn't say a word....ok.

I'm always on the lookout for a local joint that is special, a place I can take out-of-towners and say, \"This is one more thing I love about Phoenix.\" I had high expectations for SunUp since it is in my neighborhood, a short ride or healthy walk away from home\n\nBut after several visits over the last couple of months and as many disappointments, SunUp Brewing is on my list of places I might go if I'm desperate, not as a destination, and certainly not a place I want representing my city to friends from elsewhere.\n\nI'm no beer aficionado, but I know what I like, and for the most part I like the brews at SunUp. I particularly enjoy the Light Rail Pale Ale as a mild-bodied thirst-quencher, and the Vanilla Porter, which is rich without being too sweet or heavy. I also like seeing what seasonal offerings they have, many of which I enjoyed.\n\nOne constant on my many visits, however, is the truly bad customer service. I don't care if you make minimum wage or six figures; if your job is to take orders and serve people, then do it. Many other Yelp reviewers indicate they have suffered lackadaisical customer service at SunUp, and my experience is that this is the rule, not the exception.\n\nTake today, for example: At 1 p.m. on a Sunday, the place was virtually empty save for about three tables and a couple in the main bar area. The last problem I thought I'd have would be getting attention, but my disinterested server/bartender pulled a disappearing act after pouring my beer and plopping my burger in front of me. She was more interested in sitting in a booth in the adjacent room with a paper in front of her, watching TV.\n\nIf she had bothered to follow up with her customer, she would've learned my burger was the opposite of the medium-rare burger I ordered. Even more aggravating was when she did walk quickly past me (including one time when she told the other server she as heading out back, presumably for a break), she looked directly at my barely touched meal but didn't inquire as to why I wasn't eating it. I'm not going to chase down a server, especially if it involves going room to room to find her. All she had to do was notice I hadn't touched my meal for 20 minutes and ask if everything was OK.\n\nI've had similar experiences with the staff at SunUp before although this example was the most egregious. Like other reviewers, I've waited at the bar either with a growler ready to be filled or a bill I'm trying to pay while the bartender chatted with friends even after acknowledging me.\n\nIt shouldn't be this hard to find a place that wants to sell me something, but evidently the folks at SunUp have more cash than they need, so I see no reason to spend mine there again.", "business_id": "3UMcsN9IjoeV8JZvC4apag", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-06-27", "type": "review"}

None of us had ever been there before so we were excited to see what this place was all about.\n\nSituated about a 10ish minute walk from the light rail station, it is a nice walk through a part of town where I wouldn't normally be.  You wouldn't think this place is a brewery because of its small size but it is.  The inside is very quaint and taverny.  It has a very relaxed vibe going on.\n\nI ordered the sampler and all their beers are pretty decent.  I decided on the Amber for my pint, but they were all good so it was a difficult decision.  Not bad for a little local brewery at all.  For a quick bite before we moved on we ordered the calamari and the bratwurst splitter.  The calamari was pretty standard and the aioli had a nice kick to it.  The bratwurst was excellent and unique.  Each was perfect to split among 4 people.  The rest of their menu looked good but is pretty much typical bar food.  Well probably a bit better than average bar food.  Anyway, it is perfect food for the place and looking back we should have probably eaten dinner there instead of only an appetizer.\n\nPro Tip:  Cross over to the north side of the street at the light as soon as you exit the light rail station.

After waiting a couple minutes to be seated (and not even being acknowledged by anyone when we entered), we were led to a table by an older woman.  She took our drink orders and left us with menus to look over.  It took me a minute to realize they'd changed their menu.  Instead of one with appetizers, salads, sandwiches/burgers, entrees, and desserts, they instead now have a lunch and dinner menu.  And, sadly, the pulled pork sandwich had been discontinued.  I settled on the green chile chicken sandwich of some sort and an iced tea.  The waitress wasn't very friendly and seemed to be uninterested in being pleasant.  Our meals arrived but without the chipotle ketchup we requested.  A few minutes later, the waitress brought it to our table.  There was nothing impressive about my sandwich.  It was fairly blah and unseasoned, and the sweet potato fries were crispy on the outside but tough and hard on the inside.  Shame I paid $1 to upgrade from regular fries.\n\nOnce it came time to pay, the waitress took an exceptionally long time to return our cards and receipts to us.

A little neurotic, maybe, but I'm disputing the transaction with my bank right now, and at least I have the proof I need. *** See note above: This situation has been satisfactorily resolved and the dispute cancelled with my bank.", "business_id": "3UMcsN9IjoeV8JZvC4apag", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-07-16", "type": "review"}

Another 20 minutes had passed and I then told the bartender.  It took another 15 minutes on top of that.  Never ONCE did anyone bother telling me what happened.  No reason given.  Honestly, no one even gave a Sh*t either.  My buddy even commented on that after we left.  No one even cared.  Clearly the first person didn't put the order in.  The second..who knows.

It was busy, not crowded and we were seated right away.  The decor is very basic  - there is a bar and two rooms with table seating.  I didn't ask about the brewing facilities or if there is a tour as we were more interested in catching up with our sons after being out of town for a while.  After perusing the beer menu (all beer is brewed on site) I decided to have the Trooper IPA, others had the porter and pale ale.  There were a nice number of special seasonal beers on the menu and they also have a full bar for non-beer drinkers.  All were quite tasty and refreshing.  We ordered pretzel bites and wings for appetizers.  The wings were medium, with most of the flavor coming from the rub which gave them a nice crispy crunch while being juicy on the inside.  The pretzel bites were soft and  chewy with a creamy cheese sauce with a bit of a bite.\n\nFor dinner I had pork and green chili which was a nice stew that came with soft tortilla wedges that had been roasted on the griddle.  Nice blend of flavors in the stew - spice level was moderate (see my review of The Shed) but still quite nice and satisfying.  For the stew I switched to their SB 1030 Session Pale Ale, the crispness of which paired nicely with the stew.  If you don't know, SB 1030 was the Arizona law that allowed craft breweries and small batch wineries to compete on a more even footing with the large distributors and enabled many more craft breweries to open in the state (yea!).\n\nI would definitely go back and if you live in this area and are into craft beer you must make this a regular stop.", "business_id": "3UMcsN9IjoeV8JZvC4apag", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-06-27", "type": "review"}

That said, there's a few things that have been amiss at this place pretty much every time I come here.  The food has been average at best and the atmosphere isn't quite my thing.  Tonight exemplified this feeling for me during a dinner with family members.\n\nFor starters, this restaurant has been around forever.  Even many of the staff members have been here forever (our waiter had worked there for decades).  Between the long time staff and the decor, the feeling of this place is old school all the way.  It has some of the feel of an old school italian restaurant, though not so fancy that you have to be super dressy here.  In fact much of the clientele here is quite casual.  The customer crowd here has also typically been much older as I suspect many of their customers have been coming here for years.  I rarely see anyone younger than their forties or fifties in there, so interpret that however you want.\n\nThe food is old school classic italian from the pastas, the seafood dishes, the chicken and veal plates, and the steaks.  Tonight I went with the chicken francese.  Essentially a breaded chicken covered in a lemon butter sauce and topped with mushrooms.  First off, I'm not a mushroom guy so thats my fault.  But the chicken and breaded tasted pretty bland even with the sauce (which was way more butter than lemon by the way).  It was edible, but not that great.  I've had similar experiences with a couple of their pasta and veal dishes as well.  Each dish gets soup and a salad to start.  As usual both were okay, but again nothing special.  The prices are actually pretty reasonable so even if the flavors don't impress you, you can count on leaving full.\n\nIt may well be that I'm not the target audience of this restaurant.  Its an old school restaurant with old school grub, so maybe they're just looking to appeal to the old school crowd.  I'm not opposed to old world recipes as long as they're done well.  From my multiple visits here I find their cuisine adequate, but not much better than that.  There's plenty of italian joints in the Phoenix area.

I live and the neighborhood and this establishment always comes up on my Yelp mobile app and I'm not sure why. \n\nHere's the thing: I really like dive bars. Just not ones that take it to an apathetic extreme. That's the vibe you get when you walk into Pomeroy's. I'm really not one for bars with dim lighting and prehistoric decor. Strike 1. \n\nService wasn't that good either. As I said, the place is so crappy looking it's reflected in the attitudes of the people that work here. You have to order everything from the bar. Even food. My friends wanted to have a quick bite to eat here and the waitress saw us once. Granted they were a little busy, but c'mon. Strike 2.\n\nI won't continue on with this, but I can promise that if you're looking for a drink, or even a good place for happy hour, there are just too many other options in the vicinity that are 100 times better than the ambiance of this place: Zipps, The Yard, The Vig, and Z Tejas to name a few.", "business_id": "_GS1R0LTwr6h8rMWY_8U9Q", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-08-13", "type": "review"}

It's clean and well-maintained (including the \"Goddesses\" restroom). It also has friendly staff, a diverse group of patrons, a great outdoor patio (featuring appropriately-themed \"Roman\" columns), and perhaps, most importantly, features karaoke on Thursday - Saturday nights. My husband and I went on a Friday night for karaoke with Stevey P and Kristin S and their SOs and had a great time. \n\nThe singers' talent is definitely better than your average karaoke dive bar, and the song choice was good, but as an avid karaoke singer, I didn't like the fact that there was no separate stage or area carved out for the current singer to stand. We just had to stand by our chairs or between tables and strain our necks to look up at the lyrics. Karaoke also wasn't the central focus of the place, with much *very loud* talking and socializing going on in spite of (or because of?) the singing. I'm not going to penalize Apollo's for this too much, though, because I know only serious karaoke freaks like me want it to be the focus.  \n\nOne other complaint - some of us in the group were also a little disappointed with our weak our drinks were - I don't know if this was just crowd control, but with a final tab of $70 or so, we expected to be feeling a little more loopy than we did for most of the night. Speaking of feeling loopy, we were appreciative of how helpful the bartenders were when we wanted to call a cab, and one came fairly quickly after they called one for us. \n\nApparently, the company that does karaoke here is the same as the one that does it at Kobalt (another gay bar in Midtown's Park Central complex). If you are into a social and dynamic bar scene with a pretty diverse crowd and karaoke as part of the experience, you will really like Apollo. However, if you ever want to go somewhere a little more low-key and really focus on the karaoke part, you might want to check Kobalt out.", "business_id": "lLI8ObL8aCVbkrrtAW0EHw", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-08-27", "type": "review"}

I don't live in the immediate vicinity so I only stop in when in the area and the mood strikes.  The crowd can be diverse but generally tame. I had the recent displeasure of stopping in on a Wednesday with two friends visiting from S.F. The crowd was sparse and we sat at the bar. A young 90's slacker looking bar tender came to take our order. We ordered a rum and coke, LI iced tea, and an apple martini. Upon hearing the apple martini the slacker started to belittle my friends order as being REALLY gay and  had an attitude. At first maybe it could be taken as humorous banter but when he came back with the 1st two drinks he continued in the same vein with the comments and put out attitude. After serving the drink he commented that he hoped it was ok because he never made one before(in a condescending tone). Well, the drink sucked and my friend ordered and was served a beer only after the bartender threw the Martini out in a huff. Needless to say we left as soon as we finished our drinks. I was totally embarrassed. My friends certainly got a poor look at the Phoenix gay scene and what I thought was supposed to be a fairly decent bar and not a dive bar. When I paid the tab the ticket said Hippie Boy which I assume is the bartenders nickname. Imagine that, asking for a Martini at a gay bar and being ridiculed for it as being too gay. The thing is had we had gotten good service we would have stayed for a few more of those expensive gay drinks.

I have a rule when it comes to food establishments and this place does follow suite. Most often than not the little mom and pop shop hole in the wall. . (( and this place is what I consider a \"dive / hold in the wall\". . )) usually have really good food. \n\nSo here is my review. And I will have to break it down into categories. \n\n---------Environment:****\nHere's the deal. If you enjoy tennis, chess, and polo. This \"aint\" your spot. If you are comfortable with wobbly tables, hard chairs the sound of beer bottles tossed into a trash can .  .then keep reading.  \nHarvey's Wineburger reminds me of Stag's Head bar. In case you don't remember that's the name of the place on Dukes of Hazard? Ok well the waitress was no where near the same looks as daisy but she had a mom and pop shop charm about her. Smiles and jokes were readily available. Chris T. and I were rather excited about possibly finding a new \"joint\" to hang out at and writing a good review. I ordered the Cheese Wineburger and Chris ordered the Super Cheese Wineburger. She mentioned something about the fries and onion rings because we would get more for cheaper or something. I didn't really hear but Chris said sure and that was good enough for me.  \n\n---------The Wait: ---------**\n\nAs we walked in the door it we found a dark bar with a grill on the left. We sat our selves hoping someone would notice. There were a couple people in there that looked like regulars chatting away about something to the line cook and I think that is what our down fall was. The food was late and the waitress right off the bat apologized as she gave us our to-go bag as we requested after franticly watching the clock. She tossed in the drinks and fries for free because of the wait.  There was a long wait for the order. I believe it was the cool jibber-jabbin to the regulars that hung up the order. \n\n---------The Food: --------- *****\n\nIf it came only to the food I would give this review 5 stars. The burgers were stacked high like it was going for a photo-op.  I like my fries a little crispy and thought they were perfect. I'm not into soggy fries. \n\nI have to make a comment on the other reviews. These are the ones about the lack of hygiene comments. This is referring to one night that they were extremely understaffed on a Friday night. I have to ask you if you ever worked in a restaurant.  I hate to tell you but that is more common than you think. Even when I worked in a 4 star restaurant at a resort. Ever watch Hells Kitchen.  .yeah. . Stick your finger in my food and see if the meat is done. . Thanks. .\n\nI have to say I have not made a final thumb up or down. Next time I go there for lunch \"and I plan on going back\" I will call ahead and order. My only issue with this place was the wait for the food. The staff was friendly in a down home manner.  The food was really good, and my only issue was the wait. \n\n---------Over all score: --------- ****\n look for another review at some point. I'm not firm on this. I will have to see if the time service issue is the same next time. \n\nUntil next time. . keep the groove and be cool.  .", "business_id": "ntJAKLAq0cXzzdFgPoo0Iw", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-08-14", "type": "review"}

The Yelp application on my iPhone (insert shameless plug here) showed that Harvey's was right around the corner, and with a swing of the wheel, I was pulling up to their dilapidated storefront. \n\nBeing alone, I bellied up to the bar, which was packed at 2:00 PM on a Friday. I still had work to get done that afternoon, so I had to stick with an RC Cola (yes, you read that correctly.....RC Cola). Let me just tell you that I was the only person in the place that didn't have a beer in hand. Happy hour (and the weekend, apparently) had arrived early at Harvey's. \n\nJust a quick moment on the very eclectic crowd that filled this place. On my left were two appliance repairmen. On my right was a gentlemen that was pushing 80. At the pool tables were a group of what looked like college kids. Their common bond was the beer they were all putting away. I immediately made plans to return on a coming Friday afternoon, with friends in tow, and be a part of this very diverse, day drinking crowd. \n\nNow, onto the food, which is why I stopped by in the first place. I wasn't sure what a \"wineburger\" is and I can't fully say that, even now, I understand. All I know is that I ordered their standard wineburger and that it was grilled fresh for me, right at the bar. \n\nThe burger took about 15 minutes to cook and I could pretty much watch them prepare it. The same person that took my order (and delivered beers to all my fellow patrons) prepped and cooked the burger. It was fresh ground meet, pressed into a patty and they regularly pressed it into the grill with her spatula. Ultimately, it was served up on a fresh bun, which crisp lettuce, onions pickles, and melting cheese. \n\nLet me tell you that this burger was FRESH. Grease was still dripping off the sides of it. There were cracks in the edge of the burger, where they had been pressing it down into the grill. I actually had to wait a couple of minutes to eat it, as it was still TOO hot. I'm not sure of where you're going to go and get a burger that is cooked that fresh, right in front of you, and then immediately handed to you. Probably one of the freshest hamburgers that I've ever had prepared (in which I wasn't actually grilling it myself). \n\nThe onion rings were straight out of the boiling oil and too hot to eat. (I'm sure my doctor does not approve of this meal). All the condiments I could ask for were delivered promptly. The burger was hot, with just the right amount of grease, and full of flavor. This was as close to home-made as you can get.", "business_id": "ntJAKLAq0cXzzdFgPoo0Iw", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-06-08", "type": "review"}

A good friend was in Harvey's in the past month, and ask me to go there with him today.  He said on his previous visit, he got a lousy hamburger and suspected something had changed.  His assessment was quite accurate.\n\nThe first thing you notice when the burger is delivered is that the bun has shrunk and that the burger patty has become perfectly round, as compared to its 'jagged' predecessor, and flattened - maybe pre-formed and frozen?  The first bite discloses the sad news:  the meat is tasteless, rubbery, and absolutely nothing like the burger that has kept the joint in business 40-plus years.  Astonishingly, you can no longer taste any hint of wine in the burger.  My guess is that the rubbery consistency of the meat (they OBVIOUSLY have changed their supplier and/or grade) rejects the wine poured on it like water on Bullfrog sunscreen.    \n\nWe had heard about the ownership change several months ago with someone commenting that \"oriental owners\" had taken over.  The smaller microwaved-tasting bun and the Birkenstock meat are clear signs the new ownership has resorted to use of cheap ingredients - specifically the meat - the landmark's staple - to squeeze more profits while raising prices that are unrecognizable to Harvey's regulars.  \n\nIt's quite sad.  This was one of my favorite places in Phoenix - a wineburger and a game of pool - never crowded - that old dive charm...and hands down in the top 5 best burgers in town.  Apparently the new owner(s) believe all they need is a 40-year reputation.  Good luck with that, I won't be back.", "business_id": "ntJAKLAq0cXzzdFgPoo0Iw", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-07-02", "type": "review"}

All restaurant owners need to take a page out of this guys book. Reason in a second. Let's talk about food first.\n\nI had the baby back ribs and the were awesome. Not quite as good as the baby backs from Houstons but pretty darn close. My girlfriend who loves PCG decided to go with something different this time around and ordered one of their signature dishes. It was some sort of chicken. I do consider myself a foodie so the first thing I was thinking is how can chicken be a signature dish? Chicken is boring no matter what you do with it. Anyway, it wasn't that good and the chicken comes on the bone which my girlfriend didn't like. So, since it was a signature dish, recommended by the waiter, I had to return it. My philosphy is that if something is recommended and is a signature dish and it doesn't give you a mouthgasim, it gets returned. So the waiter nicely takes it back and apologizes multiple times and asks if we would like something else. My girlfriend orders her old PCG standby, the Pork Tenderloin. Wow what a great pork dish. I don't care for pork that much but i must say i crushed half of it, it was amazing.\n\nDo I even need to explain the choclate tort??? YUM\n\nBack to the owner. We arrive at PCG at about 4pm to eat dinner, who eats at 4pm, you'd think we went for the early bird special. We get seated in the dining room and are the only ones in the dining room and no one comes out for like 10 minutes. So we move to the bar  and tell the bar tender we are going to eat at the bar because no one came out to greet us or take a drink order. He apologizes, bvut it was NO BIG DEAL. We weren't mad or complaining or anything. Remember earlier I mentioned the signature dish that got sent back. Well the owner comes over to us and says i understand you have had some issues today and we are like ah no problem the food was great yada yada yada. The owner is like NO BOTH of your meals are on me including dessert. We objected and were like you don't have to do that and he INSISTED. Who does this now a days in the restauran business? Most definately not Donovans.\n\nAnyway to sum it up. PCG is awesome, the owner actually cares about his customers and everyone i tell this story to they are like i can't believe he did that. Go to Phoenix City Grille you won't be disappointed. KUDOS to PCG and especially you Mr. Owner, sorry I don't remember your name.

The chicken special was fresh and light and flavorful. The Idaho trout was delicate and perfectly complemented the roasted cauliflower and asparagus. And the pork chop was a huge mass of yum!

There's always some nostalgic value for places that concentrate on food and comfortable homey environ so that they aren't so hip it hurts.\n\nMy first visit to Duck and Decanter was on a recent Thursday for lunch and was filled with the normal Camelback Corridor office drones and car salesmen. Delicious mix of people I tell you, but even more delicious was the maple glazed ham and muenster sandwich on whole wheat topped with avocado.  My lunch buddy opted for the tuna and it was pretty tasty but not the best I have ever had.  The pricing was average and with chips and a soda came out to about $10. Bonus points for the cheese selection feature bite-sized samples for a dollar or so. \n\nThe wine store was small and charming and the layout of the place is so unconventional (with most seating upstairs) that it makes for some fascinating exploring once you get over the overwhelming collection of tacky bric a brac everywhere. \n\nI'm disappointed that it's kind of hidden, but that's probably best since I would be here all the time for a sammie and some wine come happy hour.

Everyone I know that has ever mentioned the Duck tells me they like it. Yes I have been several times over the years. But a few days ago I was at our office which is on 7th ave just south of Thomas. I was really hungry and wanted something to eat, this in it self is kind of unusual as I can more than likely wait until the end of the day before I have to eat. Plus the fact I have enough fat on me to last a few months I would not be starving to death any time soon if I missed a meal or three. So I asked Bruce, you remember Bruce he is the guy I am always asking things when down at the office. I wanted something delivered as I wanted to stay in the office to get a contract ready for signing. The only place he could think of was the Duck, but he said he could go and get it much faster. So I said ok and gave him my card and told him to get what he wants and order me I think it is called the Ducky or something like that.  Man he was back much more quickly than I had expected him to be, so they must have been on the ball in making the food. But the food as I always find; just nondescript. NO discernable flavour just a mish mash of textures and blandness. So I can say I like the building, the quickness they have gotten my food out and the patio. I guess the folks are also nice, but do not remember them so they were not not nice. I just do not get the praise this place gets, I find much better food for less elsewhere.

It seemed like a good selection because the name of the sandwich and the sandwich itself had duck in it and so does the name of the restaurant.  However, the sandwich was just ok.  Nothing special.  Not worth 9 bucks.  just a few slices of meat in between 2 pieces of bread.\n\nAll the sandwiches on the menu did however look interesting.  They are definitely not your typical \"sandwich place\" type sandwiches.  Well some of them are but they all have that special Duck & Decanter twist.  The have some deli type sandwich selections as well but I would prefer to just go to a deli for those.\n\nMy wife ordered the chicken salad and it was very very good.  I would order it if I ever visit the place again.  She ordered the Sonoran with spicy oil & vinegar.  It was very tasty and no mayo or any of the bad stuff.\n\nThe service was very friendly but I took a long while to get our sandwiches.

The smokey cheese they put on it absolutely makes it.\nI recommend it to anybody.\nThey also have good fresh pastas you can get for sides and cake and pie slices for desert.", "business_id": "HIiVx2mseVWKtx8TKfWC_A", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-08-24", "type": "review"}

I know that it sounds like an exaggeration. It is not. EVERYTHING is phenomenal here. \n\n\"The Duck\" is my measuring stick for every other sandwich shop and deli. \n\nYour first time here may be a little confusing, because your order will be taken on a paper bag and there are a lot of options. You should feel safe in the knowledge that no matter what you get you will be happy. \n\nMy favorites are:\n\nTraditional sandwich.... Roast Beef or Smoked Turkey on any of the breads, with mayo, lettuce, tomato, swiss cheese, add sprouts. \n\nFeeling like tuna? Alabcore tuna on toasted ciabatta, with no celery, add sprouts, with lettuce, tomato, and swiss cheese. The Albacore as a salad is a great option if you are not eating breads at the time (which would be tragic because all of their bread is fresh and perfect).\n\nUncommon... Italian Dry Salami on sourdough with mayo, mustard, lettuce, tomato, and swiss cheese. Just do it. \n\nGet the tea of the day. Browse the wine and beer room, consider getting a coffee drink at some juncture, and peruse all of the knick knacks and food stuffs. They'll call your name when it is ready.\n\nI have had just about everything on the menu. No, I HAVE had everything on the menu. \n\nI am partial to the swiss cheese because I have not been able to find cheese like that anywhere else, but if you like cheddar (some of  you do) then try the Longhorn- it is the same price as the swiss, any other cheese will cost you extra. If you like cheese in general, then do yourself a favor and get a cheese tray, call some friends, get some wine, and relax.

I had the breakfast burrito with egg, cheddar chz and black forest bacon for breakfast one morning. It was pretty good. Adding their salsa is really what increased the flavor and brought it up a notch. \n\nOn another day, we stopped in for lunch and had the marinated roasted chicken sandwich on sourdough bread. This was a game changer. The fresh, delicious roasted chicken was so good. It tasted like something your mom would make for you if she really loved you. Yeah, that's right mom, I'm calling you out. This is the sandwich I needed growing up. Not bologna and processed cheese. We can still salvage this relationship. Balls in your court lady. \n\nThe food here was great but they're also a specialty store. They have an assortment of greatness throughout.

It's in a tucked away corner of a strip mall.  It neighbors a furniture store and a couple of other places who very  explicitly do NOT want you parking in their store spots if you are visiting Duck & Decanter.  It's huge on the inside.  There is a little cheese section, a wine section, espresso bar with a large selection of loose teas, foodstuffs area, indoor & outdoor seating, an upstairs seating gallery, the deli...like whoah.  It's kind of like an old mercantile of days yore.  You order your sandwich and then have time to peruse the store.  They have lots of Haribo gummi snacks, including my favorite twin cherries.  There are many options for sandwiches.  I got a spicy pulled pork bbq sandwich with cole slaw inside, served in a onion-y kaiser roll.  At least I think it was supposed to be spicy.  It was good, the BBQ sauce was a little sweet for me.  The cole slaw didn't really have a \"bite\" to it, but did keep the bbq and sammie moist and stuff.  I got some seriously overpriced for the size macaroni salad, and it was some of the most mayonaissey mac salad I've had outside of Hawaiian mac salad.  You can take as many pickle spears as your heart desires.  They have a dessert case that looks delicious.  Can't really say that their customer service was stellar.  I initially walked around the store trying to figure out if I wanted to stay for a drink or whatever.  There were a lot of people working. Somebody followed me from section to section, but never bothered to ask if I needed help.  Just tailed me like a store security guard.  Maybe I looked particularly suspicious on this day...without even wearing my escaped convict prison jump suit.  Then when I opted to just get a sandwich, the staff just totally disappeared except for the sandwich maker, who had to finish up what she was doing to help me.  Kind of a weird vibe.  \nSo, would I go back?  Sure, one visit does not make a complete story.  Heat does crazy things to people and it was a CRAZY hot day.

I've been eating here since I was 12 years old, and when I grew older and lived in the neighborhood I ate there almost once a week, many times even daily. Clearly, I'm not even exaggerating a little when I say that I love this place and think the food is amazing. Lately, however I have been experiencing a lot of issues with my orders being made improperly and a lack of support from the staff in compensation for the issue.\n\nI haven't eaten there for a long time, it might be my actual favorite place to eat and for the most part if I could eat anything at all this is what I would choose, so I recently decided to place an order. I got home with my food and realized that everything was made improperly. I called them before they closed to make sure they knew what happened and they gave me credits for free food.\n\nAfter remembering how good their food is, despite the mistakes made to my order, I was left craving more and decided to try again so I could use the free credits they gave me. When I got home the food was made incorrectly again, but I live far and really didn't feel like driving back, so I picked everything off that wasn't supposed to be there and moved on with my day.\n\nSoon after I took a friend of mine there because she had never been and despite these two past experiences I still considered it my favorite place to eat. We ordered, waited, got our food, and sat down. I opened my sandwich to find it made incorrectly, yet again. After becoming quite sad, my friend encouraged me to go back inside and tell them. They remade the sandwich for me and everything was fine.\n\nBecause of my recent issues, when I placed my latest order, I made sure to ask the person taking my order to have the person making the sandwich double-check the bag to insure my food was made exactly as I ordered it. He assured me that he would, and when I picked up my food he confirmed with me that he did indeed check. Unfortunately when I got home I found that my food was made wrong, surprise! AGAIN.\n\nI reached my breaking point and called asking to speak with a manager. I gave her an in-depth explanation of the situation just as mentioned above and asked if it'd be possible to be refunded for today's food and was told that she'd need to look more seriously into the matter and call me back the next day to let me know what she'd be able to do for me. I'm still waiting to hear from her, hopefully I'll be able to change this review when I do.", "business_id": "HIiVx2mseVWKtx8TKfWC_A", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-06-04", "type": "review"}

These are what put this place on my radar....those wings are VERY good that it is hard to order anything else anytime I come here. \n\nAs far as non-happy hour....they have your typical pub cold and hot sandwiches like buffalo chicken sandwich and Philly cheesesteak. Nothing is too expensive, but the happy hour is where this place shines. \n\n\nGive this place a shot if you are ever in the Biltmore area.", "business_id": "CqhsIZ7TzCfJTrZqg5-gqQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-06-08", "type": "review"}

The place is okay, and seems to have some serious track betting going on here. Several TV's with horse racing on, machines and some betting tickets and such. I'm not much of a better myself, so I'm not even really sure how it works at this place.\n\nAnyways, I'm kind of torn between two and three stars for this place.  For starters, the inside kind of feels dated, and its always dark when we're there. Also, we usually sit in the back when we are here, since our party size is usually between 6 and 9 people at any given time.  Someone always calls ahead from the office to let them know we're coming in, so they already have the table set up in the back for us when we arrive.\n\nMy problem is two fold with Armadillos. First, is that it the service always seems slow, and secondly, they don't seem to have a great lunch menu. It seems to be mostly dinner type dishes, that can be quite big and heavy for the middle of the day.  They have an insert to their menu with \"daily specials\" but nothing that really caters to the lunch crowd.  I mean, sometimes I want a light lunch, not a huge heavy lunch that makes me tired for the rest of the day.\n\nAlso, most of the time here it seems to take forever to get our bill, and our food. I know their busy cooking it, but being that they open at 11 AM, and when we arrive we're usually the first people to be in there (aside from a few stragglers at the bar) I wish it wouldn't take so long to get our food.  Plus, we only have an hour for lunch!  One time, it took so long to get our bill, we started getting ansy and tried to hurry out of the place. We have to be back at the office by 12:30, and we didn't get our bills until 12:30!  By the time we all got our change and cards back and left, it was after 12:45, and we didn't get back to the office until 12:50.  We were 20 minutes late back from lunch!\n\nI only go here now because once in a while the ladies from work take me, and its not half bad food.

My friend got the fish tacos which was a huge serving but she thoroughly enjoyed. My conclusion on their food was big portions (I would share next time unless you want leftovers), delicious, and there was a good variety on the menu. As far as the service is concerned (I will first say that I myself am a server so I have taken into account quite a few things),our server took forever to come to get our order and when she finally did she just got the drink order then proceed to run around her section without our drinks for at least five minutes ( we all got beer so should have been fairly quick), then after she dropped those off even though we had our menus stacked to indicate readiness she left and did not return for about 10 minutes. Might I add that it was happy hour when we got there but since she did not take our full order for about 15 minutes we did not get to take advantage of it because the computers switch over automatically. Not to mention she had to keep running back and forth to ask questions, I get it there is a lot to memorize but their menu is fairly small and if you work happy hour you definitely need to know your drink menu. All in all I would return but don't go starving because it may be a while.

It usually has a nice & mature crowd.  The service is usually good.  It was perfect.  \n\nUnfortunately, it was the management and not the lounge that ruined our perspective of the venue.  The manager (Tommy) was slow/nearly impossible to reach and even harder to get info out of.....i.e. Whats your process for group reservations. \n\nHe seemed annoyed that I conntact him and unwilling to make time for us.  After several incomplete emails he finally called me, at my request, but it became clear, after 5 mins on the phone, that he did not want our business.  It was also apparent that he lacked basic customer service skills.\n\nSince, the goal of the evening is relax & enjoy our time with our friends, not to worry about bad service, we took our covo with Tommy as a hint that the Merc Bar would not be a good fit.

I have gone to you over the years while living in the Biltmore/Arcadia area and  have recommended you time and time again to people who want a 'ultra lounge feel' as opposed to a 'club like feel'. Well. After arriving for happy hour last week we had the entire Merc Bar to ourselves at about 430pm and the bartender swiftly brought us a menu and waters. Nice! However, that awesome service went downhill fast and the decibel level of your 90's Culture Club and New Edition beats went way up at the same rate. Soon my two friends and I were yelling our conversation to each other! ' What?!! What?!!! OH right?!! ' Yes. I am not making this up. That music was loud & out of character for what I 'thought ' was a cool, swanky, hip, ittle ultra lounge. I'm thinking some jazz, maybe ?? Or at least some Michael Buble? At a level where your patrons can talk in a voice to each other that doesn't cause laryngitis the next day! We would eventually figure out as Merc began to fill up , that there was a group meeting here this particular day. There were so many, in fact, we could not make our way to the restroom without pushing thru physically. We never saw the cocktail waitress, and that meant we never got our waters refilled after that bartender brought us our initial glass. At any rate , our drink that our once attentive bartender gave us was called the Double A. It was a mix of tequila , grapefruit juice , raspberries , lemon and bitters. It was good! I won't deny that you have amazing fresh ingredient drinks made with premium liquors! That said, we would have stayed and ordered more , but the cocktail waitress had to be flagged down by going to the bar  , ( and fighting the Meet Up crowd again), and telling the bartender we wanted our bill. She came twenty minutes later and we were overcharged for our drinks. Fail. We went back to bartender again because she kept our valet and garage tickets! We felt that trying to 'fight' over a few bucks wasn't worth the effort of the crowd, the loud music and all of the frustration. Oh. MY.

Capital Grille was my second choice -- my first choice was closed for the holiday weekend. And am I ever so glad it was.\n\nWhen making a reservation I dropped that it was a birthday dinner. Upon checking in, the hostess immediately wished him a happy birthday by name and took us to a table adorned with a tasteful amount of birthday confetti and a card signed by the staff. Nice!\n\nFrom there on out the service, food and ambiance was outstanding. It far exceeded my expectations from all the wonderful reviews I had read previously. Our waiter, Chad, was very helpful in helping us select items as we were a little overwhelmed by all the good reviews on yelp and the things people have told us personally. Drinks - a gin and tonic for him and a Stoli Doli for me. Appetizer was calamari, which was delicious. He got the 24 ounce porterhouse, which he ate every bit of. I had the bone-in kona crusted sirloin - AMAZING. A cup of lobster bisque is mandatory. The Lobster Mac and Cheese was an interesting grown-up take on the kid friendly dish. Not as creamy as the microwavable stuff, a little on the soupy side but it was definitely working. We got a creme brulee for dessert, which I discovered upon receiving the check that they comped it for the birthday.\n\nThe service is very well worth noting. I'm not big on fluff and getting my rear kissed as a customer, and the service exceeded standard customer service with genuine sincerity without flirting with that rear-kissing fakeness. Although I suspect if you are of that type that appreciates that, they'll do that too.

Camelback Road\n\n(602) 952-8900\n\nWe arrived for our reservation at 4:30 and were promptly seated. Our waitress was friendly and attentive. We began with cocktails - a Chocolate Martini made without Godiva Liquor and a Mai Tai. The chocolate martini was sent back and was promptly replaced with a correct one made with Godiva Chocolate.\n\nWe quickly dove into the appetizers. Steak Tartare and Lobster Bisque. The Steak Tartare was arguably the finest I have ever eaten, and I have eaten this dish perhaps 40 or 50 times. The texture and seasoning were complete perfection. Were I to return to this restaurant with the ability to order only one thing off the menu, this would be it. Perfectly balanced with capers that weren't too salty, and some wonderful greens with a drizzle of what appeared to be and tested like an aged balsamic. Companion had good comments about the Lobster Bisque, especially the fact that there was more than one piece of lobster in the dish. The bisque is brought to the table with a serving of sherry which is ceremoniously poured into the dish. Personally, I prefer the sherry added at the end of the cooking so that the flavor remains, but the alcohol does not.\n\nThe menu at The Capital Grill is similar to other high end restaurants, in that all main courses are a la carte. Be warned, portions are huge, and unless you are a dyed in the wool carnivore, you will bring home a doggy bag.\n\nAfter perusing the menu and changing our minds a dozen times, we settled on the Steak au Poivre and the Delmonico Steak. I asked for the Steak au Poivre to be cooked rare, and that is exactly what I got. Perfectly cooked with a Courvoisier cr\u00e8me sauce. The sauce was nothing to rave about, in that it added nothing to the flavor of the steak. The steak though, was perfect and huge. I will make at least one more meal out of it.\n\nAs a side dish I ordered Roasted Seasoned Mushrooms, perhaps the only poor selection on the menu. The mushrooms were without any seasoning at all - not even a pinch of fleur de sel or a touch of garlic or even some chopped shallots. Our waitress told us that they had been taken off our check, but looking at it after we left, we found that we had still been charged for them.\n\nCompanion had the Delmonico Steak (rib steak for those not in the know, and usually considered one of the most flavorful cuts of beef) served medium rare. If nothing else, the chef cooks meat to perfection. A huge cut of prime beef, tender and juicy. It's hard to go wrong with this recipe for success. Companion also ordered Cottage Fries and Onion Strings. A table of four would have had trouble finishing a portion the size of what was brought to the table. As with almost everything else, beautifully done.\n\nWe saved room for dessert, and I for one am glad I did. While companion had a scoop of Vanilla Ice Cream, which was nice and tasty and served with a tuile cookie (Pirouine perhaps), I chose the Fresh Berries in Vanilla Cr\u00e8me Sauce. Lush, succulent raspberries, blueberries and strawberries swimming in a nice cr\u00e8me anglais with a sprig of fresh mint on top. What could have been better? A perfect end to our meal.\n\nDings? A few - The mushrooms were terrible. I didn't finish eating them even though I love mushrooms. Some of them weren't even cooked properly. The music is terrible - not only is it way out of style for the restaurant, but also way too loud. Many times it intruded into the conversation, making it all but unintelligible.\n\nCudos? First and foremost for our waitress, who helped make the meal so enjoyable. Definitely for the meat and how it was cooked. Absolutely for the Steak Tartare, which I am going to be dreaming about. And strangely enough, for the immaculately clean restroom, which is something that is too often neglected.\n\nOverall: A top restaurant that I will definitely return to if only to have the steak tartare.", "business_id": "QdbZyl-LWFS54u93Vjd5SA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-07-19", "type": "review"}

You will never be disappointed when going here, whether it's for a special occasion or just for dinner. You can't go wrong when you go here. It doesn't matter if you like steak or not, this place will make it your favorite food. Their impressive menu of nationally renowned dry aged steaks and the freshest of seafood will ignite your culinary imagination as their award-winning wine list of more than 5,000 bottles awakens your inner sommelier. I can never think about steaks the same again after eating here, the best by far is the Kona crusted sirloin. I have never heard of it before but wow was it amazing. Great cut of meat and the sauce was to die for. The French onion soup was great, very light. The soup didn't really grab my attention until I got home and was craving it. Every side dish I had was also great, the mashed potatoes were by far the best; they were hot, cheesy, and just wonderful. I never even though about putting salt or pepper on anything. Everything was perfectly seasoned and amazing. I never have really liked coconut cream pie but I enjoyed this one, so moist and creamy. The cr\u00e8me brulee was a little rich but the fresh fruit they put on top made it much better. Dinner ran about 60 dollars a person not including the wine. It was by far one of the most expensive meals that I have had but it was well worth it and I will most likely be going back. The service is customarily outstanding and the staff's wine and food knowledge is exceedingly above board. The waiters were well dressed and were well spoken. It was great not to have some ditsy waitress for once! No matter what questions you have regarding the restaurant they know it all. The decor is just what I expect from an old school traditional steakhouse, dark wood, cigar humidor, and oil paintings. It not overwhelming and it has this sort of calming effect. It is so much quieter than other restaurants, people talk in a low voice so you can actually hear what your waiter is saying. Everything was very clean; I don't think I could find a piece of old food anywhere if I tried. I would definitely dress a little nicer than you would at other restaurants. They don't care if you just show up in jeans and a tee-shirt but you will definitely stand out. When I went it was a surprise and wow was I underdressed. I felt so out of place and like I didn't belong. I wouldn't recommend this place to bring your children, so I would get a babysitter. You don't want your fantastic meal ruined by screaming children. For larger parties, they have a conference room in a secluded, closed off area. Whether you are having a business meeting or just a party, it is perfect for any occasion. Reservations are not need except for Friday and Saturday nights; don't expect to even see a table on these days without one. On a crowded night parking is a nightmare, I would recommend that you either make reservations really early, really late, or use the valet that they have. I wouldn't recommend going here if it is last minute because you will be waiting for a long time. The American Culinary Federation recently bestowed upon The Capital Grille the \"Achievement of Excellence Award.\" The Arizona Republic said the dry-aged steaks are, \"gloriously beefy and juicy, lightly seasoned and utterly delicious.\" You cant get a review like that if you are just any restaurant, they earned that award for sure. The only part that wasn't one hundred percent to my liking was the temperature that my steak came out. It was perfectly cooked but it wasn't that warm when I got it. It seemed like they had it out on the counter waiting for the other part of the meal, but that was the only thing that didn't meet my standards which is very good for a restaurant. I would highly recommend The Capital Grille to anyone wishing a special dining experience. The place is a little pricy but great places like this should be and believe me, it is money well spent.

I don't mean to be harsh, but I expect A LOT more out of restaurants that charge this much for their food. My mom, brother, boyfriend and I visited Capital Grille, mid-May, for an early birthday dinner for myself. We have never dined at a Capital Grille, but have been to the Palm several times, as well as BLT Steak restaurant group. This was our first experience and last one. We wasted almost $500 on this horrendous dining experience. Number one, we ordered a bottle of wine, it literally took our server, Ken, around 20 minutes to find the bottle of wine in their cellar. We were seated near the cellar where he was searching for the bottle, and watched him. At one point he became flustered and went to check on another table. Finally, he came to table with the wine. My brother and boyfriend started with the French Onion soup, it was decent, but overpriced for what it is. I started with the Lobster Bisque, which had to be sent back because it was cold and had butchered overcooked lobster floating on top. Ken returned with a proper bisque at the correct temperature, also decent but overpriced. My mom had the Spinach salad, very small portion, and the knife cuts were a joke. Mushrooms sliced at different widths, onions, some sliced thin, some sliced thick. Mediocre at best. We didn't even mention the salad until the end of the meal, when things had just become too much. The excuse we received was that this was the \"corporate recipe\", this is how corporate wants the vegetables sliced, in random different sizes, isn't it about presentation, especially when you pay this much? My brother ordered the Dry Aged Porterhouse, my mom ordered the Kona Crusted Dry Aged Bone In Sirloin, and I ordered the Delmonico. We also ordered their \"signature\" potato gratin, creamed spinach, and the Truffle Fries. Unimpressed in the quality and flavor of meat, I'm not sure if they were even serving Prime that day. Maybe a corporate decision? The gratin was a joke, topped with crushed potato flakes, seriously? Creamed spinach mediocre. The Fries were very good actually, but how can you mess up fries? The most disappointing and shocking moment is when Ken tried to argue with my boyfriend that the steak her ordered, the Dry Aged Steak Au Poivre, which he ordered rare, and came out medium, was rare, until he took to the kitchen and put it under the light. Then comes back to tell us that the salad is on them since we hated it, which my mom only said that it wasn't the best and it wasn't the worst spinach salad she has had. They gave us an on the house coconut cream pie to go. Which I took one bite when I got home and threw it away.

I will first start with the wonderful greeting at the door by the hostesses.  I am temporarily in a wheel chair and they just couldn't be quick enough to make sure we were able to get into the door without it being awkward for me.  We had a reservation so we were immediately seated, in a very comfortable spot where my chair wouldn't inconvenience other diners.  That is very important to me, because when I go out to dine, the last thing I want is for my experience to be ruined because of other diners not being considerate. \n\nNext, we were greeted by our server Ken, who by the way happens to be about one of the best servers I think I have ever encountered in this type of establishment.  That isn't to say that our local haunts that we frequent often are not just as good because they are, but this is about this particular experience.  Ken was extremely knowledgeable about their very extensive wine list and very knowledgeable about the specials and how things in the kitchen were prepared.\n\nThe first thing we ordered were the lobster and crab cakes. We asked if they were more meat than breading and he informed us that they were very meaty and he wasn't exaggerating.  I have a very hard time eating much especially if bread is involved.   These were amazing.  I ordered the double bone lamb chops med rare and they came out perfectly, perfectly seasoned and were very good.  My husband ordered the steak delmonico (spelling) and he ordered it med rare also (there is no point in eating it any other way)  Well Ken actually suggested that my husband order this steak medium because of the way the marbling cooked, and so it was ordered medium and he was not steered wrong.  With that we shared the lobster mac & cheese, and wow, just wow.  I am not a lobster lover by any stretch because I've always found it to taste like dirt and be very tough.  I guess the difference here is claw meat rather than a tail. Whatever the difference was, we absolutely loved it.  The only issue of the whole night was SO MUCH FOOD. That isn't a bad thing, we have a teen at home, and how many teens get rack of lamb as a doggy bag?  We did take home some desserts to share with the young one.  \n\nNow to praise the management team.  It isn't all that unusual for managers to come to your table and ask how your meal is, but I have to say that Torri and Bow went out of their way to make sure we were having a wonderful experience, and we noticed that it seemed to be just the way of doing business at the Capital Grille.  It is so nice to be just an average joe and feel like you are a VIP on a night out.  So a personal thank you to both of them for making us feel so special. \n\nIn short, you can't go wrong here.  Excellent service, excellent food that is quite frankly just as simple as it gets, and beautifully done.  A peeve of mine is having a bunch of useless stuff on my plate that just gets thrown away.  Plating can be beautiful without all that, and the Capital Grille has that down.", "business_id": "QdbZyl-LWFS54u93Vjd5SA", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-06-17", "type": "review"}

First of all the service was absolutely horrible. Considering our bill was almost $300.00 for 2 people, you would think the service and food would be good. The waiter, seemingly disappeared during our dinner and I do not believe we saw him more than the initial order and perhaps the bill. Even at that, we had to track him down to get the bill. We left 3/4 of the food on our plates, so obviously it was not good. However, he did not ask us why or inquire about the food. Very bad service overall.\n\nThe food. My husband's was mediocre as he had described it. Mine was horrible. I ordered fish, although I can not recall which type. The meal was so salty I could barely eat it. Not simply from the fish itself, although it was very \"fishy\" but the preparation tasted like 90% salt. Really horrible. I hate to say it, but it reminded me of going to Olive Garden where they pour salt all over your food to mask the lack of quality. This perhaps was even worse than Olive Garden with a steep bill at the end. Horrible. Even their infamous Pineapple Martini was a bust this time. I don't don't what is going on over there but I will NEVER return.

Most places think when you order rare you really want medium rare. They did cook the meat exactly the way I like, a little fleshy in the center. My steak was good but not excellent. A little tough. We ordered the green beans. This was a huge disappointment. I am not sure where this started but green beans need to be mature and cooked, not picked before there is a bean in it and warmed up. Yes I know this seems to be the way you get them everywhere. I was raised where you go into the garden, pick the beans, string the beans, break them into 1 to 1.5 inch pieces. When cooked they are to die for. But now everyone seems to think a immature half cooked bean is the way to fix them. \nThe potatoes were good and our deserts were good. \nIf they knew how to cook green beans they might of got 5 stars. \nHave a great day enjoy good food.", "business_id": "QdbZyl-LWFS54u93Vjd5SA", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-06-17", "type": "review"}

This location at Biltmore has always been spot on. Made a reservation for our anniversary here the night before Valentines Day. We arrived about 10 minutes early and our car service was met with awesome valet guys. We sat at the bar and had pre-dinner cocktails. I've always been treated so well at this particular Capital Grille from valet to valet. I love that when your table is ready they take your tab and your drink for you to your table. This night was our anniversary of a year and our table had rose petals scattered all over it. How nice is that?! We started with a seafood tower. It's our one year and hey, relationships these days that last, deserve pomp and treats! Well.. We like bubbles and food! This seafood tower was divine and we aren't large people; as soon as it arrived, I knew we were in over our heads! Oh well, you only live once .. Spend well! Next we both ordered the filet mignons. My go to steak. I know they do it right and perfect it was this night. We opted for the mashed potatoes and a salad, as well. I think we both had two bites and were stuffed! Our waiter was spot on perfect. So friendly, you can see why Capital Grille is one of the top notch steak houses. He suggested the perfect merlot to pair our filet with and even brought us a complimentary vodka Stoli vanilla cream cordial after dinner drink, just because! As if we weren't stuffed enough and had not been spoiled by the staff enough on our special night, out comes a dessert tray with a chocolate cursive writing of, ' Happy Anniversary!', around several small dessert samplings. So wonderful! I love a classy restaurant like this that loves it's customers and shows it this way. It's a splurge and it's worth it, every single time! Oh..

Three words: Coconut Cream Pie. I'm not even a fan of coconut or these types of desserts, but whatever they put in this dessert is addicting. It's the combination of creamy coconut filling, with a flaky yet soft crust and then the very best part is the caramel. I could eat an entire serving on my own. So whatever you do, don't stuff yourself too much on the delicious steak so you miss out on this dessert!\n\nNow on to the rest of the meal. This Capital Grille has a great location, very friendly staff and a great environment...not to mention the amazing food! Not only do they have a large selection of comfortable booths, but they also have a private room in the back that's perfect for hosting a large group. I've been to a luncheon in the private room before and it was very comfortable. \n\nThe steak here is top quality and fresh! It's tender to the touch and better with each bite. I absolutely love their Lobster Mac N Cheese along with their Au Gratin potatoes. Get both and happily roll out of their like I do! My favorite meal consists of a the Capital Grille chopped salad, the Filet Oscar (topped with crab meat), sharing the Lobster Mac and Au Gratin and completing the gluttonous experience with the Coconut Cream Pie. It's worth every calorie and then some. \n\nImportant Notes:\n\n- They serve lunch and often do amazing three course lunch specials. \n\n- During the summer, they do dining after dark which means they offer a special prix fix menu starting after 8 PM that includes an appetizer, two entrees, two drinks and dessert all for $50!\n\n- Make a reservation, especially on weekends and during the busy season. \n\nA special fun fact: \n\n- I learned an amazing piece of information about their giving.

We went here for my birthday dinner and it was one of the worse meals I've had in a long time. I ordered the Chef's special - a steak served with shrimp on top, served scampi style. This came out on a plate with gigantic grilled shrimp on top. The shrimp were actually really good. Which is sad when it's suppose to compliment the steak. The steak, which is drowning in this scampi (greasy buttery sauce) is completely bland and has no taste - like not even seasoned with salt and pepper. Appears as if the Chef thought hey, all this greasy buttery sauce will cover up the need to season this piece of meat! I would expect this from a Denny's restaurant after a night of clubbing while in college - not for a nice sit down restaurant. I think I've had better steak at Outback Steakhouse. My boyfriend had the filet on the bone. It came out looking like a barbaric slab of meat from the stone ages - again the most bland seasoning you've ever experienced with a steak! Thank God this place had A-1 steak sauce to save grace - he drowned his steak in this to give it some flavour. Pretty sad when you have to ask for steak sauce at a fine dining establishment. Typically a good steak, seasoned and cooked well would require NO additional sauces used so that you could enjoy the full flavour - well this is not the case at this restaurant since the steaks have NO flavour at all. We ordered sides of lobster mac and cheese - this was good with big chunks of lobster. The potatoes were bland and unimpressive. The 2 impressive things about this place were the calamari for starters and the free cheesecake birthday dessert. The waitress gave us each one refill of our drink (I had soda and he had ice tea). The cups were literally the size of a kids cup - towards the end, she didn't even stop to ask if we would care for a refill - we must have hit our 2 drink maximum. Overall, a truly disappointing dinner experience for a hefty price tag of over $190 - with no alcoholic beverages. To pay this price for dinner and still walk out hungry is sad. Save your money if you want mediocre steak - go to Texas Roadhouse. If you're willing to spend the big bucks and want a good steak - go to Flemings or Mortons.

My husband had the Sliced Filet Mignon, and I had the Gorgonzola and Truffle Crusted Dry Aged NY Strip.  We both asked for our meat to be cooked medium rare and they both came out textbook.  Both dishes were mouth watering and absolutely spectacular.

The waiter came out with a stunning plate with a chocolate espresso type cake and a to die for cheesecake that was so light, not heavy like most cheesecakes are.

Looking more like a disco studio than today's refined simple modern standard for restaurants, it's a time warp.\n\nAnd all the staff evidentily were there on the opening day in 1970 as well, but that isn't a bad thing.  They have a very defined \"script\" they follow of an old school Itallian restaurant, and do a good job of it.\n\nAfter being scolded for trying to take the napkin to my lap while my wife's was unfolded by the waiter, I decided to go with it.\n\nWe did the $59 4 course prix fixe menu.  Ask for it if it isn't offered.   All the food was good, most of it ranging from excellent to amazing.  \n\nI ordered the ceasar salad, while my wife ordered the caprese salad.  The ceasar salad was excellent, and while dressing was heavy, it was so dang good I ate every last bit of green.  The caprese salad was different than most, with no vinegar, and over a pile of greens that looked like basil but didn't taste the same.  My wife liked it, but prefers vinegar.\n\nNext I had egglant parmesan, which was a nice small portion and very tasty.  It wasn't fried, which was interesting, and had a cream base to it.   Extremely good.\n\nMy wife had the pasta trio, which was outstanding, because it's clearly homemade.  I mean, melt in your mouth pasta.  Not enough to share, but perfect for a pasta course for one.\n\nNext came the entrees.  I had been tipped off that any fish that came with parmesan encrusted, was MUST TRY.  Mark these words.  You will not go wrong with the parmesan encrusted fish, even if you aren't a huge fish fan.\n\nI ordered the Sea Bass, as I generally prefer that to the Paresan encrusted option, Salmon.\n\nMy sea bass was just okay, but the lemon butter sauce with capers and artichokes was outstanding, and so made up for it almost.\n\nBut my wife's salmon was a thing of beauty.  I mean, perhaps the best salmon I've ever had.  And that's saying a lot.  Lemon butter sauce was even better, parmesan was terrific, and I found myself stealing 1/3 of her dish because I couldn't stop myself.  And I NEVER do that.\n\nSo if you take away nothing from this review, if they offer some fish parmesan encrusted, go for it and don't look back.\n\nLastly, was desert.  I had the recommended creme brulee, and my wife had the cannolis.  The canoli was good, maybe very good.  No complaints.  My creme brulee was just okay.  It has less of a custard consistency than I was used to, and had very little burnt sugar top, which is really important for the experience of creme brulee.  Had the requisite blue berries.\n\nSo that was it.  $65 for two, as we only had water since we started a bit early.  Well worth the price, no doubt about it.\n\nSo if you want to go to a restaurant with outstanding food, see a glimpse of what dining ina  1970's restaurant was really like, and be surrounded MOSTLY by people in various stages of retirement, I highly recommend Avanti.\n\nI wish I tried more of their fresh pasta.  If I was going back, I would probably share a pasta dish with my wife, each have the permasan encrusted fish of the day, and skip desert.  \n\nGood luck and here's to making it back out of the 70's time warp!", "business_id": "vvA3fbps4F9nGlAEYKk_sA", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-08-18", "type": "review"}

That should've been red flag number one. We waited at the entrance for a few moments before we were greeted by whom I guess was the owner. He said he had been expecting us, sat us at our table and disappeared for the remainder of the evening.  Our waiter was odd; he seemed to be in a rush and irritated even though the place was empty. For starters we ordered the pasta trio sampler and the Oyster Rockefeller.  The only thing memorable about the sampler was the gnocchi which was as good as most yelpers mentioned. The Rockefeller may have been the worse I've ever had; the oysters were so tiny I could barely discern them in the heavily creamed spinach. I'm not sure how something so creamy can be so utterly bland and flat. For the entr\u00e9e I had the Salmon which again was drowned in a weird sauce that covered the entire plate. The salmon was moist but the sauce was putrid. It tasted at least 3 days old. The sides were cold oven roasted potatoes which again were covered in that odd sauce. For the finale, I tried the Cr\u00e8me Brulee, again that was a mistake. It was ice cold and had chunks of pineapples in it which is not normal nor was it ever mentioned. The top of the brulee was not properly browned and didn't crack when my spoon hit it. I look forward to cracking my Cr\u00e8me Brulee, darn! Needless to say I will never be back here again.", "business_id": "vvA3fbps4F9nGlAEYKk_sA", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-06-09", "type": "review"}

This restaurant was the whole reason I even joined Yelp. It has and will always be my favorite restaurant in the valley. You may not get it, but that's because you probably suck. \n\nFirst off, this place is totally dated. It's dated because that's part of it's charm. This was the place to dine back in the 80's and early 90's. My grandfather only ate at 3 restaurants in the valley back then: Avanti, El Chorro on Lincoln, and Don & Charlie's. He liked being treated well and these places never missed a beat. Of course, times change, but this is why I will always love this restaurant. It has been consistently good my whole life. Also, it should be noted, if you treat your waiters well, they treat you well. Gramps was a big tipper and he got treated very well. When he made a reservation, he made it with the same waiter, for like 20 years. Ok, maybe not that long, but long enough that he saw my mom through two marriages and several relationships. Well, maybe 20 years isn't off the mark? His drink of choice, vodka on the rocks with anchovy stuffed olives, would be sitting at his table waiting by the time we sat down. Not many restaurants can pull that off. \n\nSo yeah, I am probably biased. But I am biased because I have had some great times in this place over the years. To this day, I never order gnocchi anywhere else. It's always a disappointment. \n\nIt's true, though, the vibe isn't the same as it once was. For one, nobody knows how to dine anymore. Dinner used to be an event. You ordered at least two rounds of drinks before you even considered ordering food. How are you supposed to get a buzz on otherwise? Then you would order some apps/starters, then a main course, then dessert and after dinner drinks. This is the kind of place you spent some time in. This is the kind of place that used to require some proper dining etiquette. I don't find this happening much anymore at Avanti. There hasn't even been a need for valet on my visits over the last several years. That's not a bad thing. Just an observation. Times are changing, and people don't have the money to spend on dinner they used to. One thing that hasn't changed, though, is the food. So I will continue to go back, even if I don't have the time to \"dine.\" I will go back, even though it will always have to be without my grandfather. I will go back just to get a sliver of what this place used to be back in the day ... which was, wait for it, legendary.", "business_id": "vvA3fbps4F9nGlAEYKk_sA", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-08-29", "type": "review"}

The food is excellent and the atmosphere reminds me of an old mobster hang out - not the gritty kind you see on B movies. Rather, it is casually posh.\n\nLocated just east of 27th Street on Thomas road, this cozy place is a quiet gem. There is plenty of parking in front of the restaurant. No valet needed, which is a nice perk in Phoenix. When you walk in, the d\u00e9cor is purposefully outdated in black and white art-deco design, mirrored walls and little alcoves where you can sit in semi privacy. It is usually subdued here - no need to shout at your dinner mates. I really like that.\n\nEven better, the food is superb! I've never eaten in Italy, but I imagine this comes very close to Italian perfection. The pasta is so flavourful, I imagine a little old Italian lady, rolling the stuff by hand. Perfection on a plate. My favourite is their gnocchi. Little pillows of heaven, I tell you, and the accompanying sauce is amazing! I even secretly swiped my finger across the plate and licked it clean when no one was looking (don't tell on me!). I've tried several of their entr\u00e9e dishes too and have yet to be disappointed. The double pork chop is cooked to perfection - tender and juicy on the inside, nicely seared on the outside; and served with a delicious risotto that has me wanting to lick my plate again. If you are looking for a hearty pasta dish, I recommend the Pappardelle with the braised beef ragu. \n\nOne of my favourite things about this restaurant is the atmosphere. From the moment you walk in the door, you have the impression of being in an old, Italian family restaurant from the center of Little Italy New York. Fogeddaboutit! Posh enough to take your date to, but not snobby by any means. Our wait staff have always been personable, attentive and casual. Prices are very reasonable, especially considering the quality and quantity of your meal.  We generally spend $20-30 per dish, plus an appetizer and some wine.\n\nOh!

Even the least attractive girl here would be the best looking girl in most other clubs in town.

It's nice though because there's always something to look at. There are a LOT of girls here too, so you won't be sitting there forever waiting for someone to ask you if you want a dance.

The bartender handed us a thick binder that listed pages of beer and then the description of the beer. They have several different unique beers here and the bartender knows each one! I also enjoyed the food menu. It's simple. It's one item. When we were there, they were featuring a pulled pork sandwich and it was tasty!

Plenty of room for big groups.  I would say there were a couple dozen people there which is pretty good for a Tuesday night.  I didn't visit the bathroom because I was scared to see what it looked like.\n\nThe bartender was just ok.  I got my first drink (draft beer) pretty quickly.  However, when I went up to the bar for a second beer, the bartender was nowhere to be found.  I stood there for about 10 minutes.  She finally came back in after her smoke break and poured me a beer.  I still tipped her because that's how I roll.\n\nThe karaoke was AWFUL.  The song selection was large, but I couldn't seem to find any of my regular songs, which are popular hip-hop songs from the current decade.  If you're into singing Limp Bizkit, Metallica, Pantera and other songs from way back in the day, this place is definitely for you.  You will be entertained by middle-aged obese men moshing next to their table and growling into the microphone, while the host either sings uninvited backup or makes out with her boyfriend.  But that's not even the best part.\n\nMy friends and I wanted to sing a specific song and the host overheard us.  She said cool.  We tipped her (heavily) so she would move us up in the rotation.  We waited about 20 minutes.  Then, she came over and said she didn't have that song.  Surprise.  We asked her to move our other songs up in the rotation and she said no problem, but she did ask me to change my selection (?) for some reason.  I didn't and I really wish I could have gotten my money back.\n\nIt's the most ridiculous karaoke experience I have ever had in my life and I won't be repeating it... ever.

Phoenix is growing up! Wish I knew more about wines to tell you more about that. It appeared to be a nice selection and there were bottles you can buy to take home as well.

Not sure why it took me so long to write my own review, maybe because the 67 that came before mine do a pretty good job of describing it.  However, I woke up today and felt like giving my two cents - so here goes:\n\nWhether you go to Postino for a business lunch, an afternoon glass of wine, a happy hour, dinner, or even after dinner drink - you can't go wrong!  Postino is great for any occasion!  (Although maybe not a big group based on what I read in previous reviews).  \n\nI've been for pretty much all of the occasions listed above, and every visit to Postino, I leave a satisfied customer.  My favorite lunchtime menu items are the brushcetta (perfect for sharing as an appetizer and fun to choose from the variety of delicious selections), the Mixed Greens Salad (which comes with shaved pears, candied pecans, red grapes, gorgonzola, and crispy leeks served with poppyseed vinaigrette - and I usually add turkey to it too), and the Raspberry Chicken Salad.  LOL at my long description, but had to include it all!\n\nI'm not usually a daytime drinker but I'm all for starting happy hour early and taking advantage of 'wine by the glass' $4 special - great wine list! The ambiance and service is fantastic and it's fun to people watch at Postino as well.  It's a fantastic little neighborhood place, and there are several little details that make Postino stand out in my eyes... next time you're there, check out the sugar / sweet'n low dish thing on the table - there's a little something special there if you need to spit out your gum before digging into your meal :)  Also check out the branded rolls of TP in the bathroom - so cute!\n\nCan't wait to go on a Monday night sometime soon to take advantage of their special: $9 off a bottle of wine and pizza from LGO!  Postino has a regular loyal customer in me and I don't see that changing anytime soon!", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-08-23", "type": "review"}

It was on a Tuesday, and I was fortunate enough to stumble onto the online menu beforehand and find that Postino offers $20 bottle of wine AND bruschetta on Tuesdays after 8pm.

The salmon and capers were so tasty!  \n\nNice atmosphere- lots of positive energy.  Our server was efficient, friendly, and never overbearing.  Cute restroom.

And it seemed to me more like a restaurant that sold wine by the glass rather than a traditional wine bar where you could taste and sample different wines.  I tried a temparnillo and the other girls had a verdejo and a chenin blanc.  All were fair, but nothing spectacular.  I just enjoy a little education about the wine, region, winemaker, etc. when I'm trying something new.  Postino did however, have a very cool contemporary design and a great atmosphere.

So, when I set out for Phoenix to spend some quality time with family, my one goal for the low-key weekend was to hit up a local happy hour.\n\nMy great-aunt had heard good things about Postino's and Yelp confirmed it was a solid happy hour bet - coming up 2nd in the search queue. So great-aunt & grandmother in tow, I headed for Postino (quaintly named as the location formerly housed a post office!) for their Sunday afternoon reggae and white sangria. I first noted the full parking lot, which I came to find out later - has discouraged some other relatives from visiting Postino. But for an LA-kid, the fact that free nearby lots and street parking was available - well, ain't that a novel concept?\n\nI also noted was that we did have to add our names to a waiting list; happy hour is not at the bar, per se, it's to be ordered from your seats. So we bopped around the adjacent La Grande Orange shop to bide our time - it also seemed like a good time with good food (albeit loud & busy). Thankfully, our wait was short and we were sat outside, which was fine in the 95 degree temperature - almost everywhere seems to have nice shading and misters.\n\nMy gang of three forwent the $5 wine and beer deals and instead opted for the Sunday special - $5 white wine sangria. I quite enjoyed mine, but my HH partners thought it a bit sour and added splenda. There are no food deals on the happy hour menu, but the prices are not too wallet-depleting. I got the  1/2 Italian Market Salad (greens tossed with roasted beets, goat cheese, bacon (no bacon for me!) and walnuts topped with crisped root vegetables in herb vinaigrette) and  1/2 vegetarian sandwich (grilled Asparagus, roasted artichokes, red onion, vine ripe tomatoes, goat cheese, and house-made pesto) for $9.50 and a cup of the Brocolli-cheddar soup for $2.50. \n\nI didn't leave any room for the bruschetta, but it sounded great - you pick four options of toppings (including brie & apples with fig spread; smoked salmon or salami with pesto; white bean with chopped tomato; ricotta with dates & pistachios, and more) for $12.75.\n\nThe crowd was pretty homogenous - youngish professionals on family time listening to the one-man reggae band. I think it'd be a great spot to catch up with a girlfriend over the weekend. And I'd love to see what kind of crowd the early evening/evening brings. To me, it seems weeknights would be optimal for a date night.\n\nI also wonder about the 11-5 happy hour, which is great for the weekend, but I wonder who can partake on weekdays...", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-07-20", "type": "review"}

In a foodie way, too.\n\nMy boyfriend and I came here on a hot humid Thursday night. The lightings were great to bring a date or to catch up with a friend and there were fairly good amount of room noise to keep your conversation on the privacy level. The service was just lovely. Oh, the little \"Gum\" note-card was utterly cute. You can either spit your gum on the note-card or exchange phone numbers. :)\n\nThe first time I visited Postino, I wanted to come back for more of their bruschettas. My boyfriend and I shared the various bruschetta platter: \n1. Brie & Apples with Fig Spread - He quickly picked this because the first time he had it became his favorite and was confident that I would absolutely love it, and I did -- I loved the sweet taste of the fig with the crunchiness of the apples. yummm! The composition of the brie, apples and fig gives this bruschetta a sweet taste.\n2. Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato & Basil - Since we had 3 more bruschetta options to pick, we went for something light and simple. Everything was fresh! The combination of the mozzarella, tomato and basil was simple yet blended wonderfully together. \n3. Smoked Salmon with Pesto - This was probably my least favorite out of the four, but it was okay. Although the capers were mouth bursting with favors -- which was delish, but it didn't do much justice for the slight fishy taste of the smoked salmon.\n4. Ricotta with Dates and Pistachios - By the end of the night, he declared that this became our favorite bruschetta, evar! I think they toasted the dates a bit or something of that sort, but it was perfect. The pistachios weren't dry and the ricotta wasn't an overload. All three components made it tasted like sweet heaven in your mouth. When I think of bruschetta, I immediately think savory, but there's nothing wrong with a dessert bruschetta, right? I think not. The texture of this was just perfect. No complaints here!\n\nHe and I tend to order enough to feed 4 hungry men when we dine out. So we also called for the Panini -- the Vegetarian Panini on ciabatta to be exact. We had the side salad with crumb goat cheese. Meh, I didn't care much for this panini, maybe because I was already full off of the tasty bruschettas!\n\n\nThere's a $3 charge for Valet.

That said, mad props to Postino for preserving this landmark.\n\nToo be fair, I'm not a wine expert nor a frequent wine drinker.  If you are, you're more than covered at this neighborhood hangout.  The food, while a limited selection, is excellent.  I've had a couple of the paninis and the bruschetta and I've never been disappointed.  My favorites are the Turkey Panini and the Smoked Salmon and Pesto Bruschetta.  Light and flavorful and a nice complement to the Syrah I had.  \n\nThe atmosphere is very urban and industrial and is absolutely jam packed at night.  A little noisy at times for my taste as sometimes I've had to yell at my friends for them to hear me, but I pretty much expected that with the crowd this place draws.\n\nAll in all, a nice addition to the neighborhood.  Postino's reputation in the Arcadia neighborhood brought me in, and the good food and relaxed atmosphere has made me a believer.  If you're a nightlife fan then come here at dinnertime or after a movie.  If you're a foodie (like me) I recommend coming here for lunch (or Sunday Brunch) when its more relaxed and not as crowded.  If you're a wine buff, then you're good here at all hours.  RIP to Katz, but a nice new chapter for this historic location", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-08-09", "type": "review"}

The hostess told me they were busy and can't let people just hold tables all day for their friends.  She rudely said she would seat me now since I complained and lead me over to 2 lounge chairs with 2 wobbly end tables pushed together to make a table.  The idea was cute but made for an awkward eating experience since I was leaning forward and bending down to enjoy eating my lunch.  I had specifically asked for a table so I wasn't sure if we got seated at this table because I had complained as there were other more eating friendly tables available.\n\nThe whole ordeal was very off putting so my friend and I stayed for a bit and then went to another restaurant", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-08-15", "type": "review"}

We went on Monday, when they have a $20 deal for a bottle of wine and a plate of bruschetta. The wine that they serve is their \"house\" wine, but it knocks the socks off of your typical house wine. The Bruschetta makes a great meal by itself if you want. There are 11 choices (various toppings) and you can have up to four different ones per plate (really a long-handled cutting board, which makes for a nice presentation). The Bruschetta is carefully sliced into smaller pieces so that several people can try each kind. Be prepared to eat and drink a lot; it is such a deal that you will have a hard time saying \"no.\"\n\nI mostly stuck to the beer that was on draft. There were only two choices, both very good. The draft beer was fresh and refreshing, plus at $7.50 for a small pitcher anytime it was quite a deal. If you come for the earlier happy hour it is $5/pitcher or $5 for a glass of wine, so you can't go wrong. It makes sense to have a small draft beer selection since they are a wine bar and it helps them move through the kegs quickly. I ordered the prosciutto with brie panini, which I had no trouble sharing with my friends. You get the choice of ciabatta or focaccia bread and fresh-made chips or salad- the chips and ciabatta bread were great. Our server helped me pick the ciabatta bread, which she accurately described as the \"thinner, crispier\" one for my panini.\n\nThe service here is amazing. Our servers were very patient and helpful. The busser would give any Indian restaurant a run for their money with his diligent water-refilling, plus he was thoughtful enough to get our server's attention if we needed anything else. Everyone was dressed nicely and very friendly. At one point a piece of bruschetta fell onto the table or the floor. Without even mentioning it, out server brought over a replacement. She must have noticed from somewhere else in the restaurant and wanted to help.\n\nThe restaurant had a very appealing atmosphere. Lights were dim, but not dark. The colors on the walls made it feel vibrant. Chairs and tables were comfortable, well-maintained, and fit in with the style of the restaurant. It might have been louder if we sat inside, but we were on the patio. Outside we sat in the shade (we arrived when it was still daylight) and the water misters helped keep us cool. The bathrooms are in the back corner, opposite of the front door. You might have to ask a server to point out where to go, but they are glad to help. The fact that the bathrooms simply say \"Both\" could be an interesting conversation point if you have to wait in line.\n\nThe parking is valet, but you shouldn't be driving anyway. Take a cab if you can help it, or bring a designated driver. The experience is so nice that you won't want to leave, unless maybe you make a friend to bring with you.", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-07-25", "type": "review"}

We went on a Sunday afternoon (right around 12pm) and had no issues with parking.  We scored a spot in front of the restaurant just as someone else was leaving.\n\nThe place was fairly busy and our party of two was immediately seated at a low table in the front (right by the acoustic musician).  Postino was well decorated and has a ton of seating options.  We wanted to fall in love with this place but just ended up liking it slightly. \n\nWe ordered the butchers block and the bruschetta plus cucumber lemonade and iced tea.\n\nWhile everything was okay, I wasn't knocked out of my socks.  My favorite part ended up being the butchers block rather than the bruschetta.  I think the issue that they have is that it is not crispy enough.  The bread was under-toasted and it made for a very chewy experience.  We ordered the Salmon pesto (the smoke flavor is weak and the pesto is strong so it misses there), Burratta, bacon, arugula and tomato (while our waitress claimed this to be her favorite, we were underwhelmed here too.  The bulk of the flavor came from the bacon and the arugula), tomato, basil and mozzarella (my favorite combo done wrong!  There was NO flavor to this and they should have at least provided an olive oil or balsamic drizzle to give it some pop.  The tomatoes weren't fully ripe either and were at the pink stage so they hadn't developed their true tenderness) and Prosciutto, fig and marscapone (by far our favorite since the flavor profile gave us a little bit of sweat, savory and salty).\n\nAll-in-all the place wasn't bad.  Based on the reviews though I just expected a wee bit more from my experience here.  I liked that they have live entertainment on the weekend although it makes it hard to hear when you are seated to close.\n\nI saw some folks sitting outside although I am not sure of how they survived in 110 degree weather.  On cooler nights though, I can see that being a nice place to hang.\n\nOh, I also didn't appreciate having to battle flies for my food.  They kept the door open which meant every critter wanted to beat the eat and join the tables. \n\nNot sure about returning as I've had this food concept before except with better execution.", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-08-08", "type": "review"}

The Arcadia location is in a cool neighborhood and the building opens up on one side to an outdoor patio... which is awesome on an evening with nice weather.\n\nI have to admit, I haven't tried very much from the menu.  Every time I come, the rest of the table and I order bruschetta to share and some wine.  Although I'm sure the rest of the food is great, I really do recommend bruschetta.  There are 12 different varieties to choose from, with everything from the classic tomato, mozzarella and basil to brie with apple slices to prosciutto.  Every single one is delicious.  They work well for one order for two people, so order accordingly.  For our group of 4, we got 2 orders.  With four varieties each, we got to try 8 of the 12 available.  It was easiest to say that we'd try one of everything, with the exception of the ones that had an ingredient someone at the table would prefer to skip.\n\nWe also split a bottle of wine, which complimented the meal very well.  Our server was knowledgeable enough to recommend a bottle based on what we were in the mood for, and he really hit the mark.  We were amused that the woman whose job it was to fill water glasses would come around so often that the glass never got below half empty.  It was almost too much, but hey, we stayed well hydrated.\n\nThe atmosphere is very \"cool\" with dim lighting, modern decor, and a definite wine theme throughout.  Service has been excellent each time I've dined here.  Those are perks for sure, but the bruschetta would keep me coming back anyway!  Check out any of the Postino's that may be near you!  If you go in on Monday or Tuesday after 8, their date night special is a bruschetta platter and a bottle of wine for $20.  Can't beat that!\n\nKeep in mind that Postino Arcadia is valet parking only ;)", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-06-23", "type": "review"}

If you are not sure which to try, ALWAYS try the Postino exclusive. It will never let you down.

No suggestions on a wine, no questions if we had questions, just \"you ready to order?\"\n\nWe ordered a bottle and bruschetta and our waiter disappeared.  For the rest of the night.  I watched him refill wine glasses at other tables, ours was brought by another server.  Other tables had their plates cleared when they were finished, ours sat in front of us until another server took them away.  Our server obviously didn't want our business because about an hour after we sat down he came back to the table and asked if we were interested in any dessert.  We said no and he immediately dropped the check on the table and left.  No offer of another round of drinks, just here is your check.\n\nThe wine we had was amazing and was a steal at the price plus the bruschetta.  The bruschetta themselves were half assed.  3 of the 4 weren't even sliced all the way through but over all they were decent.\n\nYet again Postinos shows they want my money but not my patronage.

It was quite tasty, a little dry so maybe a splash more of vinaigrette, and the quinoa was cooked perfectly.  A nice blend of flavors and textures throughout.

On the way back home from the airport my friend and I decided to stop for a nosh and wine.  When we got there late afternoon, we were welcomed immediately and cheerfully and seated promptly.  As soon as were seated, one of the wait staff brought us water and took our order for a bottle of Caparza.   It was a lovely Italian, a fill bodied Sangiovese Tuscan but not as murky as a Chianti.  It was delicious from the first sip to the last drop.  If you like Italian reds, this is a really good one.                                                                                           We next ordered our food and my friend ordered the bruschetta, I wanted a panini and settled on the autostrada.  One of Postino's delights is to choose your favorites when ordering the bruschetta s there are some wonderful choiced. He ended up with the salmon, caprese, artichoke and the green apple toasts. Each one offers a unique blend of flavors and no one does it better than Postino.  The Autostrada panini has all the right meats and cheeses but I am not a fan of the arugula and tomato.  I took those off and added them to my side salad and took a bite.  Each bite took me back to a stop I made on the way from Naples to Salerno where I had a similar panini with such wonderful flavors.                                                                                                                  The food and wine would earn this wonderful restaurant five stars but the Postino service by committee is not my favorite.  It creates uneven service and no one seems totally responsible for your table.  Other than that, Postino continues to be a wonderful gem in the Arcadia neighborhood and highly recommended.

Now she claims to just hate Ciabatta bread, but she was not in the mood for eggs.  ***** That was the 5-star rating she gave the dish as it was (as she admitted) the best French Toast she ever tasted.  I on the other hand always go for the biggest dish, so I ordered their Farm Scramble - Eggs, potatoes, onions,  \"secret\"  herbs of some sort and two kinds of cheese.  It came with a  salad of mixed greens and cherry tomatoes.  I had to take the salad even though I don't \"ever\" have salad for breakfast.  I moved the salad to one side and licked off the fork .... The best tasting dressing I had tasted in years.  So I finished off the salad (that I never eat) and dug into the eggs ... Yum Yum Yum, I now have a new favorite breakfast dish.  You want a Mimosa to go with the meal?  Order  up.  We are going back this Sunday with our friends and I would highly recommend it to everyone.

Try the bruschetta board for sure, and usually the seasonal option is great. We went there last night and the service is simply amazing. My water was full the entire time I was there and the food came out very quickly. We arrived around 6pm and they were decently busy, but we didn't wait for a table which is nice. We have been to the Monday/Tuesday 8pm special before and that gets extremely busy. Make sure you arrive a little before 8 and you will probably wait a bit for a table but it's worth it! A board of bruschetta and a bottle of wine for $20... can't beat that anywhere! Maybe one of the best aspects of this restaurant is that they do not upcharge bottles of wine 90% like many others do.

Expectations may have been off, as we came here for a nice dinner, but this place probably should be treated more as a trendy appetizer or drink spot. Great atmosphere and service, and at one point could picture having a large group together on the large seating area in the back. Not really sure what I'm missing though, the bruschetta was good-not-great, and if you don't feel like a salad or panini for an entree, your options seem limited. For a trendy drinking hole, there could've been a few more than 4 beers on tap. As tasty as Deschutes River Ale is, there are usually more options in most other bars that offer any craft beer. Didn't take a serious look at the wine list this time around. Trying many different kinds of bruschetta in one order was a nice way to taste many things, and appreciate that they were trying interesting ingredients such as the tomato spread, but again, nothing I'll be remembering or craving. Would like to try the butchers block if there's another visit. Didn't try the dessert, as La Grande Orange is right next door, and our loyalties are there for sweets. The outdoor patio looked inviting, and would like to kick it there when its not so Phoenix-y in the middle of summer. Would like to give it another shot some other time, but probably wouldn't wait in line to do so.", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-08-07", "type": "review"}

Today is my Birthday & thanks to them my day is ruined & I walked out crying & I still am.\nI called them on the 29th & asked if I could make a reservation. They said they don't take reservations & since it was a party of 3 it would be ok & won't be too full either as it's  a Tuesday .\nWe went to Postinos on College Avenue Tempe. They said our wait was 1 hour. We got there at 8.30.\nThen I called Postinos in Arcadia & told them we were at College Avenue & the wait was 1 hour & it was my Birthday & we didn't want to wait here outside in the heat & I asked if they were full as well & if there was a wait there as well. The guy who answered said there was no wait & they were not full & that the restaurant at College Avenue is always full. I told him we were heading  there & if we could put our name on the list. He said they don't take names over the phone.\nWe took 17 mins to get there & with parking I would say 20 minutes. \nWhen we went in the lady there tells us the wait will be 40 minutes. I had my old Mother also with us. She is 82 years. There was no place to even sit & wait. My Husband went in again to ask if we could sit somewhere & they tell us we can sit at the bar. The bar stools are so high & my Mother couldn't sit there, but we thought we will try as anything was better than standing in that warm air outside. When my husband came out & went back in with us, the lady says Oh! Someone just sat there so there's no space. She then says she will ask the Manager to talk to us.\nThen we asked if we could sit at the table outside, at least while we wait. We waited there for 25 minutes & couldn't take the heat anymore. Someone was nice enough to give us 3 glasses of water. The Manager never came out to talk to us.\nI was so disappointed & fed up. Tears just rolled down my cheeks as it was my Birthday & this is what I got. \nI couldn't take it anymore, I told my Husband let's just leave. I just wanted to go home.\nI went in & cancelled my wait & I told the lady please thank whoever answered the phone & said there was no wait. Thanks to him my Birthday Celebration was a total disaster. I asked her what happened to the Manager who was supposed to talk to us. Then she says she thought I said I didn't want to talk to the Manager.\nEverything was an excuse made for their benefit.\nShe says she didn't answer the phone & there was nothing she could do about whoever told me anything. I told her it was not her fault & that I was only telling her what happened, as she was the only one there.\nI even showed her my call log to prove I had called them. I then requested to speak to the Manager & explained to him what happened. He really didn't seem to care. He said from the time I got from College Avenue  to Campbell Avenue, they could get busy & there could be a wait. He said maybe when I called there was no wait but it got full in 20 mins. \nIt seemed unbelievable to me that in 20 minutes a whole restaurant just filled up so much inside & out & also caused a wait of 45 minutes. Just cannot happen.\nHe was not apologetic or didn't even try to check if he could get us a table or offer any options at all. He was very off handed & just couldn't be bothered. He didn't even check how long more we had to wait or ask us if we would want to wait a few more minutes. Nothing at all. He just seemed happy that it was 1 group less & he could wash his hands off. He Just said it is what it is.\nI walked out then & heard the Manager & the lady who seats Customers having a good laugh. It might be a laughing matter to them, but I want them to know that they ruined my Birthday. I planned so much & wanted to go there as that's always my special occasion restaurant. We went there for our wedding Anniversary for brunch & last year my Husband had a surprise party for my Birthday also at Postinos. I wanted it to be my Celebration there this year too.\nInstead I am now going to bed hungry as I just lost my appetite & I am so very sad. I came home & cried so much. It was past 9.30 & too late to get dinner from any place & I was not in the mood to sit & order. We went to a drive through & got some food for my Husband & My Mother.\nSo thanks to The lovely people at Postinos my Day, I planned so much for was ruined.\nI will never go back, as it will be bad memories.", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-06-30", "type": "review"}

For Realz!!!!\n\nThis deal can't be beat. This place is cool. It's in a trendy part of Acadia. Your always in for some juicy upper middle class gossip here, the crowd is 80% yuppie hipster. \n\nIt is hard to differentiate between the staff and the customers, but that is kind of Postino's thing.\nI haven't had the best service here always, I don't fit in. I'm one of those old school hip hop guys so when I come in here, I feel I kind of stick out but it seriously is a good wine bar, and good wine bars are hard to come by. \n\nI do enjoy people watching thou, and this place is definitely good for that, it's good for dates, you are sure to see allot of first daters and couples without kids here that have been together for ever just staring at their food not talking...awkward!!!!\n\nThe ambiance is always good the lighting is just right. You can smell the love in the air... then again maybe that is the bruschetta...I love the Bruschetta...only place with better Bruschetta might be North...also in Arcadia...BRUSCHETTA WARS!!!\n\nSometimes they have live music here. Always a plus...love live music, I wished more places did this. \n\nAnyhow besides the snooty staff, this place is pretty cool. \n\nI'd give it five stars if I looked like I walked out of a JCrew catalog or if  had the latest thrift store Macklemore look going on, maybe I could relate better to the staff...but I grew out of that trendy shit in like 2004. I look like I came from the gym when I come here...and I just assume the staff assumes I have no money and give me attitude. \n\nI just don't care.

The food cooked by Julio is wonderful.  The wings are the best in town.  They are fried then tossed in mild, honey, fire or a few other sauces and then fried again.  They are they best wings.  I saw that others posted that they seem smaller but, that could be because you are getting a wing that is really crispy.  They aren't cooked a bit then drenched in a sauce then put on a plate. Yuk!  They are given a quick drench in the frier and crispy.  Bravo Julio.  The waitress' are wonderful.  Be careful because as \"Ron White\" say, \"I have been over served\".  They have cabs waiting and I since I drive by in the mornings I have to laugh but feel relieved that there are cars in the parking lot and the \"over served\" took a cab.  On Saturday's they have the best Prime Rib in town and for under $17.  you get the Prime Rib, salad and a baked potato.  I also love the tacos special.  I thought it was taco Tuesday but maybe it's Taco Thursday.  Great special.  Now I must say that it's a old neighborhood bar in a old little strip mall.  Growing up down the road since the 60's I saw how the bar used to be.  It was where the men and \"drunks\" would go to drink.  I always say that it was my friends and I that changed the place.  My husband would go there with some friends and slowly slowly I would go.  I would be dressed up and feel very out of place.  Eventually about three years later I saw the change that I fell we instigated in about 2005.  It is now a tavern that you can take your girl to, if they are open to a \"tavern\".  I will warn you that because it is in a little strip joint they can have some plumbing issues and sometimes you may get a septic fume.  I just say \"oh well that's JT's\".  The people, service, drinks and cost are worth it.  I like the low lights and the mini Christmas lights strung and all the old memorabilia and hundreds of patron photos on the wall.  It will always be a bar where I know I can go in, sit at the bar and start up a conversation and have a great time.

I was asking myself, who the HELL *are* these people, getting loaded this early?!\n\nFast forward two years later, and I've become one of \"those people\"  Well, with the caveat that I'm not getting loaded.\n\nNow I figger that my excuse is about as good as they come.  I'm working nights from 6pm to 6am, and after putting in a 12 hour shift, sometimes a man wants to have a damn drink, get something to eat, read the newspaper, relax a bit.  This avoids the unwelcome alternative of \"unwinding\" by drinking at home alone at 7am,  which tends to generate feelings of being a total loser.\n\nSo anyway, ye Old Brass Rail opens bright and early at 6am, which is perfect.  As with any bar opening at this hour, there is your contingent of old man alkeeholic regulars, but this particular place also seems to be popular with the nurses getting off the night shift at a nearby hospital.  They usually enter in groups of 2-4, ordering double long island ice teas, and getting their drink on in their scrubs.  Some of them are even cute.\n\nThe service is attentive and low-key.  Drinks are cheap and there are several breakfast specials available for under $5.   The food is nothing amazing but it gets the job done and the price is definitely right.   The first time I walked out of there after paying $7 for breakfast with a tall  gin and grapefruit juice, I knew that I had found a winner.\n\nThere is a smoking patio with misters, but much to my dismay I got bawled out one day for taking a plate of pancakes out there. APPARENTLY, there is no food served on the patio, nor is the consumption of food that you have brought out to the patio yourself tolerated.  The reason given was pretty lame too, it basically boiled down to the fact that they didn't want to deal with people bitching about smoke ruining their breakfast, or something, blah blah blah.   So far, that has been my only negative experience at this place.\n\nThe joint could use face lift, like another reviewer mentioned, but doing so might erase some of its character.\n\nJust watch your step on the way out the door, there's a slight incline that's easy to get tripped up on. :-O  Regulars will back me up on this.", "business_id": "RIeWXLMHZQlYprYt1x2f1w", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-07-19", "type": "review"}

I had planned to meet a couple of friends and watch a rare ASU baseball broadcast on national TV.  I arrive first, and have to practically beg to have the game put on one of the many TVs present.  (I'm sure none of the other 3 people in the bar were watching Jeapardy).  Another patron (one of 3 already there) had asked previously, he told me later, only to be shot down by the manager.  So then I asked if I could actually listen to the game, too?  No such luck.  Did I mention this was the home-town ASU baseball team, nationally ranked, fighting for their post-season?  And a sports bar opts to play 80's hits, instead?  I quickly called BS on that, and as soon as the rest of my party arrived, we left.  If you want a \"sports bar\" near Squaw Peak, I suggest trying 16th St. Sports Bar n Grill, instead.\n\nI've been to many Suns games and other events at Gallagher's, so I assumed they would have a local sports team on tv with audio.

When I was there, a Monday during happy hour, there were about equal number of wait staff to patrons, and it still took 10 minutes to get a drink.\n\nI'm very disappointed in the service, and the lack of understanding by the management.

They were training a new server, who was from New York, so she came replete with a touch of attitude, and not enough training.  Thankfully, middle management saved the day!  The question was whether the nachos (do NOT order, by the way, they're borderline inedible, but then i don't particularly like nachos under the best of circumstances) contain beans, even if you order them with chicken instead of refried beans on top.  Somehow, someway, we got confused and assumed they did.  Our server, upon being complained at, simply walked away without a word.  Needless to say, there were comments made at our table.  That's when middle management stepped in.  He explained that it's an either-or proposition, enlightening us.  He then went above and beyond, bringing us a cup of the delicious refried beans (which I tried despite my distaste for the whole nacho thing and found to be completely and totally 100% awesome).  Thank you, sir!  At some point, I ordered a burger, which I wholeheartedly enjoyed.  It's enjoying me right now, quite enthusiastically, I might note.  *gurgle*\n\nAnyway, I don't have a great feeling about this place's future in my repertoire of places to drink.  If the unsung hero isn't there to help you out, the service will not be good.  No attitude, per se, just poor service, which is possibly more unforgivable in my book.  The perfect storm is poor service with attitude, but for that you gotta go to Pomeroy's (can we go back there again soon so I can find justification to SLAM that place in my update? please?)  The environment is typical sports bar, with a moderately clean bathroom (thank you again, unsung hero!).  The food is very uneven, even for a sports bar.  Those fries should not be heavily salted.  I don't care who likes them that way, I will not eat them covered in salt.  I will not eat them with a malt.  I do not like them, not one bit!\n\nAnyway, I don't have any particularly hostile feelings towards this place.  My burger was good, the beer selection was decent and the prices were (in theory, at least) great.  Give that floor manager a fancy set of whip and chains and...  I dunno, redecorate?  somehow import some atmosphere someway, i don't know or care how, and this place will get more stars.  I should note that I am quite sure they messed up my check.  The beers were supposed to each be $4, in fact I carefully ensured that each beer I ordered (ok, that might be a total lie) was a $4 beer, and yet my bill came to $26.  I only had three, plus a nine-dollar burger.  I don't think they were trying to rip me off, but as a cheap person, I find this slightly offensive.  Granted, I'm partially to blame for not, I dunno, reading the bill when I got it?  anyway, I'll forgive you, this time, Gallagher's, but you're on my watch list.

We missed dinner due to the time of our flight and were starving.\n\nSince we hadn't rented a vehicle, we searched Yelp for places within walking distance that were open late. Two nearby options turned up: a tex-mex place down the street and Gallaghers.  We tried the tex-mex place first (Aunt Chiladas; reviewed separately).  Despite that location's restaurant's website stating it was open until 2am, we were dismayed to find out that they only serve alcohol after 10pm. We asked the bartender about Gallaghers (and any other nearby alternatives) and he told us to avoid Gallaghers like the plague.  Funny--our cabbie from the airport said the place was greasy but a local favorite.\n\nWe decided to risk it...and I'm glad we did.  Gallagher's has a dining room separate from the bar.  We arrived around 10:30pm, and there were two other groups enjoying meals. The dining room was dimly lit and felt like it belonged in a cold Midwest metropolis--kinda like a Chicago/Detroit version of Cheers.  The bar (which we never visited) sounded busy and happy with loud music that battled with the dining room's music to make a pleasant cacophony of white noise.  We were exhausted, and the seats were comfy...the hostess was VERY attentive (but not pushy), and instantly brought us large fresh glasses of water. \n\nAs for the food.  We ordered the appetizer platter (fried mushrooms, zucchini, onion rings and mozzarella sticks). It was wonderful, plentiful, not too greasy (despite being all fried food), and piping hot with crispy fried batters. My husband ordered the cheeseburger. He loved it.  I felt yucky from my half day of traveling, so I ordered a small spinach salad. The salad could have been wonderful, with thinly sliced sweet red onions, crispy bacon pieces, mushrooms, almond slivers, and an oriental dressing on the side. Unfortunately, the spinach was beyond dry, and did not seem like it had been washed.  The mushrooms looked like they had been picked from the grocer's bin and chopped without inspection, washing, or even wiping with a wet cloth.  I swear I could see bits of the manure on a few slices.  As I dug below the surface of the salad, I identified several spinach leaves which were close to a gelatinous state. \n\nIn short--the service was great, the grilled/fried food is wonderful, the atmosphere is comfortable and inviting. Will definitely go again..maybe try their pizza or wings.  \n\nI learned two things--never order a salad from a bar (unless it is a salad bar), and always trust a cabbie's opinion over that of a competing bartender.", "business_id": "F-ykHfGY9lWr12OJ_Ofy7A", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-08-15", "type": "review"}

Of course at that point we are forced to send it back and wait for another 20+ minutes for our food to come out.

I'm not going to eat some nasty heat lamp food because you messed up.\nSo finally the food comes out after 25 minutes and the next thing I know is I look down and my plate has all sorts of spice on top of the beef, shrimp & chicken. I ask the guy why is all this nasty red spice sauce is on there and he tells me he thought I said I just didn't want peppers & onions. What part of PLAIN is that difficult to understand especially after the first plate that was brought out didn't have anything on it!\n\nNeedless to say the newer manager didn't do a damn thing no discount no apology absolutely nothing.

We have not stopped going ever since.\n\nPersonal favorites: homemade chicken noodle soup (odd for an Italian place, I know), freshly grated cheese in their shakers (which I eat as an appetizer in itself), and their alfredo sauce, which is NOT to be messed with.  I also have had their stuffed shells, which are to DIE for.  The red sauce is amazing, sweet yet tangy and succulent.  \n\nAside from the excellent food, which is the reason for the 5 star rating, this place is a bar.  They have a few games (pool, darts, etc.) when you first walk in, and a wrap around bar in the back.

The lamb was so tender it just fell off the bone. Placed over linguine it was a lot of food for me so I took my left overs home. I rarely will eat left overs but this dish was so good I warmed up the left overs the next day, FOR BREAKFAST! LOL It tasted just as good too!  Another dish that I would highly recommend is the Zucca ravioli. Its a butternut squash ravioli that is served in this 4 cheese sauce.  Surprisingly, the sauce is not heavy at all as you would expect with a 4 cheese sauce. The combination of the butternut squash ravioli and the airy lite cheese sauce is complete heaven! Im not even a fan of any kind of squash but this is my new favorite dish and I would order this dish without a second thought. Its absolutely delicious and you will enjoy it again and again.

But thats good they're $10 all day long. I don't know why places charge $20 and whatnot you can't even touch for that. The girl's skill ranges from average to excellent. Mostly average, but they get me aroused which gets the job done. I happened to be wearing a hat when I went and the girl used it in her routine, it was a nice little touch.\n\n-VIP ROOM\nThey also have a VIP room where basically you can grab their T&A. It's $40 to get in & $20 per dance. So It costs $60 to get in. It's exspensive I know but if you see something you just gotta get some hand time with, it might be worth it. And once you pay the $40 to get in your covered for the whole day.\n\n-THE BAR\nThe bar is pretty good, it's missing some of the more common beer on tap but if you're flexible it's a good way to save some bucks. They've got a lot of the more common beers in bottles, a little more exspensive but not $5 bucks a pop like you'd expect. The bartenders are very cool and pour good drinks. There is one or two pool tables and plenty of TVs playing games.\n\n-THE WEEKEND\nTo cover my weekend experience, I didn't really enjoy it the most. First off I'm not the kinda guy that likes a big crowd and this is amplified on the weekend by how small this place is. This is the utter defininition of hole in the wall, but thats why I like this place. Secondly the girls don't approach you as much on the weekend, so it's like you have to go hunt them down, which is the opposite of why I go to the strip club. There is a $5 cover which is very reasonable. I have to say they come out guns blazing with the women, very good selection for whatever takes your fancy. You do need to be careful though some of the women are hustlers and some are real sweethearts just hoping to give you a good time. If you go to the VIP room they might say you got more dances than you did. This didnt happen to me personally but I've heard about it. One girl I brought kept reminding me how many dances I'd gotten(very nice) the other one kept trying to confuse me and buy her exspensive shots. Which sucks cause that one girl is ruining the place's reputation of good service and friendly atmosphere. Just keep your wits about you.\n\n-THE WEEKDAY \nI have a much better time on the weekdays! The place isn't packed, it's much quieter. It's just a cool place to relax and get some female companionship. Everybody's just so laid back and friendly. The women are always coming over to check on you. Their might not be as many to choose from in the middle of the day but there is nothing wrong with their selection. All very good looking women, but you may have to settle for smoldering temptress if the schoolgirl with glasses isn't in yet. There's no cover charge before 6pm so if you plan on being there all night come at 5:30 for free. Happy hour is everyday from 11am-6pm, $1 off drinks. \n\n-OVERALL\nA really cool, inexspensive place to go for T&A. \nP.S. the ATM charges $7 per transaction.", "business_id": "e6i8v7VkD8yJk02PH4d9VA", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-07-29", "type": "review"}

I heard about this place as a decent dive in town, and it was just down the lot from me.  \n\nI walked in and saw what looked like a pretty decent place.  It was a slow night for a weekend, so I went to the bar and stationed a bar stool.  The bartender did the usual \"Hi, what can I get you.\" \n\nI had a country fried steak and a beer.  For 12 dollars, it was a decent meal, and I was happy I ordered it.  Cheap eats and decent booze..\n\nA weekend later I came back.  This time there was two bartenders and the bar was full, so I took a seat at one of the booths.  I sat for about  ten minutes waiting.  One of the kitchen guys saw that I hadn't been helped and showed up with a menu and asked me what I wanted to drink.  \n\nI was thankful he helped me.  I ordered a water and a kiltlifter, a Phoenix microbrew.  He told the bartender that had ignored me up until that point that I was indeed there and had intent to be a paying customer.  She showed up with my Kiltlifter and asked if I wanted to eat something, of which I did order the country fried steak off the night menu again.  I reminded her I wanted a water too.  \n\nSo I get my food. Still no water.  I ask for it again. She said sure.  Ate my food, then got my tab.  Still no water.\n\nFirst experience: Good.  Second experience: Not so good.\n\nI would recommend this place for a good bite to eat, but don't expect to be able to rehydrate here...

One: I need to get my tattoo.  Two: The Blooze has officially dethroned \"The Bikini\" as my favorite dive bar. \n\nWe went to \"The Blooze\" last night to check out a couple of surf-rock bands, The Surfside IV and Secrete Samurai, from San Diego.  Now normally, The Blooze is a NASCAR haven.  NASCAR memorabilia adorns every surface but the floor in the place.   I was a little apprehensive of checking out this place, but there was no need to worry.  This place is great.  Plenty of seating throughout the bar, a dance floor, and they even had Guinness on tap which is always good.   While the bands were playing classic movies featuring Tony Randall and Jane Mansfield were playing on the many TV screens throughout the bar.  There are two pool tables that were occupied most of the evening.  Outside they had VIP parking for hotrods so it was like a mini car show and great music.  The best part about the night was the Surfside go-go dancers and their little \"Devilette\" horns. Very cute!\n\nAll in all, I give \"The Blooze\" four out of 5 stars and look forward to the next Surf Rock band night.", "business_id": "f_leeIRar8uNCkk5sAmHRQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-08-21", "type": "review"}

The bathroom was great! \nThey don't have food there but they will let you bring in whatever you want. We went there pretty early, around 7:30ish. Unfortunately, because of ridiculously early work on Fri AM, I had to leave once it was starting to get really packed and lively around 10:30/11.

Every Thursday night is rockabilly night, if you've never been for this music it's a true treat with pinups, greasers, cars, motorcycles, swing dancers, and of course an amazing band to tap your feet to, all with no cover! This is the highlight of my week, but they also offer a wide variety of different musicians from rock, to metal, country, blues, and some great cover bands as well!\n\nThe bartenders are hard to ignore here. They will pour your drink strong and fast, with fire and grace. They also have one of the best bar backs I've ever seen. If something breaks he's there in a split second, and watch out for him carrying around about 15 glasses stacked at a time. It's always clean, even the restrooms!

It's bigger than it looks. Varied crowd with mainly your \"biker crew\". People from all walks of life seem to come here, though. Friendly crowd and great people watching. \nIt's older. Nothing fancy. They have pool, darts and a bartop video console. Some of the bar stools are rickety and make me feel like if I have one too many cocktails I might end up of the floor from it tipping over! \nHappy Hour is from 3 to 6, not 3 to 7 like some sites claim. Good deals at that time. Beers 2 bucks, wine 3 bucks, and well drink specials as well. \nThe menu is big and varied. Decent prices for sure. Large portions. My only turnoff was ordering the bean tostadas and when they came out the beans were ICE cold. I mean they actually has small ice bits. (The rethinking of this is making me want to barf a little). I explained this to the bartender who didn't seem to think it was too odd, but she sent them back and they came back out perfectly. My friends had the tacos that looked REALLY good. Only a buck fifty a pop on Tuesday's, too! \nThey have nightly karaoke here and comedy routines on Tuesday's, which is really fun. This bar has a nice feel of people just enjoying drinks and a good time. \nAnother downside can be the \"burning out/racing\" of the bikes in the parking lot arriving and leaving. The tire smoke gets in the bar and makes me feel like I need an Oxygen tank and an inhaler. \nI recommend stopping in here for some drinks and food. The service isn't outstanding, but they do keep your drinks full and will check on you frequently. \nI plan to keep coming back often.", "business_id": "-xLwGUmmyKgsTtFOOXzjeg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-08-01", "type": "review"}

I have been here a couple of times and it was just alright. I am not a big fan of country music so that added to me not really enjoying myself. Both times my friends and I went on the weekend so at least they played other music besides the country music. The bar was crowded though and was hard to maneuver around the place. The music was way too over bearing and loud for such a small bar. The outside smoking area was kind of trashy.

I used to live in quite a short stumble distance from here, so I frequented knowing I could avoid a DUI and always have a good and safe time. \nThere are so many positives. Let me add that this and the (other former Brennan's East of here) are quite different. Yeah, this is in a strip mall, as a ton of bars in AZ are. There is no outside seating. There is a lot of indoor seating- booths and tables galore as well as a large bar with extended seating. For some reason the booths to the left side of the door seem to be made for either children or anorexics. The rest seem just fine! \nIt's a little aged, clean enough, older place. They have darts, pool, shuffleboard,and bartop games. I have never had bad service here. Honestly. The servers and bartenders are attentive and motivated. \nThe menu at this Brennan's is huge! If you can't find something you like here I would be shocked. Let me tell you they sure don't skimp on cheese. Order anything with cheese and you shall see. The mozzarella sticks are the size of cucumbers! A word of advice: Share a meal. The portions could feed 6 people (unless an ala cart choice). \nTrivia on Wednesday's for cash and Sex Trivia Saturday's for sex toys! Who can resist that?! (Hey, put your cell phones down- no one likes a cheater! Yeah, you!) \nPrices are great as well. Happy hour gives you a good bang for your buck. \nIt's a fun, local type bar that always felt safe and welcoming. Used to feel like \"Cheers\" to me. Too bad I can't stumble here anymore, but I still visit often. \nNever had a bad time and if I were a fly on the wall, I'm sure I could write a lot more here. :)", "business_id": "VpQZo6KV8CqkIG_MRQ3jiA", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-08-02", "type": "review"}

I'm 27 now but started coming here as a kid to Brennans and would catch Suns games with my Dad and brothers and enjoy some Wings. Brennans is a shining example of what a neighborhood bar should be. It has always been everyones Cheers. The staff here is top notch. They are all very interesting characters. Wayne, who is the lead Bartender has been there since the beginning, is the absolute best. Just talk to the guy and observe him and you will understand what I am speaking of. Sean is also a great bartender and makes a mean mean drink. If he likes you, he will make you the \" Red Sox Shot \" It is LEGENDARY.  Jordan who bartends and serves there, knows how to ask the cooks to make the wings a special way that make them even more amazing. Flavor suggestion: Honey Hot.  Great spot to go for all the basketball and football games, drink prices are very accommodating as well. The football crowd on Sundays is fun. You have some real die hard fans that go there for football, you have some people out with laptops placing bets over the internet, fantasy football going, Bloody Mary's flowing. I live in San Diego now, but every time I come into town, its an absolute must to go to Brennan's for all these reasons and more. Enjoy yourself and sit up at the bar so you can experience the bartenders.

I was trying to find a place to hang out near my bro's house so we could go hang out for a bit and have a beer.  I found Brennan's online and noted that they had shuffleboard.  WIN WIN!!  The review said that the staff was friendly and called you \"honey\" even if it was the first time you had ever been there.  BANG!  sounds like my kinda joint, so  i called my bro and said, \"hey man, let's go to this joint by your house and play some shuffleboard and have a beer\".  So, off we went.  I got there and when I approached the bar, the bartender looked at me like I was from Mars. I said hello, FIRST. She says Hi.  Then I said \"How's it going?\"  I felt like I was demonstrating to her how to greet a customer. So I ordered drinks, asked for shuffleboard disks and some menus. I was told that I could grab my own menu and that if I wanted something, I needed to come back and order.  Cool,  no biggie,  but no points for hospitality there.  No real attempt at gaining some sort of an EARNED tip, no prob, it's only my first impression of the place.  SO,  we play some shuffle board.  5 red disks, 3 blue, that's all they have and the shuffleboard table was not in proper working order and it wasn't like the guy sitting on his butt in the office right there was gonna check on us to see if everthing was okay.  So, it don't matter, we's having some beers and it's all good.  We get hungry and decide to look at the menus.  The menus said that THURSDAY was Indian Fry Bread day. Apparently, I am told that they haven't done that IN A LONG TIME.  I guess they didn't get around to changing the menu, but hey it's only my first impression of the joint.  Glad the regulars love it, they can have it.  Oh and I agree with a former poster about the Irish draw of the place.  I thought it was gonna be an Irish place,  not even close.

I'd never heard of it, but came to realize it's pretty well known on the music circuit due to it's focus on live acts (all mini tables face the stage, sort of like a small comedy club), the great sound system (though I would say I only give it a good, but certainly better than most) and pretty awesome lighting set up (a whole separate lighting guy who does not double as the sound guy).\n\nThis place is definitely in the middle of nowhere, and well, a little trashy. Young, old, in between - bouncers, door guys, bartenders, waitresses, clientele - they all looked tough as shit and ready to fight any bitch or d-bag for stepping out of line (which, so happens, they did, but we'll get to that later). Lots of neon beer signs, a couple pool tables and four dart boards (not sure if plastic or real).\n\nThe d\u00e9cor is pretty dive-esque but the prices were not. But they had Stella on tap, surprisingly. You can also buy ear plugs at the bar which I think is awesome! Almost as cool as Club Red's ear plug candy machine. Bathrooms were clean and well-lit, so can't complain there.\n\n The crowd mad-dogged the shit out of us - even the elderly couples gave us a suspicious eye and seemed to be tracking our movements all over the bar -- this is a place for regulars, my friend. But I have to admit, the music and other acts were great (except the last band, but they were pretty drunk when they went on).\n\nSo, to make a long story short, there was a girl fight out front after the last band finished, between a waitress and a parton/stripper (guess which one was sober and guess which one was running her mouth and asking the doors guys to punch her?). That clears up...until one of the members of the last band  marched up to a bouncer saying something along the lines that he had hit the stripper girl and why doesn't he hit him, if he's so tough. So, drunk dude gets knocked down and bouncer barely bats an eyelash. Meanwhile stripper comes tearing out from somewhere to re-attack everyone. Some other dudes gets punched over a car and it was a general riot of about 20 people.\n\nAs I stood outside and watched, I thought it was all pretty funny til I realized someone's prob got a gun in their car (or on their person -- thanks Gov. Brewer!) and it's only a matter of time until shots are fired into the crowd (yeah, that's how shady this place was). So we took off pretty soon after that.\n\nSo yeah, Joe's Grotto - good live music, girl fights, riots. As another reviewer noted, it's certainly a good place to \"people watch.\"", "business_id": "ZqNYje_T-xDDog-Wp86ieA", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-07-06", "type": "review"}

That is not customer service. We eventually flagged down a different worker, who we asked for a towel to clean the mess, she brought us a towel and we cleaned our table. Just as we finished, the party behind us spilled a drink also, so we handed them our towel as a kind gesture. Just then the same girl walked by, saw what happened to them also, and did not have the courtesy to ask what she could do. Okay, we will give Native another chance next time...\n\nToday, my mother and I went to Native for dinner. As we walked in, the hostess was blatantly unfriendly and unorganized. We told her we wanted a booth, and she said okay. We then sat down and waited for a couple of minutes until my mother noticed that newcomers were being sat down, despite the fact that we were there first. My mom then walked over and asked the female hostess if she took our party name to be seated. She replied, \"yes.\" My mother then asked what the party name was. She replied, \"Dan.\" My mother said no that is not our name, and the female then asked what our party name was. Who knows where the name \"Dan\" came from.

I even joked to my waitress that it must have been difficult to find all of these pigeon legs. On one occasion I had a wing that was only a small piece of meat. Our group of Tuesday night eaters have since quit going to Native wings because of this change.

My friend and I just finished having days from HELL  at work and we needed some vino to soothe our frayed nerves. I suggested going here to give it a try and also for a change of scenery. Upon walking in, we were greeted warmly. We sat ourselves on two really squishy couches (not comfy). Well, we got our wine order and were left to chat. First thing I noticed, the music. I began to contemplate whether or not  \"It takes two\" by Robb Base was a good music selection while trying to unwind and chill with a glass of sauvignon blanc..hmm I'm still thinking no. Second thing I noticed was that the really young servers and bartenders were talking about deep issues of the world, but it was the explicative shouted out by the bartender who was making a very serious point, that caught our attention. I believe my friend said \"Classsssy!\" in response. So I guess that if you want to chill and have a mellow chat, My Wine Cellar is maybe not the place for it. Maybe it was an off day I don't know. On to the wine prices. I've never seen a wine bar that had all one price for all the wines on their list. It's silly. Really. And the happy hour prices aren't that wonderful. The glasses are 10 dollars, but at happy hour they're 8. Not that big of a price break considering 8 bucks is usually a regular priced glass of wine elsewhere. Just an observation. Food... not spectacular. We sent back the hummus platter we ordered because the bread was COLD, I mean out of the fridge, slap it on the plate cold. The hummus was just not tasty at all. And I LOVE hummus. We then got the bruscetta platter, we ordered the basil, tomato,mozzarella, and the sun dried tomato with goat cheese. Both were very tasty. Then we moved on to the chicken sticks with lemon grass. Not my favorite. YES you CAN have too much lemongrass. I don't know if we'll go back to visit My Wine Cellar. I doubt it.

I love the idea of a cozy wine bar just a few blocks from my house and that is what this place seems to be. I walk in and the atmosphere is quite cozy and even though there is not a huge crowd of people. The bar is usually full enough and everyone is chatting and appears to be having a good time. Even though the staff is welcoming, I still get this feeling like I'm an \"outsider\" and not quite a \"regular\" yet. Can't really place my finger on why.\n\nThe happy hour prices and selection for beer and wine are fantastic! Full price would be a little more than I would like to spend, but then again I love a good deal so anything \"full price\" just seems like I'm missing out. We used Living Social coupon a few days before the expiration and were a little bummed that the coupon wasn't good for the happy hour prices. I know this is somewhat typical, however that just makes the restaurants that DO allow the coupons during happy stand out that much more!\n\nIn the time that I have had food (after the ownership change and before), I think it is obvious this place is all about the wine and the food is an afterthought. Nothing wrong with that. I think it is necessary to offer food if you want people to stay and drink a while; we've got to have something to snack on! Bruschettas, thin and crispy pizzas, and salads all with great descriptions on the menu, but the execution leave a little to be desired. Some of the appetizers taste like I could have just gone to Trader Joe's or Costco and purchased the same thing myself.\n\nI promise I am not trying to make this sound bad, I will go back to the wine cellar when I want to relax (but not at home, but not too far away either) with a good glass of wine and a calm, cozy atmosphere. I do like to go there, but I think I like the idea more than the reality. It seems as if there is some unrealized potential at the wine cellar, or maybe that is just the optimist in me.

It was date night, so I figured why not.  We arrived and the place was fairly busy, but not packed.  We were immediately greeted by all three members of the front-of-house staff. We were able to get a table against the wall in a booth-combo setup.\n\nKatie, the bar manager, arrived promptly and said that we made it for happy hour and explained all the HH specials. The deals are good, especially if you want to explore some new wine tastes at a reasonable by the glass price.  Anyway, she asked us what brought us in and I explained the Yelp search.  She then told us that the DJ wasn't playing but a new young guitar player was going to be doing acoustic blues.  We were totally down with that.\n\nWe ordered two beers and a bruschetta combo.  The bruschetta was very unique, on good artisan bread, and topped with well created toppings.  We ordered the Caprese with tomato, basil, and fresh mozzarella; the Spanish, with mozzarella and thinly sliced chorizo with red peppers, and the brie and caramelized red onion.  It was a nice selection, and at only $11 was more than enough food to start our evening.  We took advantage of the happy hour food specials by ordering the tempura green beans with spicy aioli on the side.  The tempura was crisp, but left a little too much grease.  The flavor was really good and the aioli was a good accompaniment.   We were content.\n\nAs the end of happy hour approached, we decided to order two glasses of wine and were given direction by Katie, who is also My Wine Cellar's sommelier.  She did a great job of listening to our likes and matched two wines to our flavor profiles perfectly.  My wife had the Redwood Pinot Noir and I had the Crucillon Garnacha, a Spanish Zinfandel.\n\nThe music started and it was pleasant, although we were very close to the artist, so we decided to move to the bar.  It was also a little warm back in the corner and the bar was much cooler.  At the bar, we ordered two flatbreads, my wife opting to revisit the brie and caramelized red onion (she loved it), and me choosing the house specialty, The Territorial, a bbq-styled treat with short rib meat and provolone.  It was excellent.\n\nOur evening at My Wine Cellar was thoroughly enjoyable, with each member of the staff conscientiously attending to every detail, engaging in pleasant conversation, and understanding how to take care of their customers.\n\nWe will surely return and look forward to sampling some other wonderful tapas and small plates, although I may not be able to get my wife to stray from her beloved brie and caramelized red onion now.", "business_id": "Our6bzte5W1wlIeOu9luug", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-07-22", "type": "review"}

We've given it 3 shots but our experience has been consistent. The first time we stopped in for dinner on a busy evening and sat on the patio. We really enjoyed our wine and tapas meal but our server was incredibly inattentive and we had to chase her down every time we wanted anything. I brushed that off to a really busy night so we returned for a second visit. This time it wasn't that busy so we enjoyed a nice bottle of wine and food. Again, a really inattentive server. When we wanted to check out we literally had to go find her. 3rd try - stopped in for a glass of wine in the early evening. Unfortunately the 3rd visit was the worst. I asked the server if they had happy hour specials and she informed me that yes and we had just made it with 10 minutes left. When we were ready to order we couldn't find her anywhere so went to the bar hoping to make the happy hour deadline. She then came to the table and took our order. 30 seconds later she comes back telling us \"Sorry, you missed the cut-off for happy hour\".....yeah, we missed it because you never came back! Grrrr......We received our wine and waited for our food (we only ordered two really simple appetizers)...and waited....and waited. No one came by so we went up to the bar again to ask about our food. When our server came back she said sorry but our deep fryer broke today and we had to run out to Kohl's and buy a little fryer and that big table was ahead of you. Seriously???? It's bad enough that they are cooking with a Fry Daddy but never never tell your customers something like that.  After 40 full minutes we received our appetizers, our wine glasses empty. No, she didn't ask if we wanted another glass. She then came back to tell us that her shift was over but no worries, that other girl will take care of you. \"That other girl\" never came by....ever. We had to go up to the bar once again and ask for our check. I fully expected a discount because of the fiasco but no. Not even an apology. So I told them our experience and the manager came over. She said she was happy to take off one appetizer. Great. Except she talked a little too long about all the problems they were having in the kitchen today.

It sure beats fast food crap. \n\nThe theme, and decor, of the restaurant is Hawaiian. It's kind of cool. Though I still wish they had that Big Kahuna Burger. The couple of times I ate here I got a spicy jalapeno burger. They will replace any beef patty with a turkey burger, and actually the spicy turkey burger worked better for me there. They have bottomless fries also, which is a huge plus. All in all a tasty place to eat at the Ridge.", "business_id": "e0vubCKi8KD8zC2C6FdbuQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-07-17", "type": "review"}

I'd have preferred the dressing on the side like the regular salad.  I also had a small bowl of their loaded baked potato soup and that was pretty good.  Not too thick or thin and had chunks of potatoes plus the toppings.  Added a little black pepper and it was probably the best part of my lunch.\n\nThey gave us a huge platter of tasty chips and salsa, but I thought the salsa was a little too tomato saucy for my taste.  I like salsa with some heat and this was really mild and bland.\n\nI ordered the chipotle chicken flatbread and it was served on a huge long platter and looked really good.  The flatbread had good flavor, although a bit salty, but with chipotle in the name I was hoping for a little more spice.\n\nService was good, drinks refilled, plates cleared in a timely manner.  \n\nIt was everything I expect from a Chili's and I'm sure I'll be back again at some point.", "business_id": "zARGEdB0JyPCPR0f3FKGxQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-06-20", "type": "review"}

We visited this location as well as the downtown Phoenix location before it for years. Now that I live in the far west valley, it's been, easily 10 years since I last visited OSP.  We happened to be in the neighborhood for a Convention so we brought a large group of friends to experience OSP themselves.\n\nFirst things first, this place is visited by a lot of retirees. And by a lot I'd say that we were the youngest group there by at least 50 years...and the glares to the kids in our group did not go unnoticed. But our kids are all very well behaved despite the daggered looks from those who forget what it's like to have children. \n\nSpeaking of children, OSP is not very kid-friendly when it comes to certain areas that we apparently take for granted. There are no cups with lids on them at all. We were informed that they need to have a special 'license' for that from Pepsi. This is news to me as I've worked with Pepsi for years and know of no special license. The excuse was that they were afraid that people would take the kid cups, put alcoholic beverages in them and walk out of the restaurant. um...WHAT? Additionally, if you have a child who requires his pizza cut up into smaller pieces, good luck trying to find a knife there. There was 1 and I mean o-n-e (1) butter knife in the whole restaurant that we practically had to sign over our first born child in order to use. I'm pretty sure that the retirees aren't looking to shank each other in the parking lot so to have to play verbal judo with the staff to use a standard utensil was really ridiculous.\n\nThe restaurant is now cash-only. This means no debit or credit cards are taken but they conveniently have an ATM machine located in the lobby to not only dispense cash but charge a hefty $3 fee to use. If you want to have a refill on your drink, there is a charge for that too. Buying drinks by the pitcher is fine but it's soda...seriously? The pizza is alright, the salad bar is 1 trip only and is sparse at best. \n\nThe single saving grace of it all is the Organ. The piece de resistance. This is a good thing and a bad thing because given all that I've described, its simply not enough for me to drive an hour out of my way for an otherwise aggravating time between musical sets. While you're there, it makes those aggravating occurrences not quite so bad though because it's such a unique, memorable, interesting experience. I loved OSP as a child and enjoyed so many wonderful, memorable visits.

I figured they were all the same. Boy was I wrong. We came to watch the World Cup and eat some wings/drink a few drinks. After arriving we were not super hungry yet, and with it being 110 degrees outside all we wanted was water. We sat down ordered a couple waters for the time being and planned to order food/drinks after cooling down a bit.  Instantly the waitress asked for both ID's (which I could understand since we were in the bar area) and then immediately said she needed a debit card. I asked why, considering we had only ordered water, and her reply was that she needed it cause people run out on their tab consistently and that they were understaffed so they wouldn't be able to watch us well. The main problem I had with this is that we hadn't even ordered anything yet! It made us feel very alienated and like criminals for just sitting down. I have never been treated this way in a restaurant. Needless to say I will never return to this location. Management needs to understand this is not how you treat customers. The location I usually go to we typically spend around $100 between 3 or 4 ppl during World Cup games and we always make it a point to overtip the wait staff. I ordered one beer here and that's it. I probably would have ordered more but the waitress seemed to be ignoring us probably for the fact that we originally ordered just water and she assumed we weren't going to order anything else.

It became obvious this was not a traditional Native Ny'er but was previously called something else and was in the process of being changed over.

We ordered wings for the kids and us adults all got fish n chips. wings came out and could not believe how small they were. I will call them micro wings. Service was slow.

About 5-10 minutes had passed and even with our \"call server\" button blinking, nobody came, so I decided to walk up to the front and asked the hostess ( manager was standing about 8 ft away) if we had a server because another table has already been greeted and started to get their food. She apologized and went to go look for her, a few seconds later the blonde hostess decided to just get our whole order since our server was busy or couldn't be found, we thanked her. A few moments later our server popped her head around the corner and asked if our drink orders had been taken, didn't introduce herself or apologize for the wait or even really come to our table... She then dropped off our soup and salad, my boyfriend asked her to grab red pepper if she had time, and apparently she didn't because he never got it, even with his second soup.

We also thanked her again on the way out and she apologized to us once again.\n\nAnd another reason why I gave them two stars was because of another server who was attending to the other tables around us, when our \"call server\" button was blinking for a second time, she was the only one who helped us after 2 other servers had walked passed.. And she helped me take a charge off of our tab that I screwed up on ( on the table gadget under games don't hit continue to play unlimited games unless you read the bottom first, where it says cancel $1.99 charge lol stupid me)", "business_id": "bbmuF6LtbP51bk0Ia0p1rw", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-08-26", "type": "review"}

I've ate here 3 times now, mainly because I can walk here. Every time I'm amazed how bad the food is. Mainly the ultra high grease factor. I literally squeezed over a tablespoon of margarine out of my english muffin. That backfired on me as it simply ran down the plate towards my eggs. So I put my bacon on higher ground and started scarfing down the eggs before they became butter logged. As I went back for my bacon I accidentally startled 2 flies that  seemed to be thoroughly enjoying it. Incidentally,  if you feign Parkinsons disease the flies will typically find a more sedentary patron. Other than that the coffee was bland and week, no Splenda or Equal.  It definitely is a place for regulars,  as the staff would shout loudly across the restaurant \"were closed\" or such, with the entry of each person. I had came for karaoke before with friends but stopped that as well when we finally figured out why our names were only called 1/5 the amount of everyone else. I saw the dj take a $5 from a guy and guess what ? He got to sing next ! Cool how that works. Also the last beer I had was supposed to be Shock top, it came out about 50 degrees and tasted like half bud light. Also the bartender forgot to actually hand me my drink after I paid her. That was my fault though as I had interrupted a very intense conversation she was having with another guy at the bar. If you're ok with these thing's,  it may be just what you're looking for.

Inside the place reminds me of someone's rec room, High top tables, bar stools, and flat screen TVs line the walls. There are a couple of pool tables and a juke box.\n\nThe menu has your typical sports bar fare. I went with the Fisherman's Platter (Fried Cod & Shrimp w/ fries & coleslaw) it was quite good. My friend ordered the fish tacos and he enjoyed it.\n\nWe were joined by another friend and watched baseball while enjoying some beers. Our third friend decided to go out to the patio to have a smoke and we joined him. Our waitress then informed us that she would be leaving and asked if we wanted to close out with her of transfer our tab. Being in the industry I know how it is, so we closed out with her. When we went back in, the bartender informed us that we had reached our \"limit\" that day & cut us off. We attempted to ask our waitress if we did something wrong and she wouldnt give us a straight answer, just that the bartender felt we had enough.\n\nI dont know if something has happened here in the past to cause this, but we were totally caught off guard by it.\n\nAll in all, McMashers is a nice place to grab a bite and catch the game, but dont expect to stay there for long.

Who needs to clean the house, get caught up on bills, wash the cars, and eat leftovers at home?  Let's go drive around aimlessly.\"  He's such a good sport and always ready to head out on one of my escapades, so we took off towards Casa Grande.  There are moments I fantasize about getting out of the city and finding a more rural abode.  Those moments usually pass when I start looking at concerts and baseball games.  But still, wouldn't it be nice to have no neighbors, a couple of horses in the backyard, and 4 or 5 big dogs?  I think so.  \n\nSomeone had told me about some acreages out on the northwest side of C.G. so that's kind of where we were headed.  The drive wasn't very productive on the house-hunting side, but we did end up at Dell's for lunch.\n\nI wasn't too sure about it because from the outside it looks kind of suspect, but inside, it's a cool little sports bar.  Lots of TVs on the walls, and right away the server said he would change any channel to whatever we wanted.  If the Cardinals aren't playing baseball we're pretty apathetic.  I think we ended up watching drag racing or something, which always makes me want to drive irresponsibly.  And run out and buy a Camaro.  \n\nWe had their honey BBQ wings, which were very good, and the medium Chad's special pizza which basically has all the meats on it.  I have pictures somewhere and will get them uploaded when I find them.  Overall we really enjoyed our lunch.  Our server, JWF on the receipt, was great, and the food was very good.  The pizza is a thin crust style and baked golden brown on the bottom with lots of toppings and chewy cheese.   \n\nWith 1 pint of Amber Bock $2.77, 2 pints of Kiltlifter $7.38, wings $7.60, and the pizza $13.45, lunch was $33.85 after tax, before tip.

Remembered Pesto's from my High School days at Chandler High when we went there for lunch. Back then, it was a little hole in the wall and had a counter you walked up to to order. I was surprised because now the restaurant is contemporary and a sit down restaurant. The decor inside is gorgeous yet, the place is still small giving it an intimate feel. I loved the wine wall and the beading separating the bar from the actual restaurant. \nAnyhoo, my husband and I opted for the appetizer sampler plate which came with stuffed mushrooms, eggplant bruschetta, and fried ravioli. The mushrooms were ok (Ive had better, Haus Murphy's has the best!), the ravioli were great but I prefer mine with meat, and the eggplant bruschetta was pretty good though different from your standard bruschetta. I could have done without the kalamata olives which I think are a bit too salty.\nFor our meals, I got the spaghetti and meatballs with extra meatball and my husband got the meat calzone with sausage and pepperoni. I loved the spaghetti and meatballs! The meatballs were flavorful, big and meaty, and soft the way a meatball should be. I probably didn't even need to get extra because they were huge but I am glad I did since they were so yummy. I never thought I would say this but they might be as good if not better than Rigatony's meatballs. The hub said his calzone was good but it didn't seem that fresh. The cheese was not oozing from it like it would with one that just came out of the oven. \nI am a total canoli connoisseur so I felt that it was my duty to try one at Pesto's. Boy am I glad I did because this was one of the best canoli's I think i have ever had! It had chocolate chips in it but what really kicked it up a notch was that it had salted pistachio's on it which gave it the sweet and salty effect. It was lovely! I probably should have gotten the mini canoli but I am kinda glad I got the big one. GO BIG OR GO HOME! Anyways, Pesto's was pretty good although the service was a little slow. I was surprised that there was no wait on a Friday night at 6 and there were still tables open. I hope this place doesn't go under cause where will I go to get a canoli fix???

The kiddos each order the mac and cheese (Kraft, out of the box, $6, reallY!?!)\n\nThe zucchini appetizer was decent enough - even the kids ate a piece each - and plenty to share.\n\nThe steaks sucked - I've had better steak from room service that cost the same.

My friend and I really liked it . We shared the dinner for two. Our appetizer of choice was the zucchini. It's battered in a light Panco breadcrumb. The crispness and crunch was great and I LOVE the fact that it was not a greasy soggy mess. It is served with a fresh, light cucumber sauce which complements the veggie very well.\n\nI had the filet with blue cheese and chose garlic mashed potatoes along with green beans. The filet was cooked just as I ordered. The steak was melt in your mouth tender. The potatoes were fresh with small chunks and lots of garlic. The green beans are crisp. My guess is the chef blanches them, ice water bathes them. They are kissed on the grill for flavor just before serving. Just perfect!\n\nMy guest had the New York with green beans and onion rings and was equally pleased!  The dessert was a shared piece of chocolate cake. The cake was moist and very rich. \n\nThe decor was a little dated and could use a modern twist! The bar was beautiful and had many customers. I liked the booth height. It kept the noise down and made it private.\n\nOur server was Shannon. Our drinks were NEVER empty. She was pleasant and knew the menu well. She made our first experience a great one!

Very good.  The zucchini is lightly breaded and fried.  Is not greasy at all and the cucumber ranch is reallllyyyy good.\n\nNext up, wedge salad.  As always, one salad is enough for two to share, so don't waste one of your two sides getting another salad if you go the wedge route.\n\nOrdered the grilled corn and asparagus.  Both fresh and very good.  Some complaint/observation as before on the asparagus.  The cooks don't always do the best job of trimming off the ends.  I'm not going to get into how to do it properly, but if you want to know how it should be done, you can google it.\n\nFinally, on to the dead animal.

Hey, you have to give them credit for actually making iceberg lettuce taste good!! \n\nSo, I met a girlfriend here for lunch today and we had a great meal and were not made to feel guilty for a hogging a booth for a full two hours. As always, the salad arrived fresh, salad bowls nicely chilled and bread sticks warm and buttery :) I proceeded to eat three full bowls of salad...I swear their croutons actually tasted homemade today, I must have been imaging it, but they were a nice touch. She had the Eggplant Parmigiana and was able to substitute fresh asparagus, broccoli and chopped tomatoes for the pasta. It looked delicious. I had the Capellini Pomodoro which, according to our fabulous waiter, was \"one of the healthiest things on the menu\" (I'm planning to splurge at Filiberto's tomorrow!). It seriously tastes very fresh and healthy (love fresh basil) and I couldn't finish it all.   I have to give honerable mention to the Chicken Alfredo Pizza which was ordered by my dining companion on a previous visit.

The thing about chain restaurants is usually the food is the same no matter where you go, but the service is what makes the difference. Our server was Phillip and he was so nice! He told us about the options but what made the difference was his delivery.  he was fun and joking and very light-hearted.  My mom and I did the 2 for 25 deal and started with the fried zucchini and fried mozzarella. For some reson though, instead of mozzarella, we got the beef ravioli.  This turned out to be a nice surprise because I never would have tried these on my own, but they ended up being delicious.  For my meal, I had the eggplant parmesan and my mom had some chicken dish (I don't remember and neither does she). My dish was delicious and perfectly cooked. My mom's dish on he other hand was too salty. She sent it back, but when Phillip returned with her newly prepared dish, it was still salty and they figured it must be the sauce.\nEven though her dish wasn't the best, she overall had a good experience and so did I.

Great attitude too.\nPretty much everyone is addicted to their bread sticks and they hand out Andes mints at the end. The prices aren't too bad for what you are getting. Still my best advice is wait until they are featuring a special dish. Some of them might surprise you. Olive Garden just made this? Yep. Not half bad.\nBut at the end of the day it is what it is.

This place has gone down hill drastically since they adopted cost cutting measures. I suspect this decline is also related to all of the good servers they had moving on to other jobs.\n\nThis place now has the worst servers I have seen anywhere. In addition they have installed electronic devices at each table so that your server can ignore you even more. Need something? Talk to the computer.\n\nThe cost cutting has reached absurdity. It is bad enough that you had to have one salad for the table even when each person at the table ordered a meal that was supposed to come with a salad, but now they have decided they need to save on salads even more by replacing the red onion slices with onion bits to make the onions go further. The all you can eat bread sticks claim is a farce. The servers have clearly been instructed to do everything they can to limit your bread sticks by perpetually telling you they are in the oven. The soup alternative to the salad is a risky venture. Quite often the soup has been sitting forever and is horrible. The Pasta e fagioli soup that is, or was, really good if you can manage to get it without it having been sitting forever, has now had a lot of the beans removed from it. I'm guessing this is another cost cutting measure.\n\nAny kind of meat they use for the pasta dishes, like sausage or meatballs, are horrible. They will often leave your pasta on a plate in a \"heater\" and when the server doesn't pick it up promptly, which seems to be a regular occurrence now, it is all stuck together in a clump and practically melded to your plate. One of my servers admitted this to me once and said \"sorry about that\" but was quite put out when I asked for it to be redone!\n\nThis place is bad news and if you happen to run into any good servers they seem to quit promptly.

It is very clear that they are attempting to turn the tables/customer as fast as possible before the dinner rush.  The first time we ordered our appetizers (soups, salads, and bread) came out with our entrees.  We found that odd and felt that we were being rushed.  This resulted in us not eating our entrees there, because they were then cold, and my wife and I were frustrated.  Therefore, we got them to go, as the message was clear, the restaurant wanted us to go.  \n\nThis brings us to the second/last time we were there.  We came in right about 5:15 and had an estimated wait of 5 minutes.  This time our entrees came out before the appetizers.  When I brought this up to the water he simply replied \"yup, the kitchen is really zipping them out this evening.\"  This time we ate our entrees as they came out first, but the water never offered to box up our apps.  However he did ask if we wanted dessert.  He apparently didn't get the joke when I asked him, \"Doesn't this restaurant bring the desserts at the beginning of the meal?\"\nMy kids are very upset as Olive Garden is one of their favorite restaurants, and because it so close we used to get it all the time.  We explained that we aren't willing to eat there anymore, so they asked if we could do carry out.  I explained to them again, they we would not support a restaurant that has such deplorable customer service, but that if we are around a different Olive Garden we would be happy to go there.

Remedied this by asking to be moved to one of them. In addition, we didn't receive a kids' menu until we had waited around for about 20 mins. So, picture this, I have a hyper kid on my hands because his blood sugar levels are low and he's ready to chew his own arm off as well as those of everyone else surrouding him. Great... I will say that a very large party (around 20 people) was seated nearby and our server was one of many attending to their every need.\n\nOur server had an excuse; he was new to the establishment and still in training. He was very cordial and was trying his best to deal with my gluten-free requirements. Turns out he wasn't given any training on the menu, with which he was very unfamiliar. Great...way to instill confidence that I'm not going to have a gluten-related \"episode.\" Let me be clear, I don't blame him for this whatsoever. My hat goes off to him for trying. What got me was the dirty look I received from one of the female servers...WTF! What did I ever do to her. Message to her: You're in the wrong line of work, lady. Try collections or repossessions.

And, my husband enjoyed his seared ahi tuna steak, but felt the portion size was a little on the small side (he's a big guy). \n\nNext time, I'll try the chambord margarita.

The one on Mill is great for people watching and I have taken visitors there straight from the airport when they are starving to death after their flight.  The menu has a wide variety of choices, something for everyone.  The service has always been a bit slow on Mill, but they also have been very busy when I've been there.

For happy hour a couple of 6th Street margaritas, sharing some tostada bites and the street tacos make my belly extremely happy.  The husband and I can fuel up before our shopping excursion to BevMo across the street.  \n\nThe barbacoa enchiladas have been a favorite of mine for years and it was a eureka moment when I discovered that for Sunday brunch they serve the same enchiladas, but add two eggs cooked to order.

It is unfortunate because I love the food here. I booked a party for six for a reservation at 7:30pm. We were seated right away in the upper level of the restaurant. Our waitress came over right away and took our drink orders. It all started out pretty well.\n\nOne of the members of our party had never been here before so he wanted to order three appetizers for us to all share. I recommended the Tejas Trio (queso, salsa and guacamole) and he told our waitress to pick two of her other favorites. Now I understand that he did leave this up to her discretion however, she chose two other items with shrimp and seafood in them. As a waitress I would have maybe considered that not everyone in the party would have liked seafood. I would have understood maybe one other appetizer with seafood but not both. Again, it was left to her discretion so I cannot say too much about this one.\n\nI tried to get her attention two different times to order a margarita, both times she swiftly walked away, maybe I needed to be louder. All things I could have shook off if our meal would have been up to par as it usually is. I had recommended to the other members of our party to order the 21 day aged filet. We had previously had an amazing experience with this steak. Three of us decided to order this item. When they came out they were all New York strip and not filet. Not really that big of deal but when you are a expecting one cut of steak and you receive a different one, it is a little disappointing. My steak was supposed to be a filet topped with a peppercorn crust and topped with a mushroom sauce. It came out as a New York strip, topped with the peppercorn crust but no sauce whatsoever. My dining companions decided to keep the New York strips in lieu of returning them to re-fire filets. I decided to have a filet re-fired because my steak came out completely wrong. I reordered the new steak with the Gorgonzola butter instead of the peppercorn crust because it looked dry when it was brought out.\n\nAfter waiting fifteen minutes, after all of my dining companions were finished eating, I received my new steak. It was a filet after all but it still came out with the peppercorn crust instead of the Gorgonzola butter. I just feel as though the entire night our waitress did not listen to anything we said. I really am not that picky but after getting all three of our steaks wrong, and getting mine wrong twice I was irritated. This was the place that my fianc\u00e9 and I had recommended to out of town guests and I feel as though it was a big let down tonight. I just do not think our waitress could handle a big party along with serving her other tables.\n\nI still might be back because I know how good the food can be here.

He took it back and again my wife worked on the baked potato and had no room left for the steak. The waitress also failed to bring out a wedge salad for one of the other guests in our party. She returned with our meals so getting a salad at that point seemed a waste. It also took some time before our drinks arrived as well.\n\nThe management again took my wifes steak off the bill and offered our two other guests a dessert for the salad mistake.

They are less expensive than Durant's/Fleming's but more expensive than Outback/Texas Roadhouse. Likewise their steaks are less tasty than Durant's/Fleming's but more expensive than Outback/Texas Roadhouse.\n\nWith that said, each of the aforementioned places has their positives and negatives. Durants is really pricey but they very well may have the best steak in town to go along with their interesting atmosphere. You can cowboy it up at Texas Roadhouse where throwing peanut shells on the floor is allowed/encouraged. Fleming's is that classy place where you have a whole slew of wines to chose from to have with your supper.\n\nSo to take it all in and get the happy medium I think that is The Keg. The steaks are really good there. I would put them on par with Fleming's but obviously not as expensive. Neither myself or the girlfriend has had a complaint about the steak there. The price isn't too hateful there either. And the atmosphere can be as good or better than Fleming's depending where you are. The only thing Fleming's is going to have over the Keg in service is that at the Keg you will have one server that handles everything. Versus Fleming's where you very well may have three servers - one for drinks, one for orders, and one for food (you may not, but I've had special people come and only pour wine, etc). Fleming's isn't quite at the Delmonico's level (Vegas) as far as service.\n\nReally, for the money I think the Keg is the best. Food is great as is service.

They were able to fix it but it still didn't taste right. I think they added simple syrup. It  had a strange sweet flavor to it. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 did enjoy his meal they cooked a steak the way he wanted it and they left off the butter on his vegetables because he has a dairy allergy so that was good. \n\nMy steak however was well done and I did not ask for it well done. The flavoring and seasoning was good though. \n\nAgain for the amount of money we paid for that meal it definitely was not worth it.

He said that the steak was not seasoned at all. For sides, we ordered the Flemings potatoes which were really good and the baked potato which was fine, but honestly, how hard is it to mess up baked potato? When the check was presented they also gave me a box of chocolate truffles since it was my birthday. I wont lie, these were amazing!!!

I left extremely disappointed with both. The restaurant itself was nice. I love low lit, intimate settings and design-wise the decor was well conceived. The ambiance was cheapened however by the level of noise, which was comparable to a mess hall and overrode any pleasure instilled by the eye. Our server Mickey was great, no complaints there. I ordered the Prime Rib-eye, bone-in. The two gentlemen who brought our food out rushed through their delivery so quickly that any presumed warning that was issued about the plates being hot was not heard. Probably also in part due to the high decibel volume. Consequently I burned my fingers, which didn't lend to the evening. I advised Mickey it might have been better for them to get everyone's attention first, before slipping in the hot plate advisory and misplacing orders on the table. She apparently mentioned this to the manager who came to our table with all the grace of Al Capone, strong-arming us into confessing that all was right with our meal. At this point I was ready to put all these previous distractions behind me and dig into a really great steak. Instead I discovered one of the toughest and poorest cuts of meat I have ever had. I ordered it medium-rare. It came nearer to medium-well. There was also no marbling and the pale greenish color was also an indication that in spite of the wet aging process, this was not a corn fed cow - which will produce a deep red burgundy color even when well cooked. My suggestion; if you want a great dining experience and a truly excellent Rib-eye spend your next Benjamin at the Ruth's Chris in Park City, UT.", "business_id": "0ONypOKIhttBz9IJzBE8jg", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-06-16", "type": "review"}

OK enough said about that, the service here is phenomenal excellent wait staff excellent food my wife went here for her birthday and had a great time we stuck to small plates not because we were worried about cost but we like to eat smaller portions and I am NOT one to really go for a $60 steak I do believe that's a bit on the high side. We started off with a spinach salad that was outstanding and I had the soup of the day which was a leek soup which was really one of the best I've ever had for the main course we had a short rib and a shrimp and scallop dish both wonderfully prepared actuall  did have a good bottle of wine and topped off with the creme brulee I understand that there molten lava cake is something to be seen but we're creme brulee fans and it was again perfectly prepared and enough for two the same is true of their side dishes   again the service was outstanding the waiter was attentive without being overly bearing this is a perfect place for an anniversary or birthday it's certainly not going to be your Thursday night steak joint but highly recomend for special treat.", "business_id": "0ONypOKIhttBz9IJzBE8jg", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-08-05", "type": "review"}
