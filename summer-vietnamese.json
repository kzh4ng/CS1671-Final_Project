I didn't say much about the food in my previous review, so thought I'd rectify that. \n\nI'm a big fan of Vietnamese bun, which is a dish made with rice noodles and some kind of grilled meat, usually served in a big bowl with sprouts, cukes, scallions, peanuts, cilantro, lettuce and carrots. What I'm looking for when I order this is meat (I usually get chicken) that has been well marinated, as this lends alot of the flavor to this dish. Pho Minh marinates theirs in hoisin and maybe other things, and it's delicious. They add a little of this sauce to the noodles and garnish with the salad, then serve it with their wonderful fish sauce. This is a dish I crave. Their veggies are really fresh, the meat is succulent, and all of the flavors complement eachother so well. I like a deep fried spring roll with my bun, so I always order one, and they slice it and serve it right in the bowl. These are great here...really meaty little rolls. They use pork, and it's almost like a pork meatball filling. When you order these as an appetizer you get 2 of them and a side of their molasses/fish sauce combo. Doug had the Hu tieu xao, which is chicken, shrimp and veggies stir fried with rice noodles. This dish has some funky Vietnamese flavors, and has fish sauce as a base for the stir fry sauce, so you have to like that, but if you do, this dish rocks. Like all of their food, it was very well prepared and delicious. The woman who waits tables here always offers us their traditional mung bean pudding dessert, and we always say yes. This is a sweet and starchy treat served hot with a lacing of coconut milk. I love it. Tea comes to the table automatically and is free, and they offer some nice hot and iced beverages in addition. We didn't have the pho on this visit, but I will reiterate that it's great. I think this is the best Vietnamese restaurant in Pittsburgh.\n\nThis is a family owned and operated restaurant, so you will see the same friendly faces when you become a regular. Early on we learned to say hello/good afternoon in Vietnamese ( xin chao, pronounced shin chow) and we always get a big smile from the older gentleman who owns the place.

I moved to Pittsburgh from Seattle where you can find some of the absolute best Vietnamese food.  This place is a hole-in-the-wall with a very brusque owner/waiter and kind of dingy decor.  I don't mind any of these things actually, but the food I definitely took some issue with.  I ordered a tofu-veggie dish (can't remember the name) served over rice.  My boyfriend ordered the pork rice vermicelli bowl.  Our food came fast enough and it was served hot.  However, my dish was nothing to brag about.  It was pretty average tasting Asian fare.  It didn't taste bad by any means, but not restaurant quality.  Good thing it was only about 6 bucks.  My boyfriend's dinner was a real disappointment, however.  My favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Seattle had HUGE vermicelli bowls with absolutely fresh lettuce and onions, piled high on top of perfectly cooked noodles.  The meat/tofu you ordered with it was never sparse and it was cooked to perfection.  Everything was doused with some sweet fish sauce and presented with some sliced egg roll.  The pork vermicelli that came to my table did not resemble this at all.  It was served in a rather small bowl with just a few pieces of lettuce and onion.  The \"pork\" that was on top amounted to about 1/4 of a cup of weird texturized, shredded something.  It almost looked like boiled ground beef.  I felt sorry for my boyfriend because he had never eaten Vietnamese food before and I had recommended a vermicelli dish to him because they are (usually) delicious.  As a double whammy, his dish was about 9 dollars!  Neither of us were full when we were done with our meals, so we ordered some spring rolls, which were supposed to be what they are famous for.  I don't understand this either.  The rolls were extremely bland and chewy.  The sauce that was served with it didn't do much to save it.  Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place and I will continue my search for good Vietnamese food elsewhere.

I think I can help explain this issue.\n\nTram's has a fairly full menu, but there are two things on the menu that you should be ordering:  the soups (particularly, the beef pho) and the fresh spring rolls.  That's it.\n\nIf you've had Pho in other cities, you might not understand Tram's.  There's no Vietnamese community in Pittsburgh, so you can't get all the trimmings you might have come to expect:   no tripe, no tendon, no other strange meat parts. Just beef or chicken.  But what sets Tram's apart, in my view, is the quality of his broth.  I have eaten Pho all around the US, and Tram's broth is, in my view, the very best I've had.\n\nSo get the pho (or, if you're in the mood for something different, the Saigon Soup), get the spring rolls, and skip everything else on the menu.

So off I went in search of Tram's.\n\nTram's is located in a section of Pittsburgh that is a little on the run down side - the area has seen better days. But that did not phase me - adds some character to the place!\n\nIt was about 1:45 pm when I rolled in. Was given a choice of where to sit  - a little old man with one arm (or perhaps he was missing just the hand? - could not tell) took my order. He did not seem to friendly - I asked him a couple of questions and it was hard to get anything out of him.\n\nI ordered Pho Ga with white meat (although their menu lists it as \"Pho Hanoi\") with garden rolls and a glass of water.\n\nI suspected that perhaps their approach to Pho was going to be more Northern Vietnam based on the name for the soup - and I was partially correct. When the soup came out - the noodles were the slightly wider ones rather than the very thin ones.\n\nNow I'm guessing that many of my Yelp friends from the DC area that like Pho would not have liked the Pho here.  Unless I'm mistaken - most of you folks seem to prefer to have all of the fat skimmed and strained out of your Pho broth - which I am against. It makes the broth to clear and light and there is a significant reduction in flavor and richness when this is done. And they certainly weren't doing that here. In fact - there was a slight oiliness or greasiness to the broth - but not overly so. It gave the broth a delicious richness and subtly in flavor that was just so damn good!\n\nI added all of the aromatics and veggies. I will say that the amount of Basil, and the quality of the Basil were the low points of the meal. The poor Basil had seen better days.\n\nI then tasted the broth and was floored by how good it was. I detected light, rich hints of star anise and cinnamon, which when combined with chicken essence fat globules and onions - was just outstanding. Rich, savory, wonderful!\n\nI added Sriracha sauce to individual bites of food as I went - and only added a little to the broth at the very end. I really wanted to savor the broth the way it was.\n\nCons:\n- The rolls were not very fresh - in fact I did not finish them because they weren't very good.\n- The Basil was not crisp and fresh\n- The restrooms need to be gutted and retrofitted\n\nSo I'm only docking them one star for the cons - the Pho was outstanding IMHO - so four stars overall!\n\nCash only - no credit cards.

The spring rolls are excellent, too.  I just wish they served 33 beer to go with it all.  \n\nService is good, if a bit gruff.  Don't screw around chit-chatting at the table when you come in; you need to be ready to order when the waiter (Tram?) gets to you.  Failure to do so will expose you to his withering scorn.  (Seriously, he'll hang out, staring at you, until you make up your mind.)  \n\nPrice is right, too.  With spring rolls and an entree, you'll get out of here for under $10/person.", "business_id": "dxCqGkhtXq-9fYEsX7Mf6Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-08-13", "type": "review"}

Their broth is so flavorful all on its own but blends beautifully to all the condiments.  My personal favorite is the grilled marinated pork/pork chops. Whether it's served with rice or on vermicelli, it's a win! The finished product after grilling is just amazing with its sweet & savory marinade caramelized to perfection.

It dawned on me that while I was putting the dirty dishes left on the table by the previous occupants, I noticed a cart with 2 pre-made lunched that were exactly like ours. Seeing this was my first time to Tea Light Cafe, I thought maybe our meals were supposed to be cold. I asked the guy that dropped them off if that was the case. He said no and that he'd be right over to fix it. \n\nHe scooped up our meals and came back a few moments later. Our meat was warm but it was as tough as shoe leather.

But I had the urge to try it with a friend and I came out unimpressed. There are about 5-7 Vietnamese places within a 10 mile radius of this place and I find it strange that their prices are higher than all the rest. Their soup in pho wasnt especially good, though it was passable. Their rice dishes seemed to be on par with others but for the price you would expect more. The only redeeming thing about this place would be the more contemporary decor that you don't see in most other Vietnamese places. It was cleaner and from the table setup you could tell they are aiming for a higher echelon of clientele.  \n\nThe bottom line: The food was ok. The ambience was better than most.

He had pointed this place out since it had the very same menu as my favorite place Da Vang. Knowing this I thought this place was maybe a family relative or something and might have a very similar food, which should be very good. \n\nBoy was I wrong! So wrong that I would almost have thought that my friend was playing a horrible joke on me. Had he not been sitting next to me I would have thought that he was not serious about this place. Almost so bad to the point that I had to question our friendship for a brief short period we were sitting there. \n\nTo start, the spring roll. One of the most popular Vietnamese creations that everyone knows. When done right it can cause overloading emotions of happiness and satisfaction. We all know that a good spring roll is a sign of a good beginning to a meal, almost like that first real good kiss you get. \nWell this one is not it, small, skinny and filled with nothing but lost hope and broken dream. Small portions of shrimp and meat, if there was any meat in it at all. Most of all the they even cheaped out on the vermicelli noodles, lettuce and mint. More like the worst kiss you ever got , bad enough to break up over. \n\nThen the pho, the staple of Vietnamese cuisine, the first thing that anyone thinks about when they hear Vietnamese food. Well upon ordering the food I expected a delicious and heart warming soup. Well the broth was flavorless, I could have made a better one with water and  a bouillon cube. The dish was beautiful though. So simple, and the onions and jalapeno cut thin as they can get it and the cilantro chopped roughly. The taste was just not there. \n\nThe service like any Vietnamese place was lacking. This place was the worst of them all. The server, a kid who spoke no English paying no attention to anyone and not caring at all.  He must have gotten suckered into free labor by his father or someone who equally didn't care about their patrons.\n\nAll in all the visual appeal of the pho was amazing in that the small details of the ingredients were executed nicely. The  spring roll was done poorly and you can get a better one from Trader Joe's. The flavors of the food lacking in all aspects, please someone give them some salt and pepper to cook with. Pho in it's greatness can be enjoyed with out all the sriracha or hoison we all love to ruin the natural flavor of the broth with, but this place it is needed to bring the brown water of a broth to life.", "business_id": "IXB3PGgSmw4bjTe9ll-tQw", "stars": 1, "date": "2009-06-02", "type": "review"}

There is the curry noodle soup and the spicy noodle soup which are both excellent as well.  \nIf you are not into soup, the menu is expansive with options that leave Vietnam altogether (terriyaki, chow fun, etc.).  Their green beans and pork are great (look on the back of the menu).  Even though I haven't tried the house chicken (I'm too hung up on the #20), it looks fantastic.

JUST FIFTY CENTS! I have no doubt other Yelpers have noticed portion reductons and / or price increases in their favorite restaurants. In just two years an increase this infinitesimal is a bargain!\n\nYou'll receive your Porridge, which is just boiled Rice to a glutinous consistency, in a 6-inch wide bowl, with the addition of pulled Chicken meat, fermented Turnips, bits of Ginger, and Green Onions. A very simple Soup, don't you think?\n\nAlong with either Porridge or Pho, I also order...\n\nBeef Chow Fun #39 (***** $6.50-no change in price) A very, very affordable Chow Fun... as inexpensive as you'll find anywhere!\n\nStir-Fried wide Rice Noodles with marinated strips of Beef,  Bean Sprouts, Yellow Onions, Green Onions in a Sweet Soy Sauce! Delicioso!\n\nMy friend, whom I visited on this trip... even though he is Chinese, never had Chow Fun of any kind in his life... stated this is one of the best Chinese entrees he ever had! I had to remind him that this IS a Vietnamese place... and Chinese would never make SWEET Chow Fun, even though it was VERY, Very good.\n\n\nI, initially, wanted an order of Oysters in Black Bean Sauce..  but the waitress stated the restaurant stopped serving Oysters because customers started returning the entree... Saigon Pho, the last time I ordered it in  Black Bean Sauce, then had the LARGEST Oysters I had seen short of seeing it served in a coastal city like San Francisco. The Oysters can be very intimidating... they're HUGE! I kid you not, if you special order it now... you would think the Oysters were aided in their growth by artificial means. If my stay in Arizona were longer... I would not hesitate in ordering this. But I had to resort to....\n\nClams with Basil Leaf (**** 1/2 Market Price) A HUGE order of Clams cooked with Basil, in a sweet Soy Sauce concoction! The PILE of Clams musta been over four inches high!\n\nSaigon Beef Rice Noodle Soup (Not Rated $5.95) My friend's order...\n \nIce Coffee with Condensed Milk #54 (***** $2.50) WAAAYYY better than that Italian stuff... Way, WAY BETTER!\n   \n... And you get to percolate it yourself at the table... if you want to, that is. This is one of the very few Vietnamese restaurants that will let you \"do it yourself\", as most restaurants want to \"turn\" your table as fast as possible.\n\n   Some views of the Viet Coffee dripping, and dripping, and dripping...\n      ( http://s3-media2.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bI04rKTCweVgKITJ1QkZKA/l.jpg  )\n      ( http://s3-media2.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/VNQLgijYek1UNPAhiBNc3A/l.jpg  )\n\nTotal: $33.12 (including tax & including my friend's Pho order)\n\n\nMy server was a young woman, whom I have got to know since she was working here as a high school teen. On my last visit a couple of years ago, she just graduated with a degree in Business Administration from ASU. She was very enthusiastic and positive about her future... and was thinking about opening up her own Asian restaurant or taking advantage of her degree and attaining a position in a big corporation... or even marriage! I was very surprised to see her still here.\n\nAll in all, still a very popular destination among residents in Chandler... about 80% of capacity at 8pm.", "business_id": "jJlOPkv4Xl6vxNzr51fnYw", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-07-31", "type": "review"}

I thought service would be slow, but I was pleasantly surprised when I was given water as soon as I sat down, a menu just moments later, and they came to take my order within minutes.

I asked for extra onions/cilantro and again, less than 2 minutes later they were at my table.  Whoa.  These people know how to be quick.  Love it.\n\nMy pho was delicious.  I always get the pho ga (chicken), and this one was among the tastiest I've had.  \n\nOnly knock on this place is that they have Pepsi products (blech) vs Coke products, and I didn't notice if they have beer/booze since I was there for lunch.

Maybe because my expectations were too high. We started with the pork spare ribs which had a really yummy sauce on them. But the sauce was a little too thin and didn't really adhere to the meat and the ribs themselves were chopped up into bite sized pieces which made them somewhat difficult to eat. I ordered beef pho for my entr\u00e9e and of course it was delicious (Is it possible to have bad pho?) but I found that the broth had less flavor to it than other places I've tried. Like some spices were missing or something. My hubby ordered the mixed grill with rice and he was pretty happy since it came with a lot of meat. We also split the flan for dessert and it wasn't anything special. The fun and funky d\u00e9cor was cool but I found the plastic chairs to be pretty uncomfortable.\n\nI thought that the prices were pretty reasonable. We spent $35 for a fairly large amount of food. I am surprised by some of the other reviews that said Cyclo is too expensive. Who says authentic Asian food has to be dirt cheap? The owner has created a cute little trendy restaurant with a loyal following (we saw lots of regulars greeted warmly) and so she can charge a little more than your average strip mall dive.\n\nIn summary, I enjoyed my experience here but was not overly impressed with the food. I might come back if I was in the neighborhood but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.", "business_id": "UIGFrEcoDsw05I1UOrxdOA", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-08-14", "type": "review"}

We noticed a neighboring table with their order of crawfish and was definitely excited.  It came in a large bowl with red potatoes, corn on the cob and sausage.  They also brought extra bowls for the shells and a plate for us to eat on.  The Big F requested limes, salt and pepper to make a dipping concoction.\n\nI dove right in and noticed the big difference...the crawfish was not fresh.  It was old or way overcooked.  The tail meat didn't come off the shell easily and was broken up.  I thought it was just the first one and continued eating.  Unfortunately, this wasn't the case.  There was little to no head juice either, which was very disappointing to me.  The Big F was easily disgusted with the crawfish and we were glad that we only ordered two pounds to start.  (We usually go for two pounds each!)  The corn, potatoes, and sausage were good though, but it didn't make up for the bad crawfish.  Since it comes in a bowl, there's no sauce on the bottom for you to dip your crawfish in after you shell it.  No bibs were provided, which explains all the stains on my shirt.\n\nWhen I'm craving crawfish, I'll drive up the road and spring the extra cash over at Hot N Juicy.\n\nFor this experience, I give it a TWO stars.\n\nOverall, a four stars for their Vietnamese food, and a two stars for their bad crawfish.

I love the fresh ingredients in Vietnamese cooking, it really adds a distinct taste that sets it apart from Chinese food.  If you're gonna do Vietnamese, go to Pho Kim Long, I highly recommend it!", "business_id": "FV16IeXJp2W6pnghTz2FAw", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-08-14", "type": "review"}

The hostess in the front desk was pretty cool, but not the rest of the staff.  Sadly that is about the only good thing I can say about this place.  Now on to the rest of the review.\n\nI visited this place because I was in the mood for some pho and happen noticed this place while driving by.  Dropped in and the first thing was the massive waiting line to be seated.  There were lots of people waiting outside too.  Waiting outside on a HOT summer day is not fun.  After 30 minutes of waiting, we were finally called and seated.  This is where everything started to go down hill from here.\n\nWe were seated and we knew what we wanted because we were looking over the menu while we were waiting, so we ordered a coconut drink, the regular pho bowl and spring rolls.  The server wrote that down on his notepad and just disappeared.  We waited for at least 30 minutes and not one single item we ordered arrive on our table.  We then started to notice people that were seated after us got their order and they were chomping away.  After about 40 minutes of wait time I was wondering how long it takes to make just a simple coconut drink.  Are they sending a monkey to climb up a coconut tree to retrieve the coconut or something?\n\nWe finally saw our waiter and asked him to check on our order and he returned back to us to let us know they were out of spring rolls, therefore they did not make the pho or the coconut drink.  The thing was, the server said it in a way where it was OUR fault that we ordered something they ran out of and that's why they couldn't complete our order.  I just don't understand how when they ran out of one item that is no way related to the other items on the order could prevent the entire order to be made.  It's not like it was a combo or something.  I understand if I ordered a #1 at Mc Donalds and they tell me they ran out of fries, then I would order something else, not make me wait 30 minutes and tell me they are out of fries therefore they can't make the burger.  I really wanted to tell the server to GTFO here cause there is no way you run out of spring rolls in a Vietnamese pho restaurant.  It's the second most popular dish right after pho.  Its like a chinese restaurant running out of rice.  This is a MEGA CATASTROPHIC EPIC FAIL.  \n\nThe food finally arrived after putting in our order the second time, but the coconut drink did not.  I was about to take off my shoes and go out back to get the coconut down from the tree myself.  The pho dish was OK to average at best!  After waiting 45 minutes of waiting I have the right to have high expectations.  The size of the bowl was really small.  I wonder if they gave us the kids size bowl by mistake.  I can't believe they charge $8 for this kid size bowl of pho.  I can get a bowl of pho that is twice the size for $5-$6 at home!  The coconut drink finally arrived about halfway into finishing our food.  The drink was meh.  \n\nIn the end, the food was average, but the customer service just left a really bitter taste in my mind.  People think it is a good thing that they are open 24 hours.  No guys, that is not a good thing, they are there to FAIL 24 hrs a day.  Would you like to go to a place that fails 8-10 hrs a day or 24 hrs?

Or is it that everyone loves to say the name? In any case, this place gets a lot of traffic.\n\nAs for me, I haven't been here since December of 2008. Back then, I really wasn't into pho. Since then, I've been to quite a few places. While I'm still no expert, I obviously know what I like. I've been meaning to return so that I can properly evaluate this restaurant.\n\nSimply put, PKL is A-OK. Their pho satiates the appetite. Their broth is pretty good and the rest of the ingredients complement the soup nicely. Unfortunately, they do not serve tripe, which for me is a bummer. However, they do have that \"home made\" style chili sauce that I strangely prefer over plain old Sriracha. There's nothing wrong with Sriracha of course; I'm just weird like that.\n\nOne thing that PKL has going for it is the decor. Places like Pho So 1 make better pho but are completely devoid of any personality. You would never confuse PKL with a diner. That's really not that important to me though.\n\nIn the end, it's all about the pho. In that case, PKL is good enough, especially when no other place is open.", "business_id": "FV16IeXJp2W6pnghTz2FAw", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-07-18", "type": "review"}

Since the management changed a couple of times, the cleanliness of the environment had skyrocketed. There used to be an open area seafood, like the tanks you would see at 99 Ranch or any other Asian market, which was cool and all, but they got rid of it and added an extra table. The drinking water (thank god) was also one of the many things that they had switched around! Oh yea, I think they charge on soda refills, so beware!\n\nOf course, for food, you would most likely end up ordering the Pho whether it would be the soup or rice noodles, for example, the common  Pho Dac Biet (combination noodles). Sadly, they're kind of mean with the meatballs :( I would only see one floating around. On the other hand, also try the charbroiled pork chop, that one is pretty bomb as well. \n\nGirls, if you're looking for some Viet men or some late night attention, they would gladly tend to your needs and ignore majority of the customers. Don't forget, if there are other groups of girls who come in who, lets say, came back from clubbing, you would immediately become one of the rejectees and may have some difficulty getting employee attention.
