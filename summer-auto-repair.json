The mechanic also pulled up the check engine light code (Goodyear did not tell me when I asked them about the code when I picked up my car), which said that my oxygen sensor was malfunctioning.

Hmmm....  How convenient for Monro?\n\nWell, even if I give them the benefit of the doubt on the tire cracking, the pricing on the tires was ridiculous.  My tires, which were under warranty, would have cost over $500 to get replaced with crap tires (that's with the warranty credit applied).

And that's what I got, along with my tires rotated for a fair price. Two days later I started to hear a sound coming from somewhere under my car. Could not for the life of me figure out what it was! Sounded like I was flying a helicopter. So I took it back a couple days later since they're closed over the weekend. I left it there for a couple hours while they looked at it. They said it was my broken front bumper, a plastic bumper that has been cracked for over a year or so and I'd have to get it fixed to cure the noise. So a couple days after that me, my girlfriend, my roommates and their puppy took a trip up to Erie for a day at the beach. Car shaking and vibrating we headed up the highway. 45 minutes into the drive, doing 65 mph, we all feel something happen to my car that is majorly wrong. So we pull over to the side of a random exit. We get out, look around my car, look under the hood, can't find anything. Then my roommate notices I'm missing a lug nut. The lug nut flew off behind us on the highway. WHEN THEY ROTATED MY TIRES THEY DID NOT TIGHTEN ONE OF MY WHEELS. We could unscrew the rest of the lug nuts on my front left wheel with our hands. That means that when I took my car back to them and asked them about the noise and vibrating, they did not check on their previous work and didn't even drive the car around to actually hear what was wrong. They just came up with some excuse. Not to mention when I called them back they just told me to stop by so they can look at it. LOOK AT WHAT?? We found the problem going 65 mph down the highway and if that wheel would have came off we all could have been seriously hurt or dead. The quality here is not good at all, the receptionist isn't friendly and they lost my insurance card to boot.

I spoke to Jason and he said if we could get it right in they could look at it that day.  My son was there in 15 minutes. When he got there he was told they wouldn't look at it until the next day. \n\nFriday morning Jason called while I was at work, and told me that we needed an $800 repair, a radiator fan assembly and I could go with a used one which cost $278.00 or a new one which cost $600.00. He told me labor would be about 2 hours and that would be $120.00 and then we would have to flush the coolant system because all of the fluids were burnt and then there were diagnostics and shop costs.  He also said because the repair was over $500, I would receive a $100 discount. I was with a client and knowing my son needed his car to get to work I trusted them and approved the work.  \n\nI went to pick up my car at 4:30 Friday afternoon and when I went to pay for it with a check I was told Precision Tune does not accept checks. There was a 5x7 sign with pictures of credit cards on the desk and at the bottom blocked from view in very small print was the no checks policy.  did not have my check card with me (I had given it to my son to put gas in his Dad's car) and I don't carry credit cards.  I asked to speak to the manager and Jason Miles came to speak to me. He told me it was a corporate policy and that \"As per North Carolina law, no auto repair shop in the state of North Carolina accepted checks\".  I also told him I needed a printout of the work order and he told me that was impossible they did not give written estimates.  I was flabbergasted and we proceeded to argue.  Was I angry?  Absolutely. Did I raise my voice?  Yes.  Finally he relented and gave me a printed breakdown of the work. I left went and got the cash and returned.\n\nWhile I was out I called several local North Carolina auto repair shops and asked about this \"no checks law\", no one I spoke to had ever heard of it.  When I returned there was a new 8x10 sign that said No Checks Accepted.  I saw Jason send in someone else to take care of me. I asked for him.  I told him \"I did not like to be lied to.  No one else had heard of this law\".  He proceeded to backtrack and say it was a statute on the NC books passed in December 2012. I also showed him the print out and asked him where my $100 credit was.  He told me it wouldn't show up until the final paper. He and I continued to argue.  Another customer asked to be checked out so he turned his attention to the computer to finish my transaction.  He spent quite some time inputting information into the computer. He said he was giving me an additional $30 discount.  I paid the $680.88 took my car and left very angry. \n\nHere is the breakdown of the bill:\nCoolant system service.......$51.90 Parts.......$48.00 Labor.......$99.90 Total\nPower train Diagnostic....................................$78.00Labor\nRadiator Fan Assembly........$373.85 Parts\nLabor-Driveability.............................................$180.00\nCooling system Discount.....$60.00 Parts.........$60.00 Labor\nShop Supplies..................$39.73\nSales Tax..........................$29.40\nAs you can see the quoted price for the parts was substantially higher and then there is this mysterious Labor Driveability charge. What is that and why is it so much?\n\nSince Friday I have called other repair shops including other Precision Tunes and the cost for this runs somewhere between $300 and $400.  I was totally ripped off. \n\nIf this is the caliber of managers Precision Tune hires you better know a lot about your vehicle and the cost to fix them if you go here.  I personally am telling everyone I know, I'm a hairdresser in the area and posting my story anywhere I can online!\n\nBEWARE OF THIS.

When my ladyfriend expressed that she was looking to upgrade from her old Lexus to a compact SUV with some legit off-road capability and decent fuel economy, I immediately suggested Subaru. \nSpecifically, I recommended the new XV Crosstrek. It falls in line with Subaru's odd propensity for occasionally manufacturing something so niche it borders on the absurd. \"Let's jack up the Impreza hatchback and put gnarly body cladding on it.\" I like Subaru. \nLured in by their Lifetime Power Train Warranty, we decided to spend a Saturday morning test-driving some options at Folger Subaru. We'd seen online that they had a white Crosstrek on their lot with the options my lady was interested in (CVT, moonroof, that color). While navigating from East Independence down Idlewild and back up through the service areas of Folger Subaru and the adjacent Kia dealership was a touch tricky, once we got on the lot we were comforted by the cleanliness, order, and overall presentation of the well-kept Subaru facility. \nSince the car buying process is often intimidating, agonizing and frustrating - I showed up with my game-face on. Armed with info on invoice costs, MSRPs, and true-market values for the car we were interested in, I felt prepared to combat any squirrely sales-tactics that might be thrown at me. We milled around the lot for a bit, checking out the Crosstrek and one of the new Foresters. After a few minutes of kicking tires and peaking in windows, we were carefully approached by a mild-mannered salesman who introduced himself as Kevin. Already on the defensive, I explained that we were only casually looking and intended to compare other makes. Kevin accepted that notion freely. We said, \"Can we take one of these for a spin?\" Kevin replied, \"Of course.\" \nAfter a couple enduring rides full of tight u-turns, light acceleration, and fiddling with the fancy doo-dads in each car, we found ourselves debating the Crosstrek and the Forester. Kevin doled out expertise in his usual, non-aggressive way: \"Hey, this does this. And yeah, it has this built in.\" The more we learned, the more we liked. I had cautioned my lady to not express too much enthusiasm for any vehicle (as part of my car-buying game-face philosophy), and she followed that advice with such a poker face that even I couldn't tell if she liked one or the other (or neither). \nWhen Kevin walked inside to grab another set of keys, she turned to me, giddily, and declared, \"I want that Crosstrek!\" So I replied, \"Me too. You should buy it.\" \nThe showroom and offices of Folger Subaru were as pristine as the lot - well polished floors, effective lighting, crisp brochures and touch-panel info-screens. The Outback on the floor was outrigged with a roof rack with a kayak, the Impreza sport was the exact sexy-black with gunmetal wheels that it needed to be, and the white Legacy looked rather proud sitting all alone off to the right. Scents of fresh-popped popcorn permeated the space and my game-face softened a bit.\nThe haggling process was painless and straightforward. Kevin was suprisingly honest and direct (I say surprisingly not of Kevin's nature, but of my preconceptions toward car salesmen in general). We ended up negotiating a price that was only a few hundred dollars over what we had hoped to pay going in (I was unaware my lady's Lexus carried a salvage title... that hurt our trade-in leverage a bit...). \nOnce it came time for financing, the smooth sailing continued. We were presented with a fantastic interest rate (1.5%) and the upsells in warranties and service plans were reasonable and not pressed upon. All in all, I never had to buck any unwarranted advances or parry myself against forceful sales-jabs. In short, Kevin and company gave us an honest deal and made it very easy for us to get the car we wanted the way we wanted it.\nAfter several warm greetings of financiers, sales managers, and service directors - all replete with eye-contacted smiles and firm handshakes - my lady had a new car. \nFolger Subaru offered easily the most pleasant, straightforward and comfortable car-buying experience I've ever had (er, witnessed). Kevin, in particular, was great. He felt less like a salesman and more like a spirit-guide, effortlessly helping us navigate our ways to our ultimate destination. \nThe car couldn't be better - 30+ mpgs, endless utility and cargo space, built from the ground up for customization and optioned for a bevy of nifty add-ons and accessories. We broke it in last weekend on a camping trip in Virginia - really hugs tight curves and climbs inclines like a champ. It gets better every time we drive it. \nHats off to the crew at Folger Subaru - notably the only dealership in Charlotte to be owned and operated by women.

I told him if they would sell it to me for X amount (essentially the invoice price), that I'd bite. Kevin negotiated a dealer trade (they sacrificed a BRZ so I could have a 5speed Crosstrek... heroic) and got the car on the lot in less than 24 hours. \n\nIt took one phone call and one email for me to negotiate my bottom-line, and I had an out-the-door price locked in and agreed to that was exactly within what I wanted to pay for the car. \n\nHaving gone through the purchase process just a few days ago with my lady's car, the financing was a cinch. In one quick evening after work I was driving home in my own new Crosstrek - courtesy of Kevin and Folger Subaru's friendly, efficient staff. At 1.01% financing with a lifetime powertrain warranty, and 7-year 100,000 mile bumper-to-bumper warranty, I really don't know of anyone who's gotten better deals on new cars than we did. \n\nCouldn't be happier - thanks again, Folger Scooby.", "business_id": "gdaFZvWpmWIDri1Fv9PEHA", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-07-17", "type": "review"}

This is in conflict many times when I go to purchase a car, as I struggle with whether I should go new or used.  The last two cars I purchased were brand new and going that route again was my intention when I was heading into getting my next vehicle.  \n\nThis goal was changed when a friend of mine was in the market for a car and he was looking at used vehicles.  In assisting with his search, I changed my perspective on used cars.  I realized that with today's proliferation of leases you could find a good used (or gently used as they say) vehicle.  This realization is how I came across the car that I eventually purchased at University Volvo.   \n\nSelection - The selection at University Volvo was decent and is what persuaded me to consider buying used.  They have a lot of previously leased Volvos on their lot and with easy access to the CarFax Report from their website, you can quickly get a glimpse into the history of the car to help you with your buying decision.   \n\nSales - My sales agent, AJ Varricjione, was great.  Unlike your stereotypical car salesperson, he was not pushy and made the process of purchasing the car very easy.  From the test drive, to negotiation, to closing the deal...I felt I was being treated fair and honestly.       \n\nService - Since purchasing the car, I have only had one service item and it was an issue with a tire.  This issue was quickly rectified by the service department to my satisfaction.  They even provided a loaner vehicle while the issue was fixed.  My only complaint was that service did something I asked not to be done and that was wash the car through the automated car wash.  Something you shouldn't do with a black painted car unless you like faint scratches all over it (refer to the 1st sentence of my review).  After some elbow grease and my orbital buffer, I had it shining again.       \n\nOverall - I would recommend buying a car here.  It was definitely a positive experience and working with AJ changed my historical view of the car salesperson and made the experience a 5-Star one.", "business_id": "UWtpIca-ub74r6Lgwfu0Og", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-07-19", "type": "review"}

Yes, I could save a ton of money on parts by buying items online, but as mentioned, I respect dealerships and understand the benefits of supporting local businesses.  \n\nThat said, this particular VW dealership (the Zimbrick on Century Avenue is only a VW dealer, BTW - no Acura any longer at this location) shocked me with their inability to comprehend a simple request for oil, an oil filter, and a fuel filter.\n\nI called to check the price and availability for some common, everyday maintenance items for my VW Jetta.  My Jetta has the 1.9L BRM Diesel motor (\"PD\" style), and as such has some unique requirements as identified by Volkswagen, specifically when it comes to oil.  VW mandates that you use their 505.01 approved oil in the BRM diesel motor.  Failure to do so may result in a voided or compromised warranty.\n\nSo imagine my shock when the parts guy told me to use \"any old oil\" while on the phone.  When I tried to correct him and request the 505.01 Castrol VW oil, he seemed to get a bit unnerved.\n\nI then asked about a fuel filter, and despite having told him the make, model, year, and engine type of my VW on three separate occasions, he still misquoted my filter.  I then gave him my VIN, and he was still confused.  A few minutes later, he quoted me the correct filter, but at a price that was easily 2x higher than what I would pay from any other online VW parts dealer.\n\nSo, I declined to purchase anything from this local resource, and will now have to shop online with an out-of-the-area dealership.  I'm sorry, but my confidence was shaken immediately, and I was floored by the sky high price (they quoted $60 for the filter; everyone else is $25).", "business_id": "uyp8kpTXKfKXvAB8HdJSAA", "stars": 1, "date": "2009-07-17", "type": "review"}

At first it seemed like a good experience but after we got the car home, things took a turn for the worse.\nFor starters, we noticed a chip in the windshield a few hours after we picked up the car. We called them to tell them and see if they'd fix it, since it was pre-existing. They only referred us to call \"their guy\" that does their repairs. Well, we called \"their guy\" and after 3 days of playing phone tag, my husband and I ended up taking it to Safelite on our own. \n\nThen, the transmission started being weird. Shifting on the car was acting up, and the trans felt like it was slipping when we would put the car in reverse. The RPMs would get really low. At this point we had only owned the car for like 3 weeks... And it only had 24k miles on it.\nSo again, we called Zimbrick to see if they could do something. Long story short, we had to pay $120 out of our own pockets to get the car \"diagnosed\" at a dodge dealership.And then we were told nothing was really wrong with it, but they noticed the trans fluid was low. Zimbrick replaced the trans fluid for free. Big friggin deal. \n\nSo then after all this, I take the car for a standard oil change at Sears and the guy asks me if I'd like a new air filter. He showed me the old one and it was black as night. Why didn't Zimbrick do an oil change/inspection before putting the car for sale?\n\nThis makes me feel like Zimbrick only makes their used cars look cosmetically good enough to sell...

I have lived in the area all my life and never knew what this place did. It is actually a serious repair shop and sort of specializes in older quality cars and older boat motors. It does not come up when you Google boat motor repair. You have to go right to ARA to find out what they do here. Word of mouth is where they get their customers from and they get a lot.\nI have a ten year old, 50HP, two stroke Mercury outboard that was running rough. I had taken it to the local Merc dealer here in the Madison area and after three visits it still had the same problem that it had originally. Hard to start and rough idle. ARA has a guy there that specializes  in older boat engines and finally got it running like new. It did cost a bit but its worth it to finally have a dependable boat. Since ARA as well as the other marinas in this area do not do on the water repairs you have may have to do a shake down cruise after the first repair  to get a final adjustment.  I was told might happen and it did. The technician took it upon himself to get a shop manual for this engine and educate himself on the correct settings for the carburetors and linkages and the end results is that It runs very well now.\n\nThey do have a yard with a lockable gate on the left end of the building if you have to leave you boat or car here but it's not the most secure. The back of the yard has  train tracks running near it and there is no fence. It does not seem to be a big deal here but removing valuables from your boat or car makes sense as it does at all of  the other repair places and marinas. If you have a problematic car or boat that no one else seems to be able to figure out you might give this shop a call. I had trouble getting thought to them on the web site and had to call but it might be fixed by now. Casey is the owner and counter man when you call.

They aren't cheap  here but either was the other place that did not fix my problem. I was told right out that it might take a return visit after the initial fix to do some fine tuning and it did. Since most of the marine dealers do not do on the water repairs its up to the customers to take it on a shake down cruise to check it out after the initial repair. My carburetors needed rebuilding and the tech took it upon himself to get the right manual for this engine and correctly adjust the linkages to the three carbs to make my problems go away. I was not charged for the second visit or for the manual. It became a shop manual.\nThere is a yard here to the left of the building with a locking gate but there are no fences surrounding it and it is open air, so if you drop something off have a cover for it and remove any valuables. This is true of the other repair shops as well but thought I would mention it. All in all if you have a boat or car that you like and want running correctly ARA would be a good place to call. Judging by my visits here you might see a big ski boat next to a BMW one day and a Corvette and a boat like mine the next. Pay up and give them a shot. They have been here a long time and and seem to keep busy by word of mouth alone. Google did not bring them up for marine repair but I believe it may in the future.", "business_id": "BRqIGc5nGobwIVxX9vxyig", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-08-11", "type": "review"}

It did take about 45 minutes and the wrong size for the front tires was almost ordered, but the person helping me was friendly and helped me get everything squared away for a mail in rebate.\n\nMy appointment to get the tires installed was a week later and that's where things went south. I dropped the car off to have the service done. When I returned to pick it up, approximately a half hour of receiving the call that it was done, I saw my car sitting outside the front door in what may have been the fire zone. . The driver's side window was all the way down making it very easy for someone to walk by and grab something out of my car. And since it was parked right in front of the entrance, it made this an even greater possibility. The sky was also overcast so if it rained, I don't think anyone would have gone outside to roll the windows up.\n\nSo after going inside to get my key and leave, I got back in my car and was welcomed by grease all over the driver's side seat, arm rest, door handle, and gear shifter. I went back inside and told the person working about this. He had someone go out and attempt to clean it up. After 5 minutes, he said he was done. I went back to the car and it looked like he had only halfway cleaned it up. I then went back inside to inform the person in there that the car was still not clean. This time, he was the one that went out and cleaned it and did a much better job than the original guy. He was also apologetic. He seemed to get everything off except for two tiny spots, which may or may not have been there before.\n\nUnfortunately, my experience with this store did not end that day.  About a week later, on a Saturday afternoon, I went to my car in the garage and the rear passenger tire was low.  The tire pressure was at 4psi.  I took out my mini compressor and put air in the tire which took about 20 minutes.  While filling it up, I could hear the air leaking out slowly.  I took the car to Firestone down the street to have it looked at.  After nearly an hour of waiting, Firestone told me that tire was installed incorrectly and that the tire bead was damaged and would not seat correctly.  They told me they could temporarily fix it and put it back on since there was no place near that had the same size tire in stock.\n\nFirestone called Tires Plus and told them what happened.  I was told to go in to Tires Plus and let them know what happened.  After spending nearly 3 hours of my Saturday afternoon at Firestone, I drove over to Tires Plus to let them know what happened and get another tire ordered.  However, it was a Saturday and there wasn't a manager there so there was nothing they could do.  I called first thing Monday morning, explained what happened, and got a new tire ordered.  I picked it up the next day and had it installed at Firestone and everything was ok.\n\nIt's hard to believe that Tires Plus and Firestone are owned by the same company.  One was horrible and one provided great customer service.", "business_id": "zHdt_KW2QqgJJ9bLmtShdQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-06-09", "type": "review"}

I can't begin to emphaize how much that would have pissed me off, so I guess we're all fortunate that didn't happen.

He simply says of course. Okay?? How about some courtesy and let me know, i don't know, 17 minutes ago when i asked as you were walking away. When i called, 4 hours later!, i asked if it was ready, they said it has been waiting... So where was my call? I came in i waited for 9 minutes (i keep track of time, just a weird tick i have) and a ;lady walks up and asks me and the other guy, who was first? I say i was because he just walked up and she says never mind, i will help him first. Okay? Why even ask... After that, she leaves to the back.... Another guy walks up and helps me. Whilst doing so a lady who knows everyone since they are all talking and laughing and talking about unprofessional things they did on their off time (which, do what you want, why am i hearing about it at the work place?) grabs a water and drinks from it and puts it back! that is the water they are selling customers.. So, i was not happy with the quality i got, not okay, not ever going back.

Being that I drive a GMC vehicle, I thought it would be appropriate to get my tire repaired at this store and replace my other tires when I was there since it was right across street from where my tire went flat. Arrived at 1230pm after I called at 1130am to let them know I was on the way with a donut tire. The parts department told me at 1130am that the tire I needed was not in stock but would be ordered. I had to demand my keys back at 300pm when the tires still had not arrived to the Van GMC dealership. None of the staff including Greg (service advisor) kept me posted while I waited several hours (check in at 1230pm, left at 315pm). I drove from Scottsdale to Phoenix  Coulter Cadillac GMC. I called ahead and spoke to William at the Coulter GMC. He said the tires were not in stock but would be there when I arrived. I arrived and checked into Coulter GMC at 414pm, checked out and paid / drove away with new tires at 446pm. \n\nToday in mail, I get a letter from Vans that since I left due to poor customer service, I am not allowed back to the dealership. I wouldn't recommend any one go there and I certainly will not be back. When I called to speak to manager, Greg (same service advisor) answered, said that James was in charge. I spent 19 minutes explaining scenario to then be told he is not a manager. The manager will be back next week so  I can call back to repeat my story to Shawn, the real manager. \n\nVans cost of labor = $40.\nCoulter cost of labor = $24.\nVans cost of tires = $560.\nCoulter cost of tires = $428.\nTime differences explained above.\n\nLesson learned, go to Coulter Cadillac GMC on Camelback / 12th Street every time. Cheaper and less wait time. Time is valuable and so it money. Make decisions wisely. And I have to say that sometimes cheaper means less quality, but I can assure you this is not the case.

Usually a shop will tell you to find the receipt and bring it in to them before they will ever cover work that they've done in the past but this was the complete opposite. You just don't get that these days!! It's extremely out of my way to go to the shop but I will continue to bring my business back here.", "business_id": "uKNp1tdMEibbriPE9bhZKg", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-07-08", "type": "review"}

They provided me a loaner car that night and to use around town the next day so they could keep my truck, and repair it the following day. I was then able to travel safely without worry. Also, I would bet that both Mr. Martin and Dave slept better knowing that I was not traveling in an unsafe vehicle.  Thank you guys.\nAnother story involves my wife's auto repair price comparisons with our friends and other repair facilities. She/we found that Martin's was very competitive for the services they provided. \nLastly, while my vehicle was in the shop for an unrelated problem, it was noted that my battery was also going bad. Since the battery was under warranty, they simply took the initiative to make the exchange and the repairs, saving me considerable time and frustration of having to replace the battery on my own or re-schedule a return visit.\nThank you for the great care.", "business_id": "uKNp1tdMEibbriPE9bhZKg", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-08-16", "type": "review"}

Overall, I like the shop. They seem honest and the repairs they've done on my car (replacing a water pump & thermostat) have been handled well and I didn't have additional problems. They ain't cheap though, that's for sure! $350 for water pump replacement and $500 to replace my thermostat and radiator hoses. And that's for a Chevy. \n\nI like that they offer free transport from their shop back to your home. 2 of the 3 times my car was in their shop, they did call me later in the day to tell me the status of my car, and my car was fixed by the end of the day all 3 occasions. They did forget to do an oil change one time when I asked them to do this while my car was in the shop for the water pump replacement and there was another occasion where I asked them to install a tail pipe on my car which at first they said they could do, but then later called me and said they couldn't do after I had dropped the car off and left to return to my home. That cost me a taxi ride and about 2 hours of my Saturday morning for nothing. \n\nBut as I said overall I like the shop.

First off, upon meeting the owner, Ray, I was really impressed. Super nice guy and seemed very knowledgeable about these persnickety cars. So I left him my late model BMW sedan for an air-conditioning issue, which I feared was a leaky evaporator. Thankfully it wasn't and they accurately diagnosed the issue as an easily-accessible, broken AC compressor wire under the hood. For a very fair price, his mechanic fixed that wire and another broken wire they discovered near the gas tank. Everything worked great when I picked it up. I did a quick inspection under the hood before leaving, and noticed that the \"fixed\" wire was not routed the same way it was before - it was now hanging over (but not touching) the exhaust manifold, which gets VERY hot. The mechanic said he would have placed conduit around the wire to protect it, but that he had \"run out.\" Well, OK. Not a big deal, I told him, I have some in my garage at home and would take care of that. Upon opening the hood the next day after a short drive, the electrical tape he had used to wrap the repaired wire was gooey from the heat and, worse, it was now touching the manifold, causing a wee bit of smoke to rise. Upon closer examination, I realized the mechanic had misrouted the wire entirely, removing it from the wire harness brackets on the engine block and AC compressor that are there to keep it away from the exhaust manifold. Did I mention that these exhaust manifolds get VERY hot? Had I not \"repaired the repair,\" the electrical tape and wire insulation would certainly have continued to melt, leaving exposed wire touching the metal manifold. Not good. Of course, after fixing this problem, I immediately went to the back of the car to look at that repair and found the repaired section of wire hanging below the rear bumper cover. Unfortunately, it too had not been placed back into the correct wire harness. Again, had to \"repair the repair.\" Based on my experience, I cannot recommend this shop. BTW, I left a VM message with the owner to tell him what happened and never received an apology or call back.", "business_id": "Yhbsyq_n4J3vLhw9WkXwAw", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-08-14", "type": "review"}

They could not locate the vehicle I wanted locally, nor could they get a VIN number for the vehicle I wanted out of state.  I did not need the actual vehicle right away, but I did need to complete the transaction right away, to ensure that I could use the Cash for Clunkers program.\n\nI was in the dealership for 4 hours on 7/26/09 working with Nate, the salesperson, and JJ the finance guy.  To be totally fair, I did test drive three models of vehicles, so take that into consideration to the time frame.\n\nInterestingly, Big Bell Kia (Which is rather small actually) initially told me that I should hurry up and buy the car because the Cash for Clunkers would end in a matter of days.  Later when they could not find the car I wanted, they changed their statement to I had \"plenty of time.\"   I really didn't appreciate the attempted manipulation.\n\nBig Bell Kia said that they could get the car at the Tucson Desert Kia dealership, but the dealer wouldn't call them back with the VIN.  I managed to get in touch with this dealer and was told that they did not have this vehicle. \n\nI did manage to find 2 of the specific make, model and color in the Phoenix Metro, which leads me to believe that Big Bell Kia was either being intentionally deceptive, or completely incompetent.\n\nWhen I went back into Big Bell Kia to get my deposit back, I was made to wait 30 minutes while the sales people had a pow-wow in someones office.  I watched the entire thing.  I don't know what they were talking about, but it takes one minute to run a credit card.\n\nThen I was accosted by the owner.  She started out saying that she was \"disappointed that they didn't get my business, and what could they do to earn it back.\"  I said have the car in the parking lot, or have a VIN to complete the transaction.\n\nAfter that the owner got REALLY NASTY.  I told her that the matter was closed and I was done with the discussion, she kept being nasty, and I had to walk away.\n\nThe cherry on the crap Sundae of Big Bell Kia was when Nate, the salesman I worked with (who was initially quite pleasant and easy to work with) called me the next morning 7/28/09 and was equally hostile with me.  \n\nNate said that he spent the day driving to get my car.  I know this is not true for a fact, because Nate told me yesterday 7/27/09, that he was still trying to locate my car.  at 2:00 PM yesterday 7/27/09, when I called him, he was still in the office.  When he called me 7/28/09 he then claimed that he missed spending a day with his kids because of me.  I told him on 7/26/09 that it was not necessary to skip a day with his kids, just to locate my vehicle, get the VIN, and complete the sale.\n\nI actually told him to spend the day with his kids, and not to worry about getting the car to Phoenix, but just to get the VIN number so that the sale could be complete.  I told him that I was willing to wait a few days for the car, if my clunker was processed.\n\nI bought the car at a different dealership, for $500 less than Big Bell Kia and in just over two hours.\n\nTake this and all other reviews with a grain of salt, there are three sides to every story, but this was my experience and I would not recommend Big Bell Kia due to the inappropriate nature of the owner and employees.", "business_id": "MNMThMYpXa_UXZHQEEYS1g", "stars": 1, "date": "2009-07-28", "type": "review"}
