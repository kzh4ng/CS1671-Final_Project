THE SANDWICHES are done Pittsburgh-style, sort of like Primanti's, and they are as perfect today as they were back in ancient times when I first started visiting the place.  Alexion's is a clean and peaceful little place in the Rook Station part of Green Tree, the oldest part of the town.

Every trip back to the 'Burgh wouldn't be complete without a lunch or dinner there. It's my go-to place for meeting friends for a meal when we want something tried and true with no froufrou. And I am never disappointed. \n\nI have heard grumblings for the past couple of years that Tessaro's partially cooks their burgers throughout the day and then finishes cooking them \"to order\" so I asked the waitress if I could have a fresh patty, not pre-cooked. She didn't seem bothered by my request. And honestly, I don't know if I would be able to tell the difference. That being said, it still was the best tasting perfectly cooked burger I have had in a long, long time. With all the new specialty burger joints popping up across the country, I still dare any one of them to stand off side by side with Tessaro's. Our usual picks are the Deli and the Bacon-Blue Cheeseburger, but you can pick any burger on the menu and be satisfied, and then some. I also love their home fries. Yummy! The marinated gourmet chicken sandwich is also a winner if you aren't into red meat! \n\nOne of my other favorites at Tessaro's which I have to admit I haven't had in eons since we haven't made it there for lunch recently is the tuna melt on rye. It has been on the menu forever. If you want one, you have to go for lunch as even though its on the lunch menu, they refuse to make it at dinner :( \n\nThe atmosphere here is strictly neighborhood bar/restaurant. Nothing fancy. I am sometimes put off by the way they offer seating (first-come, first-serve) and they will try to cram four people at a table that is meant for only three.

After working all day, and driving 2 hours to get home I was a little grumpy and wanting a good drink.\n\nMy two friends and I decided on the sangria. I've had it on numerous occasions and it can really hit the spot. The waiter suggested the caraf but HB warned us saying that they stuff it full of ice. The waiter insured us we would get around a glass and a half. We bypassed HB and ordered the caraf. Upon arrival we knew it was no bueno! The caraf was heaping full of fruit on the top followed by way too much ice. Our serving glasses also were heaped with the stuff even though we had asked for lite ice. I asked the waiter to pour for us bc I knew sangria was going everywhere. We ended up with our glasses 3/4 full and a watered down juice cocktail. We all told the waiter that it was pretty awful but he did nothing to correct the insult. Never ever order the caraf!!\n\nTo eat I had the pulled pork sandwhich and a side of mac n cheese. The flavor of the pulled pork was good and the pasta was delish. I will say the pork had some fatty bites that I didn't care for.

He brought us our drinks and then left us to converse. Then we waited for our food.\n\n20 minutes\n\n40 minutes\n\nAN HOUR.\n\nWe started noticing that other patrons were receiving their food when they had sat down well after us.

There is an area for live music, and a couple of dart boards, I did not wander around or to take in the entire place, but I was told that there is an area with billiard tables as well.

The waitresses are wearing school girl outfits, complete with tiny little plaid skirts, knee high argyle socks, and skin tight tank tops. Somewhat similar to the outfits worn by the Tilted Kilt girls. Quite appealing. Aside from thier appearance the wait staff seem to have at least a rudimentary knowledge of the beers on thier list.\n\nThe beer selection was outstanding, somewhere around 100 taps, and at least as many bottles covering a wide array of styles.

Thursday nights feature Westside Andy & Mel Ford, and that is always a good time.  There are decent taps, though last time I was there I believe they had removed Esser's Best which was my go-to every time there.  Most of the specials tend toward the $1 shot variety, but I especially like that Capital pints are $2 on Wednesdays and you can get pitchers of Spotted on Fridays for a crazy $5.  I also learned that your second drink before noon on Sundays is free, and domestic taps are 50 cents.  More on that later.  The bartenders are for the most part good, but if you're there on the wrong day they seem to forget about you in favor of talking with the regulars.\n\nThe food is pretty standard: not too fancy but good.  Sometimes the food doesn't come as advertised in the menu.  Once I ordered a Reuben that strangely was lacking Swiss cheese, though I didn't notice until halfway through as it was still a tasty sandwich.  I like the bison burger here, but the last time I ordered this it came sans tomatoes, likely due to the salmonella issue at the time.  Also that day my sister found the Hody Chicken's buffalo sauce to be beyond her tolerance for spiciness.  My sister's boyfriend was suitably impressed with the Hody burger, but he thought that they had left of the special Hody sauce.  It might have just been a bad day, because most of the other times I've been here there were no problems.  I do believe that the overall quality depends on the day you stop in.  Some of the bartenders kind of throw things together, while others take their time and do a decent job.  I haven't been there regularly enough to establish a schedule, so it's been hit or miss for me lately.  I've also tried a few of the appetizers and the onion straws and quesidilla wrappers are very good every time I've had them.  \n\nThe main drawback with the Hody is the regular crowd.  On Thursdays when Westside Andy & Mel Ford are playing the crowd is great - a variety of people, young and old, some dancing to the music, some sitting at the bar or nearby tables.  Other nights the crowd can get a bit too townie for my liking.  It can be uncomfortable, especially when half the bar turns to look at you when you walk in.  Sundays can be the worst.  I think that some of those people nearly live there.  The place is pretty open and there is a lot of space, but it still can get quite smoky.  There is a few outdoor tables along Elmwood, and these are perfect for a weekend afternoon.  I would probably return to the Hody more if it weren't for the small inconsistencies in the food and the slight hostile feeling that I sometimes pick up from the regulars, but overall the Hody is a reliably good time.", "business_id": "xbJ9tdGbcVJIUkNgHSCwZQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-06-27", "type": "review"}

At full price, I'd rather go to Burger King or TGIF.\n\nIt's also unfortunate that their 2.00 bud light draft special was broken. I thought they'd replace the deal with something else other than can bud-a-ritas...\n\nIf you really want to try this place come for half off burgers. On a Thursday.

First of all, it was July and for people like us who live in Arizona, the heat is here to stay and we learn to deal with it. However, for visitors from all around, the 110 degree weather means that they will not eat outside. So we had the choice to wait for an indoor table or take the patio seating that had immediate seating -- and I mean, every seat was available on the patio. The hostess looked at us like we were crazy as we took the patio and we proceeded to order food. Now, contrary to common belief, just because a sports bar is named after an athlete, doesn't mean that athlete frequents there every day. But on this particular day, Dan Marjele happened to walk into Marjeles. The irony cracked us up because we knew that the out of towners probably assumed this is a regular occurrence. And hey, maybe it is! \n\nAnyway, this is the perfect bar to grab a quick and decent bite to eat before a sporting event downtown. The buffalo chicken is delicious, as is the Chicken Teriyaki sandwich and any other wrap on the menu. It's one or two notches above generic bar food and the drinks also flow nicely. They have plenty of TVs inside so even if you don't go to the game, it's still a fun atmosphere to sit and watch the game on the TV. \n\nI wouldn't drive to Downtown Phoenix just to visit Marjeles, but this is definitely one of my choices when I'm looking for a sports bar before or after the game in Downtown Phoenix.", "business_id": "45puCRQ6Vh_IIAy7kkfFDQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-08-11", "type": "review"}

All restaurant owners need to take a page out of this guys book. Reason in a second. Let's talk about food first.\n\nI had the baby back ribs and the were awesome. Not quite as good as the baby backs from Houstons but pretty darn close. My girlfriend who loves PCG decided to go with something different this time around and ordered one of their signature dishes. It was some sort of chicken. I do consider myself a foodie so the first thing I was thinking is how can chicken be a signature dish? Chicken is boring no matter what you do with it. Anyway, it wasn't that good and the chicken comes on the bone which my girlfriend didn't like. So, since it was a signature dish, recommended by the waiter, I had to return it. My philosphy is that if something is recommended and is a signature dish and it doesn't give you a mouthgasim, it gets returned. So the waiter nicely takes it back and apologizes multiple times and asks if we would like something else. My girlfriend orders her old PCG standby, the Pork Tenderloin. Wow what a great pork dish. I don't care for pork that much but i must say i crushed half of it, it was amazing.\n\nDo I even need to explain the choclate tort??? YUM\n\nBack to the owner. We arrive at PCG at about 4pm to eat dinner, who eats at 4pm, you'd think we went for the early bird special. We get seated in the dining room and are the only ones in the dining room and no one comes out for like 10 minutes. So we move to the bar  and tell the bar tender we are going to eat at the bar because no one came out to greet us or take a drink order. He apologizes, bvut it was NO BIG DEAL. We weren't mad or complaining or anything. Remember earlier I mentioned the signature dish that got sent back. Well the owner comes over to us and says i understand you have had some issues today and we are like ah no problem the food was great yada yada yada. The owner is like NO BOTH of your meals are on me including dessert. We objected and were like you don't have to do that and he INSISTED. Who does this now a days in the restauran business? Most definately not Donovans.\n\nAnyway to sum it up. PCG is awesome, the owner actually cares about his customers and everyone i tell this story to they are like i can't believe he did that.

I could go without the uninspired main menu and the fairly stuffy after-work crowd, but I plan to return as much as possible for the amazing margaritas and ridiculously cheap happy hour food!\n\nI first learned about the restaurant when I posted a thread in the Yelp Phoenix talk forums - I was trying to find out where I could go in Phoenix to get a really good margarita (that is, made with freshly squeezed juices and hand-mixed). A few people (thank you, Jim K. and Natalie G.!) suggested McCormick's, which surprised me because old-school seafood places don't tend to specialize in much besides wine, beer, and old-fashioned drinks like martinis and Manhattans. Anyway, I was thrilled to discover that they were right - that is one perfect margarita!  It was refreshing, strong, and the perfect combination of sweet and sour. When we complimented the bartender (who was really nice and helpful) on the margarita, he explained that they use only freshly squeezed lime and lemon juices, sugar cubes or simple syrup, and tequila. Yum. \n\nOn to the happy hour part (happy hour is M-F from 3:30 to 6:30, btw). When we arrived and took a seat at the bar, there were paper menus that featured the list of happy hour appetizers. There were five appetizers that were $1.95 (this time, the choices were: the 1/2 pound burger with fries, blackened fish tacos, fried clam strips, steamed mussels, and a seafood tostada) and several that were $4.95 (pulled pork sandwich, shrimp cocktail, and one or two others that I can't remember).

The food is over-priced, bland and served by people who are made to say things like \"Welcome to {PLACE}!  My name is {NAME} and I'm going to be your special pal today!  Would you like to try our Loopty-Loo Chicken Snackers?\"  I waffle between snickering and feeling really sorry for the person that has to humiliate themselves for like, $2.85 and hour and probably only averages like, 12% tips.  The feeling passes quickly, as I'm forced to wonder which frozen hockey puck will make it into the microwave and onto my plate.  Typical chain restaurant experience... but not at Chili's!\n\nChili's actually has fresh food!  I mean, it's not fresh like \"that day\" fresh, but it isn't frozen like most chains and they probably got it in that week.  So, it shouldn't be a surprise that the food is pretty decent (for a chain restaurant).  They do have standards (cough) to uphold, though, so if you're looking for something different, don't go to Chili's.\n\nTheir menu is pretty standard - fajitas, quesadillas, ribs, burgers, sandwiches, salads, soups - typical bar and grill food.  I've sampled a bunch of different things and everything was pretty consistent.  Good and flavorful, if not a little on the salty side.  The only thing I really don't like and will never order again is the ribs.  I thought, because unfortunately I remember those baby back ribs commercials, their ribs would be awesome.  They aren't.  They're dry and have very little meat on them.  Don't waste your time because you'll be disappointed.\n\nThe drink menu is pretty crazy.  They have fun fruity drinks, a full selection of liquors and a typical smattering of beers, both draft and bottle.  The drink they're most well known for is their margarita, which, I must say, is pretty good.  I love their Patron margarita and highly recommend drinking at least three of them (and taking a cab home).\n\nThe restaurant itself has a unique layout.  It's a tri-level with dinner seating upstairs and downstairs, a bar and outdoor patio.  I've been seated in all 4 sections and my favorite place to hangout and eat is the bar.  They have flat-screen tv's so you can enjoy sporting events or whatever is on at the time... plus you get your drinks faster!\n\nIf you're looking for lunch or dinner and you don't want fast food or something terribly expensive, go to Chili's.  Out of all the chain restaurants out there, this one is the best.  The Camelback/20th Street location in Phoenix is the best.", "business_id": "kjZJsF1juY_pTOw_A8Ve6w", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-06-07", "type": "review"}

There will most certainly be a 5th, 6th, and hopefully many more visits back to this treat of a dining experience.\n\nFor the first time, we were able to enjoy bar / lounge for cocktails before dinner.  It had not been completed when we were there last. It is really beautiful and very easy to get comfortable inside the lounge and to relax with a drink or two before going upstairs for dinner. The early evening was perfect outside,  so we also chose to spend time on the patio area watching the sun retreat for the day.\n\nDinner was excellent. We have yet to be disappointed. The view is really spectacular. We wished we would have been in a couple of days earlier to watch the electrical storm outside. I can only imagine how awesome it would be to observe from the peak. The Lobster Bisque is out of this world. I look forward to it each time I go! The fillet was cooked perfectly.  We also had the lobster and shrimp prosciutto. They were quite good as well.  The service was well paced and table staff is well informed and helpful. \n\nOur only disappointment of the evening was that there was some confusion to the bar tab. We had closed out our lounge tab, However another parties drinks were added to our bill for the dinner in the transfer from the lounge to restaurant. Though it was corrected, the waiter was surely not convinced that the tab was not ours. This left us with a bitter taste in our mouth as we were leaving.  A five star performance fell to a 4 star over this one incident.  My suggestion, close out your lounge tab and take your receipt. This would have been more convincing and clear to the waiter and would have dispelled any doubt.\n\nThough our trip to the Different Point of View is rare for us as we live out of state, we look forward to it each time we trek to Arizona.

The fianc\u00e9e and I had come to this establishment in celebration of our Anniversary weekend.  The restaurant is perched on a mountaintop inside the mountainside resort, so you will have to drive up a bit to reach it.  However, this place is completely worth it and more. \n\nThe first thing we noticed as soon as we were seated was the view outside the restaurant.  Even though we were seated inside (outside dining area was closed due to heat temperatures), the south side of the restaurant was comprised entirely of floor-to-ceiling glass walls that gave a panoramic view of the entire Central Phoenix area.  Once we were able to take in the view enough to focus on the menu, our server immediately and consistently came to our table for any service we needed.  As we couldn't decide what we wanted to eat, we took the server's recommendation of ordering the Chef's Special which was a five-course gourmet meal with optional wine pairing with each course.  It was not until we were served this that we realized the full extent of the service that was about to be provided.\n\nOur table was waited by not 1, but TWO full-time servers who brought out each course, explained the origin, methods and tastes of every single food item on each course.  In between courses, the restaurant chef (finding out it was our anniversary) sent over complimentary offerings (this was the first time I have ever had chocolate-covered pop rocks).  We literally felt like a wealthy couple that was being pampered and attended to in every single manner. \n\nAfter the meal, we went outside with a bottle of wine and took in the jaw-dropping view of the Valley from the outside seating area.  The only downside of our visit was that this area was closed for dining as the temperatures were too hot, however that wasn't on the restaurant and hence why I am still rating this place as 5-stars.  Our servers graciously took our pictures from various views and locations, and afterwards my fianc\u00e9e and I sat back on couple of the lounge chairs and took in the night skyline view with wine and relaxed.  All in all, it was the best meal I have ever had in a restaurant and easily the best service the both have us have ever experienced in a restaurant setting.  The after-meal view and drinking was so relaxing we didn't want to leave.\n\nThe only thing that may deter the average customer is the price; this was also one of the most expensive meals I have experienced, however the service and the experience is more than worth the price.  This is the best restaurant in overall ambience, food, service and views in all of AZ.  The view alone from the restaurant is enough to trump most establishments here in the Valley.

My girlfriend and I celebrated our two year anniversary at this fine establishment, and we were nothing short amazed. From the ambiance to the food, it is simply the perfect way to celebrate a special occasion with someone you love. \n\nWe had the perfect table right next to the glass that offered an impeccable view of the Phoenix area. Our server was knowledgeable yet not overwhelming. Every employee was extremely friendly, and the service was what to be expected at such an establishment. From wiping down the table between courses to expertly answering your questions, the staff at DPOV is well seasoned. \n\nMy girlfriend decided to do the three course meal for $40 (an absolute bargain), which included an appetizer/salad, entree, and dessert. I just ordered an appetizer and an entree, and we shared the dessert from her meal. She began with the duck confit raviolis while I ordered the risotto appetizer. We were both stunned at how beautiful the dishes were presented (and this remained true for the rest of the meal). The raviolis were delicious and the accompaniments provided an expertly-balanced course. The risotto, I can't belive I'm saying this, simply needed salt! It was garnished with shaved black truffle, so I was able to overlook the underseasoning. For the main course, she had the prosciutto wrapped monkfish while I order the filet. Her dish came with baby artichokes, fresh-made angel hair pasta, and a lemon caper sauce, all of which were wonderful. The prosciutto was nice and crispy and encased a beautifully cooked piece of fish. The filet was accompanied by a potato gratin, summer mushrooms, and a cherry terragon reduction. The mushrooms were excellent and included morels and chanterelles, so I was very happy. The medium rare prime filet mignon melted in my mouth, and the cherry reduction added a nice bite of sweetness to the dish. For dessert we shared the Greek yogurt panna cotta with pineapple-coconut sorbet. Once again, the dish looked just as great as it tasted. All in all, the food at DPOV will blow your mind away. \n\nAfterwards, we walked out onto the patio and enjoyed the view of the lit up city. If you want a dining experience that will bring happiness to your stomach and enjoyment to your heart, come to DPOV.

It's one of my favorite restaurants in the area. I'm continually impressed by the consistency of the quality of their food. I feel like every other restaurant I like gets worse over time, but not Keegan's. The food is always fresh, and nothing looks like it came out of a can.

I've been here twice in the last week for breakfast because it was convenient.  Had the oatmeal both times.  It was good.  The second time I was brought out granola bits instead of raisins and didn't care for that so had to ask for the raisins.  Iced tea is good and they are nice enough to give you a cup to go.  \n\nBiggest complaint over the two visits was on the second one a family with three young children was sat directly across from us even though the entire restaurant was almost empty.  Made conversation harder and the kids were fussy.  Why would the hostess do that?!?!", "business_id": "NX5YHSIyesufcsI7Rg5NLg", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-06-29", "type": "review"}

However, the company reached out and wanted to improve and boy did they.\n\nThe same group of 9 of us went out with 5 kids under 5 years old and four adults, and we had no issues. We were able to sit in a corner booth, which we actually kind of need for all of us. Our food came out quickly and everything tasted delicious.\n\nThe best part about it was the service and our server. He recognized that the kids were getting hungry and a little out of control. He brought them extra crayons, and was able to get their food and drinks out first. \n\nIsland's made a huge come back in my book and showed that they truly are a, \"family restaurant\" and suits the needs of everyone. It just a cool place to grab a burger and hang out.", "business_id": "e0vubCKi8KD8zC2C6FdbuQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-07-01", "type": "review"}

The service here, in the afternoons no less, is consistently slow. As fun as unpredictability can be, I don't feel like playing Russian roulette drive thru because the waits here make you want to blow your brains out. One time I pulled in and ordered an iced tea. Just a typical, unsweetened, no lemon iced tea. IT TOOK 13 MINUTES!! I feel like if there's ever a time you could go into a kitchen and learn how to do fix your order and then come out in less time than it took for you to get an order, there's a problem. The only thing I'm unsure of is if its just the employees who are slow or if the inside of the kitchen is actually another dimension in which time slows down and thus making orders coming out of the kitchen take three times as long as any other Sonic takes.", "business_id": "GoEHXcq_nY4jZOx3Ay5gxw", "stars": 1, "date": "2008-08-19", "type": "review"}
