I went to check this place out on the way home from the airport one Friday night and it didn't disappoint. It is refreshing to walk into a townie bar and not feel like the music stops and everyone in the place is staring at you - I'm guessing the mixed crowd of older hockey fans, young men in collared shirts, and thirtysomethings have probably seen it all during their time at this place. \n\nThe staff was top notch - the orders were somewhat overwhelming as they appeared short-staffed for the night, but my waitress tried to keep a positive attitude for my entire visit. The other waiter was wearing a hooded cardigan, and I wanted to steal it from him due to my difficulty in finding such a quality article of clothing.\n\nWe ordered a white pizza - large in size, engulfed in cheese, full of garlic flavor, flavorful hot sausage. An overall delicious pizza, aside from 2 things: 1, way too much grease (I know this comes with the territory, but still, it is sometimes unbearable); 2, CANNED MUSHROOMS - the worst thing to come out of a can. Ever. I would rather eat canned Alpo than canned mushrooms. And if the mushrooms weren't canned, they were just the worst mushrooms I've ever consumed. The mushroom debacle is enough to lower the review by an entire star - disgusting!\n\nMy advice for the place is keep everything awesome - random music from the jukebox, tasty food, great prices, good crowd and staff - and get some decent mushrooms; why they spoil an otherwise above average pie with such inferior crap, I'll never know.", "business_id": "KayYbHCt-RkbGcPdGOThNg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-02-27", "type": "review"}

When we walked in the singing we heard was NOT good. Oy was it not good... Thankfully, it (mostly) improved from there.\n\nSo there were 3 piano players rotating out on a half hour basis. So each was on for an hour and off for half. Of the 3, two were really good. Good singers, good piano players, and very funny. The third guy, well, not so much. Piano skills were fine. But his singing was not. When he sang in his range, he wasn't too bad actually, but too often he reached for notes that he couldn't get to or forced things that just weren't going to happen. Often his jokes fell completely flat. Luckily the other two usually did most the talking.\n\nThey played a variety of songs as requested by the crowd and would do them in unconventional styles if requested (Closer by NIN as sung by a lounge singer was a highlight). We requested Britney Spears' Toxic cause we thought it would be funny and so they gave it a shot and as luck would have it, it turned out REALLY good. That takes some serious talent to pull off. If they didn't know it (like Toxic) they'd find it and play it. They played a wide variety of stuff.\n\nPart of the experience is based on the crowd. We had a couple larger groups (there on a Thursday night, so smallish group in general) that they interacted with a lot, providing some running jokes and comedy. Of course, that also meant some annoying drunk people feeling like they could take over half the show.\n\nMy friends were BIG fans of the super cheap beer specials. $1 drafts from Rock Bottom next door. The waitress wasn't great but it could have been that she was the only one there and the layout isn't that easy to navigate. The bar was generally uncrowded though so getting service there was fast.\n\nIf in the Waterfront for a night out, definitely a place to hit and have some fun if you are up for some fun and willing to sit through a couple clunkers of songs/jokes. Having a fun loving group of friends to mock things with when they go off the rails a bit will help make it more fun.", "business_id": "MKyk4F4HSzHF8v-4cYe3Ww", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-12-08", "type": "review"}

My wife and I, along with my friend and his girlfriend hit up Sing Sing in Homestead. It's apparently located on what was the site of one of the largest steel mills in the area. When it closed they turned the entire site into a large outdoor shopping and entertainment development. The only remaining artifacts from what once was, were the nine or so original mill smoke stacks still standing at the primary entrance. Pretty cool.\n\nSing Sing, which is a piano bar, is attached to the Rock Bottom Brewery and serves a selection of RBB's in-house brews and shares a similar menu. There are no TV's, no sports memorabilia (which is rare for this city), and no big booths for large groups. This place is all about being a cabaret with the focus on the musicians. Mind you this isn't a bad thing, just note that if you want a bar, go next door or across the street to Dave and Busters. I'd say Sing Sing holds about 150 people seated.\n\nThis particular night they were hosting a (shocker) NYE's party. For $40 bucks a person you got a choice of two entrees (beef tenderloin tips or lemon chicken), veggies, mashed potatoes, one free drink coupon, a midnight champagne toast, and, what turned out to be over four hours of non-stop music. Again... Pretty Cool.\n\nThere were three musicians holding down the fort playing more than just piano (drums, electric synth, bass guitar, and apparently I missed the sax). There was plenty of crowd involvement. As in most piano bars you request songs along with a tip. The larger the tip, the better chance of hearing your song you have. I put three requests on a sheet with a 10 and managed to get two played. Their rendition of Toto's Africa was fantastic and surprisingly, my curve ball got hit out of the park when one of the guys actually knew the tune and words to the Theme from TV's \"Growing Pains.\" I was sold from that point on.\n\nI will take this time to note that this is NOT a family friendly joint. I'm not sure if it was 21+ only but I certainly wouldn't bring anyone too young to drive. A good amount of sexual refrences and strong language awaits you.\n\nDrinks were stiff and not horribly overpriced. I think rail mixed drinks were $7.00 and beers were 6 or so (RBB doesn't brew anything I particularly enjoy so I stuck with rum and cokes). All and all my bill wasn't scary and I'm not used to that on Dec 31st. Waitress staff was really nice and incredibly attentive. No complaints there. \n\nThe only down side to everything was group seating as you're sitting at 2-top cab tables. It was easily fixed though as the group next to us was up for rearranging tables from side to side to front to back (allowing us to talk and share food/booze etc), also, being a tourist, we had no idea how hard it would be to get a cab in Homestead. Understandably NYE has its issues with cab availability but we had to wait 2.5 hours for a cab because, as we found out, Homestead is a very suburban community right outside of the city and everyone drives. \n\nOoops!\n\nAll and all a good time and someplace I'd certainly return to if for any reason I'd be back in Pittsburgh... as long as I have a car.", "business_id": "MKyk4F4HSzHF8v-4cYe3Ww", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-01-17", "type": "review"}

It was her birthday, and I didn't really know anything about dueling piano bars. I was picturing glossy black grand pianos with glittering notes, pianists in black jackets and crystal glasses full of red wine. I am really, really glad I was wrong. \n\nIt was gritty, bawdy and quintessentially Pittsburgh. First off, the pianos are scuffed to hell, considering the number of tipsy people who sit on them nightly while being mildly humiliated. The musicians hammer away at them, and they're covered with N@ and Sing Sing stickers. It's obvious they've been well-loved. The music is anything but the elevator music I was picturing; it's rock, hip-hop, oldies, pop, and just about any genre imaginable thanks to the request system (send up a piece of paper with some money) and the amazing repertoire of the musicians. For instance, \"Rubber Ducky\" and \"Gangsta's Paradise\" were both featured when I was there, and both performed impeccably. They also honored a request for a Taylor Swift song only to receive $30 and a request for \"anything else,\" which they promptly followed. The musicians also do funny versions of popular songs, and throw in things like \"yinz\" instead of \"you.\"\n\nI saw in awe of the performers for a decent portion of the night. It must take a particularly special type of person to put on a show like this, considering the energy, confidence, wit, empathy, boldness, silliness, cleverness, and sheer talent a job like this requires. They rotate performers in and out so there's not even an intermission. I've read comments about the baseness of the humor, but I had no doubt the guys up on stage were intelligent dudes. They had great personalities: one was about 140 pounds, cheeky, and quick-witted. He acted out every sport in the winter olympics, and was pretty into this 90-something-year-old lady in the audience called Joan. The other had crazy hair and bright blue Chucks, beatboxed as well as he sang, and made it point to play a handful of songs for my friend's birthday. \"I think Ray Charles is the most soulful guy of all time,\" he said when she requested him.\n\nThere were tons of people celebrating birthdays, and one big bachelorette party the Saturday night I was there. The performers bring the birthday boy/girl, bachelor/bachelorette, etc. on stage (for a $20 tip, which is pretty easy to scrounge up among friends) and humiliate the hell out of them, i.e. this is not the place to be if you can't laugh at yourself. My friend had a short dress on when she sat on the piano, and they sang a three-minute song about her vagina.\n\nLuckily, the show eclipsed the bad service and overpriced, weak drinks, because those did feature heavily throughout the night. The rest of the staff was friendly, however, and I stumbled on the door guy singing and dancing by himself, which made me smile.\n\nSing Sing is definitely not an every weekend type of thing (much like Hofbr\u00e4uhaus), but is a splendid way to celebrate a special occasion. Definitely belongs on every required Pittsburgh experiences list.", "business_id": "MKyk4F4HSzHF8v-4cYe3Ww", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-02-02", "type": "review"}

After our visit yesterday, however, I don't think we'll be back. When we arrived we were greeted by a long line of people waiting to buy game cards. At first there were 2 extremely slow workers trying to do this, then one left while the line was still out the door! The girl that was left was more than incompetent, and was taking extremely long to fill these game cards. We stood in line for over 20 minutes before being told that there was another attendant in the actual game room. Needless to say, the line in the game room was just as long, and they still only had one girl in the booth. It was a Saturday! After we finally got our cards we had to wait yet again to get a beer. 2 bartenders on staff while the bar was completely full. It took us almost an hour before we actually could start gaming. The floors were filthy with trash, and the bathrooms: repulsive! I had to use the restrooms twice during our visit, and not only did both bathrooms I used have no toilet paper in them, but there was TP all over the floors, and the sinks were less than cleanly. My boyfriend mentioned that the guys restroom was no better, as it smelled like pee and the paper towel dispenser didn't work. All I have to say is get your crap together. We could see a difference in the type of crowed that was there on Saturday compared to what it used to be, and I'm I have no doubt it's due to the poor service and attention to cleanliness.

We arrived early for dinner and drinks from a predetermined menu. Dinner started with a salad of clearly bagged, almost brown iceberg lettuce, with some croutons and frozen-then-thawed looking tomatoes that were pinkish at best. I took a few bites of this unappetizing poor excuse for a salad, and I can tell you it was downright tragic. Dinner arrived and since there wasn't any vegetarian options on this predetermined menu, we received a dish that was supposed to contain meat with the meat omitted. It was a huge pile of spaghetti in a bowl. It looked sloppy and tasted worse than it looked. The pasta was overcooked, and the tomato sauce was just watered down pur\u00e9ed canned tomatoes. I saw traces of onion in my dish but didn't taste them at all. I was so hungry that I salted the heck out of this abomination and took a few bites. Yuck. I didn't make a dent in this crapfest. For dessert we were given a choice of chocolate cake, which my wife ordered, and cheesecake, which I ordered. The chocolate cake had freezer burn. Inexcusable! It wasn't edible. The cheesecake was only a hair better, but it had obviously come out of the freezer as well. I know people aren't coming here for the food, but if you are FORCING them to order things off of your menu to fulfill some outdated requirements (two drink/two menu item minimum) then at least make some halfway decent food. It doesn't even have to be memorable...just not OFFENSIVE. Which it was!! Had I paid for any of this I would have made a huge stink, but I tried to be polite and push my food around and make small talk. \n\nThe comedians were good. The venue was nice-ish and we got to sit in the front because we arrived early for our \"event\". Not always the best thing in a comedy club (we only got picked on a little bit). But damn, I was hungry! I found myself fantasizing about all of the crappy Waterfront restaurants and how I'd rather be there...how I'd rather be heating up a discount microwave dinner...how I'd rather have a giant bowl of Captain Crunch...how I'd rather go back in time and eat spaghetti from my high school cafeteria...what a dreadful dining experience.\n\nMy car was also violated in the parking lot. I had an adorable German license plate on the front of my adorable German car which was stolen while I was eating hideous food, which was just the slap in the face I wanted when finally retreating to my car.

I truly believe that's the only thing that can save this place. Do yourself a favor and eat beforehand, and just order a beer. Well, two I guess. Other diners at our table complained about the quality of the cocktails so I'd steer clear of those. Unless there is a can't miss type of comedian here, I can't ever picture going back to the Improv.

I will say that the show started at 8pm, and we were there by 7:20 or so.  There were already people seated so we were by no means very early, and heck there were people with full course meals and tables of 10.  The price of the mixed drinks were not disclosed on the menu, leading me to believe that it may leave me short for the mortgage next month, but they did have a 60 minute dogfish head IPA for $6.00.

I hate this place's M.O. The space itself is fine...only a few blind spots, nice intimate venue. They bring decent acts in, although they have a lot of repeats and need to bring in more new acts. But the two item minimum just infuriates me. Overpriced, shitty food and drinks. We went to see Lachlan Patterson last night (hilarious show, very nice guy, signed our CD and posed for photos with people). We dropped $40 on a chicken quesadilla, 6 hot wings, and 2 Yuengling drafts. The whole time I just sit there thinking about all the amazing places I COULD have eaten for $40. Burgatory is right down the street. Hell, TGI Friday's would have been better. I've been to other comedy places in other cities and they often have minimums but everything is either a lot cheaper or a lot better quality.

Make sure you go with a bunch of guys, because it isn't all you care to eat, it is a challenge.  You have to eat all you can eat and your ego is on the line if you don't.  I once went to Ribs night and one buddy of mine ordered a Buffalo Chicken salad when everyone else ordered ribs.  Yea, he regretted his terrible decision.\n\nAnyways.  The food itself.  The ribs are basic baby back ribs that come in a choice of mild, medium, and hot bbq sauce.  I tend to just go medium, b/c I find a hot bbq sauce covers up the taste of the meat itself, and when I eat ribs I care more about the taste and texture of the actual meat with the sauce being a supporting player.  The ribs are ok for mass produced ribs, nothing spectacular.  The most I've done is only two racks of ribs, but that was only because I didn't want to keep everyone else waiting up for me.  Ribs come in a rack in first round, and then re-orders come by the half rack.\n\nPersonally I prefer wing night, as they have fantastic wings.  Wings come in a dozen in the first round, followed by half dozen reorders until you're done.  They have 12 different flavors, but my favorite ones are Buffalo Blue, Old Yeller, and Red Hot Parm.  Buffalo Blue is a tasty bbq sauce that isn't overly sweet like some of their other bbq sauces, Old Yeller is a Carolina Mustard based sauce, and Red Hot Parm is a traditional Buffalo sauce (Frank's Red Hot + Butter) then topped with Parmesan Cheese.  Their Cool Ranch, Garlic Parm, and Spicy Garlic can be a bit greasy, so if you do order one of those make sure its in a batch of 6 and you share with your friends, I kind of like their Spicy Garlic, but no one else ever wants to split an order with me, oh well.  Their Gold Rush and Death Row are their two other non-spicy bbq sauces, but I prefer Buffalo Blue to both of them.\n\nFor their spicy flavors, there's Red Hot, which is just a traditional Buffalo, there's Howlin' Wolf, which is a spicy sour sauce with pepper seeds on it, and there's Hotter than Hell, which is a spicy bbq sauce.  Personally I find Howlin' Wolf tasty in small quantities, but sometimes the sourness gets to me.  I tend to find spicy bbq sauces a bit funky, so I'm not big on Hotter than Hell.\n\nIf I have a big appetite I eat from 24-30 wings.  If its just a regular day I'll eat around 18-22ish wings.\n\nNote: These wings are huge.  They aren't your typical Wingzone or Quaker Steak and Lube sized wings.  These are real wings from real chickens, not some little baby chicks just hatched from their eggs.\n\nThe rest of the menu is just typical American restaurant food with various sandwiches, a burger option, salad options, etc.\n\nHighly highly recommended.", "business_id": "Ts4xsKPU7FNPPZRj-nRjIg", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-01-01", "type": "review"}

We decided to sit in the bar area at a high table which had views of the ample number of TV's.  The beer list that they had was nice with about 20 different beers on tap and a nice selection of bottles.  I ended up having the Philly Shackamaximum with my waitress telling me that she preferred the Long Trails Porter.  It was served in a chilled glass and tasted pretty good to me.\n\nFor dinner we attempted to start off by ordering the Blues BBQ Pork Nachos.  We were told that they did not have any pork and so we were not able to order it.  At this point we were also told that they did not have any veggie burgers as well.  So we started out with the Chicken Chili Nachos.  They were pretty good and were covered with real cheese as opposed to nacho cheese which was to my liking.  For dinner I decided on having the Lovely Lisa's Salad since I love both blue cheese and granny smith apples.  Upon receiving the salad I dug in.  The chicken was cooked nicely, moist and tender, and there was a nice coating of blue cheese on the salad.  However there was a problem since there were no granny smith apples on the salad.  Whenever the waitress came back to check on us I asked about the missing apples.  She went to the kitchen and came back and told us that they were out of them and promptly left.  I am not normally one to complain but I feel like something could have been substituted in for the apples, or that I should have been told before ordering or they could have discounted the salad but none of that occurred.  It is sad that it happened too because the rest of my salad was pretty good but that left the proverbial bitter taste in my mouth.\n\nThe bottom line is that I have been here before and the food is generally good.   However, leaving a major part off an item and being told that the kitchen is out without any rectification will make me think twice before returning here again.  It is a shame because Buffalo Blues does have potential.", "business_id": "Ts4xsKPU7FNPPZRj-nRjIg", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-01-30", "type": "review"}

We were seated all the way in the back of the restaurant/bar, in a room that I didn't even know existed, so apparently Buffalo Blues is bigger than I thought.  It's nice that they have some tables away from the main bar area.\n\nI went for the Hot Veggie Sandwich with sweet potato fries, in some kind of attempt to be healthy.  The sweet potato fries weren't too bad, with a good flaky crisp.  The sandwich left something to be desired.  It wasn't hot, first of all - I'd say the (slightly crumbly) bread had been toasted with the cheese, but all the veggie ingredients were cold, leaving an overall lukewarm effect on the sandwich.  The hummus spread didn't taste much like hummus, and was thick and pastey instead of smooth and creamy.  There wasn't a lot of exciting flavor,  It was just belly-filler, really.  I guess that's what I get for trying to order healthy here.  \n\nI just wasn't much interested in it, and I don't think it was worth anywhere near $8.  I better have a darn good sandwich if I'm paying $8.  Also, it was relatively small in size - I don't have a huge appetite, so that wasn't a problem.  But I guess I think an $8 sandwich should either be awesomely delicious, or big enough that I can take half home.  Buffalo Blues was neither.\n\nNot particularly interested in returning for any reason.", "business_id": "Ts4xsKPU7FNPPZRj-nRjIg", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-02-11", "type": "review"}

For me, personally, it's one of the best places to catch an NFL game...especially if you're not a Steelers fan. On any given Sunday, you'll find fans of just about every team in the NFL taking in a game, so the atmosphere is a positive one. Seating is the only issue. Get there early or you might end up standing to see your particular game, as seating can be a premium by the time the games begin. Luckily, the TV's (there are lots of them) are all labeled with the day's matchups, so finding the game you're looking for isn't a problem.\n\nThe draft beer selection usually has something for everyone, from local craft brews by East End Brewing, to seasonals and your simpler standards (hello, PBR), so if you're a beer person, you won't be disappointed.\n\nAs far as service goes, it's hit-or-miss. I've had mostly great service at the bar, but I've also had average to below average service at tables. During bigger sporting events - primarily Steelers games - the service can be even more iffy due to the sheer volume of people in the bar area.\n\nOverall, I have to rate the food as average. I LOVE their boneless wings, and their wing sauces are all very excellent. Their pulled pork is really tender and delicious, as well, but most of their sandwiches and burgers are simply average. The fries can be either really good, or too soggy and greasy. I think the inconsistency in the quality of the cooking is the main issue. The menu reads really well, which raises your expectations, but sometimes the execution will leave you a little disappointed. It's never horrible, but you'll rarely be blown away by your meal.\n\nIn the end, I'm giving Buffalo Blues a higher rating based on the experience during sporting events, which, let's face it, is the real draw of a \"sports bar.\" As far as sports bars go, it's my favorite place to catch a game. They always get a good crowd for games (whether Sundays during the NFL season, Saturdays during big college games, or for Pens games), and if you stick to the wings and beer, odds are your experience will be great. There's a good chance that you can go in and find fans of your team if you're an out-of-towner looking for a game, and the crowd is much more accepting, friendly, and relaxed than the crowds I've experience in other sports bars in town. Most of my average experiences revolved around non-game times when you try to get a more traditional meal and realize that there are just better options in Shadyside for lunch and dinner.", "business_id": "Ts4xsKPU7FNPPZRj-nRjIg", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-02-28", "type": "review"}

I was mainly interested in seeing Madonna. I do have to say that we had a server who gave us the utmost attention. We had been seated at some tables near the bar mid restaurant that were wobbling and driving me crazy. At the request of the party she moved us up front and center to a much better and stable seat. Much better view to see the Material girl! So our server gets 5 STARS! Not only for that reason, she kept the glasses full and kept checking in with us, and took it all in stride as we ordered at different times and all had separate checks. Very classy, wish I could remember her name. Young girl with dirty blond hair. \n\nThe food was pretty blah in my opinion. Bar food none too exceptional. We had nachos that were on slightly stale chips. Good size. Everyone had a burger or sandwich. As I glanced over to my friends Pulled pork it looked dry and sad left sitting on the plate. She said it was \"EH\". I ordered a Gobbler Club sandwich. It was humongous but not that tasty, pretty dry. How can you go wrong with a club but the thick cuts of turkey did not sit well with me and I didn't like it at all. Bad texture. The commercials and time with fun friends saved the experience but I wouldn't go back to eat. Just drinks and sports. I like the location. Easy to park. Close to shadyside.

Also, I want to have a handful of beers during the games, but I don't want to empty my pockets doing it.

I'll say up front: I only ever go there on Sundays for football, and I would never go there for any other reason.  It is the only bar I know of in the city where you can reliably find every NFL game televised and enjoy your Sunday if you're not a Steelers fan.  Pretty much every team is represented by the crowd on Sundays, with a disproportional number of Bills and Redskins fans.  The crowd is generally friendly, with many of the same faces from week to week.\n\nThey tend to have a wide selection of beers that rotates pretty regularly, but wide selection doesn't always mean good selection.  That said, sometimes they get some really great beers that you wouldn't expect to find at a sports bar.  Whatever you do, don't order a bloody Mary, they're atrociously bad.  The staff is almost universally friendly, with the exception of one barback who seems to always be in a bad mood and rude to customers (he often takes over as bartender later in the day on Sundays).  That said, the wait staff don't seem to know much about the food or beers that are offered, often mis-characterizing new beers that are on tap or giving wrong information about things on the menu.\n\nThe food is mediocre and over-priced.  When two of us go for one game on a Sunday, drink 3-4 beers each and each order an entr\u00e9e, we generally end up with a tab in the $80-90 range, depending on what we're drinking that day.  In a city that is almost universally accommodating to vegetarians, this place is most decidedly not.  They have a veggie burger which is actually pretty good, but it's the only decent thing on the menu for a vegetarian to eat (there is also a grilled cheese sandwich and a veggie sandwich, both of which are bland to the point of tasteless.  It's like eating plain bread).  They have 4 entr\u00e9e salads, and every one of them has meat as a defining ingredient.  They don't even have beans so you could have decent veggie nachos.  I know, it's a sports bar, but I don't want to eat the same veggie burger every Sunday for 17 weeks.  It gets old.  Fast.\n\nUpshot?

Over the years I have enjoyed many wonderful meals here including a fantastic orrechete (sp?) pasta with chicken and cranberries in a lovely cream sauce, and some of the best pork  chops (double cut)  I have ever encountered (although I no longer eat mammals, so they are likely to be the best pork chops I will ever eat).  \n\nThis is not an inexpensive place, it can be quite pricey for dinner.  One plus is that they have a very reasonable brunch on Sundays.  Their arugula salad during brunch with small diced potatoes and pancetta is fantastic.  My one complaint about the salad is that it needs a bit of acid. I always ask for a small slice of orange and then squeeze the juice onto the salad.

Casbah has a semi outdoor seating area that is enclosed and heated even in winter.  My wife and I have often dined here with our kids.  This semi outdoor area is a bit more casual and absorbs the sounds of loud children fairly well.  You can bring kids without suffering the disdain of any but the most obnoxious of fellow diners.", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-01-22", "type": "review"}

I'd never been to Casbah before until this past Sunday when we decided to check it out for their prix-fixe menu.\n\nFor $22, you get your choice of alcoholic brunch beverage, an appetizer and an entree. An incredible price for a serious amount of great food. They had many options on their fixed menu - something for everyone. From huge waffles and omelets to lamb dishes, fish and the usual brunch regulars such as eggs benedict too. The appetizers list was equally as large. \n\nI started with a bloody mary. Was a nice middle ground between heavy and light - and it had some kick to it. Very good. For an appetizer I got the cheese and fruit plate with french baguette slices. There was a soft brie-like goat cheese, a blue cheese and a mild dry sheeps milk cheese as well. All were wonderful. For my entree I went with the Salmon Eggs Benedict. It was perfect. The fruit on the side was fresh cut, and the home fries were crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.\n\nI tasted a couple of other things as well. Both the polenta and the mushroom soup on the appetizer list were great. Didn't try any of the other entrees, but everyone seemed pleased. The only complaint was from a friend that ordered the truffle omelet - and it was that he thought they went too heavy on truffle oil, drowning out the eggs. \n\nAlso, service was absolutely perfect. We had a tall waiter, forget his name, but he was one of the most professional servers I've ever had. The table was cleared and cleaned immediately...he was never pushy, always friendly, and had great suggestions. One of the best experiences I've had for restaurant service anywhere.\n\nFor brunch in Pittsburgh, this is my favorite so far. Not to be missed!\n\nNow I just need to make plans to go back for dinner.", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-02-09", "type": "review"}

Also why so stingy with the baba ghanoush, 1 tsp, come on, eggplant is that expensive.\n\nRisotto - Over cooked not even a little bit of toothiness to the grain, plus it was pretty devoid of flavor but seemed to have had the addition of cream and butter to make it creamy.\n\nDuck Entr\u00e9e, again duck was perfectly cooked, quince jus was nice, not overly sweet but the faro did not compliment the dish at all. I even had a dining companion taste the combination and asked if they like it and they said it didn't go.\n\nPasta entr\u00e9e with spinach, this could have been good, but spinach was not washed and had grit in it, this item was returned and a braised lamb dish was ordered in its place, the lamb was slightly undercooked (read just a little tough) and jus that went with it was very watery.\n\nIf this was some little bistro where I was paying $20-25 for dinner (no drinks) I wouldn't be so picky but some of my meals have been north of $40 and for that amount of money I expect a little more attention to detail.", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-12-28", "type": "review"}

I think Eleven is my favorite, but Casbah is a very close second. \n\nMy most recent trip was with my wife on 1/15/10. We started with the grilled flat bread and the butternut squash ravioli. For entrees, I had the Casbah twice cut pork chop and my wife had a pasta dish with sausage and ricotta. For dessert, I had the creme brulee and my wife had the espresso ice cream / cookie (it was really just a fancy chipwich). \n\nThe grilled flat bread came with three different dips, Humus, Red Pepper Hummus, and Baba Ganoush. I really enjoyed all three, but thought the Red Pepper Hummus stood out as the best, although if you're not a fan of garlic you may disagree. The butternut squash ravioli didn't impress me much, but my wife really liked it. \n\nAs far as the entrees, we both really enjoyed our meals. My pork chop was cooked perfectly, and was anything but dry. The sage aioli that it was topped with added an excellent flavor. The sides were kale, and butternut squash risotto, both of which really shined. I can't describe how amazing the risotto was, and the kale was extremely flavorful. \n\nI tried my wife's pasta dish, and overall I thought it was good, but the sausage was really outstanding. Incredibly tender and flavorful. \n\nNeither of us were too impressed with our desserts. The creme brulee was very good, but at that point, I expected it to be great. My wife's dessert sort of disappointed, since the cookies were dry. \n\nThe bill for everything listed above, plus a bottle of red wine (~$35) was $120 before tip, so it is pricey, but in my opinion totally worth it. \n\nAlso, our server was very attentive and helpful, without being intrusive.

I had low expectations for dessert - it was a cornbread cake (weird!) but came with a blueberry compote and cream cheese ice cream.  The cornbread cake was an excellent balance between the sweetness of the ice cream and blue berries.  It was amazing!\n\nWhile I don't believe these are regular menu items, I highlight this because this was their charity dinner.  That they made NO money off of.

However, we decided to give it another chance, and I am glad that we did. \n\nEven though we had a reservation, we were seated (without them asking us our preference) in the front area, but that was fine, since the heaters kept it toasty warm. It was also a great table thanks to our terrific waitress. Wow, was she cheerful and friendly! She was also helpful with making recommendations - when I asked her about the cocktails, she pointed out the relatively new \"Beet and Potato,\" which had beet-infused vodka as one of the main ingredients. It was a cool cocktail - an interesting blend of savory and sweet, and very seasonally appropriate. I don't know if I would order it again, but I'm very glad I had it once.\n\nFor dinner, I ended up having a soup and then an appetizer, since I wasn't too hungry. The caramelized onion soup was so warming - it was like an update of the classic french onion soup. The broth was not too salty (a common problem with onion soups), and the onions had been braised perfectly. Everything was just the right texture as the onions, broth, and \"crouton\" blended together.\n\nI ordered the sheep's milk gnudi for my main course. Even though it came in an appetizer-sized portion, it was still a lot of food, since the gnudi are so filling. The gnudi were nicely molten in the middle, and just the right softness on the outside. There were a variety of accompaniments to the gnudi, but the standouts were the brussel sprouts. I'm actually not a huge fan of sprouts, but I ate every one in the dish. They were light and buttery, solid but not rock-hard, and had just a trace amount of bitterness left. That is how sprouts should taste!\n\nEven though I didn't plan on ordering dessert, I ended up getting the warm walnut baklava with cinnamon ice cream. The warmth of the baklava melted the ice cream nicely, and the flavors just blended together on the plate. The baklava was quite traditional in its assembly and spice blend, but the extra cinnamon with cream gave the whole dessert just a bit of extra oomph.\n\nIn summary, I'm glad that we gave Casbah another try. I wish that they would go back to offering all of their pastas in both entree and appetizer sizes, and I miss the crazy variety of wine flights that they used to have (it seems like they just have 4 now), but it's still a great dinner destination.", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-02-04", "type": "review"}

To make matters worse, when my partner tried to ask the bartender about the drink, if it was supposed to be sooo god-aweful lemony, she responded with a \"yes, it's got lemon in it.\" When he pressed the issue, she simply repeated, \"yes, it's a lemon and fig drink.\" More frustrating than conversations with the wall. The risotto that we ordered was the size one would expect of a side dish (which is what risotto should be, but this was proposed as an entree...). It had about 5 little pieces of maitake mushroom and 6 hazelnuts in it and was otherwise flavorless. We added lots of salt and pepper. Total waste of $25 bucks. \n\nAlso, their bar seating sucks. The chairs are stationary and far away from each other, and a bit far from the bar for a shorty like me; my feet don't reach the foot bar on the chair either, so my legs fall asleep trying to sit there.", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-12-18", "type": "review"}

My biggest gripe with Casbah is that it's Casbah Mediterranean when the menu (at least on this night, but I don't think it changes all that much) offers very authentic Mediterranean dishes.  One lamb dish (not overly Mediterranean) and no couscous or tagine, which are major staples of Mediterranean cuisine.  Even a side of hummus and pita or veggies would be nice.  Nonetheless, the menu has lots of fine options, just none that I've seen in a typical Mediterranean joint.  I think it's a little misleading especially if you're seeking Mediterranean cuisine.\n\nWe sampled several of the cocktails, all of which were creative and well priced.  As for food, we split the bruschetta (prosciutto and blue cheese), meatballs (pork) and the brussel sprouts were quite tasty, beet salad, and the potato gnocchi. So lots of food!  All was freshly prepared with quality ingredients and served with sophisticated presentation.\n\nLots of fine restaurants opening in the area, but it's clear to see that they have a loyal following.", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-12-27", "type": "review"}

Since the Big Burrito group is so popular, I was happy to get reservations, especially since a lot of times were already booked.\n\nThe hubby and I arrived a few minutes early for dinner. I had planned additional time to park and was delightfully reminded that Big Burrito restaurants have free valet parking -- so great, especially with slushy snow on the ground! Even though we were a few minutes early, the hostess took our coats and seated us immediately.  \n\nService was extremely attentive from start to finish. Waters were re-filled quickly. Bread was brought to the table almost immediately and we were offered another basket as soon as we finished the first. The bread came with a delicious spread - was it goat cheese? - that I just couldn't stop eating. Silverware whisked away with each course was promptly replaced.\n\nWe ordered both the land and sea courses to share so we could try the entire NYE prix fixe menu. None of the eight dishes disappointed! The first courses were Sea Scallops & Octopus and Duck Confit. The sea scallop was perfectly cooked, the octopus - thought not my cup of tea! - was also well cooked, and the balsamic flavor in the dish was very tasty. I absolutely loved the duck confit dish. It was served with mustard greens and fruit with a to-die-for dressing - a delicious combination!\n\nThe second courses were Potato Gnocchi and Mushroom Tortelloni. The gnocchi was served with lobster, which was a unique but nice paring. Though a strongly flavored dish, the tortelloni was delicious, and I enjoyed another unique paring, tortelloni with chunks of beef short rib.\n\nLake Ontario Walleye and Roasted Veal Strip Loin were the third courses. Both were cooked to perfection. The walleye's skin was perfectly crispy, and the veal strip loin was cooked medium well but was still deliciously juicy and tender. However, a component of each dish was disappointing -- a mustard flavor in the walleye and pickled mustard seeds covering the veal. I really can't hold this against Casbah though. I'm just not a fan of mustard!\n\nFinally, the desserts was fantastic! The Chocolate Ganache Tart was the ending of the sea courses. The chocolate was strong, even a little bitter, and was served with a little champagne strawberry compote. I grew more accustomed to the bitterness with each bite, and it was the perfect ending to three courses filled with fish. A Caramel Macaroon completed the land courses. The macaroon was delicious and served with a little apple sorbet and caramel sauce.\n\nOur experience at Casbah was spectacular! Based on this experience, I debated giving the restaurant five stars... but decided to wait until I returned a second time.

Dare I say this meal (with one small exception) rates in my top five of all time?  I dare.  The appetizer was very filling in itself and absolutely sublime for smoked salmon.  The salmon was accompanied by a done-just-right potato pancake that I could eat ten times over.

It only detracts from the otherwise wonderful meal.", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-12-08", "type": "review"}

I was torn between Casbah and Eleven, but upon perusing the menus, reading reviews, and giving the matter much thought, I settled on Casbah.  I knew I'd made a good decision when I invited some friends to join me, and they said that, based on their past experience, I'd made an excellent choice!\n\nOur meal started off with a few slices of bread, which came with butter and a Greek yogurt spread.  The butter was good, but the yogurt spread was amazing, and both of them dressed up the bread very well.  We then ordered an appetizer of the bruschetta, which was not your normal bruschetta, but was delicious.  I'm not entirely sure of the ingredients, since what we received doesn't match the menu description posted on the website, but one notable thing about it was that it had some pomegranate seeds that gave it a subtle sweetness and juiciness, complementing the other savory ingredients.  For my entree, I ordered the orecchiette, a dish consisting of ear-shaped pasta tossed in a goat cheese and sage cream sauce, with chicken and dried cranberries.  Flavorwise, this was one of the most well-balanced dishes I've ever eaten, with the savory ingredients and sweet hints from the cranberries (which were actual cranberries, rather than craisins, as I'd imagined) melding together in perfect culinary harmony.  The pasta was also cooked to a perfect al dente firmness, which held up well in the microwave several days later when I ate the leftovers.  The cranberry-lime dry soda that I ordered to go with this entree complemented it very nicely, and was a great alternative to wine (while I was tempted, I didn't order any since my dining companions decided not to, due to having driven).\n\nMy two dining companions ordered the Scottish salmon and the gnocchi, respectively.  Based on the samples that they provided me, Casbah did a great job on these dishes, as well!  The salmon had a subtle saltiness that complemented the flavor nicely, without overpowering it.  My friend who ordered it had had it before at Casbah, but had since been to Scotland, and he said that it was very similar in quality and taste to the versions of this dish that he'd tried there.  The gnocchi was one of the most unique and varied dishes I've encountered, and, based on the two bites that I tried, brought the ingredients together in a medley of flavors and textures.  I think my friend who ordered it described it best by saying that every bite was a bit different, but that they were all delicious!  Although all of us tried bites of each other's dishes, we each liked our own choice best, so we chose well.\n\nAfter our entrees, we decided to order dessert.  Although I was tempted by the dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding, since many reviewers speak highly of it, I decided to follow my instinct and get the chocolate-hazelnut bomba.  I'm so glad that I did, since this dessert was amazing!  If you like dark chocolatey, torte-like desserts or Nutella, this dessert is a must-try. Since I mentioned I was at Casbah for a birthday dinner, the dessert was served with \"Happy birthday\" written on the plate in chocolate icing, which was a nice touch.  My dining partners ordered the creme brulee to split between themselves, which came topped with an apple compote.  Based on the bite that I tried, it was a good rendition of a brulee, but couldn't match the star power of the chocolate bomba.\n\nWe visited at 7:30pm last Sun., at the later end of their serving hours, but service from our waiter, Brian, was very good.  We were seated in the tent-like area in the front of the restaurant, which stayed surprisingly warm during most of our visit.  At one point before dessert, upon returning from the restroom, I noticed that it'd cooled off, but the manager came out to turn on the heating elements, and it warmed back up in less than 10 min.\n\nIn sum, if you're looking for a solid fine dining experience with innovative, delicious food, Casbah is a great choice.  The food was impressive in its quality, and the service was what I've come to expect at a higher-end restaurant.  I'd particularly recommend getting on the Big Burrito mailing list to receive a $30 birthday voucher and $10 off coupons for the holidays, and taking advantage of one of these occasions to try it.  I'm certain that you'll be as pleased with your experience there as me and my dining partners!", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-12-18", "type": "review"}

Here are my thoughts from my three visits:\n\nFirst time was for dinner (June 2014) with my Big Burrito Birthday Coupon. We sat outside, where it was pleasant even though it was the middle of the summer. They were generous with the table bread and I really liked their goat cheese yogurt spread. I got the Orrechiette chicken pasta and BF got the filet mignon. The pasta was ok (see lunch review for update) and came in a large portion. The filet mignon was perfection. I made BF share with me :) The roasted potatoes with the green chutney were also heavenly. Definitely a lovely way to spend my birthday.\n\nSecond time was for a weekday lunch with a college friend visiting (Nov 2014). We had the 2 $10 off entree coupons and ordered off the Gusto menu (a fancy version of Panera's You Pick Two). I got the Orrechiette again and a Turkey Avacado Sandwhich. The pasta was delicious this time, so I'm thinking it was just one-uped by the Filet Mignon at dinner. Friend got the vege risotto which she liked. I like that Casbah is willing to customize plates at no extra charge or nuisance - they removed all bacon items from my entire meal and replaced them with other dressings, etc. I really appreciated that. Even without the coupon the Gusto lunch menu is a great deal!\n\nThird time I went for brunch with another girlfriend (Dec 2014)\n. I LOVE BRUNCH and Casbah took the cake. The table scones, pastries etc were delicious as was the accompanying cinnamon butter. Our waiter was very nice and helpful and was again quick to help customize my vegetarian friend's needs. I got the Mimosa which was delicious. Smoked salmon appetizer was as good as the other yelpers say and the portion was humongous. Finally, I got the scallop omelette and they had no issue giving me my favorite home fries as the side instead of the grits. Friend got the salad appetizer and the spinach eggs benedict. She loved the eggs not such a big fan of the arugula salad (which I have had and liked). We each had a $10 off brunch which made this a steal :) We were able to sit outside even in the winter which was nice.\n\nAll in all, I love Casbah. I'm a student so it's a little expensive for me. But I go every chance I get. Look out for Big Burrito coupons!", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-12-31", "type": "review"}

Here is a summary of our experience: \n\nPROS: \n- Ambiance is nice, upscale, not too loud. \n- We were able to find a low table in the bar within 15 minutes. \n- Drinks were good, generously proportioned. Cocktails were priced as expected for the type of place ($10-$14). Wine list had multiple options by the glass.\n- As for the meal, the meats were good cuts, well prepared. \n\nCONS: \n- Overall the food felt rich with creams, fats, salt without any particular inspiration showing through. The ingredients were all good and well sourced, but the finished products did not seem to elevate them in any particular way. \n- The service was high end of amateur - not what I was expecting from this caliber of restaurant. Our 30 minute wait stretched to 1hr 30min without any meaningful acknowledgement by the staff. Upon sitting we were told that they usually have \"excellent sourdough bread\", but they were out of it for tonight so we had ciabatta (which was fine, but we didnt need to hear what we didn't get to have). \n\nFOOD: (vegetarian options reviewed directly, meat options as reported by dining companions)\n- Cheese plate: Nicely prepared with a good range of cheeses. Only complaint was that the cheeses were served too cold to fully appreciate them. \n- Beet salad: the greens were good, the dressing was a bit too mild to offset the beets, the beets themselves were gritty and not particularly well cooked. \n- Squash soup: Overall very good - quite rich but flavorful. Felt like the salt and cream were taking over the squash \n- Mushroom pasta: Again quite rich and salty. Packed with high quality mushrooms but didn't feel that they were quite given justice due to the salt and butter. Pasta was high quality but again, overshadowed by the salt and butter. \n- Steak: Good cut of meat, cooked well.\n- Ragu pasta: Excellent pasta dish well cooked, reported to be almost as good as Piccolo Forno's. \n\nOVERALL: \nA similar experience at 2/3 the price would have received 3 stars, for the price of the meal this was barely a 2 star event. We won't be going back, even with the lure of 2 for 1 entrees around our birthdays - the food just isn't that good even discounting the service. I'm sure they will continue to do well with a certain crowd, but there are much better dinner options out there.", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-01-19", "type": "review"}

The food as always is exceptional.\n\nI have been going to Casbah for well over a decade and it is a place where my family has always celebrated special occasions because of the wonderful atmosphere, food and the great service - or what used to be great service. \n\nWe went to Casbah last night for dinner to celebrate a family birthday expecting to have a nice, memorable evening. Alas! that wasn't to be. Our server (Seth) and the service provided by him can be described in just one word - INDIFFERENCE. He went through the motions of taking our order and bringing us our food but that was it. We were never told of any specials. We were not brought any bread till we asked for it. We were not asked for re-fills on our drinks or even our water. We were not once asked how the food was and if we needed anything else. On ordering dessert, we were not asked if we needed coffee or drinks to go with and so on. In my book, indifference is worse than bad service.  \n\nI could have looked past it if it was just the server's style and lack of work ethic (every place has some of those people!) but what really highlighted this lackluster service was that the very same server was providing exceptional service to a neighboring table with a much larger party than ours. Perhaps because gratuity was automatically included? I don't know but suffice to say I was very disappointed and somewhat annoyed. \n\nCasbah is not your \"neighborhood\" place to drop in for dinner and the food and ambiance don't come cheap. So the least they can do is to make sure that service is consistent. It is relatively easy to attract new customers but really tough to sustain them.

(Both the families liked the food very much.)  Max's is the best German food in Pittsburgh -- actually, it's the best German food I've had outside of Germany, and I've definitely had worse meals in Germany as well.\n\nMax's is in a restored hotel, and the decor is very much in the Victorian style of the original hotel building.  The exception is the bar area that's good for happy hour or watching a game, or just having a beer -- that has a lot of neon and a jukebox.  But the bar area is also tasteful and pleasant to be in.  Max's has a full bar, but their real specialty is their excellent selection of German beers, both in bottles and on tap.\n\nI haven't met a wurst I didn't like, and they're pretty much all offered here.  The Braunschweiger sandwich is pretty delicious and unique in my experience, and the schnitzels are very delicious as well.  Another specialty is the kase spatzle (Spatzle noodles with smoked Gouda cheese -- a twist on mac and cheese that ensures that even a picky child will have something to enjoy here), but my two favorite menu picks here are the hassenpfeffer and the spinach salad with warm bacon dressing.  For sides, the red cabbage salad is my favorite, although the sauerkraut is also very good.  I don't care for the German potato salad, however -- I like the kind that has caraway seeds and vinegar, and is served cold, but Max's offers the kind that has an unidentifiable sauce and is served warm.  Some people like that style of potato salad though, and from what I can tell, Max's does a decent rendition of it.\n\nIf you're looking to reserve a room here for a banquet, you have a lot of options.  The basement \"Rathskellar\" is more bar-like in its atmosphere.  It would be a good place for some guys to have a birthday party or something.  For a rehearsal dinner or other formal event, one of the upstairs banquet rooms would be better.

Where most people associate Hofbrauhaus with the ultimate German beer-hall experience, I prefer Max's for the quieter, less raucous environs. (At least when it's not Oktoberfest)\n\nWe'd been there once before and immediately fell in love with the place. I (still) keep raving about the Sausage and Cheese platter. They've got some good Gouda. The Potato Pockets (pierogies) were OK -- I'd take some Pierogies Plus or Forgotten Taste over Max's, but that's just me.\n\nThe spaetzel was to die for, however. It's like a German Mac n' Cheese. And boy, do I love me some Mac n' Cheese. It literally melts in your mouth with its' ooey-gooey-ness.\n\nDrink-wise, I tried their German lager and Thom tried the sampler. Thom is a beer enthusiast. For around eight bucks, you get a GOOD amount of beers to try -- they are not some dinky little shot glass samples, either. Thom had some trouble near the end finishing it...it was so much beer. Bob had a Captain and ginger-ale...in a king-size goblet. Goblets are the ONLY way to serve adult bevvies.\n\nFor dinner, I had the pork loin over an apple-raisin gravy/bread concoction. The pork loin was flavorful and tender, and quite delicious. Sara had the sauerbraten and seemed to enjoy it. Bob's burger was ginormous and looked extra tasty.\n\nWe finished it off with the Apple Fritters. Now, these fritters aren't for the faint of heart. And they aren't your average dinky small sized portions, either. You get two huge deep fried apple fritters, covered in vanilla ice cream. One person CANNOT eat the whole serving. You must, I repeat MUST share them. If you attempt to eat the whole plate yourself, you will have flavor explosion, followed by severe heartburn. But damn, are they GOOD.\n\nOur visit ended up totaling 2 hours. One thing, though...please fix your outdoor sign. Usually it shines out like a red and blue beacon in the night for people to find their way there, but on Wednesday, it was out.

I decided on the Clark Bar.  \n\nI've only been to the Clark Bar once before for lunch about three years ago. I remember being impressed with the Boomer Burger and even tweeted the following about it: \"Just had a Boomer Burger at the Clark Bar for #lunch. Half pound of deliciousness discovered on the N. Shore of #pgh\" (the accompanying pic that I took that day is uploaded here). So I came back to drink a few beers and have some dinner with my lady before the show. \n\nSpeaking of beers, there's a limited selection of craft beers here.  As of this writing, on tap they've got Penn Marzen, Dogfish Head 60 min and Sam Adams Cold Snap.  In bottles there's Bells Two Hearted IPA and Sierra Nevada Pale Ale (they also listed Blue Moon and IC Light as craft beers but I'm sorry, I don't think so).\n\nI walked in the door at around 5:30 and I noticed that it wasn't too crowded; possibly due to the weather.  There were four guys at the bar and a couple of tables were occupied but nothing like I've experienced at the establishments on the other side of the parking lot.\n\nWhile waiting for my date to join me, I started with a Sam Adam's Cold Snap as a tribute to the day's February, single digit, temps before moving on to the Marzen. Both were decent beers, very drinkable, but nothing all that special.\n\nIt was pushing close to 7:00 when we decided to order dinner. By that time we were the only people left in the bar.  We asked the bartender about the crowd they get and if this is normal for a Friday night.  He said that lunchtime is normally their busiest time and he gets a few regulars that work in the building after 5:00 for a bite and a few drinks. Other than those times, it's before and after the ball games that draws the most business (as you would expect).\n\nThe menu is pretty simple offering a few appetizers, salads, burgers, sandwiches and the \"House Specialty\" Fish and Chips.  There were also specials listed on a chalk board at the entrance announcing drink specials, wings and a Cajun burger.  I decided I would go Cajun tonight. My girlfriend settled on a turkey burger. \n\nMy Cajun burger was spicy good delicious; perfectly grilled with a slice of pepper jack cheese and hot pepper rings balanced with a tomato slice and lettuce. I also got a sample slice of my lady's turkey burger (yeah, we do that) and it was juicy goodness as well topped with cheddar cheese, onion, lettuce and tomato. Her burger came with slaw and mine with fries.\n\nOverall this is a casual, easy bar.  They obviously recognize their Pittsburgh roots and being nestled between the two stadiums they cater to the Pittsburgh sports fan.  Photos of past local sports teams and legends adorn the walls in a relatively tasteful manner. But what's really cool is all of the autographed baseballs, bats and footballs in the hallway behind the bar.\n\nI'd recommend this place to any out-of-towner or anyone going to see a ball game or show on the North Shore. I give it a solid 4 stars for ambiance, service and delicious burgers. If the beer selection was better I would have up it to five stars.", "business_id": "k1A8pNspBPinGDivxkuDSA", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-02-15", "type": "review"}

It's right down the street from one of my old schools, so I have a lot of fond memories of eating here once a week or so with my mom during the school's lunch break. \n\nWith that in mind, because I often come here craving pizza and I was a child patron, I tend to just forget that, oh yeah: they have a full menu, and they serve alcohol as well. Not only do they serve alcohol, but my family has actually purchased six-packs from the bar since Bado's is easier to get to than a beer distributor. I think they have a decent but obviously not expansive beer selection if we're taking the time to buy and carry a six pack home.\n\nAs for the food? No complaints. The pizza is delicious, and Bado's also has a bunch of other meal options like sandwiches, soups and salads, so you're sure to find something here. All of my personal favorite dishes here are cheesy and come with standard but still tasty sauces that just complete the meal. One of my favorite things from Bado's is actually their calzones, which are enormous and yet, oddly enough, \"light.\" Not light in calories, but light in the amount of grease and oils in the meal. This, of course, is compared to take-out chains, so I'm sure it's still way too much and not that good for you. But still, I've always felt that their calzones have the perfect blend of toppings, sauces, and so forth, and they're borderline divine - the perfect local splurge.\n\nJust keep in mind, Bado's is popular and it gets crowded. Fast. Be prepared for a wait or try to show up during slow hours, i.e. not right after work - especially on a Friday. But really, other than that, I can't complain about this place.

I have updates on the gluten-free beer situation and the nacho situation.\n\nGF Beer: MUCH improved from what I remember. They had at least three varieties of the \"deglutenized\" beers - Estrella Damm Daura and both the Amber and Blonde Brunehaut (from Belgium!). They MAY have had Omission as well. \nThey also have at least three varieties of New Planet, and at least two of Greens. Dogfish Head T'weasonale. Possibly New Grist and Tread Lightly? I was in a haze of deliciously non-gluteny beer at this point. \n\nNachos: Maybe I'm recalling incorrectly, but I think when I've had these in the past they are made with real cheese - you know, shredded and melted. This time they were served with that nasty-ass liquid cheese goop, like you get at a ballpark. Blegh. \n\nStill four stars overall! Avoid the nachos though.\n\n---\n\nThe only food I've ever had here is nachos, so I can't speak to that. I WILL speak to the beer selection, though! I've managed to collect quite an assortment of beer snob friends, who love spending hours (literally) in the Cave o' Beer. I have to eat gluten free, so most ordinary beers are off-limits for me, BUT, they have an enormous selection of hard cider! Many many different kinds, including my favorite cider in the whole world, JK Scrumpy. Totally reasonable prices, too.\n\nNow the bad:\n1. They close at midnight! After the downstairs closes you can take your drink upstairs to a little bar, but it's super loud, has no seating, and you don't have access to the magical treasure trove of beer. Boooo.\n2. This is totally a niche thing, but I wish they had a better selection of gluten-free beers.

I can't be the only one. Seriously? Fine. Then excuuuUUUuuuse me. I'll rephrase for the supposed masses.\n\nIf you enjoy eating hot dogs, you'll want to make D's a destination when hanging in the 'burgh. It's a great place to go and get some tubed meat in a variety of different mix and match combinations and also a great place to meet new people... perhaps you'll even meet someone who shares your love of you eating hot dogs and you can shower them with many moments of which they can watch you eat your beloved wieners and y'all can live happily ever after. \n\nNo? Ugh, fine. Then just eat the damn hot dog all by your lonesome. See if I care.\n\nI came in with a group of friends for a semi-liquid lunch and though it was the beer cave that brought us in, I was secretly more excited about watching my friends eat hot dogs. You see, I'd been feeling super sick for the entire duration on my Pittsburgh road trip. I think it was a bad Cholera strain. Anyway, my party of six allowed me to sleep in extra late while they wandered around some graveyard by our hotel with scones until I was all puked out and ready see what the light of day looks like. I was feeling bummed that I had to hibernate through my original morning plan of going to the zoo, but the thought getting to see my pals suck down chili dogs all Jack & Diane style really helped lift my spirits.\n\nWe walked in, sat down and I was immediately excited to be sitting across from their epic celebrity mural. It's like a pop-culture/history 'Where's Waldo', only there's no Waldo, and instead Gandalf, Wolverine, John Candy, and more. I spent the entire time between ordering and the food coming out staring at the wall and finding new peeps. My only gripe on the artwork is that the mural was seriously lacking in Bill Murray biz-nasty, so for that I have to subtract a star. Okay, no. I'm only (half) joking about the star thing. I'm actually deducting the star because their veggie dog was pretty damn terrible. I mean, the toppings (I got the chihuahua with cheese and jalapenos) were fine, but I think I've microwaved dogs that tasted better than theirs. It was so freaking rubbery and tough and chewy... like bad calamari or trying to chew a whole pack of rock hard Bazooka Joe at once. My jaw was tired from trying to force my tearing teeth into that little soy sausage but the worst part is that I had to devote so much extra time to eating my stupid wiener that I missed being able to watch my friends eat their hot dogs. Boo-urns. Next time, I'll skip the veggie dog and go with a wrap or pizza or burger or something that'll allow for more wiener-peeping.\n\nOn the other hand, the veggie pub fries were damn good and something I resented having to offer to share them with my friends... but I did offer because I felt like it would detract from them getting 'weirded out' at my wanting to gawk at them like I bought a ticket to watch them eat hot dogs... even though that wishful thought didn't pan out anyway thanks to the lackluster veg-dog I ended up with. \n\nTheir beer selection was stellar and their beer cave in back was a fun shopping experience and great place to find a few rarities. They actually had the Rogue Voodoo Doughnut bombers that you can hardly ever find. Unfortunately, my sickness impaired me from imbibing and I actually spent the latter half of the time there barfing in the bathroom (not to the fault of D's) while my friends shopped for a bevy of beer in the cave. Also worth mentioning is how friendly everyone here was. Lots of helpful staff members and even the other ladies in the bathroom who were concerned with my hurling to the point where they wouldn't leave me alone and I had to lie and say that it was no big deal, I was in my first trimester and the morning sickness was getting the best of me.

The restaurant itself has a cozy feel to it, and their large beer cave is one of the few places where I can get some of my favorite import beer.  Note, the Czechs make more than just Pilsner Urquell. Je to pravda! Most of the staff are very friendly, and the managers are always quick to help if you need assistance.  \n\nSome of you may get angry with me, but I simply cannot review D's I without comparatively rating it against its sister restaurant, D's II in Monroeville.  And no, I couldn't possibly care less that the latter is in an old Pizza Hut.  That's right, I prefer D's II to D's I. Hear me out.  \n\nFirst of all, D's I' drafts are all about a dollar more expensive than those in the suburbs.  Why the upcharge? \n\nAlso, after being spoiled by the very large menu selection at D's II, I'm always a little disappointed when dining at Regent Square.  No wraps, no steak salad, no variety of sandwiches.  I will say that the food they do serve is good.  I enjoy their pizza and their daily hummus offering.  \n\nD's I has a much smaller draft selection and lacks a full bar.  Fine.  It's a smaller location and it stays true to its original \"beer bar\" theme.  Sometimes, however, I like to mix it up.  And I can do that more easily at the Monroeville location.  Obviously, I's beer cave trumps II's beer... um... outcove? \n\nSo all of that warrants a four-star rating.  Why the three? Like its suburban counterpart, I'm docking a star for closing so early.  Even when there is a crowd, the staff closes at 11:00 (Su-W) or 12:00 (Th-Sat) on the DOT.  That's just not responding to demand!\n\nOverall, I don't dislike D's I.  Quite the contrary.

The fries cost more to get as a side. Who ever heard of fries with your burger/dog? Um, apparently everyone except this place.\n- I got the chili cheese dog, the mac and cheese dog and the chili cheese fries.\n- The chili cheese fries are very very good and are some of the best I've had. If you like long fries with breading, you'll like these. The large size is indeed a large size and is enough for 2-3 people.\n- You get one hot dog, and with toppings on it, it will cost $6.50. I get two dogs with toppings at the local Sunoco for $2.22. I could also buy two packs of hot dogs and probably buns from a cheap place for $6.50, so it's not the cheapest.\n- The hot dog buns are good and have some green or black seeds on it. The hot dogs are just typical size and aren't super fat or foot longs.\n\nThe staff:\n- They are overworked but they are nice.\n- One of the girls was cooking and had no hair cover, so I could easily see hair going in food. Hope they fix that.\n\nSuggestions for D's:\n- Please sell curly fries or pretzels!\n- Stop being cheap. Give fries with your burger/dog and GIVE ME A SIDE WITH MY DOG.\n- Try to get a bigger place\n- Lower the prices for hot dogs or give two hot dogs. They have to be making near $6 profit on a $6.50 dog.\n\nWould I go back? Definitely.", "business_id": "2X5G4Ujq0s4Wfn4TC7gX0g", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-01-04", "type": "review"}

Especially the one that never stepped foot inside.  I mean how do you write a review of a place you NEVER experienced.  And all the complaining about the smoke...get used to it.  What did you do years ago when people were allowed to smoke wherever they went?  Yes, I know it's a nuisance.  Yes, I am a smoker myself, but I have enough common sense to be a polite smoker (this is my personal choice, and it is your personal choice not to smoke, as it is a business' choice to allow or not allow smoking in its establishment).\n\nAnyway, let's move forward.  I was skeptical of this place long before ever reading reviews, and long before I discovered Yelp.  The outside of the bar looks old, which may have been a factor in deterring me for so long.  It looks like it would be a one room tiny bar, but looks are deceiving, it is actually a big space.\n\nThe front is a typical barroom.  The bar takes up a good part of the room.  But there is a fair amount of space for people to walk about freely when going to the door.  Behind the bar is a small seating area where there are bar stools.  In the back of the place they appear to have just about everything you would expect a bar to have.  Pool table, multiple dart boards, and I even believe a shuffleboard table.  I cannot speak of how it is in the back as I only glanced on my way to the bathroom.  The bathroom I had used however, was rather small.  Just enough room for you to do your business and turn around to wash your hands.\n\nThe staff here on the particular night I attended were polite, funny and nice to chat with.  They were knowledgeable about the brews on tap and every beer they had in stock.  The drinks, by the way, were truly amazing.  Just the right mixture of everything when they made up your drink of choice.  And just to make sure you were enjoying the drink, the bartender came back around and asked if it was to your liking.  The bartender even made sure it wasn't too strong and offered to add to the drink to balance it better.\n\nAs for the limited food they had to offer, I cannot really talk about.  The food I did see that patrons ordered looked palatable, so on my next visit I might give it a try.  I have to say, that any place that offers popcorn for $.25 is alright by me (better than having it sitting on the bar and you have no idea who has put their hands in there).", "business_id": "7lDNKKxMV84KIS1OVZOepw", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-12-09", "type": "review"}

My great grandmother's sauce was the first I remember, she never opened a can to make her sauces, always using tomatoes she canned herself in mason jars. She simmered her sauces until every seed melted away. My mother's sauce was a bit more thicker, using puree and paste as a base, later adding whole peeled tomatoes, garlic and fresh basil. Her sauce cooks down to a velvety pasta sauce that should be jarred and sold on super market shelves.\n\nSorry on to my review of Olive Garden. seriously? Really? No! I will admit it's good in a fit of really, REALLY needing a pasta fix, or if you want to eat breadstick and salad. But the sauces are overly rich, and I don't mean the tomato sauces. I mean the sauces they put over the pasta with chicken, beef or fish. And, let me be real Italian here, pasta is NEVER the main meal in an Italian supper, Pasta is normally the first course and NEVER served with meat, including MEATBALLS. Thats as American as fortune cookies. after pasta, comes the protein, that includes meatballs, then finally salad.\n\nOkay, I'm done being a snooty Italian who looks down upon Olive Garden, I got out all my frustrations on you, my readers. But seriously, if you want good Italian food, hit up a REALLY good neighborhood, family owned Italian restaurant. The service is better, it will be cheaper and it won't go to a big conglomerate who over charges on a plate of pasta, which is one of the cheapest food you can serve.

A friend was at a wedding upstairs and asked us to drop in to say hi. Apparently they host wedding receptions in the lounge area above the bar/restaurant.\n I was hoping to get a quick meal and a drink before the show. When we arrived the bar was packed and we were told that they had no availability to sit in the restaurant section. But, little can deter me. I scoped out the tables by the bar and noticed a couple getting ready to pay. After making casual chit chat, they agreed to save their table for us. They paid and left while we ordered a drink at the bar. As soon as they got up the waitress put a reserved sign on the table, I assumed it was for us and sat down. Nope. She was trying to reserve it for an 8pm reservation. I thought this was the bar area which is seat yourself? Oh well, I told her we had to be out by 8 for a show anyway so it would work out fine. A few minutes later she came back and told us no, that won't work and we will have to find a place at the bar. Seriously? We are already sitting in the seat yourself tables, it was fine 2 minutes ago, we have to leave by 8, what's the issue? Rather annoyed we looked for seats and ways to inch ourselves into the already overly crowded bar when the waitress returned and said she will reserve another table that was leaving. Now, we have wasted 10 minutes of our already limited time before the show so, I asked what was the fastest thing on the menu. We ordered soup, salad and the buffalo chicken spread. The soup arrived first. I had the homemade chicken noodle. Warm, comfort food that hit the spot. Next was the pear salad with candied walnuts, blue cheese and strawberry vinagerette.  Again, super tasty. I could snack on the candied walnuts all day. Then the buffalo chicken spread. Presentation was great-in a martini glass. The pita chips were delic! But where was the chicken?

I went here with a group of friends for a birthday, The fiance and I had dinner downstairs first and then went upstairs to the lounge.  If you are with a group, it's a pretty fun and chill place and they were playing good danceable music, which my friends and I liked.  It didn't seem that packed for a saturday, so it was easy to get a drink.  I think there's also servers walking around the lounge to take orders, so another plus.\n\nThe dining area was pretty small, but we made a reservation just about 2 hours prior to arriving, and we didn't have to wait. My fiance and I shared the calamari, which was really delicious!  Usually, the calamari we get is seasoned with just salt & pepper with maybe some breading at times and chilli and scallions, but this one was a different taste and it was tasty!  It seemed a little asian inspired kind of like sweet with some crumble and salty with soy.  I had the seared ahi tuna salad.  I liked the taste, but it isn't the best ahi to me.  Fish didn't taste that fresh to me.  My fiance had the braised short rib with the mashed potatoes and he said it was only 3 stars for him. He got his friend a turkey wrap and he said it was average. \n\nThe real highlight for us were the martinis!  I am not one for martinis but after tasting sweet/bakery inspired martinis, I am feening for it. LOL.  I had the cake batter martini and the chocolate covered pretzel.  Sooo good! They got really creative here with the martinis and the presentation.

When Carrie suggested that we grab some drinks, I suggested that we go to Olive or Twist because I'd been wanting to check it out for awhile. I rarely receive the opportunity to go out for drinks after shows because some of my friends who I attend shows with tire out early (lame) or don't really go to bars ever (even lamer), so I was excited to finally have the opportunity to imbibe a few in a classy setting downtown.\n\nGiven that it was my birthday, I knew exactly what I wanted drink-wise, thanks to Rachel C.'s review: the cake batter martini!  Thanks to other reviews, I was aware that O or T's specialty martinis are dessert-y drinks rather than your typical martini.  This was absolutely fine by me, since I enjoy sweeter digestifs later at night.  As can be seen from my photo, this martini comes with a rim of chocolate syrup spangled with multicolored decorative sprinkles, which made for a very festive--and delicious--birthday drink.  Once I finished it, I went for a second round and chose the mint chocolate martini, which also came adorned with chocolate syrup.  It tasted exactly like melted mint ice cream--my favorite kind.  Yum!\n\nWe sat at the upstairs side bar, and service from the bartenders was generally good--one of them even wished me happy birthday when I mentioned why I was ordering the cake batter martini.  While it was busy, it wasn't so crowded as to feel claustrophobic.  The noise level was a bit on the loud side--but then again, what bar isn't?\n\nI really enjoyed my visit to O or T, and look forward to returning again, once I can convince my friends to stop by for a drink.  I'd love to check out the happy hour, in particular.

We came over this past summer for food and cocktails, but this last visit was just for the booze to have a celebratory drink with Laura M on her Birthday after seeing a great Ballet at the Benedum.  \nI don't mind O&T layout.  It's a bit chopped up but very Pittsburghese reminiscent of most establishments.  There is the upstairs where you can sit by the roaring fire on the 72\" flat screen or lounge on many of the couches or loveseats they have available.  There is also the downstairs that seems to have similar offerings, however at least in our experiences was a lot busier than upstairs.  I pick less busy almost every time. This time around we found three bar seats available upstairs and settled down for a couple drinks.  \nI started with a Southern Tier XXX IPA, solid start to the evening.  I know they specialize in Martinis but I specialize in craft beer.  After that I decided to try a martini, I went with an Espresso Manhattan Martini.  This was defreakinlishious... I love coffee and I love manhattans so the two went together like peas and carrots.  Our service was mixed.  Some bartenders seemed more helpful and interested in waiting on us than others.  This was also my experience from last time.  This time we didn't order food though we were pretty hungry and went elsewhere to eat.  Our last meal here was not worth duplicating.  We both had an Olive or Twist Burger, and I chose sweet potato fries and requested a med rare cook.  We used the Yelp deal so it wasn't as expensive as it could have been, but the burger sells for $13.00.  I rarely complain about cost especially if it is good, however it really was not.  The meat was way overcooked and dry.  Surprisingly the fries were the best thing on the plate.  To spend that on a burger I do expect a better quality.

I've been to this place once before for dinner and a couple of other times just for drinks. I've never really been blown away by my experiences there but I've never had any reason to complain either.  I got there at 6:00 and the place was pretty packed with the happy hour crew and theater goers but I got lucky and nabbed the last two stools at the end of the bar. I was greeted cheerfully and almost immediately by the bartender who showed me the beer list. I choose to stay local ordering an East End Fat Gary and looked over the menu as I waited for my date to arrive.\n\nAlthough it was a little loud, the atmosphere was very comfortable and my lady and I contributed to the noise as we discussed how our day went before ordering off of the menu. I was torn between the Crispy Braised Pork Belly Sandwich and the Pan-Seared Atlantic Char. But my decision got easier when my date choose the char... we have this rule that we will never get the same thing so that we can share each other's entr\u00e9e.\n\nOur orders came about 15 minutes later. The pork belly was amazing! Cheddar, bacon, lettuce, tomato and a creamy sauce topped the pork belly in between a really fresh Ciabatta bun. Mmmm, delicious! It also came with a side and being as cold as it has been, the tomato basil soup was nice compliment to the sandwich. Off course I got to taste the Atlantic Char that my girlfriend ordered. It looked and tasted a little like a good cut of salmon only a little thicker and saltier. It was good, but I really think that my sandwich was the tastier of the two meals.\n\nOlive or Twist? I'd say it's a good pre-theater option and I'd recommend it. The service was good, the bartender was attentive, the food was excellent and the price was competitive for the area. My only knock, and it's really not much of a knock, is that I think the serving portions are a little less than what we here in America have grown accustomed to.

Amazing what a bright color of paint on the wall and some new flooring can do for the way a place feels inside.  Also, big props for finally getting rid of the blinds on the only windows you have in the place (I have a feeling you used them to hide your embarrassment).  New floors and paint are not the only thing that was done for this remodel.  Remember those scary bathrooms?  Yeah, no more.  They have nice, CLEAN bathrooms now.  The one thing that baffles me is the sink outside the bathrooms.  One sink.  Between the men's and women's bathroom.  Air dryer, no towels...weird, but it works.\n\nAnother great thing was that they moved the pool table to the back.  To me, it felt like they were deterring you from entering on some nights.  I mean what would you think if you walked into a dim lit bar and saw some guys standing there with pool cues?  With the moving of the pool table, it really does open it up at the front, more inviting if you will.\n\nStaff are still as nice as can be.

I was tempted to get the meatloaf but instead opted for the special of the day, country fried chicken with mash potatoes and gravy. \n\nMy order came about five or ten minutes after I placed it.  The chicken was perfectly done, crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. My broccoli was cooked perfectly as well.  Unfortunately the mash potatoes were just average and lacking anything really worth mentioning. But for a nice comfort meal for under $10 on a cold February day I was satisfied. \n\nOverall, I can't say that I would enthusiastically recommend Mahoney's given all the other options available in town, but I wouldn't discourage anyone from dining here either.  In my opinion it's better than average but not really all that much better.  I'd like to come back sometime and try the meatloaf and maybe one of those huge salads.", "business_id": "-nfzEVOVvmDSFbxvBsllGQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-02-09", "type": "review"}

Daunted by the wait, and bellies hungry for delicious comfort food, my boyfriend I were sullenly driving back toward home when we remembered - isn't there a little Irish bar just off the main drag of the Strip District?  Let's go investigate.\n\nSo investigate we did, I'd say around 730 on a Saturday night.  It was oddly quiet and uncrowded inside - a few tables here and there, but no big groups gathered around to watch a game over drinks, or eat dinner.  There was lots of Irish paraphernalia on the walls, but the harsh lighting and widely spaced tables made the bar feel a bit uninviting.  A little dimness could've gone a long way!  We got some beer on draft - a Harp for me - and started with the fried pickles, which were served with honey mustard.  They were.....fried pickles.  They were served as whole spears, not bite-size pieces, so sometimes the breading would slide off, but they were hot and tasty with the tangy mustard.  Good size appetizer portion.\n\nBoth craving something authentic, my boyfriend got the fish 'n' chips, and I got the corned beef and cabbage.  Both were utterly no frills.  My boyfriend lauded their authenticity, and I have to confess, the fish 'n' chips were spot on.  Especially the fish.  That taste!  It took me back to my semester studying abroad in England, eating fish 'n' chips out of a paper cone.  It didn't need anything fancy or unique to dress it up - it was great as it was.  He was hugely satisfied.\n\nI was underwhelmed with my corned beef and cabbage.  While I won't question the authenticity, the overall effect was that the food was plain.  Well-cooked, and in a good portion, but not really crave-worthy.  There were some vegetables on the side as well, everything prepared with utter simplicity.  I enjoyed the taste, but after a few bites, I wanted something more.  It was a large portion, so I took some home, but we weren't even motivated to reheat it.  It didn't really do it for me.   Apologies to Ireland if that's how this dish was meant to be prepared - if that's the case, I suppose it just wasn't my thing.\n\nWe started to leave just as a few musicians came in.  I think I'd enjoy coming back here for a drink and an appetizer during some live Irish music!  Service was a bit slow, but if I was there to relax and unwind for a few hours, I wouldn't mind at all.", "business_id": "6xEl2PDJulIp1PfWqa7-aA", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-01-18", "type": "review"}

Once was quite a few years ago and the second time was this past weekend. The first time I went, I got fish & chips, and I was so unimpressed that it's the primary reason that I refused to eat there since. BUT this past weekend, my wife ordered the fish & chips and wow...awesome! I would definitely order them going forward. It's a huge piece of fish, though, so be prepared. I'm not sure what changed, but I'm glad it's improved.\n\nI opted for the blackened tilapia sandwich, which was also really good...and larger than I expected. My only complaint was that it seemed like a lot of roll even for the entire filet being on there. The creole mustard/mayo was good, but I used it sparingly. The side of chips (fries) were good and had that typical hand-cut taste.\n\nWe also ordered the mussels for our appetizer and they were really good. The Smithwick's broth was a different take on what we'd usually get our mussels steamed in and was delicious, and the mussels tasted fresh.\n\nOverall, the vibe at the Harp is fun. Their large dining area has a dining hall feeling, which doesn't work for me when it's not busy and you sit down to eat, but it's good for their live music nights (which they have plenty of). I prefer sitting in the smaller bar area. The bartenders are always really nice and there's a nice neighborhood bar feeling when you're up there.\n\nI'd say my only real semi-complaint is their limited whiskey options. If you're there for a Guinness, you're going to be happy, but if you want some whiskey, the limited list of Irish whiskeys may be underwhelming. We were told that they're working on making an actual list and adding to it, and there were some perfectly fine options, but you'll be disappointed if you want something even a little adventurous, like a Connemara or something.\n\nRegardless, it's a nice, laid back option in the Strip, and if you're in the mood for some fish & chips you're really limited to two excellent options in town: Piper's Pub or the Harp & Fiddle.", "business_id": "6xEl2PDJulIp1PfWqa7-aA", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-01-29", "type": "review"}

I've found that Pittsburgh locals are super fun! I absolutely loved how everyone cheered the singers on during karaoke and sang along making it extremely comfortable to get up front and center! \n- Healthy food choices! Instead of having to worry about adding a ridiculous amount of calories (in addition to the crazy amount I had already consumed for the day)...it was nice to snack on some hummus, fresh tomatoes, feta cheese, and pita bread. \n- Very friendly DJ!\n- Bartenders were simply wonderful and always made sure you were taken care even with the enormous bar crowd.\n- Prices were very reasonable. I think I had six or seven captain and cokes (blush) and the platter for only $20?!\n\nDislikes: \n- POLLUTED AIR. I now have to take my jacket to the dry cleaner, thank you. \n- Location. There were no available taxis at any given time. We contacted two different taxi services and they never showed. We finally had a taxi pick us up after calling the hotel valet and asking them to send for us (I was a little desperate).\n- This place is very, very, very small.

It's really easy to brush it off if you're walking by; from the outside it looks like a pretty standard bar. And when you walk in, it smells like a pretty typical bar - meaning that if this place ever closed, the next owner would have to rebuild the entire place to get the cigarette stench out. So yeah, I admit that my first impression was not a good one, and I actually thought to myself that if any more people showed up and started smoking I'd have to ask my friend to pick somewhere else for us to eat and talk.\n\nFortunately, between it being a Thursday, the snow and the bitter cold temperatures, very few people showed up and the majority of the smokers stuck to the main bar area. So I picked a booth in the far corner of the seating room and met up with my friend; while I waited for them I took a peak at the menu - nothing super spectacular, but the prices were pretty cheap overall. So hey, at we know this bar has cheap sandwiches and cheap burgers.\n\nOnce my friend arrived we both ordered some drinks, because of course you drink when you're in a place like Nico's. The beer and cider we ordered came in a glass and the original bottle respectively, and our water came out in plastic cups (something I'm admittedly not a big fan of - it's such a wasteful practice). We then split the fried zucchini and the recovery room pizza. The fried zucchini basket had four or five enormous stripes of zucchini and came with marinara sauce - it was quite tasty, although the sauce was pretty cold. Maybe it's just me, but I'd rather have warm marinara sauce than cold. The pizza, on the other hand, was absolutely delicious. The recovery room special is a specialty; it has gyro meat, feta cheese on top on regular cheese, mushrooms and green peppers. This was VERY good, and I'm sure the fact that they make the pizzas to-order was part of why I found it to be so yummy. And by the way, my friend and I both took some pizza home with us - it was an enormous meal and more than either of us needed. So don't let the prices on the pizza frighten you, they're worth it.\n\nThe good news is that overall my experience definitely got better as the night went on. The bad news is that I honestly don't think I'll go back to Nico's, at least not for quite a while. As delicious as the pizza was, nothing can make up for the fact that this place is a smoker's haven. With lungs as sensitive as mine, this is a dealbreaker, and I'm pretty sure it was only by pure chance that I came in on a night where no one was smoking near me; if the place had been any busier I'd've had to leave just so I could breathe normally, I'm sure. I'll still give the place an \"a-ok\" rating since the food was delicious, the prices were good, and our waiter (who I think was bar-tending as well) was very nice and very attentive overall. But with such a strong smoke smell an \"a-ok\" is all I can honestly give.", "business_id": "tQpYnf3P3Q_OQLYYJvlV-A", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-01-09", "type": "review"}

Can we all please finally shake off the illusion that Bloomfield has amazing Italian restaurants?  Granted, I haven't been to *all* of them, but I've been to most of them and for the mediocre Pleasure Bar to be the best of them is just sad.  \n\nThe real problem here:  This is food for fat people.  Lots of fried stuff.  Lots of oil.  Yeah, those potato balls were delicious, but dear god were they heavy.  I guess I should have expected fried balls of mashed potatoes to be heavy, but of course there wasn't just potato in there.  There was cheese and I think I even detected some mayonnaise.  This is definitely a \"sometimes food.\"  A delicious, heavy sometimes food.\n\nNow, full disclosure:  I'm a vegetarian and restaurants are always a completely different experience for vegetarians.  So if you're not veg, you may want to take all of this with a grain of salt.  They may do meat dishes spectacularly.  But vegetarians, take note.\n\nItalian restaurants aren't really known for making decent veg food and this place is no different.  I had the portabello mushroom sandwich.  First off, the sandwich would have been better had the bread been toasted.  However, it was very soft and airy - not something I'd expect from ciabatta.  The mushrooms tasted like they had been marinated in Kraft Zesty Italian, cooked in more Kraft Zesty Italian and then topped with Kraft Zesty Italian.  This was by far the oiliest sandwich I've ever had.  To make it worse, there was too much cheese - two thick slices of provolone.  Am I the only who has noticed that too much cheese on things is a real problem in Pittsburgh?  \n\nOn the positive side, the bartender was very attentive and very polite.  Also, the beer selection was good.  I'd definitely drink here, but eating here, eh, not so much for me.", "business_id": "-Nanlb7SYXObqQ6dZ49UOg", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-12-26", "type": "review"}

It's a small neighborhood restaurant, the main dining room is small and it looks like you're in the banquet room of a Holiday Inn in 1985--but somehow the atmosphere is warm and friendly instead of dated and depressing.\n\nI have never called ahead for reservations and i have never had to wait for a table and I believe this is only bc I've got lucky every time I dine there.  The restaurant is ALWAYS busy and for good reason--the food is great!\n\nIs this authentic Italian food?  I have no idea.  I have an Oma and a Nain (german and welsh grandmothers, respectively).  Many dishes were served at our house growing up, nary a Pasta Pomodoro among them.  So while I do not know if this is authentic Italian food, I can tell you this food is the real deal.  It's really, really good.\n\nHeres what we had to eat last night:\n\nthe tomato and mozzarella salad.  Its a real pet peeve of mine when restaurants don't use very ripe roma tomatoes for these kinds of salads.  The tomato NEEDS to be very ripe and acidic and I was initially disappointed when I saw just regular beef steak tomato's in the dish.  These were no ordinary tomatoes!  They were marinated and amazing.  The mozzarella came out in large slices, and the waitress had recommended I dress it with balsamic vinegar which I did and it was excellent.\n\nMy friend ordered the Italian wedding soup and I found it a little bland but he loved the soup.  It was the perfect ratio of pasta to broth and it was not heavy on the salt which is a good sign--you know the kitchen staff TASTES the food before serving it!  (not your food, they taste the food as it is prepared.  you know what I mean)\n\nI ordered the Salmon del Mare as my main course, it was the special of the night and it was very good.  Broiled salmon topped with tomatoes, spinach, mozzarella cheese, and shrimp scampi. I asked for my shrimp on the side and I am very glad I did because I think they might have overwhelmed the salmon.  I thought they'd just put the shrimp on the side but instead they brought out a delicious shrimp scampi which was good and savory and garlicky...  mmmmmmmmmm i just had a moment.\n\nthe salmon was cooked just right--where it flakes but it's still moist and it was seasoned perfectly.  All of the ingredients were cooked so well I ended up deconstructing my dinner, and I had the salmon without any of the toppings, and then ate the spinach and tomatoes as if they were their own side.  A side of broccoli came with the entree and it was good but kind of unremarkable.  I mean, it's steamed broccoli.  It really didn't have a chance, considering it was brought out with the shrimp scampi.\n\nMy friend ordered the Pasta Christopher which had red peppers, chicken, and sausage mixed in with penne.  Full disclosure:  I'm freaking hate Italian sausage.  I'm german (American by way of Stuttgart, my German claims are legitimate!  Stimmt!) and I HATE spicy sausages.  I like sausage bland, covered in Senf (mustard), and made of ingredients you don't want to know about.\n\nMy friend found the Pasta Christopher delicious.  You're not going to leave the Pleasure Bar hungry, where he usually cleans his plate he asked for a to go box. \n\nWe were too full to have dessert.\n\nOur check came to $50, but $14 of that was beer, we each had a beer with dinner.\n\nthis restaurant is reasonable, and delicious.  If you bring a date here, they wont be impressed but they will be relaxed, have a great dinner, and you're not going to go broke.\n\nI highly recommend this place and I wish more people knew about it.  it is one of my favorite dining options in Bloomfield.\n\n\nGlossary:\n\nOma:  German for grandmother\nNain:  Welsh for grandmother\nStimmt:  True.

We sat at the bar and so it took a while for the bartender (one of two) to take our orders.  It then took approx. 40 minutes for our food to arrive.  I ordered a wrap and my friend ordered a sandwich.  My order was fine, my friend's was nothing close to what she had ordered.  She then had to wait another 20 minutes for the correct sandwich to be delivered.  Of course, we understand that mistakes happen.  However, what was truly frustrating was the fact no one else in the entire bar appeared to be eating (just drinking) with the exception of one table that had ordered one plate of wings.  So, was the kitchen so backed up that it should have taken so long for our food to arrive?  Where they so crazy busy back there that they got confused and prepared the wrong sandwich?

Even for bar food, Lot 17 struggles to put out a decent product. The zucchini strips were way too greasy. Yes, I've never met a non-greasy fried zucchini strip, but these are saturated and almost taste like they came out of a bag pre-breaded. Definitely lacking that hand-breaded aspect. The chicken nachos were made with seemingly-stale tortilla chips and were so bland that I actually left more than half of the plate uneaten. That's a rarity for me, a self-proclaimed nacho addict. I've also tried the cheese wedges and the chicken tenders. The cheese wedges are another product that seems so simple to pull off, yet they come out cold and greasy. The only app that we enjoy at al is the chicken tenders, but while they're decent, the rest of the food that we've tried was so blah that I haven't been able to bring myself to ordering an actual meal or sandwich from the menu. Hence, why you see only a review of apps.\n\nFortunately, just when all hope seems lost, they flip on my game and their solid beer list swoops in to save the day.\n\nService can be spotty, but it's been decent at the bar every time that we've gone. At some point I'll have to try a sandwich or meal, but it's really hard to fake an appetite after knowing what kind of product they're willing to serve for appetizers.

The jalepenos add a nice kick and the chips didn't become overly soggy from the meat, which was very tender. Sour cream and salsa are served on top and an order is huge-easily feeds 4 people. \nThey have a couple of new sandwiches as well, a roasted Italian vegetable sandwich (I did not try this so can't really speak on the quality) and a smothered pot roast sandwich described as pulled short ribs with a marsala mushroom and\nonion sauce topped with swiss cheese on a rustic roll. This was so juicy and flavorful and plenty to eat the next day too. There's also a new southwest turkey wrap (lettuce,tomato, corn salsa, fresh turkey, bacon and chipoltle ranch). The chipotle ranch added just the right amount of kick and I loved that the turkey they used was of the carvery style. I took half of this home and it was good reheated the next day. They also have a new short rib mac and cheese entree and a pretzel crusted salmon dish, one of which I will be getting on my next visit. Service was excellent as usual-Adrienne, whom I'd never had as a server there before, was quick to continuously serve with a smile.

They include two drinks and a fresh fruit plate - one of the drinks can be a bloody mary (which we got and regretted, it was very unpalatable) or a frozen mimosa (get that instead). \n\nWhat I really love, aside from the fantastic food, is the creative cocktails. These drinks are going to be on the $8.50 side, some are worth it and some aren't, but The $3 Frozen Cosmo happy hour is the best deal on Ellsworth. Even if you're a manly man, this very pink booze slushie is amazing. Go with a big group and ask for the lounge upstairs or a window booth. Service is usually either chipper and delightful or just barely okay. We don't come here for the service or the dim lights - we go for a good meal and you should too.", "business_id": "rgmptwPbBH1wLpiBHcbIhA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-01-12", "type": "review"}

I was hoping that the unseasonably warm weather would make for good outdoor dining on their awesome patio (I'm pretty sure they were voted near the top for outdoor dining in one of the local Pittsburgh magazines) however, the rest of my party nixed that idea.\n\nMy usual order includes the mini pulled-pork sandwiches (swine & dandies), the mini crab cake sandwiches (crabby-patties), a side of the macaroni and cheese (I defy you to find better mac & cheese in Pittsburgh) and the buffalo wing dip.  I would highly recommend any of these dishes.\n\nThis trip, I tried the pierogies for the first time.  They were decent, although they seemed a little overcooked on the outside (too much time in the frying pan).  I also had the full sized pulled pork sandwich and a side of the aforementioned mac & cheese.  As usual, these were great.  \n\nI definitely recommend giving this place a try.

We were starving so we were a bit disappointed that it was a 30-45 minute wait but it was a friday night.  We perused the drink list (it is a bit confusing because it looks like a facebook page) but settled on a MOFOjito and a margarita.  The MOFOjito (mojito with pomegranate) and the marg were served in pint glasses which was a surprise but so was the $20 tab for both of them.

It was topped with sour cream and served with a pita chip...delish.  I also ordered a spinach salad which the server explained to me is now different from what's on the menu.  Something about no strawberries, crumbled blue cheese, spiced pecans... It was definitely a change for the WORSE. The salad came out looking rather lonely with sliced almonds, 4 orange slices and chunks of mozzarella cheese.  It was sooooo bland. The dressing was just straight up balsamic vinegar.  Not only was it bland but it was tiny (almost looked like a side salad for $9.50). My date got the 'Salad a la pittsburgh' he wasn't thrilled by it either. His was much bigger than my salad and came with chicken (i think it was $1.00 more). \n\nWe didn't get alcoholic drinks with dinner and our bill was $29.00 which isn't that much more than our bar tab for 2 drinks. \n\nPros: Lively, fireplace when you walk in the door, a bunch of vegetarian options, big drink list, \n\nCons: Pricey drinks, very dark inside, sub-par salads, \"funny\" menu ( you have to read the whole description to figure out each item, I understand how lazy that sounds but witty names are only good once in a while)\n\nOverall: Might go go back and not get a salad.

The food here is just all kinds of disappointing. First of all, their labyrinth of a menu. I understand that they are trying to be cute and witty by concealing the item descriptions within paragraph-long stories and forcing you to read them due to the completely nonsensical names they give to said items. I truly understand the concept behind this. But can I be the first to say...IT'S NOT CUTE! For the drink menu, fine. I'll admit to having a few laughs at their PG-13 drink encyclopedia. I'm not that cold-hearted. But when I'm hungry, the last thing I want to do is spend 20 minutes trying to decipher what my options are.\n\nClearly I have a vendetta against their obnoxious menu, but the real problem here is that the food is the definition of mediocre. I go here fairly often, so I've done a lot of hopping around their menu trying to build my go-to order. I still haven't figured it out, and it's at the point where if my friends want to grab food here, I'll make a point out of eating beforehand. Plus, oh WOW is this place overpriced! This was especially highlighted to me on a Sunday morning when our bill came to $42 for brunch. Not expensive, but the wheels started turning in my head...we just paid $42 for an appetizer, two entrees, and two bloodys, all of which were eh, passable. For exactly $6 more, we could have went down the street to Casbah and had TWO appetizers, two entrees, and two much stronger bloodys, all of much higher quality.\n\nThe reason I still come here though is the drinks. My favorite is the Happy Ending which involves pineapple juice, ginger, and cucumber. You really can't go wrong with anything though except for the Statutory Grape--if the name doesn't dissuade you enough, just heed my advice and don't order it.

I don't enjoy doing it.  I love our city and I think our diverse restaurant choices make us a great place to live and visit. But when I hear great things about a place only to be consistently let down, I have no choice.  That being said, I'm going to have to rip Harris Grill a new one. \n\nI waited a long time before reviewing Harris Grill.  I've been there loads of times; happy hours, bacon night, brunch, crowded Friday nights, and not-so-crowded Monday nights.  Almost every time I have been let down. \n\nI'll break it down. \n\nDRINKS: The drink menu and draft lift offer a solid list of (overpriced) choices.  That's fine.  What isn't so fine is that the bartending is inconsistent and I have too often received ill-concocted highballs and sangria that tastes like Franzia.  Perhaps I'm just unlucky, but almost every time I'm there at least one or two beer taps \"aren't working.\" \n\nAPPETIZERS: Nothing really wrong here.  Good spinach and buffalo chicken dips, the \"Britney Spears\" (chicken strips), and hummus are all very tasty. Thumbs up.\n\nMAIN COURSES: I guess it depends on your taste, but I am simply not enthralled by any of the entrees.  The salads are overpriced for their small size, their highly touted macaroni and cheese is bland, and their chicken quesadillas are NOT quesadillas.  Just about everything on the menu at Harris Grill is overpriced for the quality.  $17 dollars for homemade hamburger helper?  $16 for two fish tacos? \n\nI don't HATE anything on the Harris Grill menu.  Their entrees are between \"ok\" and \"good.\" Just overpriced.  I do enjoy the Henny Penny and as I said before, all of the appetizers.  I'd give them a 3-star review if it wasn't for the....\n\nSERVICE:  Or lack thereof.  Sure, Harris Grill gets crowded, especially on the weekends.  That does not excuse the waitstaff from being rude and ignoring their tables for upwards of an hour.  On one occasion, our server clearly forgot about us and we watched astounded as tables seated long after us were brought their meals.  When we finally did inquire about our food,  the waiter made a beeline for the computer to put in our orders.  No apologies, no offer to comp a side or a dessert.  In fact, the check was rushed to us before we even finished our food because the restaurant had a long waiting list.  Bad form, Harris Grill. What makes it worse is that I've been here many times, and have had similar problems with the service. \n\nBut truth be told, I'll probably be back.  Because I really want to like Harris Grill. Moreover, my friends love Harris Grill and I love my friends.  I just sincerely hope they hire more competent waitstaff.

We gladly took the table in lieu of waiting 20-30 minutes as we originally planned on. We closed our tab at the bar and were seated in the lounge.

We moved to the area in August and are moving away in June, and unfortunately decided we won't be coming back here before we leave. \n\nThere was only one very small table open in the crammed dining room downstairs when we got there. I'm not sure if there were tables open upstairs, but it didn't look like the hostess checked before seating us. Our table was facing the door, so I kept feeling the cold air every time people came in and out, and we were very close to the table behind us, beside us, etc. We eventually asked to move, but I thought the hostess should've asked us if that table was okay before seating us there - because I would've rather waited for a better one to open up.\n\nI thought the selection on the menu was pretty poor. I wanted an entree rather than a salad or a sandwich, but since I didn't feel like Mexican or a huge plate of macaroni & cheese, there were really only a handful of options. None of them appealed to me, so I ended up ordering the \"Henny Penny,\" a chicken sandwich. I asked for the spicy chipotle mayonnaise on the side because I have a really low tolerance for spiciness. When it came, the mayonnaise was on the sandwich. I said I would try it in case it wasn't that spicy, but when I took a bite I felt like my mouth was on fire! Then the waitress asked me if I knew the chicken itself was spicy. The menu said nothing about that, so I had no idea. She suggested they re-make it with plain chicken, which was nice, and it was fine after that. I also had the sangria, which sounded like it would be amazing from the description, but I actually didn't think it was good at all :( It tasted really watered down to me. \n\nA few redeeming things: the mac & cheese that came with my sandwich was really, really good!

Henny Penny is another go-to, but be warned, as the spice levels have varied from time-to-time from so-so spicy to mouth-on-fire spicy.\n\nIf you're looking for a nice vibe in good weather, it's fun to try your luck landing a table on the patio. Service can occasionally be slow outside and it almost always gets crowded, but it definitely beats the inside when it gets packed. The only real downside is that it gets packed most nights, and as mentioned before, it's not really worth the wait.

Yes, I might and will say this.\n\nAfter a frustratingly long day during a frustratingly long week at work, I decided I needed to stop here and ease my nerves with some comfort food and try out a few brews.  This, my friends, is just what the doctor ordered (no pun intended in relation to my work).\n\nMy friend had beat me there and already had one of each in front of her.  She decided on the Trailerpark Tatchos and I'm not quite sure what she had to drink, but it was interesting in an interesting glass.  The Tatchos were amazing.  Nothing more than nacho toppings on tater tots, but a brilliant idea none the less.  The mixture of tastes on the fried up tater tots was great.  In a single bite you got spicy, hot and cool.  I decided that I needed to order something else myself, as I feared that my friend might end up raising her lip and snarling at me for eating more than I should.  I got myself an order of Cloudy and a Chance of These.  I dare you to take a wild guess as to what this order pertained to.   DING DING DING...you, sir get a prize...not really.  Nothing but an order of meatballs swimming in a big huge potion of their sauce.  Served with a side of bread to sop up what the fork missed.  The right combination of spices mixed with the melted cheese on top was what did it for me.  And that bread made sure I didn't miss a smear of that sauce.\n\nAs for the brews, I tasted three different ones while I was here.  It was kind of hard to choose, but their nifty little binder filled with the choices made it easier.  What also made it easier was the fact that our waitress was able to make suggestions, not just guesses like most places.  \n\nDifferent flavors hitting my palate at just the right time made for a great night here.  I will definitely keep this on my short list when I need to calm myself after a hectic day at work.", "business_id": "rgmptwPbBH1wLpiBHcbIhA", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-01-31", "type": "review"}

I moved a few blocks down on Maryland and this became my mainstay while in Shadyside. This is bar far the hippest restaurant in Shadyside, and it has just enough quirk and a nice clientele to keep my faith in the typically snooty Shadyside goers. The food here is great- with possibly the coolest menu in the city- and a few good vegetarian options to boot. The hummus is good, and the vegetarian chili is incredible. The beer selection and unique cocktails, while a bit expensive, are extensive. And leave room for dessert- the ice cream covered cookie thing is to die for, especially after a couple of drinks. The bartenders are great (except for a douchebag that I believe has recently left). Harris boasts maybe the best brunch with amazing mimosas along with the buffet.

Of course, this Florida girl doesn't understand how so many places serve corned beef hash and eggs WITHOUT GRITS, WTF, but I keep reminding myself that I live in the north now, y'all. Our breakfast was tasty tasty tasty. Sure, nothing seemed fresh (or not out of a can, etc.), but it hit the spot. Nice and greasy and filling. We supplemented our meal with some mimosas, which were quite tasty, but those are hard to screw up. Our waitress was attentive and seemed rather nice.

The service has always been friendly, and it never seems to get as loud in here as it gets in some other places (Shady Grove, I'm looking at you).\n\nI know it might sound strange, but one of the things that I appreciate the most about Cappy's is that it treats its waitresses as waitresses, not as sex symbols.  I've always found the skimpy outfits that waitresses choose to wear (or are made to wear) at some other places to be rather insulting -- these women are there to do their job, not to be ogled at by everyone in the area.

I was heartbroken when said layered chocolate cake was taken off of the menu, but now that I'm of legal age, other parts of the menu have made up for this. More on that later.\n\nI think compared to other restaurants in the chain, this Applebee's is a little bit smaller than other places, but the essentials are all there: comfy seating, a bar, TVs, and most importantly: good service. Plus, it has the essential Applebee's staple: a darn good menu. (Well, I think it's good anyway. If you like Applebee's menus in other lcoations, you'll like the one here.) In recent years it's also adopted a \"light option\" menu, which is positively delicious and provides perfect alternatives to things like that tasty but not-so-good-for-me burger I used to eat on a regular basis. Fortunately, steak with shrimp and potatoes and the perfect balance of spices on top make up for my inability to always indulge in my original favorite meal.\n\nAlso: this place is home to one of the biggest margaritas I've ever seen. Joe's Crab Shack still takes the prize for 1st place, but 2nd is no small feat (no pun intended) and this place is much closer and easier for me to get to.

They were very good the mix of favors offers a very unique taste! We also tried the Bucatini with meat sauce.

There's no grandiose entry way or signage laid out in lights. Just an old house on the corner of 9th with low lighting and a cozy interior. \n\nHINT: If you've never been here, I'd recommend cutting all the way over to Graham St and then turning onto 9th. You can't turn down 9th from Tryon, as 9th is split into two sections and you won't be able to drive direct. Also, parking is sparse. Find a place around the neighborhood and walk a few blocks. There is plenty of residential 2hr parking on the streets. \n\nSat at the bar and loved every creek and crack of the old floors and pillars. It's kind of tight quarters, but it gives it a cool pub feel. The taps coming directly out of the old cabinet style system is just gorgeous. Tons of local brews and some other fine beer choices were available. Didn't indulge as it was a 1pm lunch. I ended up order the london broil sandwich. Goodness gracious I'm glad I did, too. It was just right for lunch and paired with the pasta salad, you can't go wrong. \n\nService is so friendly here.

Granted, the place only offers sandwiches (and salads too I guess) at noon, but they are absolutely, positively, worth the trip. \n\nAlmost everdyday the lunch menu offers a \"special,\" which tends to be the most succulent sandwich filler one could ever conjure up in their kitchen. They take a perfectly roasted pork loin, for example, and carve thick slices, which are then layered on top of a freshly baked roll. These rolls are never crunchy or stale; they don't cut the roof of your mouth when you bite in (ouch!), nor do they get soggy when adding condoments. I'm not quite sure how this phenomenon is achieved, but it's kudos-worthy. I hate when my tomato becomes part of the bread. BLEAGH. These rolls on the contrary, are so fresh and soft, they're practically falling apart, until glued in place by the panini grill. Unlike other delis/lunch spots, you should keep your sandwich simple, because the ingredients and toppings are so fresh and flavorful it would be a shame to spoil the fun. The special pork sandwich with mustard, cheese, lettuce, and tomato is mind-bogglingly good, and I have often heard that the turkey with cranberry being referred to as \"Christmas in a bun.\" You decide.\n\nAND YOU GET A PICKLE!! I mean seriously, just when you thought life couldn't get any better, you get a pickle for the win. \n\nI'll definitely be filling out my loyalty card here (8 sandwiches, get one free).

Which is a mild and yummy fish, much like Halibut. And Haddock is what the BEST Fish and Chips are made from, especially in England.\n\nWell, suffice it to say, these were the BEST Fish and Chips I had here in Charlotte! The batter was LIGHT, and not overly done which most tend to do. And it was very tasty too. Combine that with the quality of the fish, and the yummy Tartar Sauce, and it was a GREAT meal!\n\nMy wife had the Guiness Beef Stew, which also was yummy. A little small for me (I'm a big guy), but perfect for her petite frame.\n\nThey had a great premium/microbrew list. I had the Allagash Stout from Maine, and it was a 750ml bottle! Wow, and it cost $18.00 too. Not really bad, but my ONLY complaint that I did share with them was that they did NOT list any prices on their liquor list. I didn't realize that 1) the beer was 750ml and 2) it cost $18.00! You would figure that a Restaurant actually publish their prices (except for the really high end places which employ the snobby tactic of, \"if you have to ask, you can't afford it\" BS.)\n\nOverall, this was a great meal. I come here for lunch all the time as I work down the street in Uptown. And if you go here for lunch, try their burgers, which are great. One of the ONLY places here in Charlotte that actually know HOW to make CRISPY bacon! I HATE, repeat, HATE, soggy bacon!", "business_id": "WuCcv_Dyd_1B_1-4jwK7sQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-02-12", "type": "review"}

However, I hate the uptown (parking makes me anxious), so my visits, unfortunately, are too few and too far between.  In 2009 when I read that they had a fire and would be closing down for a bit for renovations, I am fairly certain a tear or two rolled down my cheek.  My arteries opened a lil bit, but I was mildly distraught.  Thank goodness they did the renovation and re-opened!\n\nRecently before an event at Blumenthal, my date and I schlepped it over to the Ri Ra.  After parking at the BoA deck, it was a short walk, and was only a few quick steps away from our final destination of Blumenthal/Belk to see a concert.\n\nWant to sit at the bar?  There are 2 beautiful dark wood bars to park your rump at to slurp down syrupy beers and shots.  High tables with stools?  Got those.  Tables that you can get up and down from without flashing your stuff if you have on a skirt?  Have those too.  2 floors of seating, all dark and lovely, give you plenty of room to pop a squat and enjoy some Irish/bar food at it's finest.  There is even a small terrace/patio upstairs for enjoying Carolina blue days when it is a little warmer out.\n\nMy secret dream in life is to find a nice Irish boy to move to the green, green Irish countryside with to spend my days waiting for his liver to pickle/fail.  I LOVE corned beef and cabbage - it's a sickness really.  And while I love to make it, it stinks up the house, so it's always nice to be able to find this delicious dish where it stinks up someone else's kitchen.  The corned beef and cabbage at Ri Ra is delicious.  The corned beef is tender and not terribly stringy.  Well flavored.  the cabbage is... well... cabbage.  Cabbage-y.  Cabbage-ish.  Nothing fancy, just good.  The mashed potatoes that go with are creamy without being runny.  Hearty Irish fair for a green-eyed girl.  \n\nFor an appetizer, we ordered the Spinach and Artichoke dip which is served with a portion of sliced baguette.  YUM!  Creamy, cheesy, good.  When it hits the table, resist the urge to dig in immediately, or you will be peeling the top layer of skin in your mouth off for the rest of the night.  HOT.  Molten hot.  I previously had the corned beef/cabbage/mashed potato egg rolls, but I didn't see those on the menu.  That was a bummer because they were off the hook good.\n\nI followed the dip with the corned beef and cabbage.  Happy tummy.\n\nWe decided to split a dessert and got the peach pie.  That was not a winner.  I don't know where on the pie our slice was, but it was the part with no peaches in it.  I think I accidentally ate one, but I may be mistaken.  Normally I am too full to eat dessert anyway, so this isn't a deal breaker, but I won't be getting that again.\n\nOn previous visits I have had the Reuben, which is stuffed with tender corned beef and served with a side. The colcannon side is tasty(mashed potatoes with cabbage mixed in).  The macaroni and cheese is creamy with a crumb topping.  So many things on the menu look delicious, but I almost always stick to my standard Spinach dip and then corned beef and cabbage.  \n\nGreat bar/restaurant, awesome ambiance and great food!", "business_id": "WuCcv_Dyd_1B_1-4jwK7sQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-12-04", "type": "review"}

It's always a guessing game when you pick a restaurant in a strange city. Even with reviews to check out, you never know what you might get. Ri Ra had good solid reviews, however, and was within walking distance of our hotel, which was a deciding factor!\n\nIt was fairly busy when we got there and there was a trivia round going, which was slightly annoying, since it echoed through the whole restaurant, but we were there early and once the game ended, it was much better.\n\nWe were impressed with the selection of import and local beers. I stuck with Smithwick's but my partner was a little more adventurous and tried several local NC beers, all of which were good. \n\nWe started with the hummus appeitzer, expecting the usual bowl of hummus and sliced pita. We were more than pleasantly surprised when what we got was the hummus, toasted pita, and a selection of roasted red peppers, olives, marinated artichokes, and cucumber and celery for dipping. The hummus itself was excellent, garlicky and spicy. \n\nI had the Irish curried chicken over rice and it was quite good. The curry was sweetish, but still had a nice bite to the finish. The chicken was all white meat and nicely tender, and the peppers and onions that were in the curry were delicious.\n\nMy partner had the Guinness beef and veggie stew, which was also really good. There was lots of beef in the stew and the Guinness added a really different (and delicious) flavor. \n\nOnce the trivia game was over, the atmosphere was great. Music was fun but not too loud for conversation. Our server was friendly and helpful. She made great food and drink suggestions, and even gave us info on places to check out during the rest of our trip. \n\nRi Ra is definitely a solid 4* and we'll be back the next time we're in Charlotte.", "business_id": "WuCcv_Dyd_1B_1-4jwK7sQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-12-13", "type": "review"}

My Reuben was the same price as my dang appetizer!  Haha. The Reuben was sadly not that great, the bread was soggy, and it was missing some more much needed sauerkraut. It just didn't have the tang or crunch I was looking for. The meat was a bit dry and bland as well.\n\nMy friend had the Fish & Chips Regular portion ($13.95). He said they were good, but could've been crispier. I'm not sure if the batter was exactly his favorite.\n\nThe first time I went to Ri Ra's with a group I had the Guinness BBQ Burger ($10.95) I liked this - yummy onion rings and Guinness BBQ sauce on top.\n\nSo overall - okay food good vibes.

We had to ask for our silverware/napkins after our food came, and did not get it until at least 10 minutes later about halfway through the meal. All the while watching the group of guys next to us get service repeatedly (when they asked her to get something, she would immediately come back to their table, not disappear for 10 minutes then have to be asked again when she did finally return). Aside from just being terrible, she was also unfriendly.  \n\nAs for the food, all my friends seemed to enjoy/appreciate their meals.  For about 8-10$, you get a huge sandwich/burger and a side of fries.  Except $8 for a basket of chip and cheese dip is ridiculously overpriced to me.\n\nAs a vegetarian, it was entirely another matter for me.  Not wanting a \"veggie\" burger, I ordered the buffalo blue cheese dip + potato wedges/chips + vegetables off the appetizer menu.  What was delivered was a basket of chips and cheese dip. When I asked the waitress if I was correct that the menu listed vegetables as well, she said \"yeah, it should come with it\" as if I was asking too much for the kitchen to produce what the menu says.  It wasn't actually until I explained the vegetable part was the reason I ordered this dish that she \"offered\" to get them for me.  She disappears. Ten minutes later, my friends halfway through their meal, no vegetables in sight, but at least we have silverware and napkins now.  Five minutes later, she hears us loudly complaining, and says shes told the kitchen twice now.. yeah right. Another ten minutes later, we're complaining real loud now, to ourselves because no staff member is in sight.  Soon the manager appears and says the vegetables will be out soon and apologizes.  My cheese dip and potato chips are not semi-warm, at best. He returns, and in a pretentiously apologetic manner sets done a plate and gets ready to scurry off before I can complain about: THREE 6-inch cuts of celery, and TWO 4-inch by 1-inch hunks of a carrot, completely RAW.

Wanted something new so we picked this restaurant.\n\nWalked in with the party of 7 and the host said if there are more people coming for your party I can't accommodate you more than that coz of limited seating. Understandable but I think he could've said it differently. \n\nRestaurant is very steakhouse cozy. A little bit pub vibe, very small and quite dark. They have a bar. We were seated on high chairs. \n\nMenu personally I didn't think they offered a lot of choices but that's a personal preference. I ordered the calamari, my friends ordered fried fish sandwich, burgers and a chicken fajita.\n\nThe food took forever. I was even looking at other tables who were waiting on their food staring at each other or the ceiling. \n\nWhen we got our food, you would expect it to be hot. It's not. I guess with our big party some of the food was still cooking and some were already sitting out. My friends said the same thing. The temperature of food felt like it has been sitting there.\n\nI liked my calamari a lot though and the waitress said I got more than the usual quantity it comes with. My friends said their food was good. But good as in okay. Nothing too crazy. Price upwards of $10+.\n\nPersonally, I didn't didn't really have a good first time experience. I don't think I will go back either. I definitely would rather have spent my money on hooters. But I will give huge credit to our waitress. I really suck at names. She was very patient and polite. Knew her stuff and accommodated our take pretty well. Other than that, blah.", "business_id": "vIXUw1cLG84-m8LzOg3f-w", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-02-24", "type": "review"}

While I haven't had a bad dish or poor service, Rock Bottom seems to be a variation on a theme: a classy Americana pub with dressed up pub fare and dark paneling.  \n\nI agree with Stephen K.'s summary of Rock Bottom but there are some highlights to the menu.  I've had a pretty awesome quesadilla and enchiladas to the tune of $12-14 and a hearty pick-your-own toppings cheeseburger.  I love carbs, so in this aspect, Rock Bottom does not dissapoint.  The chicken fingers are so-so.  However, the fries evoke memories of your middle school cafeteria (thin cut and taste like veggie oil).\n\nThe staff are very friendly and professional; they actually make sure you're doing OK unlike wait staff at most sports bars.  I've never been treated rudely or indifferently here-I would vouch for the service any day.  What then, is the \"selling point\" of Rock Bottom.  Duh, location!  The outdoor seating gives view to a long stretch of Tryon St.  Rock Bottom is an awesome place to people-watch or grab a reasonable meal before launching an evening Uptown.  Rock Bottom is casual but not trashy, a pub that resorts to being a sports bar, and a stopping point but not a destination. If you've exhausted your rotation of Uptown restaurants and hangouts, at least add Rock Bottom to your list.", "business_id": "ym9QwkmB5ZKTyj7q5huTDw", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-01-10", "type": "review"}

Luckily, I had a friend recommend the fish tacos so I went with that. It was a hard taco wrapped in a soft taco with melted pepper jack cheese, and all the regular taco garnishes. Was fantastic. A little on the spicy side for me, but I'm truly a baby when it comes to that so don't go by my spicy judgment. Also, I want to add that the server was extremely nice by letting me only get the tacos. I didn't want the extra rice & beans so she took a couple dollars of the meal price and just gave me the tacos. \n\nObviously Rock Bottom is known for their beers and they definitely had a great selection to offer. I tried a few =) but ended up really liking the Brown Ale the best. \n\nThey were packed when we went but we didn't have to wait too long for our food and our service was on point!

We ended up getting there around 7:45pm on a Friday night to find the place very alive with people, both young and old, carousing, socializing and being merry.  \n\nMy friends and the party I was attending were stationed in the bar area, to the left as you walk in.  Though there was a jumble of people standing around drinking and talking, a server promptly noticed we were new to the scene and took our drink orders and provided us with a menu to look over.  I ordered a \"light lager\" for my girlfriend and a \"Brown Ale\" draft for myself.  Draft beers were running $4 per pint on Friday night; which certainly isn't bad, but isn't a deal by any means. \n\nAs evening turned into a chilly night, the people I was with found a few tables in the bar area and placed food orders.  I ordered, the BBQ pulled pork sliders as an appetizer, and some sort of lobster and shrimp rolled into a black corn enchiladas.  As a devout BBQ lover, I found the sliders to be an extreme disappointment.  The BBQ was border-line cold and there was very little BBQ on each of the sliders.  As for the enchiladas, the appeal of my meal was more in the uniqueness of the dish than its actual taste.  It's not that the enchiladas were bad, they just left me wanting more.  My girlfriend got the steak with mashed-potatoes and green-beans.  I thought the steak was above par.  My girl friend said it was cooked to her specifications.  \n\nOverall, I felt the food was good not great, and the BBQ sliders were not up to BBQ code.  However, Rock Bottom offered the perfect ambiance to enjoy myself and my friend's birthday in splendid fashion.  The service WAS GREAT!  I wish I could recall my server's name, because I would love to give her a shot-out.  Despite the chaotic atmosphere that reigned throughout the bar, she was prompt, polite and accurate with everything.\n\nTIPS: *Nice, classy atmosphere, *Nice seating area outside  *Parking can be found by turning either way on 7th street, including in the garage attached to Rock Bottom itself (KEEP YOUR TICKET!!  BRING IT IN WITH YOU!  ROCK BOTTOM VALIDATES PARKING, SEE THE HOSTESS.)  *Stay away from the BBQ Sliders  *Great, friendly service  *Good for parties or pre-gaming before going out somewhere else", "business_id": "ym9QwkmB5ZKTyj7q5huTDw", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-12-04", "type": "review"}

I ordered chicken quesadillas which were MIND BLOWING!! I mean OMG, they were soooooo good! I had never eaten sour cream or avocado before that night, and now I eat it all the time when I get the quesadillas.  Next, my boyfriend ordered a burger(with cheese, ketcup and mustard. PLAIN I know.) He ordered steak fries that came out more like potato wedges. He thought his burger was so-so. I tasted it, and it was dry and overcooked. The wedges were salty as well. \n\nI ordered a steak(medium well) and fries. Now that was 10 times better than my boyfriends plain burger. My steak was juicy, seasoned well, and cooked to perfection. I couldn't have asked for a better steak! So kudos to the cook! My fries were normal fries which were just as tasty(once again better than my boyfriends) lol.\n\nI have been back to Rock Bottom 4 times since then, and now that I live up the street from it, I plan on becoming a weekly regular! I always get the chicken quesadillas, and have even tried the chicken nachos. Let me tell you that the nachos coming in a heap PILED up on a plate, with cheese, olives, tomatoes, and other stuff. They were sooooo good! Me and my friends couldn't eat it all.\n\nAlso, my boyfriend ordered the ribs before, and he did not like them WHAT-SO-EVER. But then again, he was comparing them to the ribs at Firebirds so yea. He also ordered the cheese pizza, and I must say that I have gotten better pizza at chuckie-cheese.

After her canoodling me  I gave in and said i'll take  one ( 30 dollar)  dance.\n\nAfter some pleasant conversation over the drink( I treated her to),  the dance began .  After four minutes the song was over and I reached in my pocket to give her the 30 + 5 dollars for a tip, when she explained I actually owed her 60 dollars  because it was 2 songs.  By my count it was one dance. Apparently she decided to count the 5 minutes of  time we spent talking over the drinks i bought her as part of the dance as well.   I thought she was kidding and gave her the $ 35. This  beautiful little angel suddenly became a crazy little devil. She called her manager and made me out to be some kind of lunatic lowlife cheapskate.   I politely explained the situation to the  manager but he insisted i pay up which i promptly did .  After wards i made a quick exit.   \n\nThere was no mistaken that I was being blatantly scammed here.  I was in the club for less then 10 minutes and hadn't even finished my first beer, and was not drunk in the least.   Unless you don't mind being scammed by a dancer, and paying 60 dollars for a 4 minute dance I would  steer clear from this establishment .  A night I was hoping to relax over a beer and a beautiful dancer cost me 80 dollars for less then 10 minutes of harassment and aggravation.

Let's go somewhere new, downtown (uptown as they call it in Charlotte), some place fancy.  The capital grille fits this criteria.  From walking into the place with the dark woods, white linen table cloths, well dressed patrons.  It all works.  The waiter approaches our table and we are ready to start the experience.  He recommends a wine from the extensive wine list.  Lets talk about that.  I am a wanna-be when it comes to choosing a wine.  When I see a list as big as this, my first thought is wow, I think I'll get a beer!  Our waiter was an expert.  After a couple more visits we learned that pretty much everyone there had an excellent grasp on choosing wine and familiarity with the wine selection.  Our selection was a white which was absolutley perfect.  Started with the Lettuce wedge, nice giant piece of iceburg lettuce, ice cold, plenty of blue cheese and bacon and perfectly ripe tomotes.  \nThings were looking good.  We went light on the apps the first time since we had a feeling that the meal was going to be huge and we wanted to survive!  Our steaks came, filet au poivre, of course!  Done perfectly, rare, cream sauce was out of this world.  Meat so juicy and tender you don't need the fancy knife they give you.  We had the mashed potatoes and the au gratin potatoes for sides.  These were to die for.  Low fat I'm sure.  For dessert the recommendation was made to order the cheese cake.  Wow, I had no idea.  So rich and creamy we ate the whole thing.  Uncommon considering how much food was consumed this night.  \nSince that first visit we had been back several times.  I highly recommend the Capital Grille, prices are high as you would expect.

In other words, this place oozes of old money, but you don't have to dress to the nines in order to enjoy service here; as long as you don't dress like you're about to attend a GWAR concert, you won't be denied service.\n\nOur attentive waitress, Beth, could not have been more instrumental in helping us decide what to eat. I was jonesing for a good red wine, but I wasn't much in the mood to down an entire bottle on my own (my wife doesn't like red wine, and I don't like white, so that negates our wine choosing); she recommended a rich and full-bodied Rioja by the glass, so smooth and elegant that I would have enjoyed another glass were I more inclined to do so.\n\nWe started with the prosciutto-wrapped mozzarella, lightly sauteed and garnished with fresh basil and vine tomatoes. Absolutely lovely, and the prosciutto is from Parma, and not the poser variety most restaurants and delis try to pawn off on you. The crostinis were a delight as well. My wife also enjoyed a wedge salad with a tangy blue cheese dressing.\n\nAs for the main event, my wife chose the lobster and crab-stuffed shrimp; think of this as looking akin to a stuffed tomato, lightly glazed and very delicious. I went for the steak Au Poivre, rubbed with peppercorns and served with a cognac (Courvoisier?) sauce. Oh. My. GOODNESS! Tender, with a swift bite to it, thanks to the peppercorns. We shared a neatly-prepped side of sauteed spinach, and the parmesan truffle fries; this was perhaps the only disappointment, as the fries seemed to lack the prerequisite amount of parmesan so as to not make the fries taste like, well, fries.\n\nWe topped off our gastric orgy with an off-the-menu layered carrot cake, large enough for two. There was no way we could finish it, but, man, we gave it our best.\n\n$180 for dinner? Yeah, so what?

The mixed green salad with champagne vinegarette and the tomato mozzarella salad are also great starters (but you may want to split the later as it's quite large).\n\nMain course: I don't eat red meat, but everyone I've dined with says that Capital Grille has the best steaks around. The salmon is also very good, and the portion size ridiculous; you'll definitely have some to take home.\n\nSides: you must have the creamed spinach. Even if you abhor spinach you will love this dish (which tells you just how healthy it is). The asparagus and mashed potatos are also solid side choices.\n\nDessert (my favorite course): get the cheesecake; you will not regret it. The top is torched like creme brulee and it comes with whip cream and berries. I've also had some of their  homemade ice cream (mint), and it was very good as well. The chocolate cake is very rich, but with a bit of ice cream on top, the perfect chocolately end to your evening.\n\nThey have a very helpful slew of valet attendants out front for free parking, so defintiely plan to use them.

After we sat down we ordered, and the food came out in great time. \n\nHe ordered the 8 oz Kona Parmesan steak for his meal and I had the Salmon. The sides that came with these meals were spinach and mashed potatoes. Now, I've said that many places were good, and I've given many 5 star reviews, but MY GOD I think they should make an exception for even more stars for some places. \n\nWhen I took that first taste of my salmon... time stopped as my taste buds exploded. I thought it couldn't get any better, and then I tried the potatoes... If foodgasms were real. This is it folks. I'm serious... Capital Grill has the BEST food I have ever eaten in my entire life. I could have wept from the amazingness on my palate. The salmon was so juicy and perfect. The potatoes... oh those potatoes... I could write an entire review on those alone. Perfect. \n\nNow the most amazing part and quite possibly the best customer service I have ever experienced in my life. We got our bill and my honey had ordered an All American and then changed his mind and switched to a B&B, both drinks ended up being on the bill. We weren't upset by it at all, but a manager came over when he saw us looking around for our waitress. \n\nHe asked if everything was ok, and when we explained the mix up, he apologized profusely and told us he would take both drinks off of our bill!! We told him he didn't have to do that because we did have the one drink, but he insisted and said it would make his night to make this right for us. WOW!!! We were amazed!!\n\nThere is seriously nothing negative I can say about this place, and I think it'll be a great place for any special occasion. Hmmm... my birthday IS right around the corner... :)", "business_id": "CChwRoYVXA3QZulS8a6xOQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-02-17", "type": "review"}

Frankly, I've gotten a better steak from Whole Foods.  Also, the steak came with a pool of steak sauce on the side.  If I'm paying 47 bucks for a steak, I don't want any sauce near it.

This time around we made reservations to partake in their Restaurant Week menu, and it is the most affordable way to experience one of the better restaurants in the area.\n\nThe Capital Grill may be a chain, but it definitely doesn't feel like it. From the interior decor to the service to the actual food, everything screams upscale fancy-smancy...not something that is usually associated with a chain. We made reservations (highly recommended) and were seated almost immediately.\n\nOur server was very friendly and brutally honest. I guess she was forced to try to upsell us a $17 glass of wine but then told us how ridiculous it is and we shouldn't bother with it. When we did choose a bottle of wine she detoured us to a different bottle that was the same price but was more well-received. I'm glad we went with her recommendation because it ended up being an awesome bottle that we would have overlooked otherwise. \n\nFor the first course of the Restaurant Week menu I had the New England Clam Chowder. I am a sucker for clam chowda and this stuff was great. It wasn't overly heavy with cream and had a ridiculous amount of succulent clam chunks in it. This chowda definitely didn't skimp on the seafood, and the clams, potatoes and bacon were all melded nicely for some of the best I've had in awhile. The missus got the field green salad which was very nice, and came with an excellent champagne dressing that worked very well with the veggies. I was almost a little jealous of her salad, but I had chowder in front of me, so that feeling didn't last long.\n\nThe Restaurant Week menu was decent for entrees, with a few steak options as well as a chicken and salmon. I ordered the 14oz bone-in sirloin and this was one of the most magnificent steaks I've had in the Queen City. It was cooked to a perfect medium rare just as I ordered it, and it was a tender, juicy, tasty steak with an excellent beef flavor. It was such a huge steak that I only ate half and saved the rest for a leftover dinner the next night! \n\nThe missus had the Citrus Glazed Seared Salmon. It was a very nice piece of salmon that wasn't overpowering, and the glaze was really tasty. Her plate also came with some roasted asparagus that were cooked perfectly and had a nice sauce drizzled on top. Our table was also served shared side dishes of mashed potatoes and green beans. The potatoes were crazy rich, creamy and delicious, and there were still a few nice lumps mixed within the majority of the velvety mass, making these potatoes freaking awesome. The green beans were also tasty, and were tossed with tomatoes to give it a little extra pop.\n\nFor dessert we both shared the Cheesecake and Flourless Chocolate Espresso Cake. The cheesecake was actually more like a mousse, and so it was light as opposed to dense. It tasted wonderful and the top is caramelized to give it a crisp bite. It was served alongside a few berries and strawberry glaze, which made one delicious mouthful. The chocolate cake was just as good, if not slightly better. The espresso flavor is very light so if you're not a coffee fan don't be afraid to give this a whirl. The consistency of the cake was more like a chewy fudge, making it extremely decadent. \n\nThe Capital Grill is the place to go, so long as you have to cash. The food is all excellent and I would love to go back and try some other stuff out. The ambiance, service and food all scream swank, and it definitely feels like it warrants the extravagant price tag.", "business_id": "CChwRoYVXA3QZulS8a6xOQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-01-19", "type": "review"}

There were 5 of us. Let me just say, it was incredible. I've done the Restaurant Week thing before on numerous occasions and, it's very easy to come across servers and restaurants that are focused on getting you in and out as quickly as possible. This was absolutely not the case here.\n\nBeing that it was Restaurant Week, there was a set menu for us to choose from. Unfortunately, there was not a vegetarian option (my fiancee is vegetarian), however the server spoke with the chef and they were able to come up with an incredible vegetarian pasta that she loved. The server was very conscious to avoid any soups that had a meat broth as well. In addition, at no point were any of our water glasses ever empty, every interaction with the server was met with a smile, and what's more important, we never felt rushed. The server found out that it was my dad's birthday, and brought him a cheesecake with a candle for dessert (complementary). \n\nAs for the food, I can say that this was without a doubt the best steak I've ever had. The filet was so tender and cooked perfectly! For some perspective, I've eaten at Ruth's Chris, Del Friscos, and several other high-end steakhouses in addition to working at a very high-end country club.

Fresh Market filets are tender, almost buttery (not to mention consistent, we've grilled a good half dozen times with similar results). It's nice to have someone cook for you once in awhile, but really I'd choose quality every time over being served something that's just OK while being overcharged.  My husband enjoyed his lobster bisque and the lobster mac and cheese had several large chunks of lobster that were tender and perfect. My tomato salad came with underripe overly thick slices of tomato on top (which generally made the whole thing look unnappetizing). I'd say it's a reasonable request that if a tomato salad is offered you'd better have ripe tomato, otherwise perhaps not bother offering as a menu item. Under the thick slices there were some very tasty red, gold, and chocolate colored grape tomatoes that had marinated in the balsamic nicely- those were really good and I did enjoy that part.

My colleague, John, flew in from Toronto and I flew down from Boston.  We arrived late in the day and roamed around downtown looking for dinner on the Company's dime.  John suggested Uno's--he wanted something he couldn't get in Toronto.  I pointed out that if I wanted to eat at Uno's, I'd have stayed in Boston.  So we meandered some more on that stultifying evening but couldn't agree on anything until I saw the sign for the Graduate and said, \"That looks sort divey!  Let's check it out, eh!\"  (John's Canadian so I thought I'd make him feel at home by speaking like a McKenzie Brother.) \"Right on!\" John exclaimed.\n\nThe Graduate amply filled our gustatory and cultural needs.  The place was clean if self-consciously dingy; the barmaids were hot.  A college cover band performed a passable rendition of a Green Day anthem before segueing into a more challenging Sublime ballad.  The buffalo tenders were hot, spicy and cheap, and the beer was even cheaper.\n\nJohn asked me to recommend an \"American\" beer and once I ascertained that Rolling Rock, Brubaker, and 'Gansett were not on the menu, and being kind of a jerk, I suggested Pabst Blue Ribbon: An American favorite if you happen to spend eight hours a day at General Motors, stamping pieces of metal with a drill press and need a refreshing pick-me-up before smacking around your wife and kids.\n\nThe cute little waitress gave John a look bordering on horror, \"You want PBR?\" she asked incredulously.  \n\n\"What's wrong with her?\" John asked.  \n\nI murmured something about his choice offending her collegiate aesthetic.  \"She's probably not used to real men ordering real beer,\" said I.\n\nAs it turned out, John developed a liking for good old American PBR and asked for it wherever he went.  Boy was he pissed when someone explained where Pabst fell on the beer chain!\n\nWhat does this story have to do with the Graduate?  Not a hell of a lot but it was a good evening.  We got pretty smashed, ended up with something like a fifty dollar bill--including the tip--and were in fine shape for the start of our conference the next morning, where the evening cocktail reception contained a NASCAR theme and an open bar.

It feels trendy, but isn't pretentious like some Uptown restaurants.  It's a great place to casually go before or after an Uptown show or event, especially if you can get there between 5:00 and 7:00 p.m. during the week because their tapas/appetizers are half-price!  Woo hoo!   And if we're lucky enough to go on a Wednesday evening, we can combine the half-price apps with half-price martinis.  You can really fill up on some gourmet food and classy, flavorful martinis...for cheap!   It does tend to get pretty crowded, though, on Wednesdays, so allow yourself enough time to be seated and get served all within that timeframe.  \n\nTheir regular menu is excellent, too.  They have gourmet American items, as well as a full sushi menu.  Their sushi is excellent and that's usually what I get if we're not there during happy hour.  The sushi can't beat places like Ru-San's or Nikko, but it's still pretty darn good...and very reasonably priced!  \n\nMy only disappointment with Cosmos Cafe would be that we went there once for my birthday (because that's where I wanted to go).  One of my friends made a reservation in advance and we were seated in a room by ourselves off to the side (their party room, I'm assuming).  Being in there  lost the atmosphere of Cosmos, but that wasn't all that went wrong.  We were handed limited menus.  There was some kind of event or show going on that night in Uptown (when isn't there anymore?) and Cosmos was providing a limited menu with only a few simple items (not even their gourmet options) so they could get people in and out quicker.

On the outside, it looks like a corner business. But its really a full restaurant with an upstairs area. \n\nAnyways back to the actual experience. They served food upstairs for our group, which was cool, but you had to put your credit card down as a tab. [Not an issue]. The bar selection is ok. The food was ok. \n\nThe issue I have with this place is that when you go to pay out, they give you a post swiped transaction. This is the receipt that shows the total, card transaction details, tip, and total. They did not give a receipt detailing the full itemized service. After requesting the receipt and giving a quick look at it I paid, and put down a tip. \n\nAfter looking at the receipt later, it turns out that there was a gratuity charge already added to the receipt. I find this to be very deceptive and FRAUDULENT. Adding grautity to a bill doesn't bother me. It bothers me when 1. it was never stated that would be there, 2. when you don't have sitdown service with a waiter [the social group I was with was more of freeflowing in the bar area] \n\nTo add insult to injury, they try to play the club vibe outside.

We made an Open Table reservation thanks to Yelp (recognizing my boyfriend under his first-name-last-name-initial Yelp alias when we arrived at the host stand) and discussed where they would seat us amongst themselves for what seemed to be a solid 5 minutes. The host finally walked us to a table, realized the table wasn't available, and walked us across the very large restaurant to a little two-top nook. Not a bad table, but it always makes me laugh when hosts/hostesses are confused about where to take the table. I mean, I know how it is from my college days as a hostess in fine dining, having servers whine about not having equal tables and blah blah.\n\nSo we're seated and we look over the menus. It's supposedly Mediterranean but there are dishes from all over the world, with the origin of the dish and suggested wine pairing accompanying the description. We were torn between the crab/lobster cakes and the hummus, but opted for the cakes because LOBSTER. Always go for lobster. We ordered our main courses (venison for him, scallops/pork medallions/pasta for me) off of the \"seasonal\" menu section... shortly after, our appetizer arrived. Absolutely delicious cakes, however there were two and very small. I suppose for something so rich you only need a bite. My pasta dish was good and not cream-based- it mostly got its flavor from  the scallops and pork. Very good, a lot of pasta which I didn't finish. We always share bits of our meals whenever we go out, though this time I didn't try the venison- maybe it's the \"I grew up in Michigan and I protest against deer hunters\" thing, maybe it's because venison is just too gamey. He liked it though.\n\nThat said, we go out several times a week and haven't been totally blown away with any Charlotte dinners until this weekend- 2/2 nights out this weekend were solid- and I'm glad my friend recommended Blue to us.

We also had crab cakes, scallops, and a cheese plate for appetizers- all great! I had the wild boar for dinner it was also served with the pork short ribs, I would have preferred if I could have just gotten more of the wild boar, a very tender meat that resembles more of a beef than pork. For dessert we had creme brule, which pretty much no one can mess that up and also a blueberry port that was outstanding! We went well over our budget and be aware that a party of 6 is already charged gratuity. You can eat here for around $35 per person if you want to but you can quickly start adding things up with drinks and other add ons.

We try to go somewhere new every time this event rolls around to see if we find any little unexpected gems. Food was pretty good, service was absolutely disappointing, & prices matched the quality of food for the most part. Nothing earth shattering here but it is certainly a decent place to eat on the high end.\n\nWe started with the Arrancini and the Hummus & Dolmada. Both of which were excellent. The Arrancini was really excellent. Could sit around and get fat on that one. Mmmm. \n\nNext we ordered Trout a la Navarra and Chicken Tagine. The menu description of the Chicken Tagine says \"a fiery harrisa sauce\". Yes. It. Is. My husband likes things that set my face on fire and he mentioned it was nearly too fiery for him! This dish, IMO, is over priced by about 5-7 dollars. Other than the price though, he had no complaint (it was Queen's Feast so everything was a flat rate from the offering menu so no bigs). The Trout a la Navarra was very well prepared. The trout cooked, skin on, perfectly. This is a plate I would absolutely order again. There wasn't a trace of it left on my plate when I was done. \n\nWe finished off the meal with Sticky Toffee Pudding and Amaretto Cheesecake. The sticky toffee pudding was absolutely delicious. Nectar of the sugar addicted gods. I can't speak toward the cheesecake because, well, yuck. But the hubs said it was pretty good. He's the cheesecake man, not I.\n\nThe service? Was seriously lacking and well below par for a place of this sort. Yes, it was very busy. Since when did that become and excuse for poor service IN a service based industry?? Our waitress was inattentive, slow, and we clearly had just half of her already fractured attention. Also.......a personality to be rivaled only by moldy driftwood. I get that it was Queen's Feast and there are alot of \"po folk\" out living the good life for half the price so tips are going to be lacking. However, I tip extremely generously when you have earned it, regardless. Do your job, do it well or go home. \n\nAll in all, would eat there again for a special occasion.

Jam Base had listed it as one show and when I bought tickets on the Visulite website it was for 1 show. We were aggressively all told that we would have to pay for the first person on stage or we would have to come back later. What? Then we were told, \"it was made very clear on the website\" at which point the guy whipped out his clip board and showed us some piece of paper and was like, \"don't make me pull up the website.\" If it was made so clear... why were we having this discussion? To say the least, the guy taking/selling tickets was a jerk and the door guy was a total bully. He not only told said, \"are you talking about MY ticket guy in there? you better watch yourself or you won't be coming back!\" Really? First of all, I'm a hard working polite female that does not deserve to be bullied around by some oaf that thinks HIS job is that important to keep squirrely little girls like me out of there. What am i going to do? kick him in the shins? tell him he's a meanie? there are better ways to handle a situation. Second, I was not talking back to this guy or arguing. I was trying to figure out why on earth I would have to buy separate tickets for 1 nights worth of music at the same venue. We ended up going to Crown Station (which is an awesome spot with very nice people) and headed back in time for the show. Again, the door guy was a bully saying, \"looks like you came back for a 2nd try, huh? you better watch yourself this time.\" To say the least, I asked the bartender to speak to a manager and apparently there was not one there on this particular evening. I have to say, the bartender was extremely nice and apologized about 3 times over.

And the ability to enjoy some of the best Rockabilly, Country, and Blues musicians around (for FREE!) at Rodeo Bar in Manhattan's Murray Hill any night of the week, has also spoiled me.\n\nMy point being - places like Small's, Rodeo Bar, and Double Door Inn are a dying breed. It is your duty as a live music supporter to exercise your right to enjoy this craft in a setting that is up close and personal, and velvet-rope-free. Though I doubt that the Double Door can draw New York sized crowds on a \"school night\", if you bring a group of friends here now, it could quickly become your own private corner of musical heaven for years to come.", "business_id": "Q76FbDBBw4Mm3RZ34cpZfg", "stars": 5, "date": "2007-12-03", "type": "review"}

So far, I have only been twice, but boy I wish I could afford to go weekly! My boyfriend and I just went for Valentine's Day. Had a reservation, got there a little early, and were still seated immediately, and in the jazz room too! (Side note: the female singer they had on Valentine's was INCREDIBLE. Wish I got her name) My boyfriend and I absolutely LOVE the rolls they give everyone, possibly the best rolls I've had at any restaurant. For my drink, I ordered the chocolate martini, my favorite! Oh, and of course a Hurricane later, also delicious\n\nFor my entree I had the special Tilapia with the crawfish topping. OH! First, let me mention, the gumbo that comes before the entree is AMAZING. I don't care if it's not authentic! Who cares about authenticity when the food is THAT good. I ate that gumbo so fast my boyfriend was making comments like, \"Slow down, it's not going anywhere!\" It had a little bit of a kick to it, which I don't normally like, but the flavor was just too good! Now, back to the entree. Last time, I ordered the same thing, but I didn't even try the crawfish topping; I just gave it all to my mom. This time, however, I realized what a mistake that was! I've actually never had crawfish before, so I have nothing to compare theirs to, but it was delicious, and I'm already craving more! The tilapia, like the first time, was also to-die-for. I will admit I'm biased because I like tilapia pretty much anywhere I go as long as they cook it right, but my boyfriend seemed to like it as well. He also loved his salmon special with the shrimp topping (as did I!).\n\nUnfortunately, neither of us were able to leave room for dessert, so I have nothing to say about that. Overall, this place is definitely in my top 3 restaurants in Charlotte now. The only problem is the parking, which is almost unavoidable whenever you go there. It's such a tiny place with barely any parking, but I'd rather deal with the parking than have them move to another location. The tiny old building, along with the jazz music playing, makes me feel like I've gone back in time. It's such a cozy, romantic restaurant. Definitely a great choice for Valentine's Day, and even my extremely picky, high-maintenance boyfriend (I love him, but he is!) agreed. Believe me, he wasn't lying. He wouldn't hesitate to tell me if I picked a bad restaurant! lol.", "business_id": "jTGQUWGIVvL-aY03C5BEmw", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-02-18", "type": "review"}

I guess because it is such a \"Charlotte Institution\" that I just imagined I would have written about it before!  Anyhow, this is one of my fav places to go when we actually leave the \"Ballantyne Bubble\".  \n\nWe recently purchased a Groupon and went to meet some friends there for dinner.  While I love saving the $$ associated with groupon-type specials, I really dread going to the restaurant when I know that they are going to be swamped with other customers who are also taking advantage of the savings.  It seems that most restaurants do not properly prepare for the increase in business that will result from offering the coupons.  Many times, we have noticed that there is not enough staff to handle the increased number of customers -- so the level of service and also the quality of the food suffers. But enough of that tangent...back to the Cajun Queen...\n\nSince there were going to be 6 of us, we made a reservation.  David and I arrived before the rest of our party, so we went upstairs to the bar while we waited. The bar was pretty full and I must say, the service in the bar area suffered because of it. It took a while to get our beers and the bartender didn't bother offering an orange or a glass for my Blue Moon, which was disappointing. But I had my \"big girl panties\" on , so I got over it and just decided to try and enjoy the beer straight from the bottle sans l'orange.  \n\nAlmost immediately after getting our beers, the hostess announced over the loudspeaker that our party of 6 was being seated.  Yay, CQ for having our table ready on time!  And yay friends for not being late! :0\n\nAfter being seated in a nice big corner table, we decided to order 3 appetizers for the table to share and went with the bar-b-cue shrimp, some sort of fried crawfish thing, and fried pickles. The bbq shrimp was definitely my fav of the 3.  I personally can live without fried pickles, but the other folks in our party seemed to really like them.  I am not normally a huge fan of crawfish, but this dish was really tasty.   Sadly, there were no oysters available for appetizers (although the waiter said they had a few in reserve for one of the entrees).  \n\nFor my entree, I went with the shrimp etouffee - one of my favorite dishes.  It was spot on!  David had the shrimp creole and I tasted a bite of it - it was very good as well but not as spicy as mine. (I like spicy!)   We ordered some desserts to share among the table and for some reason, ended up with 2 pieces of key lime pie and 1 of the tollhouse cookie something-or-another.  They were both good, but I wish someone at the table had ordered a bread pudding because theirs is delish! \n\nThis would have been a 5 star review, except for the fact that there were several issues with the service thorughout our meal.  Nothing egregious, but a series of little things (mostly a lack of attention to detail) that detracted from making this a 5 star experience.  \n\nBut, all-in-all, we had a great time and everyone enjoyed their meal.  So, with another Groupon waiting to be put to good use, we will definitely be going back again soon!", "business_id": "jTGQUWGIVvL-aY03C5BEmw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-01-13", "type": "review"}

It was awesome. The green tomatoes were not sour and it came with a sauce that made it tangy. This sauce also came with the fried crawfish and it complemented with it well.\n\nI ordered the Diane with all three (chicken, shrimp, and crawfish) my mother ordered the chicken, my father ordered the pork chop, and my brother followed with everyone's recommendation of the BBQ shrimp.\n\nThe Diane: absolutely to die for. It wasn't extremely spicy, the spice and kick came from the use of pepper and maybe a dash of cayenne pepper. But it was creamy, and with the mushrooms, chicken, crawfish, and shrimp it was amazing. I have to personally say that this was probably the best dish, or tied with the pork chop at least.\n\nThe chicken was probably the worse of the 4 dishes there, but on the bright side we did order the 3 good dishes. Next, the Pork Chop:\nThis was awesome as well. The flavor was just off the chain! It wasn't spicy, but that sauce they added to the pork chop had a tangy flavor and then it was sweet as well. The meat was also well cooked, juices just coming out of it. Delicious.\n\nThe last dish BBQ Shrimp:\nIf you're a spicy dish lover, this is the dish you should get. My father as well as brother found it pretty spicy (I did too), but whoa. The flavor on the shrimp as well as the rice was absolutely delicious (before the kick of the spiciness of course). It had a tangy sweet taste to it at first, then it just kicks back. \n\nParking was kinda crappy, but it goes well with the environment and ambiance of the restaurant. A house/restaurant gives it a homey feel, as well as a high class dining experience. But, parking and getting out of that parking lot is a pain. *Note, there is an exit/entrance at the back of the parking lot as well as the front to 7th street.* (But I would recommend to enter from 7th street)\n\nI hope I have stirred your taste buds in trying something new and unique from Charlotte.

It was supposed to be a mens night for the men and a ladies night for the ladies, but before we could go our separate ways the men realized they loved the ladies and the ladies too loved their men and so all together we decided not to deny ourselves the company of the other sex. Unanimously, we wanted Cajun Queen.\nWe were all already lit up from our daylight binging, so by the time we stumbled in we were ready for a good time. A milk-skinned hostess in a golf-green blazer and a white and peach paisley blouse batted at us with hazel eyes beneath a mop of perfectly tussled and pasted curls. \"We have eight,\" I said. She glowered. Before she could reply, I little-white-lied her: \"We called ahead... they told us to come right now.\"  \nGreen blazer took off to see what she could manage; we loitered in the foyer, teetering drunk, glazed eyes reeling under the light of the antique chandelier. Green blazer came back and told us it'd be a bit of wait and recommended we hit the upstairs bar. We were already halfway up the steps. \nCajun Queen is one of those big old Elizabeth houses, southern gothic, eclectically arranged and echoing blindly with voices from some other era. It's a chatterbox of ancient heritage and white-hot with flickering, inconsistent lights that make you want to trim your mustache pencil thin and drink only from a snifter. Aroma suffused our consciousness and we all just became mindless, visceral things.\nAt the upstairs bar, this long swan of a bartendress was commanding the room, elegantly and fluidly fetching glasses from the overhead rack, snatching mixers from the under-counter cooler, upturning bottles and dispensing drafts, all motions in succession, all so swift and natural, like something perfectly choreographed and rehearsed. She doled out a trayful of Olde Meck Coppers and we set ourselves to achieving the night.\nWe were led to a corner table near the glassed wall of the little balcony at the back. I took a chair at the end, sat, leaned back, and rapped my knuckles against the abrasive texture of the mud-red stucco. Our very knowledgeable, upright waiter prattled off a series of specials and toppings of the day with juicy detail, but I all heard was 'something unbelievably amazing' followed by 'something else equally amazing'. I requested a couple batches of fried oysters for the table, and then we went in rounds, ordering our blackened catfishes and our crawfish etouffees and our obscene platters of shrimp and fish and sausage and delight.\nWithout needing to ask, our upright waiter returned with another round of beers and a handful of waters. \"Good man,\" I said with an acknowledging nod. Huxley was sitting at the opposite end of the table. We had subconsciously retained the man-woman divide throughout the evening. I looked her way until she felt my gaze and when she glanced back I shot her a clever wink. She smiled. I swooned. \nOur food arrived and we all collectively lost our minds. Remoulade-dipped oysters, creamy clumps of spicy rice, mouth-searing fish and peppery shrimp, beer and wine, more wine, and life and love and faces flush and hearts racing. We ate ourselves full, but couldn't stop. Flavors were assaulting us in such unmitigable ways, we were powerless to refuse their beckoning call of mouth-flaming, heart-swelling, eye-watering release. Ryan, at one point, shoved his seat back, sat up straight with hands on thighs, neck rigid like a scout-dog, let out a billowing exhale, momentarily composed himself, then jumped back in for another oyster and few more forkfuls of rice. \nAt the table behind us, a prim blond let out a squelch of a cry, half-stood, leaned forward, grabbed her man behind his fuzzy dark ears, and kissed him hard on the mouth. She held that embrace for some time, and all the lights and sounds in the room imploded in upon them. When her lips broke free from his, all the noise and clarity rushed back upon us in a crash. She sat down and knuckled a tear from her eye.\n I clapped my hands and beamed across the room. \"This is the greatest night ever!\" I shouted out to the dining area. \nKathryn, a steadying force in our group, narrowed one eye and nodded at me placatively. \"You really enjoy the hyperbole, don't you?\"\n\"Get up for it, Kathryn!\" I threw my hands wildly about in the air above me. \"If it isn't the greatest night... then tell yourself it is, believe it, and make everyone else believe it too! Then it really will be!\"\nThe prim blond and her man giggled, and a few tables around us applauded. I ceremoniously forked the last fried oyster from our appetizer tray, held it high like a chalice, like a triumph, angled my neck, opened my jaw wide, and brought it down mightily into my mouth.\nKathryn looked around, a touch embarrassed, and then began furiously laughing. \"Oh, I believe it,\" she said. \"I believe it.\"", "business_id": "jTGQUWGIVvL-aY03C5BEmw", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-02-13", "type": "review"}

Next time I'll be clearer- alcohol now!\n\nThey have a great drink selection, including creatively-named specialty cocktails. I was tempted to order the \"Seventh Street Stumbler\" and see if it held up to it's name, but in the end, a glass (um, or three) of white wine went well with my dinner.\n\nThe food was out of this world!

For entrees, I had the blackened salmon special with crawfish and artichokes, and my friends had the catfish, the chicken Diane, and the shrimp and grits, and we were all so busy making yummy noises no one could talk.

I treated my sister to  a birthday dinner and despite our online reservation, we were asked to leave in  the most demeaning of ways. I have a debilitating childhood disease and use a wheelchair on occasion ; tonight was one such occasion. I could only order food I knew didn't require cutting, so I opted for potatoes and a salad. My sister ordered a full meal with wine. I had two mixed drinks (so we're not cheap diners). We had to signal for another glass of wine for my sister, despite seeing the party next to us being served appropriately. \n\nI'm not sure why we were overlooked but I'm left to wonder if it's the small portion I ordered that was disparaging.\n\nAnyway, when my sister went to look upstairs a minute to reminisce, our server asked my sister quite off the cuff, \"Do you want help with 'her' (wheel)chair? I kinda need that table.\"\n\nTaken aback, my sister said, \"No.\" \n\nWe took note of the EMPTY tables on BOTH sides of us and the fact that the restaurant wasn't crazy busy as we remembered. \n\nI spent $67 on a tab for two  and left a TIP of $20--clearly more than twenty percent.\n\nI don't know many people who tip as graciously as I  do. My reasoning for leaving the tip despite the service, was it being Christmas time and it's something I do for goodwill.\n\nWhen we rolled to the handicap ramp, it was completely (I mean, completely) blocked off by an A-frame sign about parking; see for yourself. Had  my sister not been with me, I would have not been able to access the restaurant at all.\n\nI haven't  always been disabled and ran a restaurant, myself (loved every minute of it). I know how people can take advantage (campers) and I know people can be uber-cheap at tipping. I don't fall into  either ilk. I know good service when I see it; I know how to approach diners who overstay their 'welcome (their can NEVER be anyone who overstay their welcome; consider it flattery); it's part of doing business and keeping patrons happy.  Take a loss here and there. \n\nWe were in and HOME in a little over two hours. The couple beside us with the adorable little girl who  laid all over the booth was fine by me; she's a child and CQ is a noisy place. \n\nI felt a sting of angst when I asked for my food to be wrapped. The facial gestures were quite unsettling.\n\nPlease don't tell me I'm sensitive: I've had over FORTY surgeries--TWO with NO painkillers afterwards. I've walked on a BROKEN leg to buy wrapping paper tape been accosted because I wasn't 'messed up' \"enough'\" to ''deserve a handicap tag. \n\nSo enough ---but there's  no excuse for inhospitably between diner and those needing  to use the facilities.''PLeASe let these be a isolated parents.'\n\nPLEASE LEAVE :)", "business_id": "jTGQUWGIVvL-aY03C5BEmw", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-12-13", "type": "review"}

Two guys ordered some bread pudding for dessert and I tried some and it was awesome.\n\nAs for the music, they would play a few songs and then take a break so we could have conversations if we wanted. We had some Portuguese guys with us and someone asked them to play some Portuguese songs which apparently they did. You could tell the guy on the keyboards knew what he was doing and seemed to enter another world when he started playing.

Its not that expensive to get in, either. I guess you can kinda say I'm a regular... its the only club that I have fun at and the crowd is never rude - drunk of course especially on free draft beer night but never rude in my opinion. hahah  Its a nicely sized place. I've had waaay too much fun at this club!! They have three bars in total (one in the main room right by the big dance floor), one in 'Divas', and another upstairs when they have that open. If you wanna get some air they have a nice outside patio too.\n\nLately I do have to say that the drag shows that I have seen have been kiiiinda boring to be honest but that's not what I normally go there for unless they have special guests.  Reading the comments I realize people are all like 'this place is shady' and, yeah, kinda is but I don't expect something fancy unless its downtown. *lol*\nThe only thing I don't like is the creepy straight dudes that show up and lurk around, especially on Fridays. They really don't take a hint. But that's with every club in my experience, sadly. xD And in my opinion Scorpio is kinda more-so for the guys. I'm a queer female and I find it hard to spot the girls who aren't just their for their gay bf. I've gone on every day they are open but Saturday - my friends say the crowd can be kinda ghetto.\n\nHouse liquor is free on Sundays, free draft beer on Wednesday. Other specials are normally only 3 bucks which is good in my book!  I read on another review that the drinks were weak but like every bar if you tip them well your bartender will treat your right.

My roommate suggested we get there early to avoid lines and having a decent viewing spot for the entertainers. The first hour and half was really dead, like maybe only 10 other patrons. We took a tour- 2 rooms with dance floors and bars, and a pretty decent outdoor patio. The outdoor patio is almost reserved for smokers and the cloud gets pretty thick.. I'm not a smoker, so.. yuck! Lol. Beware when you first get admitted you get patted down.. and it's more like getting felt up then patted down, not a particularly enjoyable experience. Forget what the cover charge was, but as someone else mentioned that for all the money they are making they sure as hell aren't putting it back into the business.. it's in dire need of an interior decorating update. Around 10-11pm it suddenly goes from empty to packed to a line into the parking lot. The area around the club is kinda sketchy and for those of you not from the south, you may become a little frightened by the exterior: gravel parking lot, porch, etc. Looks like something out of a bad movie. Drinks: prices are steep and alcohol content is weak.. if you like to drink, I'd recommend pregaming or expect the consequences. I went on a Saturday night, dress to impress.. people were thugged out.. if I knew to expect that, I wouldn't have put so much thought into my outfit and just put some gear on. One guy was literally in his boxers. Crowd was pretty young, was expecting a better mixture. Heard the N-word more times than I wanted to, at least one fight broke out, I was discouraged by the disproportionate representation of the staff- All white southerners, no diversity. Apparently this place has been around forever though which is pretty cool.. not sure if its gay owned or operated now but when it first opened in 1974 it wasn't. Music was pretty good. I'd go back again and try another night.. was a bit disappointed by lack of diversity /segregation in crowd.. I'm a Yankee so my experience was a bit backwards like stepping back in time.

Located in an 'unassuming' converted house on Tuskegee Road, the Milestone seems like the last place for an authentically divey music venue, but wonders never cease.  I was asked for an ID by a surprisingly friendly cashier and the love affair with this place started from there.  Its cold, covered in graffiti and bumper stickers, and dilapidated but I can assure that this music venue does not have an ounce of production gloss of more established venues in Charlotte.  I've rarely been to a music venue in Charlotte without feeling that the scene was concocted, often with light shows and 'vintage' d\u00e9cor.  Not so with the Milestone. The 'stage', if you can rightfully call it a stage, is a step up from the floor.  The sound system is slightly shot and I do believe there were holes in the floor, but this place did not lack ambience.  \n\nI enjoyed 3 hours of ear-splitting punk rock with a much younger and infinitely cooler clientele of the Milestone.  Fortunately I came with a hipster friend who lent me some cool points. Most of the bands were not signed and some were clearly novices, but the raw energy of the fans more than compensated for this.

I'm thrilled if I can pull a beer not slapped with a \"Lite\" label; or when I ask for a stout the waitress has something other than Guinness to provide. I crave diversity of lagers and ales like a foodie craves weirdly named cheeses. I'm pretty sure, in fact, that the Saucer was created for people exactly like me.\n\nWalking into the door I instantly get the same feeling of the hole-in-the-wall pubs I frequented back in college - just much larger. And cleaner! Almost every surface not walkable in the building is covered in decorative dishes so dense that your grandma's cabinet just shed a tear. It's cluttered but not oppressive, and again, it always feels clean and comfortable. There's a couched section up front for those really lazy days; elevated booths on the wall for small parties; and a lot of tables for any size group you can organize. And then there's the bar...\n\nBellying up to the bar at the Saucer is easy - it's roughly 50 feet long. From this bastion of beervana, you can see the real reason you came here - the jaw-dropping wall of tap heads and stuffed bottle coolers. It's a selection so big that trying to pick by looking is almost a fool's errand - you could easily down a pint just while trying to weigh the options. Thankfully, they have a well-organized (and four-page dense) beer menu that will help you find just the draft or bottle you're looking for. I want to give some kind of feeling for what you'll find here, but the simple answer is - everything. I've had everything from double IPAs aged in oak barrels to blueberry wheat beer to a savory coffee milk stout. Any style you could ever want, well, it's here. It's impressive. It's a little terrifying. It's very, very delicious. There are $3 fire sale specials every night of the week as well. Saturday's \"Beer Poker\" is my favorite - a random bottle from their cooler for three bucks. I've scored a few Victory and Rogue bottles there, so it is definitely not just the leftovers. \n\nAs for the food, well... It's decent. Let's be fair, I'm not coming here for their burgers. Food at the saucer is a means to an end; the food is here so you can cleanse your pallet between brews. That being said, there are a few musts on the menu. For a snack, you cannot beat the soft pretzels. You get two, they're huge, warm, salty and soft - if you're on a date and you don't get this, don't expect a second date. The brats are decent, the burgers have flavor, and oh yeah - spicy cheesy pepper tater tots. You'll find something. \n\nI guess the last thing worth mentioning is the service. A place with this diverse a beer selection could rest on its laurels, but the Saucer follows through with an excellent staff. Beyond the fact that your waitresses are gorgeous smiling Beer Goddesses wearing short short skirts and knee-hi stockings... They're genuinely nice and know what they've got on the menu. Talking with them is talking with peers. They check in on the table frequently and always have a good recommendation on what beer is next. A few of them pay attention enough to recognize me and remember what I had on the last visit. Coming to the saucer is like hanging out with friends.\n\nOne last word of advice - if you're serious about your beer exploration, sign up for the UFO club. For $18 you get a commemorative t-shirt and a membership which clears you from (very infrequent) cover charges and lets you track the beers you have on each visit. Drink 200 different beers and you get your name in the ring of honor, a commemorative plate on the wall, and a $100 tab for a party for you and your friends. There's a reward every 50 - I just earned a free pint - and you get the benefit of trying a ridiculously wide selection of beers and learning more about what the craft has to offer. You will find new favorites and probably a few that you can't stand. But that's the point of the journey, now, isn't it?\n\nSo bottoms up, there's a lot to drink.

This is the best beer  brewery/tastery/deliciousry/savory place in all of Charlotte.  Well, at least I think so.  I just wish it was a little closer to Uptown (where I roam).  It is located up near UNC-Charlotte where I dont think the college youth truly respect good beer.  They are drinking the natty ice and PBRs of the world while this place serves over 300 better options.  Just sad.\n\nSeriously, when you walk in to this place you are figuratively smacked in the face with originality.  They do it all their way and you either love it or you don't.  I became a UFO member in about ummmmm 3 mins and 32 seconds.  $18 and you get a free Tshirt, membership card, and free brunch every Sunday 12pm-3pm for the rest of your life.  The brunch alone is worth it.  I went for beer on a Saturday and came back for brunch the next day.  The other perks are listed on the website and take a little time to accomplish.. Like try 200 different beers and get a $100 tab and your name forever enshrined on a plate on the wall.  I'm going for it!! \n\nDon't care about joining the BeerKnurd club... Thats cool too.  Just go on in and try the pretzel.. Let me rephrase that... YOU HAVE TO TRY THE PRETZEL.. I grew up in the Philadelphia area and we are used to brick pretzels.  Though the sad thing is that we like them.  Here, you get two huge... soft... fluffy.. wonderful pretzels.  How can someone be so excited about a pretzel, you ask??  Just trust me and order it.

Like chewy nothing and fried batter that squished when you chewed it.  The cole slaw?  Like crunchy nothing and mayonnaise.  \n\nEven the cocktail sauce was bad.\n\nDo I deserve this?

It tasted something like chlorine/really old water that has been sitting in a dirty sink for a long time. It was terrible. After kindly explaining this to my waitress she again was not very professional. She was like oh okay. And took it from us. She offered free desert which we did not want because everything else was terrible. I asked if they tried the butter in the kitchen and she said \"oh no...we won't try it\" which makes me wonder how many other poor folks had to taste it that evening! We will NOT be back for dinner. The only reason I would go back is to sit at the bar on the back deck and have a drink. This place has so much potential! The wrong people are running it.

Roast beef sandwich that was basically 3 or 4 pieces of processed store bought roast beef on a roll with cheese and grilled onions and peppers (clearly frozen prior to grilling).

Once seated our waitress served us our drinks in styrofoam cups, all of her tables were served like this, at the end of our meal we found out it was so she could just hand us a lid and let us take it with us.

The steak was under cooked and I ordered medium rare. The ketchup on the table had started fermenting because they continue to refill the glass bottles and I'm assuming they never throw them away, how about taking a bite of that on a romantic night out. My boyfriend ordered crunchy peanut butter chicken sand which thinking it was a batter of sorts, but no he was literally served an open face grilled chicken sandwich with a scoop of crunchy peanut butter sitting in the center, now this is printed on the menu we checked afterward but why on earth would you serve that on a menu. When he questioned it he was offered another selection but said no since it took so long to cook to begin with, even though he did not eat it we were still charged full price for the meal.

I guess I could think of a few things.\n\nI went there today for the first time and was dazzled by the charm it flaunted, while still maintaining the gritty edge of a backwoods Wisconsin eatery.  Let's not get it twisted folks, we're not breaking gastronomic ground here.  What we are breaking are your misconceptions of what a restaurant can be whose parking lot is largely composed of Chevy and Dodge trucks, and whose front, snow-covered, lawn is full of snowmobiles.  Deal with it kids, this is that slice of Midwest Americana you've been looking for in any number of wayside eateries in rural America.  Fish fry anyone?\n\nTo begin, let me explain that one of the many draws for the Beach House's patrons is the fact that it is still legal to smoke indoors in McFarland.  I stepped inside and was immediately made aware of this fact as plumes of smoke took up residence in my clothes and nose.  \n\nDo not fear, however, there is a separate dining room that is nonsmoking.  And man was this separate dining room packed (Superbowl Sunday).  Packed with large women squeezing into convention center chairs.  Packed with waitresses who wore skin tight white Jordache jeans, giving you a fleeting sense of their giving nature.  Packed with the eager anticipation of an entire day spent watching football and football-related activities: drooling, eating, drinking, and smoking.  God bless America.\n\nThe AM dish to get here is the Walleye and eggs breakfast.  I would tend to agree, although their limited selection of omelets is made marginally more tasty by the addition of broccoli (you heard me punk).  As breakfast wore on, the dining room filled, emptied, and filled again; the waitstaff eagerly setting new places, removing paper place settings, calling people darlin' and hon'(always appreciated).\n\nSo give it to me hard backwoods Wisconsin.  Give me every sinew of your being: your ice fishing, snowmobiling, smoking, bloody Mary drinking, being.  Just be.  And give me a friggin' huge piece of deep fried walleye to help me digest the spectacle, with scrambled eggs on the side.

Absolutely terrible. Scrambled eggs: those are difficult to screw-up... mine were runny and far too under cooked. Bacon: how can someone screw-up bacon???

Once you've been there a few times, everyone who works there begins to recognize you and seems glad to see you. They have a small menu of yummy fried items (Spudsters!), great burgers and sandwiches, and daily specials (love the French Dip on Wednesdays). All the food is cooked right behind the bar, and they keep their cooking equipment impeccably clean. They make good drinks and have a small but respectable selection of draft beers that meet the needs of both craft beer lovers and Miller Lite-types. Bartenders are not afraid to do a shot of whiskey with you, and many of the regular patrons will buy you a drink if you chat with them. \n\nThe Green is owned by two brothers who are almost always there, cooking or bartending. The place is closed on Sundays, and rarely stays open past midnight - it's just not that sort of bar. Go across the street to Hody for late-night drinking. Any other time though, I promise you'll find the company much more enjoyable at Village Green.", "business_id": "G1qUGBNYNS220jKlPAlFsA", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-01-12", "type": "review"}

To some, it may make you want to go back to the island...atleast food is fresh.\n\nWe arrived 10 mins after the 4 other people of our party, after 20 more minutes the waiter came back to see what we wanted to drink.  Forgot to note, for a Friday night at 7:30 the place was pretty much empty in the dining area.\n\nI ordered a diet pepsi and the others ordered random alcoholic drinks.  My soda was flat, watery and had some kind of scum on top of it.  I thought I may be crazy, so everyone at the table tried the soda and agreed it was disgusting.

Asked for a glass from the bar w diet pepsi.  It seemed a little less flat, but not by much.  Atleast that glass was clean.\nFriend ordered the hog heaven, bloody mary with bacon infused vodka.  He said it wasnt the worst drink, but mainly tasted like greasy bacon fat, not a smokey bacon flavor.  Didnt try it myself.\n\nAfter the soda ordeal, it had been 20 mins since we arrived I ordered some Moo-skis as an appetizer, which are listed as hashbrowns covered in bacon, onion, and cheese from what i remember.\n20 mins after that waiter came back to take our order.  I gave him my order of all you can eat fish and asked about the appetizer.  He said \"oh ya, forgot about those, theyll be right up.\"\n5 or 6 minutes later, he came back to check our drink status, and said \"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaand.....you had moo-skis.....theyll be here soon.\"\n5 or 6 mins later again he brought out the moo-skis.\n\nThey were hashbrowns on a small side plate with a small layer of shredded mozza on top.  Very plain and greasy tasting.  Realized there should be bacon and onion...which i found tiiiiny few far between pieces inside hash later.  For the 3 or 4 dollars, would have been better used for just plain hashbrowns at a diner for a dollar.\n\nFinally get the all you can eat fish which had 2 pieces of pollock, beer battered fries, tartar, and coleslaw:\nFish: ok sized. breading was hard(which i like), taste ok. Not worst Ive had, but no where near good.\nFries: Were best part of the meal.\nTartar: Different, paprika or something in it for a red color.  didnt taste any dill.\nColeslaw:  Im not sure you could even call this slaw.  It was literally a small cup of mayo, with maybe 2 tiny forks of cabbage.  Im not exaggerating that it was a little liquidy...it was literally SOUP.\n\nOrdered a 2nd piece of fish which I got 5 mins later w more tartar.\n\nWe were still eating and I ordered a 3rd piece of fish.\nHe came back with our checks after 10 mins.  We laughed that the forgetting of the fish was on par w our night.  2 friends paid seperate and we had 2 parties of 2.  Super simple orders, but he ended up bringing the bills up wrong 3 times so we had to continue to correct.  Had to take our payments one at a time which added another 10 mins.\n\nFinishing up our bills........and kitchen staff brings me the last piece of fish about 30 mins after ordering it and when we were getting up.\n\nMaybe it was a one time bad experience, but considering how dead it was on a friday night....Im guessing our experience is pretty representative of the food/wait staff which is a shame since the place really has a nice flair or feel inside it.\n\nThe best part of the experience was the upbeat classic 80s music.\n\nWe  all received buy one get one coupons upon leaving.  Not sure if it was just us or everyone gets them.\n\n30 mins after getting home, I spent lots of time in the bathroom as it all came rushing out the bottom pipes.  I have an iron stomach and don't get messed up by much.\n\ngirlfriend edit:  Reminded me she didnt get the salad she ordered and had to ask.

Alas, the fish is unreal and the beer selection rivals many (if not most) of Madison's finest.\n\nDetailed Review:\nThe Fish Fry Fanatics stumbled into Dexter's Pub this past Friday and decided to give their fish fry a shot.  The menu selection is vast - we counted at least 6 or 7 solid fish fry options, from shrimp to Lake Perch to Walleye.  \n\nWe put our name in for a table, and were told it would be a 35-40 minute wait, so we ordered some of our customary Old Fashioneds.  We were pleasantly surprised to find that the bartenders muddle their Old Fashioneds, but were disappointed by the inclusion of a huge chunk of orange.  I'm sorry to say, but a Whiskey Old Fashioned Sour should *not* include half-of-an-orange as garnish.  \n\nRegardless, the Old Fashioned was solid - very good, actually.  So much so that when we ordered a second round and requested they drop the orange, it wasn't a problem.  Dexter's recovered nicely, and as luck would have it, our table became available soon after we grabbed round 2 of drinks. \n\nWe immediately ordered cheese curds, salad, and soup.  I went with the vegetable garden soup; others at the table went with chili and salad.  The soup and salads arrived within seconds; the soup was good - not great, but good - and it could've been a little warmer.  I'm told the chili was good as well - not life altering, but good.\n\nThe waiter came back to take our dinner order: two orders of beer battered cod, an order of lake perch, and an order of shrimp.  He said he'd be back in 10 minutes with our fish.  \n\nNearly an hour later, we flagged down a waitress for: refills on our drinks, and to inquire about our curds and fish.  She apologized profusely... curds came out a few minutes later - apparently they forgot about us.  The only benefit to being forgotten was that we had plenty of time to read the beer menu, which features a nice selection of craft beers from microbreweries - Dexter's doesn't strike me as a place that would feature such a wide selection of unique beers, but I guess it goes to prove that you can never judge a book by its cover.  \n\nCurds were excellent - not your typical \"from the bag\" curds, which was a nice surprise.  They were breaded and featured a mild white cheese; they were cooked perfectly.\n\nFish arrived within minutes, and it was well worth the wait.  The cod was phenomenal.  Three huge pieces with a mound of fries - now that's what we're talkin' about.  The batter was light, crisp, and flavorful.  The fish was thick, meaty, and perfectly flavored.  I loved every single bite of it.\n\nI also sampled the Lake Perch and shrimp - both of which were excellent as well.  Huge props to Dexter's for their fish fry - it's definitely a top-10 offering.\n\nIn the end, they also made things good as the waiter comp'ed us our drinks and curds, so we got out of there for under $40.  We tipped well and called it a night.  I'd definitely go back to Dexter's - sure, they dropped the ball, but they did an honorable thing and made everything right by us.  Thanks, Dexter's!!\n\nDexter's = WIN\n\nFood = 4.5 stars (excellent fish; curds and fries were stellar)\nService = 2 stars (they forgot about us, but made up for it)\nValue = 2 stars (would've been over $85 for the 4 of us)\nMisc = 3 stars (the place isn't much to look at, but has an excellent beer selection...)\n\nOh - also, parking is hard to come by, so be prepared to park on the street and/or walk a bit to get there.", "business_id": "HTplzElel_F_U_qhWuDKdg", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-01-22", "type": "review"}

However, when we went back a month or so later, we had a horrible experience.  We had to wait nearly 45 minutes for our food and then when we got it- it was terrible.  My boyfriend had the garlic chili fries and they arrived not only COLD, but DOUSED in disgusting grease- they were inedible.  We mentioned it to the waitress and she offered to bring a new order, but it turned out the new order was just as terrible as the first one.  I had the roast beef sandwich and it was horrible- very dry and bland.  To her credit, the waitress did give us free cupcakes to take home to make up for the horrible food (although it turned out the cupcakes were also inedible and terrible).  \n\nWe hoped this was just an unusually busy night and not the norm, and because the fish fry is so good, we went back again tonight, hoping for a better experience.  We were wrong!  We went around 7 and waited 15 min or so for a table.  Once we were seated we placed our order right away with the waiter, since we already knew what we wanted.  An hour later, we were still waiting for our food.  All we ordered was the fish and waffle fries- so nothing complicated- and on such a busy night, you'd think they'd be making sure to keep batches of fish and fries going steadily into the fryer.  When we finally got our food, it was the tasty fish we'd remembered from before, but by that time, we were so tired and crabby from having to wait for so long, it wasn't quite so enjoyable.  After our meal, we had to wait quite a long time for the waiter to bring the check, and then he didn't come back to pick it up for a good 15 minutes.  We would still go back to Dexter's just for drinks, but I don't think we'll be going there to eat the food anymore.  Two terrible experiences with inexcusably long waits is enough to keep us from going back for dinner.  It's too bad because the fish is good, but not good enough to justify the SLOW service.\n\nEdit: Turns out the fish wasn't so good- ended up being up all night with food poisoning.

I like it so much, I've been hesitant to even write this review.  Nonetheless, Dexter's does it right.\n\nFresh, Bering sea cod enveloped in a crispy, salty batter keeps me dreaming of Fridays.  The clam chowder is phenomenal and so are the rest of their soups...obviously lovingly tended to and cooked from homemade stocks.  I could further pontificate, but no need...the execution in the kitchen is stellar.  \n\nNow, the beer list is exquisite in my opinion.  I love Madison, but many bars get so caught up on local-centric taps lists.  Consequently, more often than not, you walk in to see the taps jammed with Ale Ayslum, Lake Louie and Capital.  Not bad...but I'll be damned to say I could choke down another Hopalicious.  Dexters, on the other hand, opens their taps up to pretty much anything.  From Toppling Goliath (which I love, but you can't really get outside of Iowa and Wisco) to Belgian Flander's Reds, they kill it with their beer selection.  Also, I really respect that they let you know on the beer list what's on deck...this has kept me coming back many-a-times.  \n\nSo why not the 5-stars?  Well, we've run into some seriously long waits, both for a table and then for the fish.  If they could streamline a little more in the kitchen, I'd gladly give it that extra star.  In the mean time, we NEVER come here on Fridays after 6pm....forget it.

Said it in a kind of a friendly fyi context and it was not well received.   The meal came, fries were cold, portion was light, and we got no au jus.  After having to ask for some, to overpower the weak roll, we ate the rest of the meal.

Boo. When it finally arrived, the three pieces of heavily-battered European block cod were far too watery. According to my fisherman friend (he's a professional fisherman who fishes for Alaskan salmon, cod, and sable fish), the cod they serve here is a pressed-combination of cod loin and belly. It fell apart as we cut into the pieces, and was difficult to eat, other than to scoop it with a fork. At least it was served piping hot, and the batter had a decent seasoning. But the fish itself wasn't exciting at all.\n\n- The fries. Cold. Lifeless. \n\nI love dive bars, a lot. But Villa won't be on my list of places to return. I'm still stunned that it took 3+ hours to get any food, and that the service was so terrible.

The place was busy, there seemed to be a short wait for tables. Luckily two people had just gotten up from the bar so we were able to snag 2 bar seats without waiting. And boy, were we lucky, because the bartenders here are FANTASTIC. Incredibly knowledgeable and engaging, they make great traditional Brandy Old Fashioneds. They also have some of their own infusions that they do, like a honey chai infused bourbon (also great as the base of an old fashioned). \n\nThe food came out relatively quickly. It is a pretty standard fish fry menu. You can have either Cod or Walleye, breaded or fried. I had the fried cod, and it was definitely worth the trip to the near east side. Light, not overpowering batter, and thick pieces of cod. Fries were pretty standard, but the house-made cole slaw was a nice touch as well. \n\nAll in all, classic Wisconsin Fish Fry experience. Really cool little place, great staff, good food, and great drinks. They also told me they are opening a Speakeasy right next door, which is really exciting. They do a lot of their own infusions so I can't wait to see what drinks they come up with for this new venture. \n\nNot quite sure it was good enough to unseat Quivey's Grove at the \"Tip Top\" of my fish fry list, but it came darn close (horrible joke free of charge).", "business_id": "JJFoeKZXgi2_LeECDMkkoQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-02-10", "type": "review"}

The tap beer menu is impressive with local beers. I was surprised to see a local new release at $4 for a pint. I ordered the cod baked and my husband had cod deep fried. I ordered baked potato \"loaded\" and hubby french fries. So while we enjoyed our beer the place filled all tables within 15 minutes. The interior has been completely redecorated in a very comfortable art deco. I love it! I think there were 9 tables (could be separated into a couple more) along with window and bar seating. The baked cod is the BEST I have ever had,generous portion tender and flaky, the house made coleslaw and tartar sauce were perfect. My loaded baked potato had crispy smoked bacon, melted cheese and parsley-so good! The fries were perfect wedges.

At first I thought it was just sarcastic \"Soup Nazi\" humor, but soon realized that the prevalent hostile attitude there is genuine and that it trickles down from management to employees, customers, and even performers.  I've seen bar managers there either berate customers directly or berate the bartenders who then have to try very hard not to pass that negativity on to customers.\n\nAlso, it's downright embarrassing to be an audience member there when the bar mistreats the band.  I once saw a Harmony bar manager preempt an encore performance by turning on the overhead lights, jumping up on the stage, and literally grabbing the mike from a performer to announce that the show's over and that everybody has to finish their drinks and leave.  I was floored.  It was the first time I'd ever seen anyone kick a band off the stage just because they wanted to close their bar early.  \n\nThe kitchen staff works hard, and the food is decent.  Unfortunately, this is the only bar I've ever been to in Madison where I've been asked to pay for my dinner tab up front.  (There are lots of other bars that also don't take credit cards, but they still let you run a tab.) It made me wonder if they didn't trust me to close out my tab or if they were hoping my tip would be better prior to experiencing their poor service.\n\nIn short, even on occasions when they book national acts, it's not worth going there if you're going to encounter hostility when you want something from the bar.  There are too many other fun places to go in Madison for anyone to have to put up with the miserable buzz killing atmosphere that prevails at The \"Harmony\".", "business_id": "KHOHjA8HOcTlFBCtMQFv8A", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-12-01", "type": "review"}

Decent service, mediocre food, fairly pricey for average bar food.\n\nDetailed review:\n\nAfter taking a small fish fry break, we resumed our quest to find the best fish fry in southern Wisconsin. With the roads in poor shape thanks to the recent snow, we decided to focus our sights on local offerings, and since Tully's is \"around the corner\" from our friend's house, we decided to give it a try.\n\nWe walked in and seated ourselves; we chose a small table that was located in a section \"in front\" of the bar area and adjacent to the pool tables. The salad bar and another small dining area are located on \"the other side\" of the pool table room... Odd layout for certain.\n\nOur waitress took our drink orders and we browsed the menu, which included your typical bar fare: lots of fried appetizers, burgers, sandwiches, and so on. I'll say this - there are a ton of items on the menu; even the Friday night fish fry offered 7 varieties of fish, 4 of which are all you can eat.\n\nOur drinks arrived and we placed our orders: AYCE baked cod with a baked potato, AYCE beer battered cod with cheesy hash browns, and AYCE lake perch with hash browns.\n\nWe were informed that our meals also included a salad bar trip... Too bad we had already ordered cheese curds. \n\nBut, being the troopers we are, we ventured over to the salad bar and built a few plates. It was ok for a bar's salad, but not great by any means. My tomatoes were mushy and tasted \"off\"; broccoli was dry and obviously came from a bag. Coleslaw earned decent reviews.\n\nCurds and fish arrived at the same time. Curds were breaded and typical \"from the freezer bag\" variety. Nothing special, and not worth the $6.79 price tag.\n\nFish plates each had two pieces; baked cod was drenched in buttery water and loaded with dill flake. Hmm... It tasted ok, but wasn't as flaky, tender, or flavorful as I'd prefer. Baked potato was foil-wrapped, and nicely cooked.  \n\nBattered cod had a decent batter that had just a hint of a unique flavor (we couldn't put our finger on it, as it was tasty), but it was fairly greasy and like the baked cod, the actual fish was quite \"lifeless.\"  The cheesy hash browns were good- nice and crispy, with only a hint of grease.\n\nBattered lake perch was just like the cod, only it was more greasy. I shed a small tear as grease oozed out of the piece I tried.\n\nThe bill arrived... $55 for three with one round of beers. Yikes.\n\nTully's = fail.\n\nService = 4 stars (good, prompt, fun)\nFood = 2 stars (based on fish only)\nValue = 2 stars\nMisc = 2 stars (not real exciting)\n\nI'd come here to drink some Miller Lites and to munch on some bar food during a game, but I'd skip the fish fry.", "business_id": "kOXJrbuB1a1Na6sf_WQnDg", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-12-13", "type": "review"}

Do delivery rather than take out.  Delivery is actually relatively good on campus.  Take-out is a nightmare late night due to the fact Geo's seconds as a bar in addition to all the other drunkards that come in off of Green Street .\n- Ask for extra crispy.

The Champaign Olive Garden has declined significantly within the last year.  I believe this is due to a change in management, but I am not 100% certain.  My last meal there was in November and the standards were that of poorly-run fastfood restaurant.  This is what I wrote about it at the time:\n\n\"Remember how Olive Garden used to be a 'nice' place to have a casual meal?  Even though it was a chain restaurant and you knew most of the food was heated up in a microwave, it looked like real food and it almost tasted like it had been cooked.  It seemed a little nicer than your T.G.I. Fridays and your Applebee's.  Well, it's not like that anymore.  Not the one in C-U anyway.  I don't think I will be going back there ever again.  \n\n The first thing I noticed when I walked in was that the entire place reeked like a sour towel.  Someone had obviously wiped all of the tables down with a cheap disinfectant solution that had gotten a bit... ripe.  It was disgusting.  \n\nI proceeded to the bathroom to wash my hands before my meal where I found two employees lounging about and chatting while pretending to clean the restroom.  Since they did not find it prudent to tone down their conversation whilst a guest was in their presence, I got to enjoy a pre-dinner melodrama.  Apparently an employee of the Olive Garden is trying to file a sexual harassment suit and the management had been asking both ladies if they had experienced any inappropriate behavior.  And while the accused sometimes gets a \"wild hair up their ass\" they did not consider themselves harassed.  Speaking of sex, Manuel looked FINE this morning and when he came into work they were like \"oh my GOD!\"  \n\nWhen I got back to my seat, our waiter (who I admit was nice and attentive) served us a sample of white zinfandel that had the distinct vinegary taste of a wine that has been left uncorked for too long.  The food, which tasted decent, no longer looks, tastes or feels like real food.  Both the dinner and dessert had an artificiality to it that resembled an expensive TV dinner.  The textures were waxy and the cheese was lardlike.  While the flavors were bold, they tasted man-made and had a processed mouth-feel.  It was to real food what Velveeta is to real cheese.  The dessert, the chocolate torte, especially had the look of something that had just been plopped out of it's microwavable container.   The vanilla sauce was practically flavorless and the torte was only heated halfway, resulting in a jello-pudding like consistency to the fudge filling.  It is also made with artificial sugar now, which adds to its alien flavor and texture.  In truth, the food quality is comparable to a fast food restaurant.  The only difference is that they offer more variety and a few more low quality ingredients per dish.\n\nI know it's just Olive Garden.  I know it's an evil chain restaurant and a glorified McDonalds.  I guess the thing is that it didn't used to be this way.  I think I've heard that they are under new management.  It used to be satisfying in a guilty pleasure flavor overload sort of way and it made you feel sort of ok about it because it deceived you into thinking it was real food.  But now it's not.  The seams are showing.  Quality of service and presentation has gone way down.  Corners are being cut and it shows.  You can tell it is just a fancier Fazoli's and it's really had to pay $25-$30 bucks a person for some sour wine and some microwaved Italian Velveeta in a place that smells like mildew.", "business_id": "H0D2HYqLd9MRCq68rtbTyQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2007-02-12", "type": "review"}

I'm not sure what it's called, but when eaten at the end of your meal, it's unbeatable.\n\nThe only downside I see to Chevys is that I think it's a bit overpriced.  I'm from Chicago, where Mexican food is cheap, and even though this isn't quite the same thing as the Burrito house, I find it odd to be paying as much as I do for this kind of food.

So there's a new bumper for a car being painted in her garage on Sunday. The sister comes inside the house around 5ish, as we are trying to decide where to go to dinner. Name places... all no, finally \"Farrens?\" and it's a yes. We decide to meet there at 6:30. \nDrive from the country into town, and exit at Neil street from 74. As we are exiting, look to the north and see Toys R Us is packed, as is Olive Garden, and most everything else that way. \nDrive down Neil, turn onto Main, and all the restaurants in downtown are relatively empty: 301, Dublin, Big Grove, Guidos, Destihl... everything is relatively vacant. I start to feel sad, not for the empty restaurants, but for the people who decided that it was worth it to eat at Olive Garden. I felt genuinely sorry for people who thought that Olive Garden was a good decision. \nWe park, and walk to Farrens. We go past more restaurants that have seats available, Miga, that Thai place... and still I'm thinking... FRIGGIN OLIVE GARDEN IS FULL!!!\nWe go down the ramp into Farrens. I make eye contact with the server He points to a table. No one else sees him point to the table. I go and sit down, they stand on the ramp, and are like \"You can't just go sit down, they have to seat you\". and i'm like... DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM!!! A little while later, I inform them that yes, he did tell us to sit there. \nWe place our drink order, there's Triptych on tap, so that's nice. (Seems to be a recurring theme, that Triptych stuff is everywhere). I order a beer on draft, the lady orders a beer on draft. The sister asks \"do you only have that craft stuff on draft?\" She gets, I think, a Coors Light. How can you drink mass produced beer with craft food? \nKridz orders the mozzarella sticks. I get the portabella mushroom appetizer. The moz sticks are moz sticks. Nothing too fancy (it seems) about them. The portabella mushroom is the entire cap, cut in half, breaded and fried, served on a salad bed. Hell, this thing is practically a meal to itself. For the actual meal, I order the Russell, you can't go wrong with saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, bacon, blue cheese sauce and pepperjack cheese. BACON ON EVERYTHING!!! \nAt some point before the burgers came out, we also ordered the mac and cheese. If this is on the menu, get it. The ladies at the table were like.. \"what is this puddle on the top? grease?\" and i'm like \"uh... that's butter\". Then they are like \"who puts butter in their mac an cheese?\" then go into a discussion of how they made their mac and cheese for holidays... this, this, this, butter, this, this... seemingly forgetting that they put in a whole lot of butter. Butter makes everything better, as does bacon. mmm bacon butter. \nI dive into my burger, I also got fries with that, fries are delicious, but unnecessary after eating some of the mac and cheese and the whole mushroom cap. I finish my burger. I have blue cheese sauce throughout my mustache and beard. Thus is the struggle I deal with. A drippy delicious burger, all throughout the beard. \nI have another beer. Everyone else finishes eating. The ladies sit around and wait for the sisters significant other to show up because... she locked her keys in her car when she parked.

I went to the other one back in my college days, but this one I didn't even know existed. Walked in and it's seat yourself tables to the left, a bunch of pool tables to the front, and a long bar in the middle. \n\nVery limited seating, but it wasn't packed at all so that wasn't a problem. There was a weird draft hitting our table though, so we moved to one deeper in the corner since we thought it was the door, but the draft was there too. We just had to wear our coats throughout dinner.\n\nFor 6 people, we ordered 2 large pizzas, one buffalo chicken, and one prosciutto. I didn't care much for the prosciutto, but the buffalo was pretty bomb. Ordered some small ranches (50 cents per though, what a rip) and it was delicious. It's deceptive that they cut their pizzas into smaller squares because you feel like you can eat so much more. We had 6 slices left over and it was about 42-ish dollars with tax and tip. So a large probably feeds 4 people comfortably, 3 uncomfortably.\n\nWeird thing though is when we asked for a box, the waitress asked if we wanted anything else. We said no and assumed she would bring us the check. But didn't and we sat there for like 10 more minutes. Had to grab her attention and then ask for the check. We weren't drinking or anything so I'm not sure why she thought we would want to just hang out.

I always preferred Radio Maria, Escobar or some other place for a nice meal. So before we set out on a Friday night for Bacaro, I decided to Yelp it and I was (and still am) very suspicious of a few of the reviews. \n \nHere was a place with lots of 1 & 2 star reviews and yet a couple of 5 star reviews, written in great length and gushing detail by Yelpers for whom this was their only review.  So who writes their first and only review in great length and never mentions anything they ordered, just summarizing it as an excellent restaurant, then never subsequently reviews any other restaurant?  I may be a cynic, but it raises red flags....\n\nSo, we set off to do our own independent research:  Three people on a Friday night.  The place is full, we get one of a couple of available tables, with no reservations.  The waitress was wonderful.  My first requirement to enjoy a restaurant experience is good service, and she was great.  She knew the menu, she was unequivocal when we asked her what she liked.  She kept her distance and watched us for cues, never interrupting a conversation and never rushing us nor ever making us wait.\n\nThe wine list is huge, the drink list is equally huge, but both are very pricey by Champaign standards. My wife's martini was a very full glass, all the way up to the \"c\" section as we Assembly Hall fans would say.\n\nWe had a risotto special with fish \"for the table\", one mixed green salad, and one fried pork belly starter.  The pork belly was $10 and was the size of a large marshmallow in the center of a 12 inch plate, humorous by its dinkyness. But good, like a chunk of fried bacon fat.\nThen we had three entrees, all were very good.  Mine was the grouper ($28) and frankly I don't recall my companion's meals because we also knocked down one martini and two bottles of Cote D' Rhone between the three of us.  The Cote D' Rhone was $28/bottle and the lowest price wine on the list.  Several other wines could be had in the high $30's, and then the rest of the list was north of $40.\nOne apple pie ala mode later and the three of us were out of there for $192 before tip; and she was worth the $40 tip we left, so by the end of the day it approached $77 per person.\nSo if you start a Yelp review at a three, this place gets one more star for having a great server, one star for being in DT Champaign and being beautiful inside & out, including cloth hand towels in the loo.  Then I'll knock one star off for being too pricey for the market, but if Yelp allowed half-stars I'd give Bacaro 4.5.", "business_id": "h9xdY1NO4GnNijNChTy-8A", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-12-19", "type": "review"}

We finally made time last night.\n\nAtmosphere: 5 stars.  Great atmosphere, dimly lit, very nice.\n\nService: 5 stars... we found the service to be extremely high caliber without being \nsnooty.  We ate at NOMI in Chicago a few weeks ago and the service was comparable.  Quality and Kind... just the kind of service we adore.\n\nFood: PERFECT.  I'm not a \"foody\" but I adore good food.  The octopus was the best I've ever had.  The gnocchi was incredibly savory.  My husband tried the steak and I had the lamb special.  Both were FANTASTIC.  \n\nWine suggestion: 4.5 Stars.  Wine was good, not great.  I'm not sure if we failed to describe what we wanted.  Would be nice to have some descriptions in the wine menu.  We've been to several nice restaurants in Chicago that provided descriptions of at least a subset of wine choices.  This is such a minor point though.\n\nWe did not eat dessert as we were stuffed.\n\nI can't say enough good things about this very very special restaurant.  I'm just disappointed we took so long to finally get around to eating there.

To be fair, there's a lot to like about it. The quality of the ingredients is high. The ambience is great too. The servers are among the most professional in the C-U area. The food is genuinely sophisticated. However Bacaro's commitment to local, seasonal ingredients, while being one of its strengths, is also one of its greatest weaknesses. The menu at Bacaro is constantly changing based on what ingredients they stock. This tends to result in inconsistent dishes whose preparations are constantly changing. Of three visits I've eaten some bad, ok and great meals.\n\nVisit 1:\n\nHad halibut with some kind of crust in a mint-gazpacho. The fish was fresh and of excellent quality. This was frustrating however because the fish was coated in a greasy crust that became soggy from the fish sitting in the mint gazpacho. The gazpacho was also greasy and was not pleasantly minty. What could have been a complex, herbaceous broth, wound up tasting like greasy mouthwash. Fantastic ingredients but badly executed prep.\n\nVisit 2:\n\nValentine's Day prix-fixe. Three courses all of which were delicious. The appetizer was some kind mediterranean type salad if I recall with olives and I think preserved lemon. Delicious and fresh! My main was halibut again, with some kind of vanilla saffron sauce. The fish was perfectly cooked and the sauce was complex and homey. My girlfriend got the steak and it was of great quality with a strong preparation to match. The dessert was a chocolate torte with blood orange sorbet- good flavors that were well-executed.\n\nVisit 3:\n\nPork loin with mustard spaetzle. The spaetzle were delicious! I could eat that spaetzle every day. The pork however was DRY. Really, really dry. I was trying to conserve the mustard sauce on the plate in order to make sure there was enough to get on each slice of pork. It was that dry. \n\nSo in closing out of three, expensive visits, the food has been good maybe 1.5 times- with me being able to say I enjoyed one complete meal (valentine's day) and the side of one of my mains (the spaetzle). If the food was consistent, Bacaro would be an easy 5-stars. Hopefully they can strike a balance moving forward between rotating fresh, seasonal ingredients and maintaining a consistently-executed menu.", "business_id": "h9xdY1NO4GnNijNChTy-8A", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-02-27", "type": "review"}

On our most recent visit, we ordered a few things from the new menu, all of which seemed fantastic--it was hard to choose. We had greens, octopus salad, gnocchi, and the scallop entree. Each course was just as delicious as the last. \n\nThe scallop entree is so clever and very well executed--it's such a treat to have perfectly cooked, high quality seafood in the middle of Illinois. Chef Drew worked his magic with this dish. There are \"scallop potatoes\" on the plate, which blend in and look just like the actual scallop next to it. Biting into the potato is an experience, especially if you're expecting a scallop! They are divine. I could eat a whole plate of just the potatoes, I swear.\n\nWe were too full to order dessert, but everything I've had in the past from the dessert menu has been phenomenal--creative, elegant and fun at the same time. Their pastry chef Lindsey is awesome! \n\nAs for wine, I didn't have anything beyond Prosecco on my last visit, but I usually just allow the staff to select something for me. It's always on the money.\n\nThe service is always impeccable as well--smooth, engaging when it needs to be and with a huge attention to detail. Connor took care of us on our most recent visit. He's a truce service professional--knowledgable, eager to offer suggestions and advice with the menu, but allows the experience to flow naturally. We had such a nice time with him! Plus, Julie is always there to make sure everyone is having a perfect experience.\n\nI highly recommend bacaro to anyone who is visiting CU who is looking for a polished, smooth, fine-dining experience. I would also steer visitors that way if they are just looking for a place to relax with a glass of wine.

If you put the restaurant together as a whole package including the ambiance, the uniqueness of the food, and culinary innovation you would get a 3 star restaurant, however the flip side is that the culinary flavors do not resemble anything like the gastronomic experience you get when you dine at Next in Chicago or Charlie Trotters when it was still open. You pay quite a premium for the dish that are notably small. Our dinner meeting was held at this location. There is plenty of meter parking, just remember to not go over or you will likely be ticketed. I started my meal with the wagyu beef stew which had smoked potato and a bone marrow crostini. I can honestly say the crostini was amazing with bone marrow that offered an amazing umami flavoring, however the actual stew was salty, the beef was not tender by any means sort of tasting like a dinty moore stew. This cost 13 dollars and the portion size was very small. My main entree for 33 dollars was the grilled lobster tail with kale, crispy black truffle polenta, and additional lobster claw and pieces of lobster on the side with a acidic lemon tasting sauce. Once again the portion size was quite small as you see from my picture. I don't believe you get the whole lobster tail as it looked like 1/2 of a lobster tail. There was a piece of claw meat on the side and the other side was shredded lobster meat. The lobster was cooked well, tender and well flavored with the black truffle polenta balancing the seafood, however the attempt at the different texture from the arugula/kale along with the soft polenta and the lobster did not work. Our meal ended with a flourless chocolate cake with blood orange champagne foam and pomegranate jelly. The grapefruit foam hit the spot, but again the cake was a sliver and for that cost you would think the portion would be bigger. Due to the long wait for the waiter to bring the dessert menu, I ended up getting my first parking ticket in Champaign. So I agree the flavors and small portion size at this price do not make this a place that I will frequent. As another yelper said, if you want to impress your date this maybe an interesting place to try, however I am going to try to find another culinary gem elsewhere.\n\nPros: local sustained food, changing menu\n\nCons: VERY expensive, small portion size- I left hungry, taste and texture just does not work for some dishes\n\nHidden deals:\nIf you really want to impress your date, try the 7 course tasting menu at 85 dollars. I don' t know if that is a deal but at least you get to try everything for $$$", "business_id": "h9xdY1NO4GnNijNChTy-8A", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-01-31", "type": "review"}

Named for and run by Dan Majerles of the Phoenix Suns, this bar sits just one block away from the arena and tends to host some of the rowdier crowds during the Suns games. Majerles is consistently ranked one of the top sports bars in the country by Sports Illustrated. This accolade is well deserved.\n\nMajerles is small but laid out well with the bar in the center with smaller high-tops encircling it with booths along the outer wall. This system works well for the different types of crowds that come into Majerles. There is also outdoor seating and usually a scantily-clad hostess standing with them.\n\nNothing special about the menu but everything is good. The Chicago burger, with its blue cheese, is a personal favorite. The bar features the usual selection of domestics and imports as well as specialty liquor.\n\nThis is not really a kid-friendly environment but there is nothing to suggest they shouldn't attend. Because the bar is more intertwined with the restaurant and the waitresses are usually minimally dressed, Cooper's Town might make a better impression on the younger ones. The food is better there too.", "business_id": "45puCRQ6Vh_IIAy7kkfFDQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-12-15", "type": "review"}

Even so, the hostesses went out of their way to find a bunch of open tables and pushed them together for us.\n\nService wasn't nearly as quick as I'd like, but I try to be realistic.  When you're in a crowded sports bar right after a local sporting event, it's gonna take a few minutes to get your drinks, and I'm cool with that.\n\nAfter people had a couple of drinks and loosened up, the karaoke lineup was classic!!  It started off with a tiny girl singing Gin and Juice by Snoop Dogg.  Then came the Beastie Boys and Salt N Pepa.  And that was enough, I was hooked!\n\nIn the business of full disclosure, I don't think it's advertised as Hip Hop Karaoke, I think it's just referred to as karaoke.  That's just what it's become known as between me and my friends because that's all we've ever heard/sang there.

And all the places I've never been to but have been wanting to go to for ages were either closed or greens free-- LoLo's (collard don't count), Palatte, Cheuvront, Cibo, My Florist, and so on.\n\nSo Moms decided that Coach and Willie's was the perfect luncheon destination.\n\n(Cuz they thought the salads online looked purdy tasty, and they were right. But I shouldn't have \"judged a book by its cover,\" since even McDonald's looks pretty good in commercials.)\n\nSo I swing by to pick up my sis and we dash to Coach and Willie's. I thought the name sounded like a bastard love filly to a Pony Express stud. Or maybe some purebred dog name, like Sir Charles McWigglesworth.\n\nEasy to find. Parking was plentiful. Patio was neato. Sunken bar seemed like a novelty. Horseshoe shaped booths were comfy and inviting. Atmosphere was upscaley for a sports bar. Company was vivacious. Waitress was engaging and attentive. Bacon wrapped prawns were succulent and satisfying. My Woodchuck cider was tasting crisp and peary. And I had a big ole smile on my face.\n\nIt was salad time. \n\nNow if a salad costs ten dollars, I expect more than a tasteless expanse of iceburg lettuce. What head chef uses iceburg lettuce any more? With all the varieties of salad greens to chose from, I end up with the tasteless, tacky trailer trash of the field greens world? I'm not saying you gotta get all pretentious with a salad by using micro greens grown in an organic hot house, but for fuck sake, iceburg? Airplanes and cafeterias are the only places I've ever encountered iceburg not in fancy pants wedge salad form, which classes it up some and acknowledges the fact that iceburg is tasteless filler devoid of nutrients of any sort.\n\nIs Coach and Willie's food comparable to airplane fare? Ahem, yes. My salad was anyway. Everyone else seemed to enjoy theirs, despite the offensive iceburg. I just ate the equally tasteless southwestern chicken mass that came on top and picked around the lettuce filler. So while the lunch was fun and the bacon wrapped prawns were rockin', the salad sucked. And since I've only been here once, they get a less than stellar review. (And I'm stating that straight up so nobody gets all persnickety. I've only been once. For lunch. And a crap salad.)\n\nI'm sure it's a fun place for drinks before a game or for a quick lunch with coworkers, but I'm taking a stand against iceburg lettuce. It should be eliminated on principle alone. (Aside from its uses as filler; see Navajo tacos and garnish.)\n\nAnybody want to join my one woman campaign?", "business_id": "j8nyAaN_w5t6wYv-ni23sg", "stars": 2, "date": "2008-01-24", "type": "review"}

Every day of the week they have specials and they are always hosting parties, events, etc. Guaranteed there is something for everyone. The staff is great! Ray and Jeff the bartenders are professional and still fun! There is a nice patio and I've heard there is also a big upstairs room but I've never been up. Next time. Lots of TVs and plenty of room for large groups. Clean bathrooms, live music some nights and even a DJ on Friday nights I think. Brunch menu is unbelievably good! I had mimosas of course to quench my thirst. : ) Hits the spot-especially after a night of drinking! AND the deserts they have are even delicious! There is a lot more I can say and I am pretty picky about the places I like. Definitely go!", "business_id": "j8nyAaN_w5t6wYv-ni23sg", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-01-15", "type": "review"}

The girls and wings are hotter than most others in the country. \nOn a cross country trip 10 years ago I  rode with a friend who was infatuated with this place. There was only one in Mass at the time and he never went, so during our 6,000 mile trek we hit up about a dozen of these places. Some were good, some sucked, but the wings and girls at this downtown phx location made me decide to stay in az for a year. \nFood at this location just seems better than the ones up in the northeast. They seem to add alot more spice in order to keep up with the plethora of mexican restaurants in the area. So if you like your wings hot, you unfortunately gotta leave the bland northeast. \nBeer as long as you buy it by the pitcher is affordable, but if you come in during happy hour, expected to get nice and drunk while not going poor.\nAs far as the other reason to go to hooters:the girls, you're gonna love this place. Let's face it, all hooters waitress are conning you just like a stripper would at the club. Here it doesn't seem they are faking it that much. Besides that they are hot as hell! With over 100 days of 100 degree heat in the valley of the sun, your use to seeing alot of hot girls walking around with next to nothing on. Yet hooters seems to still pluck away some of the best and stick out.\nThere aren't many reasons to go to downtown phx, but this hooters definitely makes it worth the trip.", "business_id": "qsWxbgQwuomXvMseg23DGg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-02-07", "type": "review"}

Location is easy to find. There is street parking and I didn't get the feeling my life was in danger (even though somebody once told me that it was extremely dangerous for a girl to be out by herself in that 'hood and at that venue). A bum did stop along the sidewalk and ask for some spare change, but he wasn't a creepy bum (you know what I'm talking about). \n\nI chose for my first visit to The Brickhouse to be during a Beat Battle event. Granted, I wasn't sure what I was getting myself into, but that was part of the draw. Rap? Turntablism? Beat Boys? I just had to know. \n\nI dragged a friend along with me. He seemed like a willing enough victim, though. \n\nCover was $10, which isn't bad for any sort of musical event. Crowd was cool - plenty of unique individuals to rest your eyes upon. I enjoyed how this particular show brought out some pretty artsy-lookin' and jam-jivin' folks. I can hang with these peeps, I thought. I actually did enjoy the Beat Battle, for it was something new. Nothing like a new experience at a new venue to make one helluva memory. \n\nOnly downside was that the beer selection was lacking. I wanted something seasonal, yet they didn't offer any sort of winter lager or ales. Bummer. I settled for a Kiltlifter to start off with, followed by a Newcastle.  Plus, there's a kitchen for people who have the munchies. They offered a drink, fries and burger for $5. Now that's a bargain.\n\nOh, and let's touch upon the bathroom, shall we. Ladies Room, my arse. More like a \"Enter at Your Own Risk Waste Disposal.\" I mean, seriously. Door 1: the lock didn't align; therefore, the door didn't lock. Door 2: 1/2 the seat lid was broken off and missing. Door 3: Out of Service note. Door 4: The large stall with the big door that wasn't quite big enough to meet the stall column; therefore, it just swing wide open the other way.  Can you guess which stall I chose?  \n\nBut, c'mon, I admit it: I like this venue. I don't always need or want pristine, perfect or even pleasant. In fact, I am thinking my review will change and a 4th star may find its way into my rating if I go back here to see a band of my liking. I missed the Okkervil River show here, and I'll never forgive myself for that. \n\nOf course, this is definitely not a 5 star venue - unless, of course, there's the exception to the rule: no cover, better beer selection and Harry Connick Jr. on stage.

(Legenary burger, fries, and soft drink) The only positive is that the food was alright. It was good for the $4 I paid, but not the $15+tax and tip it was normally.\n\nThe cons:\n- The customer service was laughable. Our waiter come up to my guest and I, who both had empty drinks at the time, and said \"Good? Good?\" with thumbs up. My guest asked for a refill and specified that I needed one, too. Later in the meal when both of our drinks were totally empty again, I asked for a refill. He only brought one for me, so my guest and I shared my drink. He clearly couldn't care less. \n- The burger was dry, like it was previously frozen. It definitely didn't taste fresh.\n- The veggies on the side to put on the burger weren't crisp. I usually like lettuce on my burger, but not their wilted lettuce.\n- The fries weren't seasoned and they weren't anything special. I'd compare them to Wendy's fries. \n- The music videos they play are awful. For being the Hard Rock Cafe you'd think that they'd play some well known rock stuff. ...nope... my guest and I were there for almost two hours and there was only one song we recognized. While I'm not a music expert, my guest is. To top it off, their bad music is so loud that you have to yell to talk to someone across the table.

Overall, it has a pretty neat atmosphere with everything being music related. Lot's of guitars and gold records along with pictures cover most of the walls. be prepared, it is very loud in there. Music videos will be playing. This does not bother me, but you may have to raise your voice to be heard.  Now, onto he food.

Or if you're like me and have an unending love of different cheeses, you're good too.  In the emerging downtown Phoenix nightlife scene, this place may be the crown jewel.\n\nA disclaimer for starters.  I'm friends with one of the waitresses there.  She was the one who pretty much roped me into this place.  I let her pick the cheeses for me as a first timer.  There's no way to try out all of them (there's about three dozen different kinds to choose from), so I got a plate of Parmiagiano Reggiano, Carmody, and Mimolette.  I happen to be a red wine guy so these selections went perfectly with a Syrah.  The wine and cheese menus recommend wine and cheese combinations for you if you're not familiar with different styles.  The waiters there are also very knowledgable about what wine and cheese combos work best.  They always serve the cheeses with some crackers, nuts and fruit to go with it.  You can buy a helping of cheese to take home too if you want.\n\nThe restaurant itself is pretty modern with a comfortable low key industrial feel to it.  It's situated at the bottom floor of a condo complex and just steps away from the main Phoenix library and Hance Park.  They've got a couch area in the back of the restaurant if you want to lounge with a group of friends.  You can also get a patio seat right along Central Ave.   Now that the light rail is up and running, my sense is that this place is going to see ALOT more business as word continues to spread about this place.\n\nNow if you're not huge into wine and cheese, they do have a full lunch and dinner menu.  I haven't tried any of their lunch or dinner items and they are a little pricey.  Although if other Yelpers are any indication, they're probably worth a shot and I'll probably give one of those entrees a go next time I'm there.\n\nIt goes without saying that downtown Phoenix isn't the first area of town that most people think of when they think of hangout spots and eateries.  It's still not quite there yet, but with places like Cheuvront's and other unique spots opening nearby, it shouldn't be long before a regular stream of urban crawlers start filling up places like this on a regular basis.

The bleu cheese mac-n-cheese was our favorite, the shrimp & traditional were just so-so, and the other varieties were pretty good.

If I had stuck with that I might have had a very different experience.  Unfortunately, I tried to range farther afield and came away feeling like everything except the wine and cheese came from Costco.\nCheuvront gets predictably high marks for the range of the wine list and the varieties of cheeses--if Wallace and Gromit decided to move to the desert and become social drinkers, here is where they would do it.  I took the menu's advice and paired a Queso Iberico cheese plate with a pinot noir (Cartlidge & Browne '07) and liked both very much.  Actually, I liked the cheese.  The rest of the \"plate\"--almonds, dried cranberries, and a few grapes in their twilight years--evoked no real response at all.  My accomplice in dining chose the Pascual Toso Malbec '07 (accurately described as a full-bodied red) and summer salad.  The wine was great--complex and dry without being acerbic--but the salad tasted like the chef had just given two weeks' notice.  The chicken was bland, the \"mixed field greens\" had clearly just come out of a bag, and the roasted shallot white balsamic vinaigrette was the middle school marching band of dressings: yes, I recognized what was being attempted but still felt bullied by it.  The pumpkin bread pudding was good, but not worth making a trip for.  The latte and cappuccino were fine, but here's a tip for the kitchen: if you want coffee to stay hot, warm the cup first.  By the time our friendly-yet-overwhelmed server came back with the cinnamon, the drinks were lukewarm.  \nSpeaking of service, let's not.  We got menus, we got food, we got the bill.  We also waited a lot, heard several rationalizations for said waiting times, and had to repeat requests.  We spent two hours for a snack-sized meal that required no cooking except for the bread pudding that had obviously been made much earlier.\nIf I could send one message to Mr. Cheuvront, it would be this: It doesn't require any particular talent to sell good wine and good cheese at above-average prices.  It does, however, require talent and skill and desire to create an experience that keeps folks coming back.  If I want to drink good wine in a mediocre setting, I'll buy a bottle at AJ's and smuggle it into Denny's.", "business_id": "muCl5p-9ut1sY0aKeUeRhw", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-02-24", "type": "review"}

Also, our host acted as our server - not sure if this is typical or just because they were slammed, but you could tell he was working his butt off. \n\nThe so-so: The prices seemed pretty steep to me. I don't mind an expensive meal if the food is stupendous, but there seemed to be a few missteps. Two of our appetizers were overcooked (overbaked, to be precise) with scant filling. Also, I ordered a scallop appetizer as my meal because I didn't want to commit to an entree. They weren't able to make it, so I ordered the scallop entree and was only able to eat 2 of the scallops, which were sandy, and a small bit of the pasta. It felt kind of  wasteful.\n\nOh!

I have been meaning to go for ages and finally a group of friends wanted to go out of dinner, two of them which now live downtown, and I recommended Cheuvront. A half hour ride from the Mill Avenue stop and I was there. \n\nA bit chilly to sit outside but looks like excellent outdoor seating. The seating is well spaced with wine storage along the back wall and a well stocked bar in the middle (God and I both love a well-stocked bar, or at least I always say \"Thank God, they have a bar). The wait staff was cordial without being too personal (I look at dining as I'm out to eat dinner with friends, not really out to make new friends, at least until I have a few drinks but that is whole different situation....ahem). \n\nI started out the evening with a basic mojito made with 10 cane rum. A little too much sugar syrup for my taste and could use more lime but wow, served in a full size glass and a kick like a mule. One of my fellow diners had the white sangria with fresh basil and wow, that was a keeper. I'm definitely having that next time. \n\nThey have a huge selection of cheeses from around the world and we ordered the three cheese appetizer plate (the waiter asked if I wanted to pick but was happy to pick a selection for us, and I love to delegate) and the pork empanadas with orange marmalade. The cheese was good and I noticed they also have another book where you can order wine and they just pair it with cheese, how cool! The empanadas, to die for, I will order that again, ideally along with that sangria with fresh basil. \n\nDinner was the duck breast rubbed with coffee and ancho chili pepper and served on top of I don't know what but it had a crispy grilled crust on the outside and it was nice and cheesy (seemed like some sort of rice and cheese mix) on the inside, and it was wonderfully presented. I actually had the recommended wine pairing and wow, it went so well together. A rich red wine that offset the spice rub on the duck breast perfectly. \n\nWe ended the evening with coffee and desert. The coffee was okay but they should consider serving coffee roasted at the Cartel coffee lab in Tempe (which I love) as the coffee here was just...coffee...which was a shame when the rest of the meal was so great. Ideally they should bring everyone an individual french press so they can let the coffee get as strong as they like to drink it. I would also recommend a thicker cream, even whipping cream (unwhipped) since it provides that sense of luxury that goes well with this place (I had that at Mucho-Gusto and became an instant fan). \n\nFor those of the more intellectual persuasion, I noticed this place is in walking distance of the main Phoenix library. So you can go pick out a good book on a lazy Sunday and then walk over to Cheuvront for some wine and cheese and feel like the perfect elitist, before you ride the light rail home (okay, this is my ideal lazy Sunday and I've always dreamed of being just a little bit of an elitist - I'm not perfect).", "business_id": "muCl5p-9ut1sY0aKeUeRhw", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-02-07", "type": "review"}

It wasn't a small amount of salmon as one would expect\n, but a quite moderate piece of salmon filet. I had the Cheuvront chicken served with polenta.

Plus, like Hard Rock, you can buy t-shirts and souvenirs.  \n\nA group of co-workers and I decided to go there for lunch since four of the five of us hadn't been there before. It seemed like quite a popular lunch destination as almost the entire inside was full. We were seated promptly and had a very nice server.  The menu includes your standard sports bar appetizers, wings, salads, and sandwiches.  There is even a small \"low carb\" section, with some very tasty sounding wraps.  I ordered the BLT and my bacon came out pretty crispy for the most part, as I requested. I liked how the bread wasn't toasted, but grilled, and my crispy fries were delicious.  I appreciated how the sandwich size was reasonable (you know, so it actually fit in my mouth) and I received a nice side of fries, but not too many. Portions appeared to be very reasonable.  With the sandwiches and burgers, you get a choice of two sides, but I only got the fries. Smart move on my part, as two sides would have been too much food for me.  My one co-worker ordered off the kids menu and our waitress was totally fine with that.  For the five of us, our bill came to $52, which is very very reasonable.\n\nI can see how this is a popular destination before Diamondback or Suns games...plenty of TVs dot the restaurant so regardless of where you are sitting, you have an easy view of at least one TV.  Service was quick despite a pretty full restaurant (we were in and out in well under an hour). Street parking was a tad tricky as most of the meters this afternoon were unavailable to park at (not sure why). But if you are going before a game, parking won't be an issue.  The heavy eyeliner on the servers and hostesses was a bit much for me, but fits in the overall theme of the restaurant I suppose.\n\nAll and all a good choice if you work downtown and are looking for a lunch place or before a sporting event.  Not sure I would make a special trip to eat here though.\n\nUPDATE (4/20/08):\n\nI have been to Coopers Town a few times since my initial review, most recently today before a Diamondbacks home game. Based on my subsequent experiences after my initial review, I have bumped up my star rating to 4 stars. I have tried a few more things on the menu and I highly recommend the crispy chicken wrap...it is delicious! The atmosphere at Coopers Town before a game is awesome and is a great spot to hit before a game. Plus how can you go wrong with $3 Bud, Bud Light, and Amber Bock drafts on home game days for the Suns and Diamondbacks?", "business_id": "oCA2OZcd_Jo_ggVmUx3WVw", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-01-24", "type": "review"}

There is Alice memoribilia covering every inch of every wall in the place. And of course all good theme restaurants have a gift shop.  They have great live bands that come out to play and when there is no band, they have great piped in music too.  \n\nCooperstown is a novel place to take out-of-town guests before a game, but if it's just you and your family, you won't feel empty if you skip it.  It's just too much money to spend on very bland, uneventful food.", "business_id": "oCA2OZcd_Jo_ggVmUx3WVw", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-02-28", "type": "review"}

Not crowded, the bar tender was GREAT.  Attentive, personable, good recommendations on food, but not intrusive.\n\nMy wife had the Lady Gaga sausage appetizer.  Fantastic sausage, spicy, great sauce, served with celery stalks and bleu cheese (optional).  She likes a good sausage.....let's leave it at that....and Alice Cooper delivered.\n\nSince the bartender claimed the place is a BBQ house, I went with a  BBQ beef sandwich, with chili and fries for the sides.  While the pig in me would have wanted more of everything, it was the perfect size for lunch.\n\nThe brisket was done perfectly.  We travel with a smoker...so I know a little about BBQ.   The BBQ sauce is very good.  I'd like it spicier, but I always do.  The sauce is multidimensional with some real \"depth\" to the bench.  It's not a one-trick pony BBQ sauce.  The sauce is also not thick, like ketchup.  It's definitely not off-the-shelf.\n\nThe Chili.  Two words; A-mazing.  A few weeks ago, we were at a chili cook-off.  Cooper's Town chili would have kicked some butt.  Again...could have been spicier, but there was some heat and there was LOTS of flavor.  Could definitely taste a hint of the BBQ sauce, cumin, and chili.  Saw what looked like slices of Anaheim or Serrano pepper.  And it has beans.  Again, seems to not have any thickener in it - I appreciate that.  A clean flavor.  Next time, the chili burger will be ordered.  The side portion is just too damn small - this stuff is good.\n\nPrices are decent - lunch for the 2 of us for just over $20.  Can't complain about that.\n\nThe decor is nice, cool memorabilia, autographs on the wall, definitely a sports bar with huge damn screens.  Nice place.  Nice time.

He didn't like it much and I don't really blame him. I examined the sandwich only to find that the BBQ sauce on it was all dried up on the meat. The grilled pork loin appeared to be the only fresh meat on the sandwich. Ah well, 14 dollar sandwich down the drain.\n\nThe 5 year old took a tiny bite out of his dry hamburger slider and ate a couple of fries. The fries were just like Burger King fries...not so yummy.\n\nMe and my friend started eating the hot dog which had shredded cheese, bacon and pickles. Each side is a dollar, by t he way. Anyway....it tasted good for the first few bites but after that I was overwhelmed by the saltiness of the hot dog. Way too salty.\n\n50 dollars later I walked out with 3 take home containers and 4 people that were still hungry because they couldn't eat the food.\n\nOn to the ambiance; they sat us very close to the entrance/exit to the kitchen which is also near the bar.

I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to stop here on the way out of town and grab a bite with the family.\n\nWe ordered potato skins to start, the Big Unit Hot Dog, Pulled Pork Sandwich, and Beef Brisket. \n\nThe potato skins were better than what I've had at chain restaurants. The bacon on them is the same as the hot dogs so at least there's an effort to make it less processed. They're served with Ranch (I'm used to sour cream) which made it interesting but enjoyable. \n\nThe Big Unit Hot Dog ($16.99) is enough for two. I ate 3/4 of it before my flight, my wife had the difference. This is definitely one of those items you want to order to egg on your buddies to order and try out, giving them the bode of confidence that they'll finish, well knowing they'll pay for it later. I tried to walk it off but eventually fell victim to the meat coma. \n\nThe dog tastes like most dogs, a little spicy flare to it but not unbearable for those who do not like heat. What really makes this hot dog in my opinion is the bread. It's what you would expect from a baguette, hard outside and soft inside. Even with the toppings I added (bacon, cheese sauce and sauerkraut) the bun held up. \n\nThe restaurant is full of TVs, perfect for catching a few games. It's no short on entertainment. The plus on service was that our server was very conscientious of the short time line we were on. The opportunity that could have been gained was asking for refills for beverages, which came at the end. They did stop by to see how the meal was after all of us had a few bites.

Also the service was good.\n\n\n I went during the week at lunch time and they were not busy. It is a sports bar that has rock n roll roots. The servers all had the Alice Cooper eye makeup on(great touch). The drink menu is celebrity themed. I had the Ozzy Osborne and James Gandolfini.  Both were great and served in pint size glasses (I was surprised). For appetizer we had the nightmare Nachos.  They are nachos with nightmare chili on them. I thought they were really good.\n\nFor our entrees I got the Cuban sandwich and my wife got the maniac mac and cheese with chicken. I was tempted to try and eat the nightmare Big Unit (which is 22 in hot dog with lots of toppings). The Cuban sandwich was really good and the garlic mayo was not over powering, but it had flavor.  My wife's mac and cheese came with potato chips on top. My wife was surprised on how it actually improved the dishes flavor. She would get it again. She is a tough mac and cheese critic. \n\nNow onto the dessert.  We couldn't decide on which one to get so we got 2. The oversized hot white macadamia nut cookie with ice cream and the dessert  taco with banana cheese cake filling. My wife like the taco better than me (not a huge cheese cake eater), but the macadamia nut cookie dessert will be one I get everytime.

We brought my parents and showed up for lunch around 1 (on a Sunday). The restaurant area was quite busy and we were a bit surprised to see that no one was utilizing the giant patio out front. We had a bit of a disconnect with the host and being properly seated but that gave us time to survey the decor.\n\nFood wise, I opted for the brisket plate and my family all had sandwiches. Our food arrived quite promptly, which was perfect. I was served 6 long strips of brisket, that was well cooked. The sauce provided was necessary as it was a smidge dry and didn't have the smoke ring one would look for. My sides of coleslaw and mashed potatoes were thoroughly enjoyed though and I definitely didn't leave hungry. The coleslaw has blue cheese mixed in which I felt was delicious but if that's not your think, perhaps choose another item. Everyone else enjoyed their meals and found the food worth the price.\n\nService was fairly attentive and our drinks were never empty. The eye makeup on each was unique though it would have been nice to see at least one of them enthusiastic about being there. Instead we got a lot of grumpy faces and no smiles. 'No more Mr Nice Guy' seems to fit in well ;) They also ring what sounds like a fire alarm bell every time someone orders a jumbo hot dog and the servers all yell something. There must have been 10 hot dogs ordered during our visit and it got a bit old after the first time.\n\nOverall, we had a decent visit.

The music.  Which lasts when administrations and trends are gone, and flashes in the pan are revealed as pyrite.  Speaking of eternal, the particular piece she was discussing was Beethoven's fifth.  And I learned something!  Real pros don't call it Beethoven's fifth. They call it \"Beethoven Five\".  Can you imagine composing something that the best talents of subsequent ages compete with each other to try to do honor to? She also discussed the ruddy earthy tambre of another piece, and those words resonated because I was careening across a stretch of Arizona's ruddy desert at that point and I felt her words echo the landscape.  She was more lyrical and relevant and hard hitting with her prose than many self-styled prose gurus and 97% of talking heads.

I was turned on to the Welcome Diner by a classmate at a software training I was attending, I said I was a food nerd and he told me that these guys were reopening today!\nSolid yelp reviews sold me, and they did NOT disappoint.\nThey opened at 5:00, but I got off of class at about 4:15, so I went down there and hung around for a bit. After unsuccessfully attempting to help out with their square credit card thing (they can take cards, but it'll show up as the food truck because the restaurant account isn't setting up properly), I placed my order. I was the first customer, yay! Amazingly, the only other opening day jitter I saw was the ricecooker being ornery and tripping the circuit breaker repeatedly. In terms of \"disasters\" that's a pretty minimal one. I chose to wait for the rice to finish and get my meal all together, as I needed to burn time to avoid getting out of central Phoenix back to Tucson at rush hour.\nI had the port of call burger and a side of red beans and rice (the ricecooker worked in the end).\nBest burger I've had, I think ever. All the ingredients were high quality, very nice cheddar cheese, mushrooms cooked with port, and garlic aioli. And the bun. Oh damn, the bun. Feathery is the best adjective. No unevenness in texture, light, and just barely strong enough to contain the burger... well maybe not entirely contain.\nThe red beans and rice were good - I'm not well versed in the craft of that dish, but it was tasty.\nBoth the other customers that ordered inside got the fried chicken biscuit sandwich with apple butter made by one of the staff. They seemed very happy with their choices.\n\nThey've got beer, wine, and hurricanes. Right now they're open Thursday-Saturday 5:00-10:00pm for dinner, and Saturday and Sunday from 10:00-3:00pm for brunch. I snuck a peek at the brunch menu, and there looked to be some tasty stuff there too. They're going to work on expanding dinner service out over more of the week gradually.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are you doing?\nYeah. \nYou.\nWhy are you still reading this?\nGo get a burger or something from here.\nBlah blah blah it's Tuesday at 9am and they're not open, sure, whatever, maybe that excuse will fly with your family, but not here mister/missy.", "business_id": "tb24fvNJfHhyKEXkKn12Xw", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-01-31", "type": "review"}

Their PB and B burger is exceptional, peanut butter with burger sounds weird, but it's damn tasty and good Schrieber's bacon(also used at Bill Johnsons Big Apple for less dinero). It's the highest price burger at $12.50. I also had the previously mentioned collard greens and a 7 buck Hurricane, tasty and well-mixed, almost at price point correctly with such good ingredients.\n\nThree items and with tip, over $28.00.

The chicken was probably my favorite, but it was impossible to eat like a lady. It's stacked so high that in order to get some in your mouth, you have to get some on your face.

I'm impressed by the caliber of the menu that Michael has put together. And I love how there is Southern and Cajun style food.

If you're getting the avocado, split it with a friend. Five pieces of that is a lot, in my opinion.\n\nThe biscuits are really unique. You can taste a difference from theirs and what you may get at another restaurant. The biscuit sandwich with the fried chicken and honey will hit just the right spot. I also like the biscuit with goat cheese and jam. And we can't forget about the peanut butter + bacon burger with fries. You may get some clogged arteries from sampling everything but it may just be worth it. I urge people to try this place. I'm sure it's only a matter of time before Guy Fieri parachutes in. \n\nI ended up writing about this place for an article on restaurants worth highlighting in Phoenix. Besides the food, I think this has a terrific location to build on being the \"Cheers\" of the Garfield neighborhood. The patio is really inviting and you can watch residents coming and going since it's in a residential area. It is quite hipster-dominated but that's just what a lot of Garfield and the Roosevelt Row area are.

It's possibly because I was hoping to keep them my little secret. These guys took their Old Dixie food truck and took over this unique and eclectic location that has been home to other popups over the last couple of years. Inside seating is VERY limited 8 built in stools against a small counter. I love sitting inside but I often enjoy their out door seating during the summer and especially on these beautiful Phx winter nights. [They do lunch and brunch as well.] \n\nThe Food: I have enjoyed everything I have tried here. They are known  for their biscuits, which are fairly large, sturdy enough to be used in their biscuit sandwiches but tender enough to enjoy with their homemade honey butter (the honey sourced from a small apiary in the neighborhood) or house made jelly/preserves or apple butter. Many of their veggies are often sourced out of the community garden when possible. They source locally as much as possible, and their menu adjusts seasonally, while keeping some of their popular favorites. They always offer vegetarian options and occasionally even vegan. [Skip the goat cheese on the beet tureen salad and that is a yummy vegan option]  \nThey make all food to order and honor substitutions or additions within reason.  Heck, for dinner one night I ordered their biscuit with goat cheese and smoked apple butter (found on the dessert menu) and asked if they could add bacon.  They gave me a bit of a raised eyebrow as they found the request unique and gladly served it up (and it was SOOO good) \n\nMy favorites:\nAnything with their fried chicken. \nAnything with their biscuits. \nTheir french fries are  hand cut and fabulous. \nThey smoke their own meats  (and sometimes apples for their smoked Apple butter) so try the Carolina or any smoked  sausage, pork chop, etc. that shows up on the specials board. \nTheir burgers rock! (YOU HAVE to try the PB&B, well unless you have a peanut allergy). \nTheir salads are lovely and tasty. \n\nThey offer some select cocktails and a limited choice of liquor.

But where there is jackfruit I will follow.\n\nWelcome Diner on Roosevelt and 10th Streets sells a lot of burgers and booze but they also offer a jackfruit po'boy ($8) and several other interesting veggie dishes.\n\nEven though I fancy the taste of sweet, juicy, ripe jackfruit, it's also scrumptious when cooked and used like a vegetable.  This is the fourth spot where I've had jackfruit in a sandwich (or taco) and 'twas delicious.  \n\nPaired with a cabbage slaw that adds crunch to the 'wich, the flavor was mild and hearty.  I requested no BBQ sauce because that sickly sweetness would have disturbed the taste of the fruit.  My only regret is no side was included in the price.\n\nWelcome Diner also sells a fried green tomato sammich. ($8.5)  Doesn't that sound delicious? \n\n[crickets]\n\nDoesn't it?  Okay, well maybe it's just me.  And lesson learned:   \"Sounding\" delicious and tasting delicious are two entirely different senses.  The sourdough was oily, toasted with a few slices of breaded fried tomatoes laid in-between.  And a fried tomato is...well...it tastes...uhhhh...urrrr...well...well, at least it's a vegetable, damn it Janet.  \n\nNo side either.   If it wasn't for the arugula, corn relish, and ranch dressing on the sandwich, it would have been a complete disappointment.  Ya' hurd meh?  Complete. Disappointment.   \n\nAnd so TOMATO gets added to the list of things that should not be fried and passed off as food.

The gravy on my biscuits and gravy had some of the best, yummy, flavorful, salty gravy I've had. And the biscuit was cut in half and grilled so it was a bit crispy.

Little old me, drinking at the Bikini Lounge from 2 in the afternoon until midnight with 3 friends.  Drinking, drinking, drinking.  So after 10+ hours of living solely off of beer, there can surely be no better idea than going to a strip club.  Right?\n\nSo we pack up and head on over.  A high cover (sorry, for the life of me I don't remember how much) and a 2 drink minimum (which I do realize is standard) later, we're immersed in black light.  As my eyes adjust, I start to see that this is really not the crowd I expected to see in a strip club.  There is ZERO energy.  No talking.  No laughing.  Nothing but rows of guys sitting and looking blankly at the dancers.\n\nWe found some empty chairs in the back, and settled in there, and I was able to turn my attention to the girls.  Ok, look:  I know they can't all be Elizabeth Berkley (may the Lord keep her feisty Nomi Malone safe and warm forever).  But I didn't expect this apathy.  Bored looking women taking their short turns on the small round main stage, and more bored looking women walking around offering lapdances in vain.  The thing about stripping is this:  I thought the point was that you could make a lot of money.  But we were there at midnight on a Saturday night, and these girls were getting NOTHING.  In the hour we were there, I saw ONE man put money in a girl's pants on stage... and I watched, and it was a one dollar bill.  Seriously.\n\nI sat there with my 3 friends (2 men, one other woman), all of us in a row, all of us suddenly sober, staring with our eyes and mouths wide open.  I could feel my male friends' good mood deflate (ha!  don't be dirty), as my girl friend and I felt like gender traitors just by being there.\n\nI thought these kind of places were supposed to be rowdy and fun.  Was I expecting too much?  It was the most depressing experience.   I sort of feel bad even writing this, because nobody involved with that joint can be happy, I'm sure.

I can tell the people of Phoenix take great pride in the jewel of the desert. \n\nThe gardens have five trails; the main trail is called the Desert Discovery Loop. Then branching off from this central trail are the plant and people of the Sonoran Desert loop, the Sonoran Desert nature trail, the center for desert living trail and the desert wildflower loop.  \n\nDuring my time spent at the gardens I encountered desert wildflowers, abundant wild life such as humming birds, butterflies, rabbits, roadrunners, ground rodents and countless  varieties of other birds along with herbs and plants used for food, medicine, shelter and other cultural purposes and cactus so many cactus varieties!\n\nThe botanical gardens are so well thought-out that the best way to describe the venue as a whole is simply a work of art!  Oh, did I mention there are wonderful works-of-art scattered through-out the gardens.  Right from the beginning, you know this is someplace special as before you even enter the gardens you come upon a wonderful man made rock formation with three incredible Chihuly glass sculptures titled Desert Towers!\n\nThere is a lot of walking to be done here but the designers have obviously made your comfort a priority.  There are drinking fountains everywhere, several restrooms, a caf\u00e9, nice secluded / shaded sitting areas and benches along all the trails.  \n\nMy recommendation is: make a day of this, take your time, look everywhere, take photographs, have lunch at the patio caf\u00e9, drink lots of water (you are in the desert), put on some comfortable walking shoes and enjoy the show!", "business_id": "qMkIbQFrROSnPaQ7at85-w", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-02-01", "type": "review"}

I have lived here for just a little over 2 years, and I think I've been to the Gardens 5 or 6 times.  I'm from Tennessee and used to love going to their botanical gardens, but the DESERT Botanical Gardens are unlike anything I've ever seen!  I just love walking around there, and I feel like I discover something new every time I'm there.  I love the Chihuly exhibit that's there now.  I've seen it twice.  They also have some wonderful events there.  My favorite is Corks and Cactus, their wine tasting event, which I attended last weekend.  What could be better than wine tasting followed by wandering around amidst a bunch of cacti?  ;)  One of the best trips I had there was in April one year because so many of the cacti were in bloom.  Prior to that, I don't even think I knew that cacti did bloom!  It's just a great place to be.  If you're local and you haven't been, you need to take advantage of having this place nearby!  Get a list of their events!  I took my boyfriend for the first time, and, once he started walking around, he said that he couldn't believe he'd lived here for 2 years and had never been.  If you're visiting, this is definitely a unique way to explore Arizona--it's the Sonoran Desert compressed into an area that you can walk through in a couple of hours!  But if you're going in or close to the summer, be sure to wear a hat and cool clothes, as there's not much shade.  Also, I would recommend skipping their restaurant, Gertrude's.

Even without being lit, the luminaria bags along the pathways were cool anyway and added to the festive scene. On a side note, who lights the over 8,000 luminaria bags anyway? Yikes!\n\nOverall, the gardens are beautiful and the views of the mountains that surround Phoenix are top-notch.

A spoken word event [well technically it was a psychic/medium that has quite the following, who I never heard of]. But I am not here to get into those details. \n\nI pulled into the lot and noticed a sign \"$5 Parking\". WTF?! I had already paid close to $70 for the cheap seat for this event and now I am being charged for parking. Making my way to the box office to pick up my ticket I was intrigued by this round building in the hood. Walking into the \"Club\" portion of the venue I glanced at the prices. Pretty standard $5-10 depending on what your drinking. After paying $5 to park and the cost of the ticket, I had invested enough in this venture already. \nDetermined to get my money's worth I did make use of the ladies room, which was relatively clean. I then stood in line waiting to get in. \n\nThe staff I encountered were friendly. Having not been to this theater before I asked for directions and was directed there with courtesy. The seat numbers were a little confusing. luckily there were not many seats in the row and I was able to count the seats to determine which was seat 8. I was 7 rows from the stage in this small intimate venue. Not bad... \nI could see how this would be nice for a comedy show or a mellow musical performance. [After reading other reviews from Rock/Punk performances I can see how places like the Marquee and The Clubhouse would be more suitable.] \n\nWhile waiting to get in I read the reviews. Several mentioned tight seating. Now I am a big girl and that concerned me. If this is anything smaller than the width of an airplane seat, I am in trouble. Luckily it was better than expected, which doesn't mean much and I was pretty cozy until the people occupying the seats on either side of me sat down. Both ladies had \"super\" purses. You know the ones that hold EVERYTHING, unwilling to put them on the floor and swinging them around everything they would get up. And the other lady spilling her soda on me barely apologizing saying it technically wasn't her fault since they over filled her soda. WTF?! Anyway the tight space was making my patience ware thin. \n\nHowever the theater is becoming quite innovative and in tune with technology. As I waited I was handed a card that advertised the Theater's app for iPhone and Android. This app was designed to keep people in their seats and a theater usher would bring you drinks and snacks ordered directly from your phone. Someones thinkin'..... \n\nWhile I would never spend that much to go see that performer again, the crowd was more entertaining.

There are a lot of people who are giving it 4 and 5 stars, but they are really rating the acts they saw there and how wonderful a time they had. They aren't truly rating the theater itself. Let me give you the PROS and CONS of Celebrity Theater.\n\nCONS:\n1. Parking:  If you get there late, good luck finding a spot. There are hardly any parking lines to assist you. If you get there when everyone else is, you may even have to wait to turn into the parking area. I always try to get there 45-60min before the show starts. Yes, it's a little early, but you will find a parking spot without much problem and you'll have time to get some beers, snacks and hit the restroom before the show starts. \n\n2. Concession Stand: It's your typical drink and snack bar. Beer is like $6-$7 and popcorn $3. Everything is overpriced like the movie theater. The food is just average at best. The lines can be very long if you get their late. I got their early and still had to wait about 20min to get my drink/food. \n\n3. Bathrooms: They weren't the cleanest in the world. There was toilet paper in the stalls and soap in the containers. So that was a plus. This wasn't the bathroom at the Bellagio, that for sure. If you can, go before you leave home, do it. Try not to drink or eat anything prior. \n\n4. The Theater: It's old. The stage is a nice size, but the seats are very small. If you are a tall or a wide person, you probably won't be too comfortable sitting in these seats. I'm 5'8\" and I still had to pull my knees in so not to hit the seat in front of me. I don't believe there are any cup holders for your drinks. If there are, it's attached to the back of the seats in front of you. It's pretty dark in this place as well. Almost like a move theater before the movie starts. \n\nPROS:\n\n1. The Shows: This is the main reason we go to this theater. They have some of the best shows here. I've seen Sinbad, Katt Williams and the 70s Soul Jam performers which include (The Delfonics, Ray, Goodman & Brown, The Stylistics, Bloodstone & The Main Ingredient). All these shows were fabulous. Absolutely worth the money. Sinbad started like 15min late, but he kept telling jokes till after 11:30p at night. He said, \"I can go on all night\" Make sure you folks get your moneys worth. He was very funny. Katt Williams was also good and a little over the top.His voice can grind your last nerve after an hour of listening to him. The 70's Soul Jam was spectacular. Each group sang a least 3-5 songs each. I loved it. Most of them sounded just as good as their records. \n\nSo even though the Celebrity Theater itself isn't the greatest, the acts they are able to pull in are awesome. If you can deal with the parking, seats and bathroom, then definitely go and see your favorite acts here. \n\nI gave them 3 our 5 stars.  (1 star for the theater itself & 2 stars for the incredible acts, and the fun & enjoyment I had.", "business_id": "BcBxTyj09Wu-w0KA1QvKTA", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-12-08", "type": "review"}

It is old, and it is aging with friendliness and grace.  Yes,the seats are too close together, but it isn't your kitchen.  Three hours and you are out of there.  The bathrooms are small, and as the evening wears on, they are dirty.  You would be too.\n\nBut when you can drive on great freeways and pull off to a completely gated and guarded arena with enclosed and cheap available parking ($5), that is a good thing.  \n\nBut the enduring quality of the Celebrity Theater is its size and its up close feeling.  This place is a gem which allows you the leisure of a reserved seat and the ability to get up and move about at any time.  If what you are doing is going to hear the music or see the talent, this place may be perfect for you.  If you are making the scene, you might prefer something else.\n\n(Bob Weir Show.

After a drink on the patio, we headed inside for our next round and decided to just cozy up to the bar. The inside decor is not going to wow you at all, but I appreciate the amount of TVs they have near the bar, showing everything from women's college basketball to English Premier League soccer. I'm also a big fan of bar sports, so the pool table and dart boards in the back get a thumbs up from me as well.\n\nThe draft beer selection is large...probably the largest of any of the pubs I have visited in the Valley. I believe it was about $4.75 for a pint, which is slightly cheaper than pubs like Rula Bula. The menu runs the gammet from traditional British fare to very Americanized food with very very moderate prices. Chris had a fish sandwich which he enjoyed and I had a BLT which I requested with no mayo. However, more than half way into the sandwich I realized there was mayo on it! This shocked me because normally I can always detect mayo on sandwiches as I hate it so much...so I'm not sure what G&D did, but they snuck mayo past me and I still loved the sandwich! The fries that came with the sandwiches were tasty. Our bill  (before tip) after five pints of beer, an appetizer, and two sandwiches came to $40.\n\nThe two bartenders that waited on us were incredibly friendly and quick.

The staff gets perfect marks for ignoring us, This time the joint wasn't to busy so figured we would have a decent chance at getting service. Well we sort of got service from a staff member who seemed annoyed we bothered her to order. The drinks were slow to come out and for beer it wasn't very cold. Before we could ask for waters our server ran away. We did finally order \"food\" the curry wings looked like a pile of gooey vomit and didn't taste much better. There were three of us at the table, each regretfully had one wing and shoved the rest to the side. I ordered the Halo burger which had a crisp cheddar ring around it which was the best part. The burger itself was something straight from the freezer, pre-made greasy as all can be. No flavor and the condiments that came with the burger were the standard fare. The steak fries as a side should have stayed in the kitchen. They were underdone and soggy. No flavor either. My wife ordered the french dip, something that usually you can't screw up. Well these guys at G&D are batting 1000 with subpar food, I've tasted better french dips at hospital cafeterias. Our friend ordered the Reuben grinder, he said it was OK, but again the fries stayed on the plate. Our wait staff was non existent. She never bothered to check on us once. We had to stand up to show that we were ready for our check...that really didn't work so our friend had to track her down. Plan to ask for your check well ahead of time as they do not value your time. I guess we are the idiots for trying the place again but really you might get em on a bad day so give them the benefit of the doubt and try em again. Well twice was WAY more than I will be spending there. I know they have a lot of regulars and maybe these folks are fine with the usual horrible AZ customer service and crappy food. I for one, coming from Chandler, like to enjoy a decent meal.

My first experience at the place was a few weeks after moving.  It was the middle of August and the AC and all refrigeration at the place had gone out.  Despite the rising heat in the place the bartenders were still moving quickly behind the bar and trying to make the most of the situation for the customers.  They let people know the situation and were knocking down prices as beers started to get a lil warm before things got fixed later on in the early evenning.  I noticed that lots of people still stuck around even with it getting pretty warm inside.  That to me meant on a regular day this was a good spot.\n\nEver since that first time and thinking there was a reason people stuck around, my thoughts have been proved right each time I go.  I have never had a bad time when I go into G&D.  The food is great, especially with the newer menu and cooking staff.  I have yet to have a bad item when I order food.  Most recently had the Turkey Club and it was a huge sandwich and very good.  The wings are always great and the potato soup on Thursdays is a good eat during Trivia.  Yeah, I said it, soup in AZ.\n\nStaff has always been great.  Like the servers at any and all restaurants, there are good servers and ok servers.  At G&D it is no different but here the OK servers are better than most you will find at other small pubs and bars.  When it gets overly busy orders can run slow but that should be expected during a huge rush.  Over all I have found that the staff is great and if you go there to enjoy yourself and treat them well, they return the favor.  I have been going to the G&D long enough that I have gotten to know most of the staff and have not had a bad experience with any of them.\n\nI am a big fan of this place and try to make it there once a weekend.  I rarely miss a Trivia night on Thursdays.

The atmosphere is very relaxing and welcoming.  As I  sat muling over the menu I enjoyed listening to the random music being played.  In the short time I was at George and Dragon I  listened to  metal, George Michael, Aretha Franklin, classical and everything in between. \n\nThe customer service at George and Dragon in amazing.  The servers  were very accommodating without being intrusive. Our server took the time to explain the menu and even offered suggestions based on our preferences.\n\nMoving onto the food.  The food at George and Dragon is great and served piping hot (which I truly enjoy).  The unique combinations of flavors were prepared and presented perfectly.  My lunch party and I tried Bangers & Mash, Roasted Vegetable Pastie, fish& chip, Shepherd Pie, and Meatloaf. All of the entr\u00e9es were delicious. \n\nEven though we were full from lunch because at George and Dragon the servings are large. We had to try dessert. So we ordered blackberry crumble and  bread pudding.

It's not unsafe or anything, yet I like how you feel a bit off the beaten path when you come here. There's a few places to park along the East side or in the back.

I'm told the beer selection is good, although when I tried to order something seasonal, they didn't have anything. Bummer. Instead, I went with the tried-and-true Sam Adams, followed by a Stella Artois. Both were served in a bottle, although the bartender tried to pour my Sam Adams into a glass. I had to stop him. \"Just the bottle,\" I said. \"That's enough for me.\" If memory serves me, each beer cost me $4. My companions opted for draft pints of Coors and Michelob Ultra.

I think they went from Rehab to Richard Cheese.

Oh, but I wanted to be. I mean, a local brewhouse right down the street from where I live? I thought for sure this would become my home away from home. Instead, it was so mediocre and underwhelming, I can't help but wonder, \"Will I ever be back?\" Probably not. \n\nMy friend and I walked into the restaurant side of Sonora. I wanted to sit in the Den, where the brews are crafted. We were told to cross over the patio to the place next door. Alright. So, we did. Hardly anyone was there. In fact, the place didn't really pick up until the time we were leaving. Must've been the football game that drew people in, for there was a flat screen plasma TV behind the bar. \n\nSpeaking of bar, I was excited to try their Vanilla Porter. I was told it was so good, it would make you wanna slap yo' mama. \"My mama needs a good slappin',\" I thought. Well, she didn't get it. Ok, so maybe vanilla + beer isn't my thing, but I wanted to try something new, something special to this brewhouse. After all, isn't that the point? The kick and finish of this beer did not impress me. In fact, I struggled a bit to finish  my pint, which, was $2.75 during happy hour. At the very least, the prices to whet my whistle were great! \n\nMy friend and I opted to try the food. I felt brave and ordered the bratwurst. Maybe I'm not a bratwurst person, for it was just okay. Nothing else on the menu appealed to me, even though they do tend to have a variety (fish and chips to grilled salmon to soup and burgers). \n\nThe layout of the place was somewhat unusual. I mean, two seating areas connected by an outdoor patio area (with heaters). That was cool, except that when my friend and I left the Den, we had to cross the patio to get to the exit (in the other building). Along the way, I got one giant whiff of cigarette smoke. Yep, that's just what I wanted to top off what had become a very bland and unenthusiastic experience.", "business_id": "3UMcsN9IjoeV8JZvC4apag", "stars": 2, "date": "2007-12-14", "type": "review"}

Except that nobody seems to know my name there in spite of how frequently I come. But then, I'm not part of the 30-something clientle who sets up shop at the bar.\n\nI roll into a booth or a high table that has the best view of the games that are on. It's a great place to come down and see local sports or tie one on after a terrible local sports performance. Not great because of the televisions or presentation of the games in any way(which is just two smaller flat screen TVs with no sound in the main room), but because of the laid-back, true-to-its-locale atmosphere it emits. It just seems perfectly in place and makes it feel natural  to hang out and throw some back more then any other bar around town that tries to force its motif into a Phoenix landscape it just doesn't jive with.\n\nAnd of course the food and beverage there don't hurt its cause at all. I do agree with some people's sentiments about particular beers not being up to snuff compared to other breweries. My particular complaint is with their Pale Ale, which tastes like an IPA, and their IPA, which tastes like a medicinal strength IPA. But in spite of some quibbles with the beers here, they really do have some fantastic stuff. For some reason, the beer that is my standby there is the Light Rail Cream Ale, which is in stark contrast to the Brown and Amber Ales I typically get at other breweries. Its got that perfect taste/refreshment balance that acts as a Siren's call to bring me back here at least once a week.\n\nThe burgers, salads, and pizza's are also fantastic. But the real find here is the bread pudding, which has got to be one of the best bread pudding's in existence. I always try to eat slow to make room for it. Luckily, this is a place that won't care how long you cement yourself to a seat.\n\nWhich again, makes this place perfect for some Suns action or whatever is going on. But I probably remember my trips here best after catastrophic defeats. Last year after the Sun's officially bowed out of the playoffs without a championship for yet another season, and with my brother after ASU (he's an alum) lost to Oregon are the first that come to mind. The classic rock and the atmosphere and the beer (don't forget the beer) seem to breath new life into me during such trying circumstances.

Which means that I was really hoping for more. I was hoping that this place would be a little lived in, a little less polished, a little less new Phoenix. It's kind of odd that big box chain food spots work at trying to get that aged look by throwing junk up on the walls and hanging it from the ceilings. Not at the Sonora Brewhouse, they'll have none of that here, but that's okay.\n\nYes, they brew their own beers and yes it's good and more than decent. The food is better than average and always cooked. Even when you ask for your Kobe burger to be cooked medium with the hope that you'll see some red, it'll come out with no pink at all. Sadly, I wasn't expecting anything different.\n\nDo I sound disappointed? Do I sound like I'm sitting in a box of self pity? Oh woe is me, they FULLY cooked my burger. Oh woe is me, the beer is good and the steak fries have the perfect crispness on the outside and mashy-goodness on the inside. The quality at Sonora Brewhouse is what I expect at any of the big box chain restaurants like Gordon Biersch, but never get. The problem here is that they can be so much more. Food + Ambiance (personality) = Greatness. Sonora Brewhouse is missing the heart.\n\nThey're polite and not offensive in anyway, walking the definition of middle.\n\nThis is both surprising and disappointing since they have been around for a while, but also because just a block to the east, Rosie McCaffrey's is overflowing with heart and soul, more than you can imagine. If they can find it, tourists probably love Sonora, but remember, tourists often love going to another branch of the same TGI Friday's that they have in their own suburbia, while on vacation in a different town.\n\nOkay, so Sonora Brewhouse isn't anywhere near the low level of a TGI Friday's, but it's almost as clean, boring, and devoid of personality, being almost completely unmemorable. Oh. They also probably have the thinnest Kobe burger patties I've ever seen, at least the steak fries and beer are good. My advice?

Once we moved down here, we started pining for the brewery scene. We gave Sonora brewhouse a shot.\n\nGranted, our expectations are very high. OCB is THE social hub for the locals. We knew we weren't going to find the same thing here, being that Phoenix has so many cool haunts available.\n\nWhat we were looking for was a good patio, good beer, and a good atmosphere. Sonora Brewhouse delivers on all counts. The good food was a bonus. It's not great food, but it'll do. We've learned to stick to a few select items. \n\nThe chips and salsa are wonderful. If you're lucky, the flour tortilla chips will still be warm. They are fluffy, light, and delicately crisp. The salsa is the traditional smooth style, with just the right amount of heat. \n\nThe other go-to food item is the American Kobe beef burger. It is so juicy, so flavorful and delicious. It's big enough to share, if you're more interested in sampling the beer, but want a snack to keep you going -- which is my usual strategy.\n\nI'm not really wowed by the beers. I think I have tried four or five of them, and of those, only two stood out for me. The seasonal vanilla porter is lovely and luscious, like a creme brulee in a pint glass - but without overdoing it. Typically, I am a dark beer drinker, but the Light Rail Cream Ale won me over. For a light beer, it has surprising amounts of body and flavor. One could easily wile away a warm Winter's afternoon kicking those back.\n\nAs for the atmosphere, it is casual, but I wouldn't say friendly. I've been there probably six or seven times, and haven't had a single conversation with a stranger. \n\nAlso, they play great music -- if you can hear it! Often, I can make out faint notes of Janis Joplin or the Doors. I'm told that the patio speakers are as loud as they can get.

Needless to say, I wasn't in the best mood and I had thought I was settling in for an evening of fantastic food served in small portions on pristine white dishes.\n\nInstead, I pulled a 180 and went to SunUp because it was close and it was on my food list.\n\nThe interior didn't put me off. Though it's not a \"classy\" brewpub, the interior sports soft lighting, Spanish colors and a certain amount of elegance. I'm not saying you should take a date here if you're trying to impress her, but it's certainly acceptable before or after a movie.\n\nThe atmosphere is laid back. A curved bar sits behind a simple floor stacked with numerous square tables both normal and high-top. Brewing equipment stands behind a plastic wall off to one side. A small doorway leads to a narrow room lined with booths on either side. The place is not that big, but it's not small either.\n\nThe menu consists of standard pub fare with a few Spanish touches. Appetizers have the normal dips and fried dishes. The homemade bruschetta caught my eye, however. It was a bit strong on the garlic and not very well done. Outside of the typical burgers, sandwiches and wraps, they do feature some interesting entrees. I ordered the special - shrimp fajitas. It came with one giant flour tortilla which confused me, but overall it wasn't bad. My friend ordered the salmon which was a much better effort.\n\nAs for the beer, they featured six standard offerings along with three seasonal. Of the typical offerings, most were a little too sweet and a little low on the hop side, especially those of lighter color meant to appeal to the masses. However, the low amounts of hops did allow the floral and citrus notes to come through on the IPA. My favorite was the seasonal Red along with the Vanilla Porter, which though sweet, had a robust chocolaty character. Bonus point for the dry-hopped, cask conditioned version of the IPA as well.\n\nThe service was alright. She didn't know much about the beers, but could at least distinguish one from the other via color, even among those that looked quite similar.\n\nOverall, the place is alright.

Maybe some remember the old Tommy Knocker's, but that's as close as we have ever had. Recently when SunUp split from Sonora Brewhouse, they also added a brewery next door and have been increasing in popularity ever since. However, they come up short in terms of providing a top quality microbrewery, and SunUp only shines as a good neighborhood bar that happens to brew their own beers. \n\nOn mutiple visits, I've tried multiple beers. The first visit, sampling the Red Cask Ale, I had a mostly positive feel about the beer. It was bold, reasonably priced, and packed quite a punch. I also sampled the Light Rail Cream Ale that night, which was essentially a standard ale by my count. The bartender explained while serving it that the name is \"a bit misleading\" because most, like myself, are expecting more of an ale with a stout-like finish. The Vanilla Porter is their best brew in my opinion, with the most distinct flavor and a perfect balance in aroma. I've become quite enamored with porters lately and SunUp's didn't disappoint, but it also didn't drive me to proclaim it one of the best porters around.\n\nService at the restaurant has been hit and miss. One visit with an empty bar, we were waited on hand and foot, but also felt as though the staff wanted to close up and go home. They were putting chairs on the tables, sweeping the floors, and doing general closing duties, though they insisted they were not closing for a \"couple more hours.\" Another visit I sat at the bar for quite some time with no bartender present, and the bar obvoiusly understaffed.\n\nAll in all, it's a welcome addition, and compliments the other establishments popping up around Central and Camelback very nicely. Unfortunately, Central Phoenix could still use a top-notch microbrewery. SunUp, right now, has too many inconsistencies, and doesn't have great enough beer to make them not matter.

Their beer sampler is definitely a good way to get started. It's served in a row of glasses slightly larger than shot glasses. You'll have to ignore the temptation to pound them one after the other... at least on your first go-round. All of their beers are certainly quality and quite enjoyable, though there didn't seem to be a huge \"wow\" factor with any of them. In no way will I hold that against them though, as none of the local AZ brews (that I've tried) seem to be doing anything very far outside of the box.\n\nNot only should you visit Sun Up to check out their craft, you should definitely go to try their eats. Their wings are probably the  best I have ever had; fried perfectly and still nice and moist, plus their \"hot\" sauce had a finely-tuned heat factor. Their sliders were dynamite as were the accompanying sweet potato fries and garlic parmesan fries. \n\nThe service was fast and very friendly, and the establishment (men's room included) was very well-kept.

SunUp however, was open and was my first suggestion so that I could still hang out with my lovely lady friend who is also a connoisseur of fine beers.\n\nSunUp turned out to be a cozy little place to enjoy beer and some righteous grubble. Knowing that my drinking companion was also a vegetarian (although she allows for bacon, which makes her an ovolactopesciporkatarian), we chose to split the nachos (sans meat) and the smoked salmon reuben. We also sampled the onion rings, which were downright tasty (especially if you sweet talk the waitress into bringing you a side of the remoulade that is normally served with their shrimp)! Although I found the smoked salmon reuben a tad on the salty side, I appreciated the fact that it was served on a nice marble rye.\n\nAs for the beer, I found it fresh and quite drinkable. They offer their own house beers as well as guest taps, so I found the selection was ample enough to satisfy my beer wanderlust. The atmosphere was my favorite element of SunUp... it seems to be a great gathering place and yet it is intimate enough to serve as a decent place to take a date.

I usually prefer amber or brown ales but there is something a little off about their amber. So, I did not really ever make it a point to visit their brewery before. Then I saw that last week, for AZ beer week, they were doing something kind of fun. Beer floats. That's right, they had paired four of their beers with different flavors of gelato: cream ale with strawberry gelato, pale ale with blood orange sorbet, amber with sea salt caramel gelato and vanilla porter with tahitian vanilla gelato. Some were better than others but it made for a fun experience. I just love the fact that there are so many breweries in town now and they each have their own vibe but yet they are all part of the local craft beer community.\n\nThe brewery itself was very homey and comfortable. It was decorated with a lot of wood paneling that was probably left over from the seventies but it gave it sort of a cozy country lodge feel. They have a nice inner courtyard with a secluded patio even though they are on a major street in the middle of downtown. There is a larger separate room where it seems most people who are eating a meal get a table, but the main bar area is pretty small. Most of the people there seemed to be regulars and it was an eclectic mix of ages and personalities. The bartender (who was also the hostess and the server) was very friendly and that also contribuited to the warm and fuzzy feeling we got while sitting at the bar.\n\nThough I don't go that often, I will probably return to SunUp. Firstly because I have discovered that their porter is actually pretty good, and secondly because it just seems like a cool place to hang out. The main thing that kept them from another star was the awful smell in the ladies room. My hubby said it was even worse in the mens. Gross.

Their description says that this is their closest thing to a domestic and I couldn't agree more. It's light, crisp and refreshing. \n\nNow to the food. We started with the pretzel bites which were okay. The best part about them was the side of mustard. It was actual legit mustard with mustard seeds, not the yellow nasty goop people put on hot dogs at baseball games. \n\nThen I had the Trooper IPA Pulled Pork sandwich with a side of the Green Chile Mac & Cheese. The sandwich had cole slaw on it with delicious tender BBQ pulled pork. I haven't had a BBQ sandwich that good since I left the South. I also haven't sought out BBQ too much since I've been in Phoenix, but bottom line is that it was a really good sandwich. \n\nThe Mac & Cheese was also a winner. Giant elbow pasta with a nice mix of creamy and stringy cheese in each bite.

We waited maybe 15 minutes until we were seated.  After a short time our waiter came by and rattled through the specials.  Once he left we were unsure of what he actually said.  I knew before I arrived I would order some escargot and decided to go with some kind of halibut special.  The escargot came and did not taste as great as I had remembered.

Watch yourself in the bathrooms though...\n\nShuffleboard, pool tables, people watching, and cheap eats and drinks are all in store for those brave enough to hang at Pommies.  They even have darts, fooseball, and a small respectable arcade that boasts Deer Hunter.  \n\nAs far as food goes, it is the quintessential bar food.  Served on paper plates...just like you have at home.  The burger and chili cheese fries are my favorites and the beers are ice cold. \n\nA good casual place to just hang out - Pomeroy's holds a special place in my heart and always delivers a good time.

The sound has always been pretty good at this place which is perhaps one of the saving graces. \n\nThe last time I was here they allowed smoking inside. I'd say it an improvement. They have fans on the ceiling, but they don't run them. Air doesn't circulate and since there's no smoke anymore to cover up the smells, every 5 minutes you have to endure someones nasty ass gas. Yes, people at the Rhythm Room are farters. Perhaps because they are so full of hot air? The Room draws a bit of an artsy (yet very diverse) crowd.\n\nApart from the lack of oxygen and the dungeon-like darkness with no windows and the boxy prison-like 4 walls and the cheap uncomfortable seating - this place is pretty charming.

Small venues are fine if you are not the only audience member and will be missed if you need to get up to pee.  The beer is cold but my friends who prefer a gin and tonic can also be taken care of. The people who work there are nice, no attitude, and are actually very cool. If it gets a little crowded or if you feel like chatting someone up they have a patio.

Apparently on the weekends there is karaoke, and let me tell you, this is not your average karaoke experience! I mean, karaoke where 3/4 of the people that sing actually have decent to really good voices?? Geez, where are the horrible screeching renditions of \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\" or \"Fergalicious\"??? Oh wait...that's right my husband was there and sang the latter...and he was awful, but in a funny way. If you do go to participate in karaoke, there are plenty of TV screens with the words. I really liked that a few TVs were reserved to show football and Sportscenter!\n\nApollo's itself is a moderately sized establishment with an outdoor patio. I only saw the ladies bathroom, cleverly marked with a \"Goddesses\" sign, but it was tiny; however, there was never a line as most of the crowd was of the male persuasion. My husband and I had beer, so I can't comment on the prices for mixed drinks or shots, but beer was cheaper than most places I have been to in the Valley. Bud light drafts were $2.75 and Fat Tire drafts were $3. Since I was the designated driver that evening, I switched to soda halfway through the night, which was $2 and included free refills. The bartenders were extremely friendly and very prompt in service. There is also a waiter that floats throughout the space if you don't want to go up to the bar.\n\nThe crowd ebbed and flowed throughout the evening, but it never got so full of people where I was getting knocked into or where it was impossible to move. All and all, a very laid back place where you can just hang out, chat, and enjoy singing along with \"Sweet Caroline\".", "business_id": "lLI8ObL8aCVbkrrtAW0EHw", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-12-09", "type": "review"}

With that, I'm already out of things I like, so I suggest you spend no more than that here and leave.   \n\nI only went to meet friends, and a good friend at that.  I would have passed any other time.   \n\nI order a Stella on draught, served right, even in the Stella glass.  They do know how to serve beer and other alcoholic drinks here, like, in the strictest sense of being able to pour a non-skunked brew or a strong cocktail in the right glass.   Not much else, unfortunately.\n\n$4.75, the bartender tells me.  I hand him my Visa.  \n\n\"It's cash only.\"   \n\nMy vision blurs as I strain to quell my irritation as we're already off to a great start.  I should have left right there, but that would have probably been illegal and the Stella looked pretty good.  \n\nI take out a $20 from the ATM, the last ATM in Arizona that still dials out. So I spent my time waiting looking for skimmers because nobody else would have noticed one in a place this cheap.   \n\nI like paying $5 in fees for a $5.75 beer.   I really do.   (With tip, as its not his fault his job sucks.)\n\nAs I find out, I pulled the last $20 out of the ATM before it *ran out of money.*  If I intended on pulling more out to lessen the 25% tax on my cash, I would've been doubly irritated.  \n\nSo when the bartender switches the policy from \"cash only\" to \"we take plastic\" after I just went out of my way and money to comply...I didn't know there was another reason I don't want to go back but the morons who run this place figured one out.  \n\nThe stale-beer-and-sweat smell was getting to me by the time my friend needed a cigarette.   But forget seeking your respite on their \"patio.\"    \n\nTheir \"patio\" is more like a planemullkip, a word I had to just make up from the German translation for \"a tarp stretched over a garbage dump.\"  \n\nNo prior English word better describes this pathetic joke--It smells worse outside, there's no furniture, but there is plenty of garbage and you can't even take your drink out.\n\nMaybe it's intentional--they've duplicated being just as cheap, annoying, and lazy on the outside as they have inside.   The tiny bathroom that forces everyone to watch you take a dump is just like the rest of the place:  all the charm and appeal of a rural county lock-up, right down to the same suicide-proof sheet-metal toilet.  Even if you get off on this sort of thing despite the many inherent travesties, go elsewhere.  \n\nIncidentally, I really like setting my coaster on top of my drink and adjusting it so just in case one of the creepy trolls here GHB's my drink, I'll notice.\n\nA use permit is something like $500 from the city for outdoor alcohol  consumption, and they might pay that much in fencing.   Instead, I just I don't get it.  I first went here 7 years ago and I can tell they've made about $300 in capital improvements since then, all from Goodwill.\n\nOutside lives a $30 heater, they have a $150 website, and $100 for a used LCD or two.   One of the LCDs was displaying a completely different faded illegible picture than the one on the same channel next to it, putting the rampant cheapness here in striking contrast to the one new thing that worked--the jukebox probably wasn't theirs and didn't work either.   Who even knew you could get a website from Goodwill?\n\nThe last $20 they must have spent is for the annoying plastic flaps they hang on the back door to lessen their AC bills.\n \nThis place reeks of cheap.  And not in a good way like a cheap beer, the sort of thing I'll tolerate a lot for.  \n\nRoscoe's is cheap like \"you've got to be kidding me\" cheap or \"the smell just made me throw up in my mouth\" cheap, both of which negate any benefit of cheap beer. \n\nRocoe's survives on two things:  being the one gay sportsbar in town and being the one thing to do on a Tuesday night.   \n\nSo I give it a 2 out of 10.  It covers its bases, but that's it.   I'll say it a third time.\n\nEven if you like that sort of thing, just go elsewhere.", "business_id": "7srDFwPPnzBaQoPW55Dc8Q", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-12-08", "type": "review"}

Another great thing is that it was inexpensive $5 for the cheeseburger, $4 for the hamburger and $4 for the rings and fries.  \n\nIf you watch Diners, Drive-ins and Dives on the Food Network they would refer to this place as a Dive and I think the people their would not mind.

It took about five minutes to get someone to notice us.  Once we got the attention of the waitress she was apologetic and seemed very nice.  The booths were really small and seemed to be made by someone who got a C in shop class.

The onion rings were so good, (crispy outside, soft onions inside) it felt like they were actually melting in my mouth. The burger absolute perfection, from the soft bun and juicy meat to the fresh lettuce, tomato and onion adorning it. I added ketchup and mustard to mine and it was simply heavenly. \n\nThe bartenders are friendly without being annoying/hover-y...in fact, you may need to flag one down if you want another drink, but it was exactly what I was looking for and I will definitely stumble my way back there again instead of always driving by.

After the bartender assured me that my food will be cooked properly I came in and picked up my replacement food. He was also good enough to refund me a couple of my drinks from earlie which made up for the hassle. That burger he cooked himself and it was good. He also took the lady who made my burger off the grill.\n     Today I went there and picked up some food to go. The same lady who cooked my burger before, was working the grill. I didn't want to be a dick and ask for someone else to cook it and I decided to give her another chance.

I wanted to get dessert but I had a long night ahead of me so I will have to get something next time. I did see a few desserts come out and looked great. Overall the place is great and I have a feeling I will become a regular. The server we had was the nicest guy.

We gnoshed on those delicious burgers accompanied w/ garlic horseradish mashed potatoes ooooweee!

PCG is a very classy little restaurant that is low-lit and practically perfect for dinner, vino and conversation. The staff is very professional and helpful, and it was undoubtedly a pleasure to be served by them.\n\nThe food was good, though a bit steep in the pricing department. I tried their famous corn cakes, and I also got to try the 16th Street Pot Roast and Rose Lane Chicken. The corn cake was the highlight of the meal for me. Imagine the flavor of corn bread (that's not dry, mind you) accompanied with chicken, salsa, black beans, and topped with some jack cheese. Mmm! Every flavor really complimented each other really well. That appetizer was what a fancy southwestern appetizer should be like. The pot roast was also delicious, and I would say the same about the chicken. The meat in both dishes was cooked just right, flaky and tender for the roast, and perfectly juicy (not wet, but not dry) for the chicken. Both entrees were very comfort food-ish.\n\nI hope to eat at PCG again sometime soon.

Somehow PCG manages to crisp the bacon perfectly without overcooking the (somewhat huge) shrimp. The tartar-sauce like dipping sauce, however, was too creamy. It took away from sweetness of the shrimp and saltiness of the bacon. We found the vinaigrette on the bed of greens the shrimp were served on to be a better, brighter accompaniment, that did not take away from the other flavors.\n\nEntrees were amazing.

Even if you are allergic to corn, take the plunge and try these...unless you might die, then stay away as that might be bad PR for PCG.  Topped with smoked ham (that's what I had), chicken, or bacon and served with maple syrup, it was beyond good.  I could eat this dish every day of my life.

The accompanying roasted beets were not my thing, and the mashed potatoes were okay (maybe I'm picky about potatoes?)  I also tried a bit of my dining companion's beef tenderloin and it was butter-knife tender (that's what I cut it with).

We actually shared half, and I most generously took the other half to my husband who I left at home.

Since this was the first time I didn't make the trip home to San Francisco for Christmas, I had absolutely no idea what to do with my Christmas Eve. Matt and I need plans! Therefore, after doing some investigative work on the internet as to what Arizonians can do in Phoenix on Christmas Eve, I came across PCG and their special menu for the holiday. Their prime rib and sea bass specials looked mouthwatering so I made reservations. In the end, this place did not disappoint!! I will unquestionably be back. \n\nI started out with a strong and tart pomegranate margarita that wasn't too sweet. I don't like it when margaritas are sugary so this one was perfect, and a great way to get my Christmas festivities started. \n\nFor my main course I opted to try the sea bass special. It came with almond crusted asparagus and some garlicky (and insanely buttery) rosemary mashed potatoes. How would I describe the entire meal? In one word, perfection! That sea bass was so fresh and delicious it practically swam right up to my plate. You can't really go wrong with asparagus but this wasn't just your regular vegetable. They coated the asparagus with a crunchy layer of almonds and it was soooooo tasty. And yeah, the mashed potatoes tasted like they had about 5 cubes of butter in them... but that's the best way to make em!\n\nI wish I had known about this place sooner because it really is such a delightful restaurant. The atmosphere isn't too lively but it isn't too dull. Tons of families, friends and large groups filled the interior so PCG really suits any age demographic. I loved the decorations that they had up for Christmas, and I highly recommend dining here for any holiday. They really do an all around excellent job at providing an awesome dining experience. \n\nWhen I was there I also noticed that they have a really nice bar with an even nicer happy hour... so once I get the chance, I'm going to head right back here and try it out! Everyone in AZ needs to know about this place.

I had the special of the evening, seafood linguine with shrimp and crab and lemon capers butter sauce, .   WOW!!   It was great.  In fact, beyond great.    I was trying to figure out how the pasta was flavored with every bite I put in my mouth.  I think I shall call the restaurant and find out.    It was the right mix of ingredients, not too buttery, which would make it oily/greasy.   The right amount of capers, which, if there's too many, overpowers the other flavors, and the right mix of barely knowing it also contained lemon.     Oh, yes, he had the Grilled Beef Tenderloin.    Since he is on a \"low carb\" diet, he asked to exchange the starch for veggies.    I was thinking about having that, but I am more of a seafood, chicken gal versus beef.    I tried it.   It was good, the beef was very tender.    Sorry, can't give a review from  just one bite.   My wine was the cab, Sebastiani, Sonoma Black Cherry.    No, I don't follow the white with the seafood/chicken \"rule.\"     I like cabs.    It was good.    I shall go back, you can count on it.

I was the first to arrive and waited at the tables outside for my party to arrive.  After a couple were there, we went inside to get some beverages and went upstairs for a table.  The beverage selection was good, I was drinking beer, and while they didn't have anything on tap that I was interested in that night, there were several in their selection of bottles.  Some more of our group arrived, and a cheese tray was ordered, and it was decided that we were going to go sit outside, b/c they were starting up the heaters.  We got a table right under a heater, not too far from three dudes playing music.  I probably would have rather stayed inside, if only because of the music...I'm not against music per se, but I have trouble listening/focusing on conversation when music is being played.  Anywho, the funny part about this was that at one point, the band brought up some girl from the crowd who sang two songs with them.  For whatever reason, the conversation stopped on the patio.  Not sure if everybody knew her or what, but another guy and I just started talking...I mean, if we were talking during the band, why not talk during this girl's singing?  Hopefully we weren't too loud and didn't offend her.  Anywho, the cheese tray was good, but wish it had been labeled, because whoever brought out the tray did not do a good job at telling us what was what (I can't even remember if one of our group brought it out or an employee).  One other minor problem was that our heater went out (ran out of gas) but no one ever came over to restart it, and it got cold...  \n\nOverall four stars.  Pretty good happy hour specials and a nice setting.

Pullpork in a not super sticky, more savory, bbq sauce, cole slaw on top on an onion roll. This place can definitely do pulled pork correctly, it was a tiny bit dry, but still great flavor and piled high. The macaroni salad was whatever. A lil too mayonaisey and not much flavor.

It seems that in those cases they are wanting The Duck to be something it's clearly not; a mainstream-mass production-delivary running-squeeky clean-just-like-every-there kinda place. If that's what you are looking for then I would suggest going to AJ's, they might be a better fit for you.\n\nDuck and Decanter has been around for longer than I have been around. They have won award after award for the best sandwich in town. I am surprised Kanye hasn't busted in on a subway commercial and told Jared that he would let him finish, but Duck and Decanter has the best stuff EVER! It has a homey feel, that makes you almost say (as Jeff L. put it) \"Am I still in Phoenix?\" \n\nThey have daily soups and special sandwiches. Their cheese is out of this world, the best provolone I have ever had for sure. They slice all their meat in house and very thin, perfect! I would tell you what sammy is my favorite, but that list would go on way too long. Turkey on a croissant, bree with roasted red peppers and prosciutto, garlic chicken salad, BLT.... \n\nThe Duck is the perfect spot to have lunch out on the patio on a sunny Saturday or Sunday. They have a musician playing music most of the time and sometimes even have cute little farmers markets and art fests. It is perfectly tucked back in the shopping center with Sports Authority shielding you from the hustle and bustle. There is a fun grass area for pets and children to run around on. They also have some great knickknack shopping available to pa-ruse while you wait for your food. They have all kinds of coffee, tea, dishware, cookware, marinades, candy, drinks, wind chimes, magnets, jewelry, specialty gifts, and so on and so on.

My first impression was. Not good. There was no landscaping, vegetation or flowers. Felt like we were sitting on a concrete slab in the shopping center parking lot.  Also looked a bit trashy with several dirty tables left unattended. Ambiance a big Zero.  After about 25 mins of waiting outside at the table the rest of my party came out with brown paper bags and drink cups.  In that amount of time we could of had a fabulous sit down and served lunch at one of the many great caf\u00e9s in the neighborhood. They said it was busy ordering the food and only two persons working behind the line taking orders.  On a busy Sunday afternoon this is unacceptable. I ordered a BLT on sourdough bread with a side of coleslaw.  For almost $8.00 per sandwich they could afford to be a little less chinsy with them. The sourdough bread was just cheap white bread that you can buy at the grocery for 99 cents per loaf.  There were exactly 2 slices of over cooked bacon with a piece of brown wilted lettuce on mayo.  The only ingredient they were generous with was the whole tomato that was sliced and piled on the sandwich to make it appear that it was a heartier sandwich.  I didn't order a big fat tomato and mayo sandwich. Shame on you Duck and Decenter.  My side of coleslaw was practically inedible.  Coleslaw swimming in watered down slaw sauce (more like mayonnaise and warm milk) was not at all tasty.  Another person in my party ordered an over priced spinach salad with barely any spinach.  She never told them when ordering yo hold the spinach. Really people!!!! Also she had to wait another 25 mins to get her ice tea because she was told that they had run out. Couldn't they have told her when she ordered it and let her make a different drink choice.  While eating our less than acceptable meal a man was playing the guitar and singing.  He sounded okay but his volume was way way to loud. We literally could not even coo in ate with each other being at least 50 feet away from him.  This total experience at the Duck and Decanter left a bitter taste in my mouth and not just from the awful food. We will never be back.  They can keep their lousy service, inedible over priced food and \"cluck it\".", "business_id": "HIiVx2mseVWKtx8TKfWC_A", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-01-05", "type": "review"}

I've literally seen people playing board games in one of the nooks. This place has expansive space which allows customers to branch out across the two stories.  You'll see that it's almost treehouse-esque. There's wood everywhere and you walk up and down rickety stairs to get to the upstairs loft/patio. They have a lovely outdoor seating area and again, the space for focus and meetings is unparalleled. I typically spend about 5+ hours here when I come and I see the morning flow (pretty slow and tranquil) then I see the lunch rush. Sure, it gets busy, but I bring my headphones which gets me through that period of crowdedness. The staff doesn't hover around you or make you feel unwelcome when you spend a lot of time there, which I certainly appreciate. They are actually very friendly and helpful.\n\nThe place is quite old and could possibly use some updates (computer outlets, tables and chairs, etc). However, I kinda like the shabbiness of it. \n\nPrices are typical for lunch/coffee. The first time I tried this spot, my dirty chai was eh. It was luke-warm and just not very good.

Besides general bar-fare, they offer some of the best weekly dish specials a bar can conjure up. They are not simply a OTB or pool hall... they are much much more.\n\n~Fud/Drink~\nAs stated, they have superb dish choices each week. They do seafood/fish surprisingly well. The most memorable dish from here was actually a Basa filet in mushroom gravy and perfectly grilled veggies along with mashed potatoes. That, my friends, is NOT traditional bar-fare. The chef they have locked up (love that comment Joe S.) does a stellar job. Please don't forget they offer all the traditional fried food options you can dream up. But this is a multidimensional bar, which makes it so unique. They also have stellar drink specials throughout the week and into the weekend. The barkeeps keep regulars happy with free-flowing drinks and will make your day as well if you stop in! They offer a full bar along with beers of different variety as well as select wines to be pared with your special dishes if you purchase one. \n\n~Atmosphere/Service~\nOnce again, service is superb every time I go. I am by no means a regular, but they treat you like one. I feel at home here when I come in to have a bite or shoot some pool. There is no real dive atmosphere, its truly an interesting mix. The inside is by no means \"nice\", its a bit older and adds to the general feel of the room. Along with the bar area with the regulars and the OTB on the screens with rooting betters, it surely is an interesting collection of atmospheres in one. You do not need to worry about loud noise though, the patio outside is helpful and can alleviate any issues with inside noise. I never have noticed much of a noise factor though, its a fine spot to both watch a game and dine at. Its impressive how you can go about it at the 'Dillo.\n\n~Extras/Rating~\nCall ahead for specials that day/week, the website they have does not get updated at all unfortunately. Look online, there are numerous coupons available from different spots... I use Entertainment coupons here and they work like a charm! They aren't the finest bar in town, that's understood. But its drink specials, above-par food, central location and outstanding staff each earn a star, giving them 4 overall stars.

The dark and dingy interior doesn't help either.  \n\nBut on the other hand, the food is certainly a cut above the typical greasy, soggy bar food one usually encounters at most sports bars for a decent price. If you're there to watch a whole football game like I would on a few occasions you could end up spending in the mid to high 20's when it's done, but if you're just there to get a meal and maybe a beer, then obviously you won't end up spending as much like around $15. The bartenders are overall ok. No real issue there.\n\nOverall it's more of an interesting experience than a pleasant experience, which is why I will pop in from time to time, but only from time to time just to mix it up.\n\nOh yeah, and to their credit (at least in my book) they play metal later in the night when all the games are over and there's no more retarded horse racing on.", "business_id": "CqhsIZ7TzCfJTrZqg5-gqQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-02-15", "type": "review"}

Inside its a dark lounge with comfy leather couches, this bar plays jazz and serves $12 cocktails....but....IT IS IN A STRIP MALL (which is maybe the case with everything in Phoenix).  It's impossible not to feel like the place is trying too hard.  And if you don't feel the same maybe YOU'RE trying too hard.\n\n1a.  Merc Bar feels like a place you should go if you're having an affair - its dark and if you go early enough the joint is empty and the drinks are strong.  It's got a great location - it's close to the mall, it's close to the corporate parks and, depending on your price point, it's close to hotels as well.  Best of all, should you see your significant other out and about you can always say you were going to McCormik & Schmick's for a gift certificate for him/her for his/her birthday, big promotion celebration, GED graduation and/or your anniversary.  Totally believable alibi.\n\n2.  I didn't have the cheese plate, but I read the menu....umm...really?  That's the best you can do?  I've assembled a more interesting cheese plate at the grocery store.  For 1/8 of the price.\n\nSo why the three stars you ask....?  Numbers 3, 4 and 5:\n\n3.  Holy Crap the White Port Mojito is by far one of the best and most innovative cocktails I've had in a long time.  If you're a fan of Port I highly recommend trying it.  \n\n4. Merkin jokes.

I was never that impressed by it before, but wasn't opposed to it like I am now after that night. We had to signal one female server over so someone at my table could order another beer. She responded like she was being inconvenienced. When a \"Boulder Hazed and Confused\" was ordered, she looked like the guy was crazy and said, \"I don't think we have that\" to which he replied, \"I just had one.\" So, not only was she annoyed by having to serve us, she didn't even know the bar menu like the back of her hand like any good server would.\n\nOn to my difficulties in getting a drink: a male server came over to bus our table and take any orders. I ordered another glass of wine, and over the next 20 minutes, I watched him serve/bus other tables, hug patrons, and open a Christmas gift. No vino for me. The only positive part of the night was when I went to the bartender, told him what occurred, and he comped my wine. The bartenders seem less aloof, so I suggest getting all of your drinks from them.\n\nThe Merc Bar seems to be one of those places to go if you're only interested in being seen, mingling with douchey patrons, and you're not concerned about receiving good service (even though their mixed speciality drinks command $12). It is like the Neiman Marcus of bars, where some of the employees act like they are better than you are, even though they work there and you're the one there spending money. On the upside, they had a band and their seating is inviting, but the wait staff remove that vibe almost immediately.", "business_id": "peA3F-PnIfijYr8HuG-A-Q", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-12-24", "type": "review"}

Me and the girls decided to come here on a Saturday night recently to celebrate her b-day and it was super packed by 9:30PM. This place is definitely a little gem and the ambiance very surprising when you walk in. I love that most of the time it's just dark enough and there's usually a good mix of music playing; I also love that there is always an eclectic mix of people here ranging from people on first dates, b-day parties, to \"that guy\" trying to look cool at the bar.  After living in Vegas for 7+years I can say that this is actually a real lounge. I've found that many places in AZ claim to be lounges but when you walk in it's a full on club with super loud music and people dancing every where and little to no seating. At Mer Bar there's plenty of seating and the music is just loud enough to create that lounge like setting but you can actually hold a convo. \n\nBe advised that the drinks are not cheap! A specialty cocktail or martini goes for minimum $12 a pop so be prepared. Their food selection isn't that large so the only thing I've tried was their cheese and cracker platter which was perfect to snack on. Service is pretty hit or miss, on our last visit there was only 1 lady working the entire place, she said the other person called in but we had no complaints since we were having an awesome time chatting.

First off, cordial responsive bartender like that of yesteryear.  I don't why this tradition has died in favor of bartenders that tend to ignore you and demand more than a dollar to pop a bottle top, but nay, that is not what MercBar offers.  I ordered my go to drink of Campari and Soda.  Kudos to knowing what Campari was because he immediately grabbed it without searching.  After this drink, I followed up with a \"Moscow Mule\".  Again bartender did not disappoint, quickly yet methodically, indeed caringly, crafted my brew.  I was pleased how well cucumbers soften the edge of vodka.\n\nAs for the ambiance, I'm a bit confused how to rate it.  The clientele seems to be superficially well off and no one was sloppy in this upscale place.  However, for the same reasons I was nauseated by investment banking, does this crowd annoy me.  Don't get me wrong, I'm as snobby and obnoxious as they come, but I like to think I'm authentic about it and I know it's a fault of mine.  I suppose what bothers me about the clientele here, is that bar conversations tend to revolve around name dropping and pronouncing why each person is more accomplished than the next.

But while going through a pile of mail I had set aside as junk, I found a $50 off postcard from AM-EX to Capital Grille. We decided to give it a try and save Mastro's for another time.\n\nThe service was fantastic. Our waiter, Reuben, was just the right amount of attentive (I hate being asked after practically every bite if everything is ok), and the other staff was also excellent.\n\nWe got a basket of bread to start, which also held some matzo-like crackers. Don't pass by the dark bread- I thought it was regular pumpernickel at first, but it had a wonderful crust with a soft and slightly fruity center- totally unexpected and delicious. We also received an amuse- a great little bruchetta topped with micro greens.\n\nI ordered the caprese salad which was good, especially the yellow tomato slice, but I have had better mozzarella at Cibo. Hubby had the French Onion soup which came with a ridiculous amount of torch-melted cheese on top. The soup itself had great flavor (one of the best I've had), but could have been a little hotter for my taste. Hubby liked it the way it was.\n\nFor our entrees, Hubby got the Kona crusted sirloin (which was rubbed with a blend of decaf coffee powder, cocoa, and cinnamon) with shallot butter. He really enjoyed the flavor, although about half of his steak was really much more medium than medium rare. To me, the flavor was unexpected- I thought I would taste any one of the rub flavors before I tasted the steak, as they are all strong flavors. That was not the case, however- it was a subtle yet complex addition to the beef. I had the classic Delmonico rib-eye. Mine was perfectly done and quite tasty, although I must say that I have enjoyed my rib-eye at Bobby Q's every bit as much. The sides were fine- we tried the mushroom mix and the lobster mac n' cheese. We have been spoiled by our CraftSteak hen-of-the-woods mushroom ecstasy experience, so all else pales in comparison. I expected more from the mac- it was sort of mild and bland. I'm not sure what it needed- something that wouldn't overwhelm the lobster, but something nonetheless. Because we wanted to try a dessert, we took home plenty of food (the sides are large, and all share-able by 2-4 people).\n\nWe shared the coconut cream pie, which again was more than enough for two. It was in a tart style with a sugar cookie type crust, topped with a layer that we felt had cream cheese in it, then a layer of custard cream, covered by a mountain of fresh whipped barely sweetened cream and toasted coconut flakes. It was really delicious. The house blend coffee was truly outstanding, without even a hint of acidity. Hubby added Frangelico to his, and it was so good and rich that it did not need the cream he would have otherwise added. \n\nAll in all, Capital Grille gave us a very pleasant dining experience (aside from a couple of wasted chicks who were way too loud), and very good food.", "business_id": "QdbZyl-LWFS54u93Vjd5SA", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-01-19", "type": "review"}

This is not a \"cheap date\", and has become one of special occasion spots...anniversary, birthday etc. \n\nThe Rib-Eye here has the perfect marbleization and has always been cooked to perfection. Sandra K usually has the Filet, and has never been disappointed.\n\nBut I better mention the Lobster Bisque soup before detailing the steaks and sides. It is like a special sunset. Dazzling light, luminescent colors and a special moment. Not sure how's it's made...but to die for flavor.\nSalads are exceptional, except I usually go for the soup, but when I'm thinking healthy, I have the wedge or Caesar, or on occasion the bacon spinach. All worth mentioning.\n\nBack to the steaks, again, I am a Rib-Eye fan but I have had The Dry Aged Steak Au Poivre with a Courvasier Cream Sauce. This steak is rubbed with crushed peppercorns and \"seared\" to lock in the juices. The cream sauce is such a delight. Don't mix the Lobster Bisque and this steak unless you want a decadent evening. \n\nBy the way, don't lke beef? Try the Double Cut Lambchops...fabulous! Seafood, I can't get myself to order seafood at a Steak House, unless I have Steak and Lobster/Crab. Then again, I get my Lobster fix with the soup or the appetizers.\n\nSides....This is why I like to take a group here. The sides are all \"shareable\" although there are several here that I don't want my companions to take too much. Parmesan Truffle Fries....ouch on the flavor scale (and other scales). Lobster and Mac N Cheese, again, I get my seafood on the side, this one is decadent to the power of 10 and one of my all time favorites are the AuGratin potatoes. To impress my guests, I will order a vegetable to share and it's usually the creamed spinach or asparagus. But sliding into decadence here means I throw out the rules of engagement and if I going to sin....here I am going to sin big, and that means dessert as well.\n\nCoconut Cream Pie or Key Lime Pie at a fine dining spot contrast the other offerings of Flourless Chocolate Expresso Cake and Berries and Cream.

What ever homesick girl needs to feel better. :)\n\nWe entered the very clean and classy and dare i say it - swanky setting with their hostesses who ware blazers and they were very welcoming and were very glad to seat a yelper. (they asked how I heard about Resturant Week when I called for reservations) Our waiter - dang I can't remember his name! he was so attentative and had one of those table sweeper type thingies and he recommended I try the best drink of the night - the Stoli Doli. Fresh pineapple stewed with Stoli vodka for atleast a WEEK before it's dispensed for sweet drink lovers (like me) smooth, delicious and slightly sweet. I was in love. \n\nWe had standard salads, nothing to write yelp about. I had the Filet Mingon and she had this steak that was sliced in half (if I remember) it came with veggies, again nothing to really write yelp about but everything was so yummy. The steak was well rested and cooked perfectly. I was very impressed.  \n\nOne slight issue: we saw creme brulee on the menu on  the resturant week's website but when we got to the resturant, it wasn't there - boo... but our ever amazing waiter worked it out for us! YAY!! Thank Goodness he did because it was insanely good.\n\nIf you want a place that is swank, seriously fancy (I'm from the rez okay - so this is crazy fancy in my world)  and has GREAT service and even better steak... this is the place for you! But you better have the cash to pay for it all! lol but if you have the money honey and a need to wine and dine then trust me sweetie Capital Grille has the time! Just call ahead for reservations!", "business_id": "QdbZyl-LWFS54u93Vjd5SA", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-01-21", "type": "review"}

So the fact that I ended up at Capital Grille for Valentine's day is actually a little embarrassing. But the combination of a $100 gift card that was about to expire, a fond memory of steak tar tar and homemade potato chips at their bar, and a failure to make any other sort of reservation landed us there at about 8pm on Sunday night. I really wasn't feeling like anything fancy, so we decided to sit at the bar, nosh, and watch the Olympics.\n\nFirst, cocktails. Mine: an expertly made Manhattan that was approximately the size of my head (hurray for oversized martini glasses!) My husbands: Hendricks, rocks, cucumber. Our bartender offered to go get cucumber slices from the kitchen as it was a garnish they typically had at the bar. Score 1 for Kevin the bartender. \n\nNext, food order. This had the potential to be the low point of the evening when they informed me they no longer had the steak tar tar on the menu. Or the ketlle chips. I now wanted to cry. We settled for a caprese salad, beef carpaccio, and the lobster crab cakes. Salad came out promptly, was very tasty and nice presentation. And then...nothing. The other apps lagged for like 15 minutes and the bartender was visibly irritated at the kitchen and wait staff. Luckily I had a full drink in front of me and it was the skating pairs short program on TV so I really wasn't complaining. When the food did show up it was actually worth the wait. Nothing I would have changed about it at all.\n\nFor the dessert portion of the evening we decided to try a Colheita port, which the bartender described as a single vintage tawny port. My husband loves tawny port and they had one that was fairly reasonable but still in the Colheita category. Rounded it out with the flourless chocolate espresso cake. Sadly, we were informed they no longer carried our port selection. And then, not so sadly, they poured us a much more expensive version for the price of the other one! Oh, and the dessert itself - freaking amazing. Best chocolate torte I've had in a while. \n\nThe actual shocker of the evening was that they took the appetizers off the bill without us saying anything about it. This really wasn't necessary but I think it shows that this place really does have class and that they wanted us to know that wasn't up to their standard of service. Well played.\n\nOh, and, right before we left the bartender leaned over and said \"Come back on a day when it isn't a holiday and we'll get the kitchen to make you some steak tar tar.  They do it for me all the time.\" Bless you, sweet bartender man. And thank you for a lovely Valentine's day.", "business_id": "QdbZyl-LWFS54u93Vjd5SA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-02-15", "type": "review"}

Had a 5:00 reservation.  Arrived about 10 minutes early and we were greeted by young hostesses with heavy make-up and just okay.  We were happy to sit in the beautiful bar (entire place is decorated wonderfully - music was upbeat, young and pretty loud).  Cops was on in the bar.  Our tender was fun.  Ordered martinis straight up, with GREAT blue cheese olives.  Good service at bar.  Got served some cold bread in a basket.  Nice variety.  But cold!  We sat there for over 20 minutes though.  Wished to be seated at table on time.\n\nTable was nice.  Servers and bussers do shuffle around and don't seem happy.  Our server was fine.  We dine at Ruth's a lot so we were happy to try a bone-in rib-eye here.  We were told that we'd find the steaks at PCG better.  Didn't turn out that way and not just because of overdone. \n\nAnother bread basket but this time it was hot.  Love the pretzle bread with big salt crystals.  \n\nInteresting that we didn't even open the menu.  What the server sugggested was what my hus. decided sounded great.  I agreed.  Nice red wine.  Lobster bisque came out pretty fast.  It was tepid.  Yuck!  Flavor was nice, lobster morsles good.  Temperature - awful!  The giant crouton it came with (same kind as bread basket) made it better.  Not enough flavor.  Just seemed to be creamy for creamy's sake.  Just a bowl of heavy cream.\n\nHeirloom tomato salad was good but the dressing was just alright.  Nice variety of tomatoes.  Was hoping for more pizazz.  \n\nPotato Au Gratin were heavily salted.  Sliced thinkly, good texture, but I like the simplicity of Ruth's potatoes better.  They were very tasty, but maybe just a little too salty.  I like to salt my own.  Neat, but not necessay to have an extra server scoop out a serving of potatoes.  No personality when doing it.  \n\nOur steaks were ordered meduim-rare.  They came out meduim.  The server asked, noticed, took out flashlight and agreed that they were both overdone.  My hus. kept his.  Hungry is his name (not really).  My new one came out pretty fast.  With my new one, came manager.  Man, was he stuffy!  He had his flashlight too and said for me to cut into it so that HE could be sure that I'd be happy with this one.  Well, it was rare, but I, too was hungry so I kept it.  I was happy to warm it up later in the broiler and then it'd be perfect.  \n\nThe meat itself was great.  Not salted or peppered at all.  Not much butter.  I love Ruth's WAY better.  I like the butter, salt and sizzle.\n\nServer comped steaks and gave us desset to go.  Overall, all our needs met.  Happy time!  Just prob. won't go back for steaks.  Ruth's and Hillstone are MUCH better.", "business_id": "QdbZyl-LWFS54u93Vjd5SA", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-12-17", "type": "review"}

Last minute anniversary idea totally worked in our favor, as we were greeted with a \"Happy anniversary!\", and led to a seemingly huge booth decorated with rose petals & cheap plastic heart pieces, which was a nice touch. \n\nThe drink selection consisted of standards like martini's and a massive wine list. We went for the basic. Dry gin martini, 3 olives. They pulled it off wonderfully, and it was shaken/poured tableside, as it should be.\n\nWe started with the calamari. They fry them up in a bready, salty batter. Almost too salty. Then, they do something awesome, and toss in chopped cherry peppers. The result is this concoction of spicy bready perfectly fried calamari. The peppers add this crazy flavor to the overall dish, which is completely unexpected and delicious. Great ratio of head vs body too. I hate it when restaurants just give me heads. I'm not afraid of tentacles! \n\nI had the sliced filet migon with cippolini onions and wild mushrooms, finished with a 12 year balsamiq reduction. Perfect crust on the steak. The saltyness of the crust brought out the juices of the meat, when combined with the reduction, resulted in a fantastic melt-in-the mouth feel.  That being said, I wish it was a little more rare.\n\nShe had the special, which was a lamb roulade filled with an herb cream cheese and wrapped in bacon. While this proved to be a winning combination of flavors, the lamb was slightly overcooked from medium rare. \n\nWe got the lobster mac and cheese, which had huge chunks of lobster. The cheese was mascarpone, which resulted in a soupier mac, but it worked well with the lobster. We also got the french green beans with heirloom tomatoes, which while tasty, wasn't anything special. \n\nFor dessert, we were brought an espresso chocolate flourless cake, finished with raspberry sauce & fresh raspberries. Rich and delicious.\n\nIn the end, it was a fantastic meal. The Capital Grille is not the best steakhouse I've ever been to though, it is a very close second. I recommend in a heartbeat.\n\nAs a p.s: The service was top notch. I even got a phone call the next day, wanting to know how the experience was.

The fact that their happy hour starts at 8 is by far the BEST thing ever. It also makes it our go to place. I'm pretty sure in the last two weeks after we 1st visited we've been back 5 or 6 times. The prices are perfect, the service is great and the food is really delicious. I wasn't putting a lot of hope in the food but everything that we've tried has been very good. My only suggestion would be that they turn down the grill and cook the food a bit longer. I had to have them remake one of my sliders and I've seen other situation were people asked for their food to be cooked more. But the food tastes so good that it isn't even an issue for me or my usually very picky boyfriend :) we just make sure to have them cook everything well.

I gave up; I really wasn't interested in having a hockey puck piece of meat left after another re-fire. The plate also consisted off what they call a baked cheddar potato which in all reality is some kind of stringy shredded potatoes (Hash browns)  with some creamy cheese concoction on them then they were broiled for a few seconds to crust up the outside. They were very weird, their flavor was almost that of boxed au gratin potatoes and their consistency was that of the inside of a tater tot.\n\n In Fact (BREAKTHROUGH) I just came up with a great name for them other than Baked Cheddar Potatoes,,,,,,\n\nWait for it,\n\nCHEESY SHREDDED TOTTS\n\nAlso note, when ordering the Taproom steak sandwich, what they forget to mention on the menu is that it's an open faced sandwich which can be fine if you know that going in, but we had to ask for a top for the sandwich because there is absolutely no mention of it...\n\nSorry, I wanted a sandwich, not a piece of meat on bread...", "business_id": "rVUEZpHQfWI_3kt0lBwaxQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-12-16", "type": "review"}

I had the Veal Marsala, which was off the charts. After 35 years these guys know how to cook veal. It was pounded very thin and melted in my mouth. The lady had the salmon, which was parmesean crusted and very good. It was mild and wonderful. The tiramisu for dessert was also great. Next time though i will get the pasta as the were making it fresh in the restauraunt. I have to give that a try. The ambiance was great.

Black and white floors, mirrors galore, dark, moody and strangely intriguing.

Each was delicious in it's own way, being savory, and rich without being overpowering. \n\nWe then were treated to a fish, I can't recall the name that was Parmesan crusted with a delicious sauce that was just right. The tenderness of the fish combined with just the right amount of richness from the sauce created a crescendo of flavors that was perfection. \n\nLast but not least we had a desert platter with three delicious deserts, a mango, ice cream sorbet that was amazing, tiramisu which was equally good, and a classic Italian desert I can't recall. It reminded me of lemon bars my mother used to make for my sister and I as a child. \n\nOverall this experience was amazing. I'm still thinking about it and telling my friends. The atmosphere, ambiance, and intimate setting along with outstanding food and service makes this a must see and eat place in my opinion. So many restaurants these days are about group dining, and group experiences, this is a lovely escape from all of that.

And this year I totally neglected to get Mr. Man so much as a card. Dog house! (I thought we weren't celebrating! How was I to know that little sneaker was would bring a smile to my face with a cutesy, cheesy, tchotchky gift and card combo?)\n\nLittle did he know that I had an ace up my sleeve. An ace with lots and lots of titacular action. Bombshells! I know that nothing brings a smile to Mr. Man's face quicker than a pair of boobies, so we stopped by on Sunday for some sinful indulgence in an illusionary atmosphere. Being a non-traditionalist doesn't have to be a bad thing.\n\nSundays are 2 for 1 well drinks and domestic bottles before 7 pm, which is nice when it's $7.75 for a short gin and tonic. There's also no cover, an indication that Sunday nudity lures some guys that are reminiscent of your dad. Expect gentlemen in kahki shorts and button down shirts paying to have a lady rub their bits all over. But at least these gents are better business than the twenty-somethings that just watched the entire time, not a dollar bill in sight. Skeeze. \n\nIt's pretty easy to see which girls are enjoying themselves up there (or at least doing a good job faking it) and who's bored as all get out. We had some very enthusiastic ladies, especially after the shift change at 6pm, and they totally knew how to work the pole in their seven inch heels. Don't come here expecting tig ole fake bitties you usually encounter at Skin or other Scottsdale places. These ladies are au natural and I wouldn't have it any other way. \n\nWhat's nicest was this fact that they're willing to sit down and chat with you regardless of whether you're interested in a lap dance or not:\nLovely buxom brunette: \"What are you and your girlfriend celebrating?\"\nMr. Man: *baffled, blank stare* \"Sunday?\"\nLBB: \"Wow! She's a keeper. Hold on to that one!\"\n\nOfficially out of the dog house.\n\nIt's not a brusque, all-business attitude at Bombshells and even though I was the only girl there that wasn't on shift (aside from an awkward couple that came in scowling, stayed for three songs and booked it), there's no awkwardness about it. And since I'm a woman I get the supremely sexy treatment instead of the perfunctory titty shake when I tip.\n\nThe icing on our lecherous evening? Mr. Man got a lap dance and the Italian beauty offered to do a couple's one for no extra charge. Now that's class. \n\nMaybe I'm too harsh on the whole 'tradition' thing.

That's essentially Postino in a nutshell.  It's next to the ever trendy La Grande Orange which just adds to its hype.  Seriously, I could start serving twinkies and pbj's  next to La Grande Orange and i would have 91 reviews with 4 stars too.  The food was unspectacular as I felt like I was eating lunch but paying 3 times for it.  The service was average. The waitstaff was not rude but they were not helpful either as we had to constantly remind them to bring items; they took nearly 20 minutes to take our order and you had to ask them for anything extra like water or silverware.  It just seemed like the owner walked into Six lounge and asked some people to be servers; they just seemed as if they had no experience waiting on people. \n\nFurthermore, it's not a \"winecafe.\"  It's just a cafe. The wine part makes it sound trendier than it is. The wine selection is a joke and there are hardly any \"by the glass\" selections. The servers have no clue about wine and if you ask them a few questions, you will see they do a really good job trying to b.s. you but if you have any knowledge about wine like I do, you enjoy the spectacle of seeing them trying to sound intelligent: \"Er, do you like white or red wine\" \n\nThe food was good but again, why am I paying a lot of money to be served this for dinner. There are several panini Italian lunch delis that i could get this same food at. \n\nThis is a great place for a light meal or a cocktail or a great place for friends to meet at for a quick drink before heading out to the clubs or lounges.  It's also a great place to impress a date (if you are less than 25 years old).  However, Postino should not be viewed as serious fare in regards to dining.

What? It's not? Well, I would consider it in poor taste.\n\nI got drunk at Postino last night and had a wonderful time. The $20 Bruschetta Board and Bottle of Wine promotion they have Mondays and Tuesdays is a ridiculous steal. I didn't want to be the alcey to ask if that deal was limited to one-per-table as I was fully planning on consuming my own bottle of wine and possibly my own board of bruschetta. Luckily the guys across the bar had the same plan, so I didn't have to. FYI: It is illegal for restaurants to serve you your own bottle of wine. Don't ask how I know. I just know. However, you can split 3 or 4 with one other person and nobody says anything. Don't ask how I know this either. I just know. \n\nAll of the different bruschetta options are fantastic. The Prosciutto one tasted like Cinnamon Toast to me. That may have been the booze talking. Considering I kept referring to it as \"Cinnamon Toast Crunch\", I'm going to go ahead and say it was. The roasted red pepper & goat cheese and the apple & brie were equally delicious. Sorry, I don't have a breakfast cereal comparison for them. \n\nTo top it off, the service is fan-freaking-tastic. Everyone is extremely helpful and seems genuinely HAPPY  that you are there spending money. Clearly, from a business standpoint, this should be a given, but more often than not it isn't. Once I was there with a girl whose recently adopted Greyhound was somehow prompted to dart across the patio like a bat out of hell, knocking over chairs and wine glasses along the way. Not only was the staff RIDICULOUSLY nice about it, a few of the valet guys actually CHASED AFTER this greyhound and I'm pretty sure one of them got into his car to find it.

The retail wine area at the entrance is awkward to me, because it's cramped and I frankly think you should all be buying wine at my shop so perhaps I'm a touch biased. Anyway, it is a great way for you to take home whatever you enjoyed with your dinner. Damn magnanimity. \n\nI wasn't in the mood for drunk biking that night so I skipped the adult beverages for a pot of tea. I get that this is a wine cafe so really no one going here is going to review a cup of tea, except for me. Tea selection was sad. Tea has the same cult following that wine does, so three options seemed half-hearted. And my pot of hot water was only half filled, which, for $2.50 is lame.  Okay I'm done bashing PW. \n\nThe second time I drove in for a take out order of the bruschetta board. My order was ready, the place was packed and I was able to get in and out in less than 3 mins! We ordered the date and pistachio on ricotta, the fig and prosciutto, the mozz/tomato/basil and the smoked salmon pesto. Great value to order ratio, each slice was huge and pre-chopped into littler bites. The smoked salmon was definitely my favorite, with the runner up being the pistachio/date combo.

We opted for the Smoked Salmon with capers and Pesto, the Tomato, Basil, & Mozzarella, the Ricotta with pistachios and dates, and the Brie with apples and fig spread. All of them were amazing! I am not a salmon fan, but this smoked salmon was delicious! It was also my first attempt at Brie. This too was good. \n\nFor the meal, my lady friend or special lady, (Big Lebowski random quote) had the Raspberry Chicken salad. It was chunky chicken salad on a bed of greens with a raspberry vinaigrette. I was told it was good. I went for the half panini and soup combo. I had the Vegetarian with the Tomato and Gorgonzola soup. Originally the wrong panini came out. The server got it replaced and put the wrong one in a to go box to take home. Thought that was nice for the mix up. The soup was excellent. It is a very close second to The Roosevelt's tomato soup. The Vegetarian panini was good, but could have used a little more veggies on it. \n\nUnfortunately there was no room for dessert, but they all sounded amazing. Overall, a great experience with great food and drink. Service was great and the atmosphere was perfect. \n\nAgain, thanks Amber W for the gift!!!", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-01-10", "type": "review"}

What's that? I can start my bottle now and easily move with my meal and my server once my table is ready? And you say that I can do this on Monday and AGAIN on Tuesday, starting at 8pm? Every week? Can this be true?  Thank you, Postino, for having the best wine and food deal in the valley, and creating a great atmosphere in which to enjoy wine with friends. \n\nI love wine. So do lots of other people that show up at 8pm sharp, rain or shine, to take advantage of the awesome Monday/Tuesday special. So be prepared to wait for a seat. If you are sharp like a hawk or stealthy like a fox, you might catch one of those coveted bar seats, but otherwise you'll stand at small tables, casually drinking your wine and doing some people watching until the host finds you and guides you to your table. You will love your wine selection. Your bruschetta will be made with the the freshest ingredients on crusty MJ bread, in the perfect proportions. Do try my favorites: Prosciutto, mascarpone, & fig; Red peppers & goat cheese; Ricotta with pistachio & dates; and Pesto with smoked salmon. Happiness served on a wood-cutting board. I paired my bruschetta with a spicy corn chowder, and it was just the best meal for a rainy night. \n\nThe servers are very cool and know what they are talking about. They will not steer you wrong with a wine selection. If you order a bottle that is not to your liking, no problem! They serve all wine by the glass, so you can easily send it back and try another! They want you to enjoy your experience and selection, and thus have built in the flexibility for people to take risks and try new wines. Have fun with it! \n\nMy suggestion is to find a friend or two, valet the car, put your name in for a table, get started on a bottle, make laughter and conversation, and finally take your seats, enjoy your food, and order more wine. You will be fully satisfied and will have had a great night. Do recommend it to your other friends, and definitely make plans to return again soon.", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-01-24", "type": "review"}

I make this sound horrible but it isn't at all, I was just being dramatic.

After talking to Postino's, I tried Chelsea's and LGO and got the same answer.\n\nI also tried Chelsea's, which takes reservations for less then 10 but got the same story, they were booked and we could wait. Also asked them about calling in when we were on our way b/c I was with two older people who could not stand long... they said no way.\n\nI own two restaurants, I can tell you-- this is not appropriate customer service. Its also not very moralistic. If a frequent customer explains a situation, seeking a little help, and its not ridiculous, the restaurant shoud be happy to do it. \n\nSeems as if the LGO owners have taken a cue from Houston's... which is the type of place that gives Scottsdale a bad reputation. The type of service that scares out-of-towners away from Arizona because we are too \"snooty.\"", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-12-17", "type": "review"}

I love having the option of various small plates to share amongst friends.

The wine offerings are great and they have a decent variety as well.  I have also tried their Bellini which was wonderful in that the peaches in it tasted fresh and like the actual fruit instead of the canned syrupy version - a pleasant surprise.\n\nThe hummus was smooth and creamy and the artichoke dip was warm and comforting.  Honestly, I don't think you can really go wrong with any of their bruschettas.  We have tasted the fresh mozzarella with tomato and basil, prosciutto with figs and marscapone, smoked salmon with pesto, ricotta with dates and pisachios, roasted red peppers with goat cheese, and the warm artichoke spread - all wonderfully fresh, mouth watering, and plenty of toppings so you can experience the full flavor of the offerings.\n\nPeople watching is fun at this location if you're into a varying crowd.  The decor is fun and the staff is friendly and seems very relaxed as well as catering to locals.

The soup was just OK - it wasn't bad, but it was nowhere near as exciting for my tastebuds as the panini. \n\nI would liken my dining experience at Postino to \"If You Give a Mouse a Cookie\" -- after I had one phenomenal item, I had to have them all!

With a drink in hand, it was a pleasure to check out the wines and the milieu of this place of business. It's quite nice, it is however not very big and it can get quite loud in here. Not too loud for a simple conversation, but loud enough for me to take notice.\n\nOnce seated the service was great. Our server was a knowledgeable and energetic gentleman that gladly helped out in any decision making regarding the menu. I tried their beer selection as well as had a cheese tray. Note: For being a wine place, they sure do take pride in their beer selection - however I must say that I was not impressed by their cheese. They seem to take pride in their cheese diversity, but I was simply not impressed.\n\nThe service was great, the ambiance was relaxing, and the patrons were nice.. I truly enjoyed my visit and will be returning to this establishment. It wasn't expensive, but it isn't cheap nor should it be.

Let me do you (and me) a favor and break it down very simply and give you the hard.cold.facts:\n\nThe best day to go: Monday night\n\nWhy?: $20 for any bottle of wine and a bruschetta board (4 different types) starting 8pm\n\nStrategy: go there 10-20mins before and scout out for a table. Expect an extremely long wait if you get there after 8pm\n\nWhat to order (in order of tasty): [Bruschetta] Tomato jam and goat cheese, fig and prosciutto, Apple and brie, pesto and salami, pistachio and date, caprese (lacks balsamic vinegar and olive oil). [Other] Olives.\n\nDon't bother getting: white bean hummus is pretty insipid and the artichoke dip doesn't add much to your meal, nor is on discount during their Monday specials.\n\nBest group number: 2-4 is pretty perfect. Anything more will be hard to accommodate as the space is pretty small.\n\nOverall impression: ridiculously good deal on Monday to share with 4-5 people, paying only $8-10 to get sufficiently tipsy and full. Location is classy, service is pretty decent but be aware that the parking situation sucks as the lot in front of it will tow you for parking there.", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-01-28", "type": "review"}

Whether its the service you get , the food quality, the ambiance or the amazing deals... its all been said. But hell, I will say it all again..\n\n~Fud/Drink~\nI have had bruschetta many times, at many places. They do bruschetta the RIGHT WAY. They give you so many different options to choose from, and each one tastes as good as the next. I am a salmon fan, so their salmon bruschetta was exquisite in my eyes. They have so many amazing wines to offer you as well, so many its almost impossible to not find the right fit for your meal. I have yet to try other main entrees on the menu, but do not worry I will. Just remember, you can taste the quality. They take good care of their product and make sure the kitchen pumps out quality dishes.\n\n~Atmosphere/Service~\nThe Servers really know their stuff. They understand why you're their and they seem to really rock to the vibe of the place. Hipsters love it, I love it, and the servers are awesome at what they do. The suggestions they provide prove to really help make the night a better one. The atmosphere is great, a real hipster vibe for sure. I enjoy a relaxed calm spot personally, especially after a long day at work, and  they nail it. Its just quiet enough to sit down and relax with someone special, yet loud enough that no one can hear your conversation.\n\n~Extras/Rating~\n\nRegarding the $20 Bruschetta/Wine deal: GET-THERE-EARLY. Or else you might find yourself waiting for an hour to get served. I do not fault them for having to put you on a long wait-list, especially because its such an amazing deal and so popular just suck it up and get there earlier or 30 minutes earlier than what you would normally want. Their $20 Bruschetta/Wine pairing is the best happy hour item I have ever seen. No lie. That alone puts them in the upper echelon for date night go-to's and perfect chill happy hour locations in the valley here. \n\n No one can lay claim to such a unique and perfect option, despite the fact that numerous other bars have attempted. They may try, but the quality of food and vast selection of wines, paired with the ambiance they provide, blows all competitors out of the water.

I really like the patio area!! It was too cold for us on this trip however this is a \"must come back\" kinda of place just to enjoy a great meal on their patio!!\n\nFood~ if your dining for lunch go straight to the salads and/or bruschettas!!  Their portions are actually larger than you think and after you pick and choose some of the different ones to eat, you'll thank me for passing on the apps!!  \n\nHowever if you re dinning for dinner or have a larger group or a huge appetite, then go ahead and order some apps.  I suggest trying their Bella Postino~ warm artichoke dip and white bean hummus with assorted breads or their Butcher's Block~ with different artisan meats and cheeses served with Tuscan beans, olives, nuts and crostini.  Both are DELISH!  \n\nBruschetta's~ here are some of our faves;  Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, the Smoked Salmon with Pesto is my go to!! The Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomato is also a go to!  We also like to try their seasonal burchettas as well!  \n\nPaninis~ go for the prosciutto with brie or their Nine Iron with smoked bacon layered with grilled chicken, fresh burrata mozzarella, lettuce, beefsteak tomato and special sauce = nom.nom.nom!! \n\nService~  our service was a little slower than what we are used to at their Central location however our server was very friendly, knew the menu well and tried her best to keep up.\n\nAll in all it was a FANTASTIC experience!!

Yes, I know there are only so many variations on a salad but these just all blend together and become forgettable.  If you're going for wine and cheese and bruschetta, you won't be disappointed.

What's not to love about a beautiful, modern indoor-outdoor restaurant, with excellent paninis and bruschetta and a fabulous selection of wines by the glass?\n\nReasons why I love Postinos, and you may too :)\n\n1) Great building with modern/chic decor - There's ample indoor and outdoor patio seating, and it's the perfect spot for lunch with the girls, or a date, or whatever! Parking can sometimes be tricky, but 9 out of 10 times, the valet guys will be there to help you (valet is free!)\n\n2) Butcher's Block Appetizer - $14 and well worth it and perfect to share - It's loaded with an assortment of artisan meats and cheeses served with tuscan beans, olives, nuts and crostini - Yum!\n\n3) Bruschetta - $14 for a choice of 3 - The bruschetta is made with beautiful thick, large slices of crispy, fresh bread, and topped with all sorts of delicious toppings. My favorites are 1) the Brie, Apples and Fig Spread, 2) Prosciutto with Figs and Mascapone and 3) Salami with Pesto\n\n4) The Wines! Great selection of wines ; there's something for everyone.\n\n5) Happy Hour! $5 glasses of wine/beer Everyday between 11am-5pm !", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-01-14", "type": "review"}

It wasn't quite what we expected--we'd assumed it was the kind of Italian place where you could get a glass of wine and a plate of pasta--but we had a great time.\n\nOur reservation was for eight o'clock on a Saturday night, and the place was busy but comfortable. It felt intimate and not too crowded. The lighting was low, and the space was warm and charming. A great go-to date spot. Service was great. Our waitress was friendly and helpful, and we were well taken care of.\n\nPostino is more a wine bar than a full sit-down restaurant, with reasonably priced bottles and a menu that consists of large format antipasti and paninis. We ordered a bottle of Canto Sur, a red blend of mostly cabernet and carmenere. You can get wines by the glass here, but the bottle prices are only three times the glass prices, putting most of the bottles in the high twenties/low thirties range. We were happy with the wine. We also ordered a few antipasti and tried to order paninis for our dinner when our waitress stopped us--she said what we thought were antipastis would fill us up plenty, and she was absolutely right.\n\nGranted, we were planning to order a pretty big spread of appetizers. We shared the butcher's block, the pub board, and a selection of four bruschetta. Did not realize that each of these boards would be gigantic. Everything was delicious. The butcher's block came with plenty of meat--prosciutto, coppa, salami, and peppered salami--along with goat cheese and white bean hummus. There was crostini, of course, and a huge assortment of great accompaniments--olives, dried cranberries, almonds, asparagus, cherry tomatoes, smoked yellow tomatoes, and three kinds of pickle.The pub board brought another huge spread, this one of MJ's soft pretzels, Scrheiner's chorizo, cornichons, aged cheddar, and giant Spanish corn nuts. It was fun to mix and match everything on these boards, and it was all fantastic. The bruschetta seems to be the main draw of Postino, but I didn't understand why until our selection arrived. We opted to order four of them for $14, and were expecting bruschetta sized like bruschetta. These were more like full-on flatbreads, with the four bruschetta adding up to about a pizza in volume. We had the tomato jam and fresh sheep's milk cheese, the salami with pesto, the prosciutto with figs and mascarpone, and the burrata, bacon, arugula, and tomato. Not a dud in the bunch--loved all the meat, and the tangy cheese with the sweet tomato jam was perfect on its own.\n\nWe took great pleasure in our feast of antipasti and wine. We ate with our hands and enjoyed the variety. I'd love to go back to Postino next time I'm in Phoenix. I'd be a regular if I lived in town.", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-12-17", "type": "review"}

Food, service, decor, Postino's has everything. I went here with my husband after rock climbing the camel back mountain.  At first this place kind of threw us off. It has a free valet which made us think our dirty hiking gear apparel would get us snubbed, and everything would be super expensive. I'm sure you have gathered based on the five star rating this was not the case. The gold diggers of Scottsdale were in attendance decked out in Lululemon, to class down the dress code. \n\n To the food: We got two plates of bruschetta, and after basically licking the plate clean we got their meat and cheese butcher block plate. All the bruschetta was amazing--super flavorful and used very fresh ingredients.  We also got some wine and a mimosa, fantastic as well. One of our bruschettas was missing an end, the waitress told us that more would be out soon to make up for the missing piece. Soon afterwards, another server brought it with a little extra added, making for no complaints on our end.\n\nI loved the ambiance. Its really cool and classy with lots of character. You can dress up or wear hiking gear. It also has garage doors to hang outside on those warm-weathered days (basically everyday in Scottsdale!). Complete with heater and misters for the summer.

Not the largest selection in town, but if you need that go to the Yard House ya hippy!  My AA (Affordable Alcohol) group would love it here.  In my opinion the drinks are pretty cheap considered the prices of most places these days.  \n\nOverall, great bar to lay low if that's how you feel for the night.  It's right in the heart of the Arcadia neighborhood and it's not as rough as it looks from the outside.  I'm from Iowa and I've seen some rough bars and this place looks the spot, but once you start meeting the people around having a drink.  You'll feel just at home - a Midwest home that is....- Enjoy!", "business_id": "qz4ZOcv-840UjfCEYI4qZg", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-02-18", "type": "review"}

Since I'm unable to, whenever I bug my coworkers to go there I simply make up a new name for it.  For example:\n\n\"hey guys, we should go to old Mcdonalds house of Brass Railroad Tracks.\"\n\nor\n\n\"Hey, lets go to Brass Traintrack Rails at noon.\"\n\nSince most of my coworkers have not been afflicted with heavy drinking habits and/or retardation they know what I'm talking about.\n\nI sought this place out as a lunch time place during work hours since often I crave a simple beer for lunch instead of caloric \"food.\"  Usually my fellow workers and I will end up at the Dirty Drummer, since it's right across the street from our office building.  This was fine for a while until I realized that The Dirty Drummer is actually fucking gross, the atmosphere is depressing and the servers are visually annoying.  Thanks to my obsession with Yelp and alcohol, I was able to find this little gem, a simple and tasty dive bar that is literally four minutes from our office.  \n\nOld Brass Rail is large and not at all intrusive, it's not so local that everyone looks at you when you walk in and it's not so detached that they don't care that you're there.  Plus, they have those high top bar tables that are fun to sit at, especially when they're spread out and you don't have to hear other people's conversations.  They have a million flat screen TV's for when the conversation slows or when you dine with boys who are distracted by lights and moving objects around them.\n\nI've only been there twice, both times we had the same server, both times all my comrads ordered the amazingly reasonable and genius idea of a three dollar breakfast until 2 p.m.  Everyone loves breakfast, and to serve a cheap breakfast at a BAR until 2 p.m. is god damn fucking brilliant.  The server was super nice, sweet and friendly, remembered us, offered suggestions, was not put off by the fact that we are an unlikely group to be at bar in the middle of a weekday.  I can honestly say that both times I thoroughly enjoyed my Old Brass Railroad Tracks experience. \n\nI didn't order breakfast because I am not a \"breakfast food\" person.  I order lunch, even in the morning.  I ordered the chicken strips and a salad, I've also had the fries.  Everything was what you expect as far as bar food but genuinely not gross, with the added bonus that it was NOT, in fact, The Dirty Drummer.  Also, it's not over priced for what it is, 7 for an app, 7 for a burger, cheap beers, good specials, 4.50 pitchers, such a great find.  Also, 3.50 breakfast AT A BAR- GENIUS.  In addition to the totally acceptable food, pleasant service and good prices, you get the added bonus of checking out an old school cigarette vending machine on your way out.

The reviews were mixed - some proclaiming excellence and others less than stellar but none of them regarding the karaoke. I wanted to see for myself.\n\nOne, the parking is dismal. But, if needed, the post office is only half a block away with a nice big lot and available for parking (which is where I parked the Saturday I went).\n\nTwo, the place is a dive bar - nothing more, nothing less. When I arrived, there were several people at the bar and several groups at the tables. Karaoke was in full swing and there were singers up. When sitting at the bar, I was immediately served by a male bartender with an easy smile.\n\nThree, beer. The selection is fairly standard, the commonplace brews you can find in most bars - Bud, lites, Mich, etc. I was happy to find Woodchuck served, and not just served but on tap. (This is the only place - bar or liquor store - I've found since moving from the Midwest that offers my favorite hard cidar. I'm sure there are more, just haven't found them yet.) The price was a little steeper for that Woodchuck though than I'm accustomed. But that could be since the company that makes it is a small brewery in the Midwest and do not commonly distribute this far west.\n\nFour, Karaoke DJ. A nice wooden dance floor was where the DJ made house for karaoke. Decent set up (one more like I'm used to with a lap top instead of cartridges like a few places I've seen since moving here), and a decent selection. I think he had books available, but he said it is often easier to simply write the song you want down and, if he has problems, he'd let you know. I was happy to see he had several bands/artists that are a little less known karaoke-wise that I enjoy to sing.\n\nThe DJ did sing, unlike some places where they refuse. But it wasn't an issue as the rotation wasn't overly long, and he was good about weaving new people into the existing line up. There were singers (like all places) with good voices and others without. It's not an overly young crowd. I'd say late twenties and up.\n\nThe only annoyance was the sound system was wonky. There was really only one or two good places to stand with the microphone to keep feedback out of the speakers. For someone like me who likes to sit in their seat, instead of standing on the dance floor, that was a drawback.\n\nI did not eat while at the establishment. But there were a lot of people who did. I checked out the prices which seemed VERY inexpensive and also checked out the portions others had which were VERY large. But I can't attest to the quality. Despite negative reviews (and possibly at my own peril) I will try the food in the future however. \n\nI was happy with my experience. The people were polite and friendly, the service was good and not intrusive, and the karaoke was fun and had a receptive crowd. While not going to be a regular haunt, I'll certainly come back in the future.", "business_id": "RIeWXLMHZQlYprYt1x2f1w", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-12-20", "type": "review"}

But, after thinking about what I would include in my write up I decided I have to go with five stars. Here's why: \n\n*FREE cookie sundae with the purchase on an entree on Sundays (Half-baked Chocolate Chip, White Chocolate Macadamia Nut or Peanut Butter with Chocolate Chip cookie topped with 3 scoops of vanilla ice cream and chocolate syrup. You can mix it up with two and go 1/2 and 1/2!) \n\n*Build your own burger - not only can you pick your \"meat\" but you can pick your \"bun\" and your bun can be a bed of lettuce allowing for less guilt over the fries. I'm partial to the Greek Burger (topped with feta cheese, diced tomato, black olives, and a side of cucumber sauce) made with a turkey patty on a bed of lettuce. \n\n*Karaoke on Saturday nights and, if you want, you'll easily get to sing more than once! (I, however, do not sing. I'm pretty sure I could get paid NOT to sing -- even at karaoke. I like to watch and make requests!!) \n\n* Generally not a problem getting a seat and TVs are EVERYWHERE! But, when it really counts, Gallagher's graciously took a reservation for the play off game and, actually had \"Reserved For...\" signs on the tables. The manager was very courteous, even when some of our group were slow to arrive. For this, Gallagher's has secured its place as my \"#1 go to watch a game\" spot for all time. \n\nP.S. If your preference is \"fake cheese\" nachos, as mine is, then hands-down these are the best nachos in the Valley.

I guess I will have to write the review and then decide between 3 and 4 after I brain dump. \n\nI have been to Gallagher's twice now. The first time for Saturday night Karaoke, and the second for the final playoff game (Go Cards!). Over the span of those two visits, I have tried quite a few items. \n\nThe nachos are really, really good. They use nacho sauce versus shredded cheese, which I happen to think is pretty tasty. However, the salad I ordered left quite a bit to be desired. I kept getting the crunchy gross part of the lettuce head so only half of my salad was edible. The cookie sundae was pretty damn good, as well. I have also had the cheese crisp which I have no complaints about. \n\nPerhaps the BEST thing about this place is the $3 well drinks. I am used to paying $5-$9 for a damn vodka tonic, so I was pleasantly surprised when I paid under $10 for three drinks! \n\nNow, service here is another story. I'm sorry to say that both times it has left something to be desired. I completely understand that the place was packed on a football day, but the whole place was reserved in advance so I feel like they should have been more prepared. I had to ask for limes three times, and waited twenty minutes to get one. It also took almost forty minutes to get my damn nachos when I first showed up. \n\nAnother flaw? They put bacon/chicken on my salad, even though I specifically said no meat... and had previously told the waitress I was vegetarian (when I ordered nachos). \n\nOooooo now that I think about it... the very worst part of my experience was that we were seated near the patio, so every time someone opened the door the cigarette smoke rushed in. My eyes were watering and I was coughing the whole time. It was pretty uncomfortable, actually. \n\nOverall Gallagher's is a pretty good sports bar with relatively good food and great priced drinks, but there are definitely some service issues. \n\nDamn.... I still can't choose between a 3 and 4 .... I know I will be back ...

As much as I'd love to give a neighborhood sports bar props, this place just did too many things wrong for me to comply.\n\nWent there with a bunch rowdy Yelpers to watch the NFC Championship game on Sunday and was fairly disappointed.  For starters, as a sports bar and Cardinals viewing destination that had been promoting themselves as \"the place to watch the big game,\" they seemed grossly unprepared for the crowd they got.\n\nFor starters, I sat at my table for about 15 minutes before I gave up on a server coming over to take my drink/food order, and went up to the bar to order and take the middleman out of the equation.  Only when I went up to the bar did I learn that they had run out of glasses!!!\n\nThis is where it gets good though.  Their drink specials that I was interested in were their $2.50 20 oz domestic drafts, pretty good deal if you ask me.  And since they had run out of glasses (definitely not my fault as I am not their barware supplier) and the bartender asked me to get a bottle instead, I naiively assumed they would honor at least a similar deal to the one that they were promoting.\n\nThis is where I was SORELY mistaken.  Not only did they not give me my 12 oz bottle for the same price as the 20 oz draft that they were unable to serve me, they actually had the nerve to upcharge me to $3 per bottle!!!\n\nNeedless to say, I was a bit incensed.  And it had nothing to do with the extra 50 cents per drink, I just thought it was poor business practice...a bit of a bait and switch, if you will.\n\nAfter the initial poor service and swindling of my hard earned $$, the bar ended up being okay.  Of course I will have to attribute at least 75% of this to the wonderful company of my yelp compadres, who I hate to disappoint with my less than stellar review, but I have to keep it real.  The TVs were big and plentiful, the food was fair.  I ordered a Buffalo Chicken Wrap which wasn't bad but my fries were SUPER cold and therefore inedible to me.  But the bar's sorry excuse for a smoking section is what threw me over the edge and made me want to puke on more than one occasion.\n\nWe had the bad luck of being sat in the general vicinity of the door that led outside to the smoking section, and every time the door was opened either by a server or a patron, you could literally see plumes and plumes of smoke wafting into the restaurant.  It was disgusting.  I couldn't stay even 5 minutes longer after the Cards won to celebrate because I was coughing and my eyes were starting to water.\n\nI am willing to give Gallaghers 1 more shot under the parameters that there can be no special event going on because they were terribly ill equipped to handle it, and mainly due to the fact that they had tons of TVs and it is relatively close to my house.\n\nAs long as the don't run out of glasses again of course...", "business_id": "F-ykHfGY9lWr12OJ_Ofy7A", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-01-19", "type": "review"}

I do not know many people who would consider this a staple. Its there, if you ever need it...\n\n~Fud/Drinks~\nThe food is bland. Lets just call it as it is. Salads are a best example as to how a restaurant treats its menu. If its got good salads, then they must have amazing entrees. Well this works well for Gallagher's, because their salads are meh meh meh. I tried a Greek salad, which for some reason, comes with iceberg lettuce, crispy, dry, iceberg lettuce. SERIOUSLY!? All the other ingredients including the feta  tasted like they just came out of the box/can they were shipped in. Horrible food choices besides the salads. Greasy, overpriced bar foods that really serve no purpose than to make you fat. Lets just say the ingredients in all their foods are lacking significantly. The drinks are typical bar options. Beer selection is OK, nothing stellar, but at least they carry some local options. But nothing to note that will turn heads, just average.\n\n~Atmosphere~\nThere is no atmosphere really. Like an Applebee's, they put things on the wall and expect that to make the atmosphere of the room. No, it doesn't. There really is no ambiance or significant feel, its weird being that its a sports bar. The carpets are drab, by the way... just wanted  to point out that does not add to the experience. Waitstaff are pretty attentive, they do an OK job. But ya, the crowds aren't lively, and I can definitely name some other places you can feel the true sports-bar experience at. \n\n~Extras/Rating~\nThere is really nothing to add, other than the fact that an amazing resort, the Pointe Hilton, is literally a 1 minute walk away. They have amazing food options there, although its not sports oriented. They do have the Hole-in-the Wall restaurant as well, which is amazing western Bar-B-Q. Go there, honestly.

The waitress barely had that many people to wait on and it took her a million decades to get us anything whether it be drinks or food. You almost did not want to ask for anything just because we wanted to get the hell out of there ASAP. We already knew what we wanted for a good 30 minutes before she came back and took our order.  Then we got our order maybe another hour to an hour and a half later! SWEET. By that time my mom being the feisty little Filipino lady that she is was absolutely livid and was complaining about when we would get our food. I don't rush people yes i am irritated and hungry but i will not rush you or get loud.  God only knows what they could do to my food behind closed doors. \n\n    So after staying at this location for 2 hours or so because of the long wait for everything i am slightly scared to go back to any chilis but i love their strawberry lemonade so its hard to refuse based on one girls performance or lack of.  As i finish my review on their not good food quality and piss poor service i cannot help but notice another girl had the same issue in june and i almost wonder if we had the same female who had waited on us and literally waited before taking our orders and giving us anything. If i went to this location which i highly doubt we will, i hope to god she is or was fired because if you cannot handle a couple tables and are no where to be found majority of the time something is just not right about that.  I am sorry. This is Arizona honey work laws suck here and if you aren't a decent worker you should not have a job unless you are being a brown noser with the managers and that's the only reason you are there is one of the many reasons i hate hate HATE Arizona work laws with a passion.

They had a couple of musicians who were very good.  The last time I was there I remembered the music to be a distraction.  This couple was very good.  Service is excellent.  We started off with the Mussels Marinara.  Maybe the best mussels I have had.  The marinara was to die for!  Next we had Calamari Fritti.  They were cooked to perfection. The marinara was not as flavorful as with the mussels though.  Still, it earns a 5.  The house salad was great.  I can't remember having a better Italian dressing!  So why the 3 overall?  My wife and I were both disappointed with the entrees.  On the recommendation of the waiter I had the Eggplant Parmesian.  The first bite the eggplant was chewy. Now the marinara sauce had no flavor!  Same for the cheese, no provolone?  I admit I am very picky with food especially  eggplant parm so I  rarely order it because I usually am disappointed.  I cook as a hobby and I grill the eggplant over charcoal instead of frying it and it is wonderful.  I also use 3 cheeses.  Anyway, back to this review, my wife had the mahi-mahi.  It was okay,  It was slightly fishy.  Again, kind of a disappointment after such a wonderful start.  I should have stuck with my original plan, just fill up on their wonderful appetizers.  I should also mention that their Zinfandel was also great and my wife said the Creme Brulee was the best she ever had.  Their secret, chocolate on the bottom!

She did not have much to say except for a fumbling, \"sorry, we'll make sure it doesn't happen to anyone else\", blamed the problems on the recent change of ownership.

Yes, it was Valentines Day; but my wife and I have been together for 15 years and neither of us like to do Valentines dinner out for the obvious reasons (crowds, long waits, mediocre food, etc...).  We would rather enjoy each others company and have a good time just being together.\n\nI have been going to Gallagher's on Fridays with a group of friends for lunch.  I have enjoyed my lunches.  So far, the service and all the food I have tried has been very good.  \n\nSo anyway, we walk in and grab a booth.  The server comes over, introduces herself and tells us she will be taking care of us this evening (standard for most places).  We ordered a couple of iced teas and checked out the menu.  \n\nWe ordered our meals and an appetizer that was on happy hour special.  This was about the last time we saw our server (other than her walking by and looking at the table).  The manager (I'm guessing on this, he could even be the owner...) delivered our appetizer, our meals, refilled our tea, checked to see how we were doing, etc...\n\nOur server wasn't overloaded w/ tables, and the place was not packed (we went early, about 5PM), but it seems that we were an annoyance to her and not a table of customers that she was supposed to be \"taking care of\".  \n\nShe did show back up when we had finished our meals and asked if we wanted desert.  We declined because we were full.  She brought the check, I put my card in the folder for her to run.  When she returned the folder, she just set it on the table while walking by; no \"thanks\", no \"see you soon\", no \"go to hell\", nothing.\n\nI won't put the server's name on here because I don't want to embarrass her.  I understand it was Valentine's day and maybe she didn't want to be there, or maybe it was because we were not drinking alcohol.  I don't know...\n\nMy wife and I are pretty easy, we don't ask for a bunch of substitutions, we're not needy.  Just bring us what we order, fill our glasses when they're empty, and check on us once in a while.  Do those things and you will earn yourself a nice tip (I usually tip about 25% up to 40%).  \n\nI will also say that we had dinner on Friday night at the Gallagher's on Carefree Highway.  The food there was also very good, and the service was great (and they were busier than the Union Hills store was on Saturday).  Our server checked up on us a couple of times, the manager came by to check on us, even the young gentleman busing the tables wished us a good night.\n\nThis review is not so much about the food, which has been very good to excellent on EVERY visit (worthy of five stars!), but about the service we received on ONE occasion when we stopped in for dinner.", "business_id": "PkBkqQpAoeX3Ogo5HBthQg", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-02-16", "type": "review"}

My husband is a big chicken wing fan; he eats them until they're coming out his ears.  There are lots of burgers and hot sandwiches too.  I always order the Jalapeno Cheesesteak, thinly sliced beef, cooked with mushrooms, onions, peppers and jalapenos, and served with melted pepper jack cheese.  I'm not much of a drinker, but I know they have a full bar serving both the usual stuff and also specialty drinks.  They also have a huge variety of beer.\n\nPrices are a great value and always several food, drink, or happy hour specials.   Casey Jones offers live music on special nights of the week.  This place is fun, not too rowdy, but a great place to hang out with friends and have a tasty meal.\n\n(Because I want to be totally open, I need to say that I'm an acquaintance of one of the owners here, not close friends, but wanted to mention it in the spirit of transparency.)", "business_id": "vFJmFFfPVhHkC3bWOeZnNA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-01-04", "type": "review"}

In other words, I traveled all the way from Tucson to Northern Phoenix to eat an all right burger.  Well, that's not true.  My friend and I traveled there to watch Avatar on the IMAX screen at Desert Ridge.  \n\nTo reiterate, the burgers at Islands are \"fine\" in the mildest possible term.  The ground beef was of decent to good quality, and therefore the taste was of average to good caliber.  It was the fixings that sort of dragged down the burger in the taste department.  I ordered the Kilauea, which is a jalapeno & black pepper crusted burger with pepper jack cheese, chipotle aioli, lettuce,\ntomato and Island Reds.  I'm not a cheese fan, so I opted to forgo the pepper jack.  I'm not sure if that would've saved the burger.  The seasoning lacked any pronounced or distinguished flavor.  Sadly, the end result was a rather bland burger.  \n\nHave mercy, the fries, on the other hand, were probably the best thing on my plate.  The fries at Islands were good and fresh, just like me with the ladies after a few drinks.  With all due respect to a review who said that the fries \"tasted a lot like In-N-Out's,\" I disagree.  In-N-Out fries are of the thin-cut variety, while Island's are more of a traditional style.  What I appreciated the most about the fries were that they were crispy and fresh.  \n\nThe service was fairly fast, efficient and friendly, especially considering this a California-based chain.  I hate to wait for refills on my drinks, and our server was always on the spot just prior to hitting bottom as to satiate our impending thirst.  By the way, if you order a Cherry Coke here, it comes with an actual maraschino cherry.  Well, the first one does at least.  The second and third ones lacked any cherry.  I guess once you pop that first cherry, you really don't get any more.  \n\nOn that note, I would consider paying Island's a visit again, but it's not high on my list.

I came to Brigett's for one reason - karaoke. And this place offers it every night of the week!\n\nThe first night I showed up, I was with three friends. All of whom had to leave early for work the next morning, but I wasn't ready to stop singing. Less than three songs after my group had left, Papa T (the karaoke DJ) advised me that no one sat all by themselves at Brigett's and invited me to a table filled with other karaokers. \n\nThey were all super nice, very friendly and open, and genuinely seemed like they wanted to get to know me better. Due to Papa T's insistence I not sit alone, I've made several friends through karaoke. A nice thing for someone who just moved here from the Midwest and doesn't know anyone.\n\nBeer and food. The bar offers a kitchen with the usual bar foods. They are decently priced, good portions, and above-average bar quality meals. The kitchen is open late, even on weekdays, to accomodate the hungry, late-night crowd. Beer prices are reasonable, as are shots. I haven't had mixed drinks so I can't comment on their price or quality.\n\nTVs are offered, even during karaoke, although they are left to captioning at that point. There are four pool tables and a dart machine. If you're not interested in being part of the main floor, karaoke crowd, there is a second room to the back that houses two  of the pool tables and the dart machine.\n\nBrigett's also offers several other types of entertainment BEFORE karaoke hours - such as comedy and team trivia. Happy Hour pricing and quantity is unbeatable really.\n\nI regularly go to this place - for food, beer, and karaoke.", "business_id": "-xLwGUmmyKgsTtFOOXzjeg", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-12-20", "type": "review"}

Right when you walk in you notice the eclectic crowd, and I was for sure that this was going to be the night that I finally realized a lifelong dream to witness a dance off, but no such luck.   \n \nDaisy Train, the live band consisting of a guy, girl duo was very engaging and played a good mix of \"couple\" songs and \"dance in a group\" music.  Don't be scared of the dance floor when the 2 steppin' songs come on though, just make eye contact with one of the many cowboys huddled around the perimeter of the dance floor.  I chose an older gentleman who knew something about boundaries, but you can have your choice of younger or older, taller or shorter.  Just make sure to watch their style and level of attachment before you commit because you could be stuck with a cowboy that moves more like a chihuahua in heat.  Didn't happen to me, but it's real and consider yourself warned!.  \n\nDaisy Train does about 3 sets and while they take a break to wet their whistle, the DJ comes on and plays a mix of hip hop and group dancing favorites like the electric slide.  My one complaint is that they had more than one disc that seemed to be skipping and didn't have good recovery time.   \n\nBesides that though, there is plenty of space so come with a group, be prepared to dance with a couple of cowboys if you are so inclined to master the 2 step, and wear boots not heels.

We arrived in Phoenix at around 9:30 am local time, and by the time we picked up our luggage and rental car, it was almost 11 am. Since we flew over from the east coast and had not eaten since early that morning, we were ridiculously hungry. However, that day also happened to be the day of the highly anticipated US-England World Cup soccer match, so we also wanted to watch the game. In need of a site with food and televisions, we decided to look for a sports bar or pub. But I guess just about everyone in Phoenix wanted to watch the soccer game at a bar, too, because all of the sports bars that we passed by were full. Who knew that Arizonans (or Americans, for that matter) followed soccer? Anyway, long story short, our search kept turning up duds until our GPS navigated us to Rodehouse Restaurant. The nearly empty restaurant, large televisions, and our groaning stomachs all conspired to pull us into the restaurant. My jubilation at finally getting a chance to sit down and eat quickly vanished when I noticed that, though the game was not even 10 minutes old at that point, England was already up 1-0. Sigh.\n\nAnyway, about the restaurant: we ordered a couple of burgers and salads. The Cobb salad was actually pretty large and substantial, containing a good amount of chicken, egg, avocado, bacon, and cheese. The chili cheeseburger, a behemoth of a burger, was tasty, as the thick, hearty chili definitely hit the spot. Messy, but damn tasty. Oh, and the Tavern Fries (I think that's what they were called) served with the burgers were good as well. All in all, the food was solid, but nothing blew my mind away. \n\nWe stayed for the duration of the game, giving a large whoop when the US tied game on Dempsey's goal courtesy of the English keeper's gaffe. The waiter was nice and didn't mind that my family and I lingered at the restaurant for the length of the game, long after we had finished our meals, so props for that. The Rodehouse Restaurant is not particularly special, but it more than served its purpose as a place where we could watch the game and get some good grub.", "business_id": "aiFo19hI2ulx47oMdjuqfw", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-01-07", "type": "review"}

Native Grill & Wings is actually one of the few places in which I do not dislike anything. I decided to write a simple easy review on this particular location, so why not? Let's cut to the chase.\n\nPros:\nI'm not exactly a sports fan, but this is DEFINITELY a place for one. There are TVs everywhere, throughout the patios, the indoor areas, and at the bar. They are all constantly switched on to ESPN, FOX Sports, and on rare occasions, ESPN2. From the looks of it, it seemed impossible to not have a clear view of the TV screen without having someone's head, arm, etc. block your way. We came on Sunday, and the wings are crazy cheap. The fish and chips had a pretty decent taste, as we split them all up between the three of us. The service was not particularly the nicest, nor the meanest, but was speedy when talking to us. They had great placing of all the heat lamps and chairs outside in the patio, so it is great to come during the winter. The location is fairly large, so you can almost always find a table to sit at.\n\nCons:\nThe patio had not many places to put your used cigarettes. I am not a smoker, nor do I give any offense to smokers, but the patio REEKS of smoke. The service here is fast-speaking, but not exactly fast-moving. We waited for several minutes between when we asked for the check and the delivery of the check itself. The fish and chips had decent taste, but not decent size. They were tiny compared to the fish and chips in the OTHER location for the same price and meal. I was really disappointed when I saw this. We did not get enough wings. There were only 4 wings for the 3 of us for EACH dish. \n\nOverall, this is simply not the greatest restaurant I've experienced. Its other competitors were able to show a performance at least twenty times better than this one. Thanks, but I'd rather visit the Ahwatukee location from this time on.", "business_id": "SgGINtDKQgoXoAnQgrDKDg", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-12-29", "type": "review"}

Ok fine i'll get over it. We find a table and sit down. We order some wine - mind you there was no recommendation or comment on our choice. Whatever. Then we order some bruschetta based appetizers and gnocchi and soup. Bruschetta arrives and i am real disappointed that its just a bruschetta bread sliced real thick and not even toasted. How not cool. \nThen gnocchi arrives. It tasted ok but was cold in some parts and kinda skimpy on sauce. Is it possible it was nuked? By that time 2 man band started to play. They were pretty good and played some soft rock and country without overpowering whole place, like it often happens. But wait, why talk of the band if food review if not over, was not there soup involved? Hehe we wondered what happened to that as well. \"Oppps, you right\". Few minutes after our reminder it came. And not it was not worse the wait :( Too bland, too sweet. Not that great after all. \nWe also got coffee and desert. Both were alright but nothing to write home about. Just ok.\n\nPerhaps, if you come there with a few friends, do not care much about food and just drink the wine and listen to music it would be much better. We came there for a dinner and wine.

Don't bother eating here.  Stick to the wine when going.  Food here, I think, is okay, and overpriced.  Its a wine bar, not a resturant.

Not that we're trying to get out quickly, but there's a point where it gets absurd. Here's a little example. P and I came in one rainy night around 7:30. It wasn't too busy and we found some nice, comfy seats and waited for a waitress to bring us some menus. And waited. And waited. Don't forget, they're not busy. Twenty minutes later a friendly waitress comes by (they're always friendly, haven't had a knowledgeable one yet, but they're always friendly) with some menus. Another ten or fifteen minutes she comes back to take our order. P had a question about one of the wines so the waitress offered her a taste of it. How nice! Another ten minutes she brought me my glass and P's taste and mentioned that they opened a bottle just for her taste. Unfortunately, P didn't like the wine at all (if I remember right, it was on the list in the wrong place, and P was looking for something much, much different) so instead of waiting again she russion-rouletted it and just ordered something. It came, we chatted and enjoyed our evening and she catches my eye and nods at the next table. it seems they have ordered the wine P didn't like and the waitress stands at the table popping the cork out with great flourish saying, \"here's the bottle of wine you ordered\". Why no one questioned it not needed to be uncorked, I don't know. It's a classy place like that though (underlying sarcasm). My Wine Cellar I mean. Not the poor suckers next to us paying top dollar for an opened bottle of wine with a pour missing from it. \n\nI guess I feel a sort of affection for My Wine Cellar. The same sort of affection you would feel for your \"special\" cousin. The one that can't seem to move out of your aunt and uncle's house and never seems to make smart life decisions. Oh, I know we've all got one. You want to strangle him in one breathe but the next you can't because he's always got such a sweet grin on his face and small animals really seem to take to him. A lot. Anyway, My Wine Cellar is right here in Ahwatukee and they have survived and you can go and have a glass of wine and just hang out. Reasons like that keep bringing me back.

Called to see if getting a table at 8 pm on Sat night would be a problem, she said no, come on down. We wanted to love it, as it's not far from home. It hurts me to give a place with a new owner a mediocre review. But I have to be honest.\n\nHappy that we caught Notes from Neptune playing music which is only once a month; they were REALLY good. Relaxing yet upbeat, nice sax & voices, & not too loud to hold a conversation; well-done choice of entertainment.\n\nThe blonde server helped me choose a wine, let me try one I was considering, which I appreciated. \n\nMy husband got beef sliders. They were tasty & toasted buns were a nice touch. They came with a few (a FEW) fries that seemed to be made from delicious, creamy potatoes, but were sadly soggy even though they looked pretty well-done. \n\nI ordered two apps instead of a meal - the sweet potato chips (server said they are delicious, made fresh to order) and the brussel sprouts. \n\nWe did have a staggered order, as I took a while to decide on my food. Slider order went in first. But once I did order, I waited a LONG time for the chips, much longer than the turnaround for my husband's sliders. The menu says \"hand cut,\" so maybe they actually grab a raw potato and start carefully slicing when the order makes it into the kitchen?  However, I would then expect them to be uh-oh hot. When they arrived, they had NO heat at all. Given my history as a server & restaurant manager, I'm guessing then they were left in the window a while before making it to our table.\n\nThe sweet potato chips were a shockingly small portion for the $5 price - I had to hide my surprise when they were delivered. You gotta know, we are NOT \"big portion\" people, we often split an entree when we go out, as we are not fans of the \"more is better\" concept.  But for $5, this was ridiculous, a HANDFUL. My husband sincerely said to me, \"I planned to have a few, but I'd feel guilty, as you won't have enough.\" I should have counted, could have very easily and quickly, but didn't think about it before I dove in since I was hungry. They are thin-cut, come in a cutesy little mini-deep fryer basket lined very loosely with waxy paper that therefore holds them up higher than the bottom of the basket (like the gift basket trick of putting in a false bottom to lift up the gift items). Therefore, initially they look mounding out of the little basket, with a honey dip ramekin nestled in there with them (taking up yet more space NOT full of chips). Once I removed the ramekin and looked inside, I could no longer deny that yes in fact this was a - forgive me, owner - rip off. I know what a sweet potato costs, even an organic one bought at retail price at \"Whole Paycheck\" grocery store. I'm all for places making a nice profit, but honestly... I felt kinda \"taken\" by that app. If it had been delicious, maybe if it had \"wowed\" me (I LOVE sweet potato anything), but they were un-warm, not much flavor, and the honey aioli didn't improve them for me at all (I set that to the side after two tries). \n\nThe brussel sprouts for some reason took another 15 - 20 minutes PAST the chips to arrive (no exaggeration, the band took their entire break & went back to playing while we waited for the brussels). But when they finally arrived, YUM! we agreed we should have skipped the chips AND the sliders, and just had multiple order of the brussels. (But that would be weird, \"Hi, just 2 orders of brussel sprouts, please,\" - not a reason to return). They were delivered hot, and their weight pushed that little piece of wax paper all the way down into the cutesy basket, no space-robbing ramekin, so I'm happy to say said basket was joyously full. We didn't mind paying $6 for those!  (Surely the brussel sprouts cost more than a small sweet potato?? Don't understand pricing logic here).\n\nMusic really saved the whole experience from being really mediocre. Server was very nice, but either she screwed up my order and 1. left my first item in the window and 2. forgot to put in my second item for a long time, OR this is normal kitchen flow (she didn't say anything like, \"sorry for the wait,\" so maybe this is normal?). Either way, unimpressed. \n\nSUMMARY: We agreed nothing to bring us back. However, we could see it's potential. If you hit it for happy hour prices and the music is good, and maybe when the patio is open, and the kitchen and servers are humming along, it could be a fine place to go, as others describe.  Moving on...........\n\nP.S. - Funny, I just saw that \"Phyllis\" mentioned an odor the same night we were there. We were not sitting near either bathroom. I asked my husband at one point, \"Did you fart?\" He looked shocked, swore no (and he's pretty trustworthy on that Q.) A little while later I smelled a waft again... and I realized it was the same sewage smell that happens in public bathroom drains from time to time.", "business_id": "Our6bzte5W1wlIeOu9luug", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-01-13", "type": "review"}

I did not care for the chardonnay at all.  I felt like I was drinking fruit juice.  Then I was going to try the one from Spain.  The waitress brought me a sample and I hated it - reminded me of baby powder for some odd reason.  So I tried a glass of the reisling.  I really liked it!!\n\nFor food we tried many things.  The french fries with no bacon.  They were delicious fries but I did not like the aoli.  I am just not a fan of mayonnaise based sauces.  The chick peas were my favorite appetizer that we tried.  It really grew on me and I didn't think I liked chick peas.  We also tried the bruschetta.  I had the one with brie, carmelized onions and apple.  It was okay.  I wouldn't order it again.  It was skimpy on the bri and the bread was a boring wheat flavor to me.  The onions were delicious though.  Also tried the brussell sprouts and wasn't impressed.

The staff understands how to interpret your pallet well, and easily helped guide my fiance and self through the options we had. We ordered some Sweet Red they had on the shelf which was perfect with the pizza we ordered. The pizza was a fine thin crust with yummy add-ins like pepperoni and olives, etc. The wines here all are fantastic, we had a hard time choosing from the selection they keep stock of. They also have some beers if you prefer that, although I believe the selection has changed. \n\n~Atmosphere~ \nIt has a quiet, local and relaxing quality to it. I felt right at home and our waitress on each occasion was welcoming and attentive. It has a lot of homey qualities to the site, the bar area has a TV but its not in your face, allowing me the chance to pay attention to whom I am with, rather than other disturbances. They have an outdoor patio we briefly skimmed over. Next time I go I'll update on it so you have a feel for what it provides, etc. There is a general sense that loud noise is well out of the norm here, so boisterous parties are probably best left for reserving space for an event. \n\n~Extras/Rating~\nThey do host events, and they do a great job at hosting them from what I have heard. It is an awesome idea for a date, there isn't a better idea for a first date then some wine and pizza to chill to while you talk. They get 4 stars for having a good blend of food and wine/beer selection as well. Plus on top of that, the ambiance is perfectly romantic and will leave you with a great lasting memory!

Holidays are the times when it's most likely the stresses placed on the kitchen and wait staff may result in frazzled service and a less than savory dining experience. But ramen for dinner was out of the question. (I've tried to keep that survival food to a minimum since graduating.) So what's a gal to do? \n\nHop into the hooptyville and cruise in search of something better than soggy shoestrings. Doesn't sound like much of a challenge at first until our two players realize that it's New Year's Even and they're pretty fucked for A) Places that still have seats open cuz all the smart folks made reservations, B) Places that are open at all cuz nobody wants to work when there's bubbly to be had and C) Places other than 24 hour greasy spoons cuz even fast food joints close on New Year's Eve.\n\n45 minutes elapse in which our players dart in and out of establishments encountering option A, drive by potential restaurants while encountering option B, and almost succumb to option C. Enter Ruffino's, a humble little Italian Restaurant located in a strip mall dangerously close to the suburbs of Ahwatukee. \n\nSo we saunter up and politely wait our turn for the hostess to be free. \"Two. No, we didn't make reservations.\" And the flibbertigibbet proceeds to seat two parties milling around us without even informing us whether dining there was a possibility. Again, she turns to us. \"Do you have an open table for two? No, we didn't make reservations.\" Again, she proceeds to seat others. Lots and lots of others.\n\nOh no you did not just rouse the bitch from her slumber. The pursed lips, raised eyebrow and death stare begin to surface. Mr. Man senses the subtle change, \"Do you just want to go and find somewhere else to eat?\"\n\nA cold, calculating response with an edge sharp enough to cut the horrid poodle hair off the twit that's been snubbing us spews out. (I can't recall what it was exactly. The vitriol clouds memory, often with good reason.)\n\nThen our savior, a tux dressed waiter out of stage left, greets us with a smile and ushers us to a table for two in the bar area. The bitch circles three times before settling down for a snooze so Erica can enjoy a nice meal with Mr. Man.\n\nSince it was a busy holiday they only had three seating times and a truncated menu, but that just makes it easier for an indecisive gal like me to make up my mind. Mr. Man goes with his favorite, the Veal Marsala. I opt for the Veal Ruffino, prosciutto and mushrooms sauteed in a tarragon brandy cream sauce layered over veal medallions. Yes I eat poor caged baby cows. And I do it because they taste goooooood. My meal was perfection, with a side of al dente rigatoni in marinara and perfectly steamed petite julienne vegetables. The marsala wasn't as stellar, but I'm not the one that had to consume it, so to each their own. \n\nThe meal came with garlic bread, which was respectable, and a salad that was delish! Their house vinagrette was rockin'. We also decided to kick off the evening with a bottle of chardonnay that was chilled in one of them thingys that stands by your table. \n\nThere were balloons and streamers and live entertainment in the form of a super stellar, pitch perfect showman all tuxed out and belting out classics while playing the piano. Cutesy couples were even requesting songs and dancing with their sweeties. Aww. The sap in me just melts. See that puddle of goo at your feet? That's me. Don't step in it.\n\nThere was also a nice program they were running that night where they would take you home for a flat rate of 10 bucks within a 15 mile radius so you didn't ring in the New Year with a DUI. Now that's class.\n\nI don't know if I'd ever go back here again (leetle on the pricey side at 20-30 bucks for an entree) but if you're in the area and looking for a dining experience rather than straight calories, hit it up!", "business_id": "S3FhtwXuiGMlGdBNtmiiSQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-01-10", "type": "review"}

From then on all was great; Our server, John I think, was very nice and made great suggestions, the manager was around a few times to make sure everything went well. \n\nSome of the guys at the table wanted to order a few appetizers, muscles and escargot. Oh dear lord they are going to make me eat snails I thought to myself. And to my great surprise, they were great. I have never had them before, and from my understanding, they are only good if made right, and made right these were. Very yummy, i will have them again for sure. \n\nFor dinner I had the Shrimp Carbenara, suggested by John, and it was awesome!

First of all, even though our table was close to the door in the bar area, the host did not even accompany us, but motioned where to sit. Upon ordering our drinks, we were very surprised being told there would be an extra charge for stuffed olives in my husband's martini. My husband has ordered martinis with stuffed olives at the most finest, and least popular restaurants, and never has he been told an additional cost would be charged for his request. Consequently, after waiting an unusually long time for our before dinner drinks, they were brought to our table along with my husband's soup. In the past we had often frequented Ruffino's, however with the present ownership we are likely not to return. Food was just o.k., nothing exceptional. I think Ruffino's had lost its personal flavor as the previous owners would drop by the table, ask if service and food were enjoyable and to our liking, chatted a little, and made you feel like special guests.

Why some establishments think that 100+ degrees outside means it should be 65- degrees inside is byeond me. We visited on a Saturday before a movie and they seated us just under what seemed to be an ice vent, I was glad I had that sweater in the car.\n\nMy first impression of the Elephant Bar was \"What type of food do they serve here?\" Are they Mexi-merican, Italian, American, BBQ, sandwich, Asian Fusion? I'm not sure, and neither does their 30+ page menu. They've got the most confusing menu I've seen from just about any restaurant. I think I saw the same menu item on three separate pages with at least two separate items, why? Don't ask me.\n\nI FINALLY, after about 25 minutes, ordered a barbecue glazed chicken sandwich with the macaroni and cheese side - which they touted all over the menu and table top flyers (the mac n cheese that is). By the way, turns out that their idea of barbecue glazed is a bland piece of chicken with barbecue sauce added after it's put on your sandwich. I could have sworn that barbecue glazed means it's cooked in a fire roaster / oven with the sauce.\n\nI ended up sending the macoroni and cheese back after 4 or 5 bites, the noodles were way over cooked and the cheese was bland, I guess I could have added salt, but didn't really feel like paying for mediocre macoroni. I also requested them to add jalepenos to my chicken sandwich, and they sent out basically an entire jalepeno pepper on the side not peeled, not chopped, not diced, but sliced about 5 times - I ended up cutting it into smaller pieces myself with the butter knife they supplied me so I could actually add it to my sandwich.\n\nThe chicken wasn't pink, so I THINK it was cooked, but it was walking the line of cooked and not cooked. After about one fifth of the chicken sandwich I decided the flavor wasn't going to get much better and ended up sending that back also. \n\nThe bill arrived and to my surprise the chicken sandwich was still on there. I asked the waitress \"are you really going to charge me for that meal?\". She went and found the manager to which I had to explain again all the reasons I didn't want to eat the food they provided and why I didn't want to order something else instead.\n\nMy wife's hambruger was good though. If you're here, hungry, and confused at what to order, get a burger; I think it's the best thing on the menu and difficult to get wrong.

While is good they are open late the menu has changed, they don't have a lot to choose from and the food isn't that great.  Also both times we have gone my order was messed up (one was wings and one was dessert, not hard orders).  Not worth it to me to give a 3rd change.", "business_id": "d-rZazFFYvnjRZUhLTEUZg", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-02-21", "type": "review"}

Service was a joke, restaurant was dirty and the food! Mine was OK, but my wife ordered one of the Burgers. The cook forgot to remove the plastic wrap before cooking it and it was served to us that way, melted plastic and all.\n\nWe heard that they were \"under new management\" so we thought we would give it another go for lunch. The new owners didn't do anything to renovate before opening so it looks exactly the same. We stood in the doorway for about five minutes before anyone even acknowledged we were there. When we did finally get sat down we had to wait another ten minutes for drinks and to have our order taken. There were only three other tables sat when we went in mind you. Our waitress was not very attentive and was more interested in watching TV.\n\nI ordered the Blackened Chicken Sandwich. It was decent, had good flavor and was cooked well but the lettuce was soggy and the tomato's were not fresh. My wife ordered the BBQ Bacon Burger and the bread was soggy. We ordered Mac 'n Cheese for my daughter, it was cheap Kraft stuff (not even the deluxe), not home made.\n\nBottom line, the \"new\" owners had the opportunity to really turn this place around and missed the mark, terribly. It's doubtful we will return.", "business_id": "d-rZazFFYvnjRZUhLTEUZg", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-02-25", "type": "review"}

The food is great - I have had the spinach and artichoke dip and the only problem I had was there wasn't enough dip to keep up with the chips!\n\nThe French onion soup is really nice, and I believe made in house. Also, the buffalo chicken sandwich is outrageous!...as long as you ask for an extra side of buffalo sauce, if you need it.\n\nNice atmosphere, the service leaves some to be desired. Make your food and bev decisions quickly, because when the servers come by, you may not be able to flag them down for a while. For a sports bar, the food really does it here.", "business_id": "d-rZazFFYvnjRZUhLTEUZg", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-12-18", "type": "review"}

Last night I went to go watch the BCS Championship game and get some wings and they had a pizza special $6.99 for a 14\" cheese pie so we got that too.  All the food was great and the game was on every tv along with ample volume.  Overall a great time and great food.
