If you plan to go on a Friday or Saturday night, I suggest reservations because there's nowhere really to relax indoors when you are waiting for a table.\n\nBeing regulars, we have settled into a few choice menu items.  If you bother to read the menu, you'll notice a few jokes hidden in the description of items, so even if you are a regular, it's worth a read.  We always start with some chips and pico or the Picka Dippa and some margaritas.  The black bean dip is to die for.  Slight bit of spice, creamy black beans and a little bit of melted cheese.  The beer cheese isn't my favorite, so that one is never ordered, but we regularly switch up the salsa choices.  For margaritas, we have settled on the Ultimate margarita or the Don Julio VIP.\n\nThe burritos are huge.  Seriously, as big as your face type of huge.  At this restaurant, you will definitely use your silverware.  Of course, they are filled with a lot of rice and beans, so I recommend to pay extra for double meat to make a more desirable meat to starch ratio.  The chimichanga is great, but pre-made so they can't accomodate any changes.  The tacos and fajitas are good and come with nice warm flour tortillas.  Enchiladas tend to be oversauced, but overall good.  \n\nThe food tends to be quite consistant and you get what you expect, but other parts of the meal tend to be hit or miss:\n1. I think it's the sour mix, but something about the margaritas tends to be really inconsistant.  Sometimes you get a strong one, sometimes not so strong.... Sometimes you get a sweet one, sometimes you get a sour one.  It's never terrible by any means, but you really never know what you are going to get.  The Greentree location has the most variation in the margaritas while McNight road's margaritas tend to be better more often.\n2. As off-season tomatoes tend to be finiky, sometimes the pico is fresh and flavorful, sometimes you get the gritty or cardboard-ish tomatoes.\n3. Some of there servers are great while other times you get one that leaves you wanting more from the service.\n\nIn contrast to another review, YES, they do appreciate you on your birthday.  None of that childish singing or a flamboyant dessert... if you are on there list, you get a birthday card for a free burrito.  That's better than any of that cheesy crap.  Although a casual dining chain restaurant typically isn't worthy birthday dinner fare, if someone's giving away a free burrito, I am there.", "business_id": "hhNlQWaKqGbMPoeZHoL-IQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-12-29", "type": "review"}

I think this once again has to do with little me's disliking of Mexican-type foods and eateries. Fortunately, adult me has much better taste than little me, which means I get to enjoy Mad Mex in all of its glory now.\n\nI've been at this location a couple times the last couple of months and it hasn't let me down yet. The first time I wanted to get in on the Gobblerito trend that half of my coworkers were enjoying during November, so I ordered that and a frozen margarita. Both were pretty darn awesome - I took half of my massive Thanksgiving burrito home and proceeded to eat nothing but that and more Thanksgiving food for the next few days. Most notable from that first visit was the fact that even though the place was hopping, the service was super quick. In fact my waitress came and asked about my drink order before I'd even opened the drink menu - it was just that quick. The kitchen had my meal ready super quickly as well and I was out the door in under a hour. Pretty darn impressive considering just how busy they were that night.\n\nSince then Mad Mex hasn't disappointed. The service hasn't been AS prompt since then but it's certainly been reasonable, and the speed in the kitchen makes up for any order delays. I practically devoured my shrimp, spinach and mushroom quesadilla during my last visit - talk about a meal with lots of my favorite ingredients! Ingredients, I must add, which were all well cooked and seasoned and mixed together in the right varieties, resulting in a well-balanced and flavorful meal. I also remain absolutely in LOVE with their variety of margaritas, which are impressively strong and delicious no matter what size drink you order.\n\nReally, my only complaint is their need to play loud background noise to \"set the mood\" for the place - I'd never want to bring a large group here because of the soundtrack they've got going. One or two people talking to each other over that noise is enough for me.

Best tortillas in Pittsburgh - my fiance and I were beginning to despair of ever finding 12-inch flour tortillas to make burritos (which we like to do way more often than our arteries appreciate), when a fortuitous series of events pointed us to Reyna's.  The cooler near the front of the store had plenty of 12\" tortillas of varying types, and some smaller flour tortillas, but none of the kind we wanted!  I asked one of the employees if they had any 12\" flour tortillas, and he led us to the back, where he opened up a large box, pulled out two packages of exactly the kind of tortilla we wanted, and said, \"How many do you want?\"  \n\nNow, that's my kinda place.\n\nWe proceeded to grab everything we'd need to make burritos that night, short of the chicken we already had at home.  And then, for good measure, we got a jar of roasted green chiles for another night's chile verde, and some pineapple-and-chili-pepper lollipops, because, where else in this city have we seen those???  I can't wait to try out the taco stand one of these days.\n\nReyna Foods is a quintessential Mexican grocery.

And Yerba Mate, all of the brand from Argentina and Paraguay, and they also have them in flavors.\n\nUPDATE (Dec. 2013): Reyna food has replaced Edgar's tacos stand and Edgar's tacos has been moved around the corner, closer to Pamela's on 21st Street.

It was near my best friend's home, and a huge group of us went one day. I wasn't an adventurous eater then, so I ordered something that looked pretty tame. I had the nacho cheese burritos, with chicken. That was in 2001 and for the past 12 years I have ordered the same thing every time I visit. \n\nThere is a short list of \"must visit\" places every time we go home, and Miguel's is #1 on that list. When you pull into their gravel parking lot, look past the outside of the building and it's location. When you get inside, look past the decor & the cracked, red vinyl booths. Take a seat (there is no host/hostess, just sit where you want), dive in to the chips and salsa (I could eat their salsa with a spoon!) and get ready to enjoy a truly delicious meal. \n\nThis visit Graham & I both began our meal with a margarita. We were heading to a movie after dinner, so I got a small one. If you're not going to sit through a three hour, really depressing musical (Les Miserables... really good, though) order a pitcher. They had them on special that night and it the pitcher was cheaper than what we spent on the drinks we ordered. Graham thought his was weak, and ordered an extra shot of tequila, I thought mine was perfect. \n\nWe devoured two baskets of chips and salsa while waiting for our meal. Finally, it arrived. We were starving, and of course this was the one time that the service was slow. But our food came out and it was worth the wait. I know the burritos don't look like much... but oh baby.\n\nThe cheese sauce is absolutely delicious, and the inside of the burrito is stuffed with huge chunks of chicken, bell peppers, tomatoes & onions. Every single bite is delicious. I was craving some black beans too, so I ordered a dish on the side. Black beans are usually pretty bland at most restaurants, and these were too. But a spoonful of the delicious salsa and some salt worked wonders. \n\nGraham is a little more diverse in his meal selections than I am. I find something I like, and I tend to stick with it. He typically gets something different each time. This time he ordered the Enchiladas De Chorizo. This was excellent. The chorizo was perfectly cooked and really flavorful. \n\nMiguel's is truly on my list of my favorite restaurants of all time. The food is delicious, the service is quick and the staff is always pleasant. The same people have worked there forever, and back when I still lived in Charlotte and ate there every week, my server would bring me a sweet tea without even asking. And the price absolutely can not be beat. Dinner, margaritas & tip cost us about $42. \n\nThree enchiladas filled with Mexican sausage, covered with shredded cheddar cheese & green sauce. Served with rice, lettuce & pico de gallo.", "business_id": "p_HFt0I92MHDNPWvdtyEBA", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-01-11", "type": "review"}

My wife usually has 2-3 meals from it.\n\nAny other fajita - all of them are great, but now add in the fresh tortilla experience and they are no longer \"just a fajita\".\n\nTacos al Carbon - a great hot sauce and the onion/cilantro combination make these tacos jump\n\nEnchilada Suizas - when you're in the mood for enchiladas done differently with a tomatillo sauce and queso!\n\nAnd, getting back to the live band, they had the volume of the band set perfectly.

When you're just craving that Mexican face-smash of flavor these kinds of places are where it's too be found. But the reason I'm giving them only three stars is because of hidden up-charges. Well, I suppose the hidden part is debatable. They tell you outright that pretty much anything delicious you want to add to your burrito is an up-charge. Guacamole, for example, is an extra charge. Go to Moe's, you can put whatever you want on your burrito from their line-up, no extra charge.

I typically enjoy the standard \"tex-mex\" type restaurants, but this was a pretty poor example of the style.\n\nLike most of these places the experience starts with chips and salsa; this salsa was bland and watery. The chips were cold and stale; not sure when they made them, but I'm sure that it was not the day they served them to us... At this point I should have left and drove up the road to Azteca, Don Pedro or any of the other taco shacks the Queen City has to offer; but sometimes I am not so sharp so we proceeded to order lunch.\n\nI ordered the chimichanga; now usually a chimichanga is a flour tortilla filled with a wide range of seasoned flavorful ingredients and deep fried until it is a golden brown color and slightly crispy on the outside. This thing was filled with bland, unflavorful, grayish colored \"shredded beef\" and was soggy, they then smothered it in some sort of unseasoned canned tomatoes that they tried to pass off as salsa, I assume to mask the lack of flavor in the dish itself. On the side was some wilted lettuce with sour cream and something that vaguely resembled guacamole, and some oily rice that was nearly as flavorless as the rest of the meal. Phenomenal. I managed to eat about a quarter of this flavorless, oily, soggy train wreck before I gave up and threw in the towel. \n\nWhen the server finally came back around several minutes later, she acted like she didn't even notice that none of us had eaten more than half of their meal, and quietly picked up the plates and brought us our checks. None of us were asked how our meal was, if everything was OK, if we wanted any desert or more chips and salsa, and none of us received a refill on our drinks.\n\nAll in all, this was one of the worse restaurant prepared meals that I have had the pleasure of experiencing.

They moved and changed the name to Taco Loco: http://www.news-gazette.com/news/business/restaurants/2012-11-20/el-toro-urbana-moves-gets-new-name.html \nThe decor in this place still smells faintly of wet paint, and somewhat reminiscent of La Bamba in Champaign, if much brighter.  In the table, beneath the top layer, there appeared to be a footprint in the under layer.  Weird.\nThe waiter immediately asked us if we were ready to order, and when we said we needed more time, came over about every 2 minutes to ask if we were ready yet.  It wasn't \"Do you have any questions?\" or \"Can I help you find something to your tastes?\" but just \"Are you ready to order yet?\" every time.\nWe were brought chips and salsa and I ordered a bean dip to go with it.  The salsa was mediocre at best, and the bean dip was lukewarm and a soupy mix of queso and beans.  We were not brought appetizer plates, and so it was challenging to eat these without dripping.\nThe food came out unreasonably fast.  I can only imagine that they keep food in a warmer and not cooked to order, since food that comes out that fast should be HOT.\nI ordered the Quesadilla Roja with ground beef.  The plate contained a folded tortilla, scorched on the bottom, and filled with a ground beef that was a bland version of Taco Bell beef and a smidgen of queso.  The other half of the plate was filled with shredded lettuce, a half slice of underripe tomato, a generous dollop of sour cream, and a teaspoon, maybe, of what they call their \"Special Red Sauce,\" which seemed to be nothing more than chili powder added to tomato paste and thinned.  I had a pepsi with that which came in a glass with a crack in it.\nMy dining partner had a Burrito Loco, which was about a foot long, covered in cheese sauce, and came with as much rice.  He wasn't impressed, but I declined to taste it to compare.  He also ordered a margarita which had this tiny bit of salt on the rim, and he said it very sweet, but it didn't seem to have a noticeable amount of tequila in it.\nCompared to the time I dined at the old location, this is a very poor showing, and I will not be returning to give them a second chance, since the staff seemed marginally friendly, but indifferent at best.", "business_id": "1ZMcQNF-hHL0nJSnh5_a4w", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-01-20", "type": "review"}

Despite the fact that we were still poring over the menu he came again three more times before we'd finally set our menus aside.  Mind, the place was almost entirely empty and hours before closing time.\n\nMy girlfriend ordered Quesadilla Roha with ground beef and a special sauce.  The beef was utterly dry and flavorless.  The primary taste of her meal was the burned tortilla.  Accompanying it was a salad which consisted of shredded lettuce topped with a single, thick slice of under ripe tomato (totally inedible) and their 'special red sauce' which tasted like tomato paste with a bit of red pepper.\n\nI ordered the Burrito Loco which came with rice.  It came with enough rice for three meals and a burrito the size of my head.  The chicken inside was largely flavorless and there were some sizable bits of gristle inside.  The enormous quantity of rice was entirely unadorned in a large sticky pile.\n\nI ordered a Lime Margarita.  I wasn't asked how I'd like it prepared and it came with salt, but so little salt that there was barely a trace of it on one edge.  It was also very sweet, and I'm not sure whether there was any actual Tequila in it.\n\nWe shared a 'bean dip' which was sized for a party of eight, and was almost entirely cheese sauce with few discernible beans in it.\n\nAdding to the failure was that the food came out less than ten minutes after being ordered, which really highlights the fact that the food was almost certainly not cooked so much as reheated.  I would urge them to go INTO fast food if that's what they want to serve, but their beef compared unfavorably to Taco Bell and their Burrito was vastly less appetizing than any I've ever had at Chipotle, so I'm not sure there's room for them there either.", "business_id": "1ZMcQNF-hHL0nJSnh5_a4w", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-01-20", "type": "review"}

This is by far a significant drop from Maize which is just around the corner. Based on the reviews I was excited to try this as an alternative because there was actually seats and I could eat the food fresh from the kitchen. When you walk in you will notice that this place is sort of a hole in the wall place. I had to even ask if they accepted credit cards, yes they do! Everything in the restaurant was sticky from the menu to table to the floor. Usually that may mean good traditional food. Unfortunately this was not the case. I ordered a carne asada and enjoyed my mexican coke eating complimentary chips with salsa. The chips are straight from a bag and the salsa was quite bland. I was hungry so I enjoyed my chips still and ate the whole basket. When my carne asada came it was not what I expected. The meat was hidden in a pile of chopped up onion, peppers, and large chunks of green onion stems. Why would you put giant pieces of green onion in with the carne asada. These were not pleasant and bitter tasting. The carne asada is usually very tender the way it was prepared. This was again not the case. Very thinly sliced meat that was very chewy. The problem is that it was thinly sliced so it was quite over cooked. The refried beans was a soupy mess, but the mexican rice was passable. All and all this does not come even close to maize in the term of quality and flavor. Did I mention that there was so much oil in the dish... Finally when I paid I did not get an itemized receipt but as I saw him adding the price of the entree I believe I was overcharged as the menu list 8.99 for the carne asada, but I was charged 9.50. Seriously...\n\nPro: None....\n\nCons: The restaurant is not clean, the quality of the meat is poor, bland salsa, very greasy carne asada\n\nHidden gem:\n1 dollar tacos on Wednesday", "business_id": "cT9uP_Lr5bz6jhIqZPlLcw", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-12-17", "type": "review"}

I have to say that I land firmly on the Chevys side, because I am never -- never -- disappointed with what I get here.\n\nAll the way through, Chevys is a delicious meal.  Frankly, I'm frequently too full to do anything more than nibble on my entree, because the chips and salsa are to die for -- I've never had anything quite like it.  The salsa is absolutely delicious, tastes like there's a little bit extra black pepper in it.\n\nThe entrees are great.  I usually get a pick-4 or pick-5 combo -- leaves me with leftovers so I can have lunch the next day.  Anything's good, but in particular, I want to recommend the flautas.  They're not traditional (when eaten with the sauce they come with, the term \"Mexican egg roll\" comes to mind), but they are, I think, the tastiest item on the menu.\n\nAlso, make sure you get the yellow corn stuff.  I'm not sure what it's called, but when eaten at the end of your meal, it's unbeatable.\n\nThe only downside I see to Chevys is that I think it's a bit overpriced.  I'm from Chicago, where Mexican food is cheap, and even though this isn't quite the same thing as the Burrito house, I find it odd to be paying as much as I do for this kind of food.  It's not a budget-buster or anything -- food+tax+tip usually comes out to about $17-18 for me -- but it's a bit pricier than most college town fare.\n\nBut, it's delicious.", "business_id": "WgmAx4SWy-71daxakDNd1g", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-02-20", "type": "review"}

The chicken was very moist! The asparagus wasn't too good, as it was chewy. However, the southwest rice pilaf was so creamy and had a smoky flavor. I also loved the extra touch of the tortilla chips on top of the dish. Lovely presentation!\n\nMy mom had the Chicken Penne Pasta with the cilantro pesto. The chicken was moist, and the pesto had a deep cilantro flavor. If you hate cilantro, stay away from this dish!! There was a tad bit too much olive oil, but the strong cilantro flavor was awesome!\n\nIt was a pleasant surprise to receive a frozen white chocolate tamale. YUMMY!

I don't know if they've changed management or service since they changed their name to Canyon Cafe but the service here frustrated me so badly I had to give it 2 stars for \"I've experienced better.\"  The wait for food is rather long most times of the day, which, at lunch time especially, can suffice as a reason NOT to go here. You definitely won't make it back to work within an hour.  \n\nBut here's the main reason I started boycotting Sam's. I went here with a friend who is allergic to cilantro once. She tried ordering 4 different things that presumably wouldn't have cilantro on them and each time she selected something the waiter just said \"That has cilantro too.\" How about helping to identify some items WITHOUT cilantro, Mr. Waiter?! When she had finally just decided NOT to eat at all, I asked the waiter if he could go ask the cook if he could make anything without cilantro so my friend could eat.  Rather than doing that, he said, \"well, I know all the ingredients in everything so that won't help.\" Nice. Finally I asked the waiter if the chef could make a quesadilla (tortillas & cheese!!!!!!) without cilantro and he STILL said no.  Do you know why? Because it's served with pico de gallo on top. HELLO?!?! just leave it off....idiot. It was really a terrible experience. Usually restaurants at least ATTEMPT to accommodate food allergies. NOT this one. \n\nTHEN, to cap it all off, I asked for parking validation for the garage when we were ready to go. All restaurants at the Arizona Center give validation for parking because why would you pay an additional $5-$10 just to eat at so-so restaurants?  The hostess responded with a simple, \"Sorry - we're out\". I had no patience left after the no-cilantro fiasco so I inquired further and finally a manager came out and said, \"Oh - no parking? - I'll go get more validations from our sister restaurant around the corner.\" He was back in 1 minute. How difficult was that? The lack of problem-solving skills among the staff here really astounded me, and for this reason, despite the fact that this place is super convenient to my job and home, I haven't been back since.", "business_id": "e5kc0CQ4R-PCCDgb274gSg", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-02-15", "type": "review"}

Waters all around and then drinks were ordered. A had a beer so there's not much to report there. M choice a Mai-Tai and it was VERY strong.

The carnitas were a little dry but the plate arranged beautifully. Canyon serves an odd chips & salsa combo too - puffy fried flour tortillas (my guess on the flour) and then sprinkled with a sweet, BBQ flavoring. Interesting.

I want this place to succeed, I really do, but based upon a couple of my experiences here it seems they themselves do not want to succeed.\n\nCanyon Cafe has a really nice location in downtown Phoenix at the Arizona Center. One of its main selling points is the huge shaded patio overlooking the Arizona Center courtyard with tall palm trees and soothing waterfalls. They have some of the best margaritas I've ever tasted. The food is mediocre.\n\nMy first three times here last winter were great. Canyon Cafe was one of my first restaurant experiences in Phoenix, as I had just accepted my first big boy job and had relocated from Pennsylvania. I was in love with the new climate and the countless varieties of margaritas. The food was so-so, but the atmosphere and service received were wonderful. My server was the older lady with shorter gray hair--perfect! \n\nMy fourth time was on a Friday night, and we arrived to a surprisingly empty restaurant around 8:30 for dinner. The chile-rubbed sirloin left a lot to be desired, but the Orange Beso margaritas were its saving grace. I really love these margaritas, and I highly recommend this place for margaritas, and margaritas only, but only if you want to stop drinking them by 10pm on a Friday night. I didn't know they closed at 10pm on a Friday night until the server presented me the check at 10pm saying that they close at 10pm on Friday nights. Seriously? I'm not one to consciously stay past closing time, but giving one of your few remaining repeat customers the proverbial 'foot in the ass' is probably a big reason as to why you have no one in your restaurant on a Friday night. That, and you don't have a HH to lure customers in earlier in the evening. Get with the program.\n\nIn the spirit of redemption, I came here solo for a late lunch yesterday. The place was nearly empty, but that's to be expected at 4pm on a weekday. I picked a nice patio table overlooking the courtyard on an absolutely beautiful 80 degree day. I sipped on my Blue Moon margarita, wayfarers on, giving thanks I wasn't in the torrent of shit that was unloading on the east coast. I ordered the Salmon Caesar Salad and went back to sipping and basking. Five minutes later my waitress returns asking me what I ordered. Sip.\n\nThis particular Caesar salad has apple and pear slices in it, which sounded deliciously refreshing. I was let down when the bowl arrived and the pieces were about the width of a toothpick. The salad and dressing were great, but the salmon tasted too fishy, leading me to believe it was old. \n\nI'm about halfway finished with my margarita when my server drops the check, not even asking me if i'd like another margarita. There are literally three tables in the entire restaurant and I feel like I'm being rushed out again. I don't touch the check, but proceed to sip, people watch, and check my phone to see how the market did. Ten minutes later she opens the check presenter that's on my table,\n\n\"Oh, you're not finished?\"\n    No.\n\"Just enjoying the weather?\"\n    ..........\n\nI think I'm finished now. I'm finished with this restaurant. This place is a headache. Also check out their website. It looks like something I could have created using Visual Basic in high school. This place reeks of complacency. 2 stars only because of the margaritas.", "business_id": "e5kc0CQ4R-PCCDgb274gSg", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-02-19", "type": "review"}

We were quite a diverse crowd with different backgrounds and tastes so it was quite impressive to hear overall satisfaction. \n\nA couple logistical things that were annoying was that there was some miscommunication between the kitchen and wait staff so quite a few of our guests who ordered steaks had to wait quite a while until they finally came out.

I was just getting mine to go luckily.  I didn't hear anyone quoted more than a 10-15 min wait - and some of those were crowds of 8-10.  Walking through the restaurant - it's huge!

There was this guy in a cowboy hat, plaid shirt w/ jeans tucked into his cowboy boots standing right next to a guy in a full suit w/ a snazzy tie and shiny shoes.  It was really a great snapshot of Downtown/Southern Phoenix.  So yea, there were like 2 white groups.  But the rest of this place was a somewhere in the brown scale.  Black, Hispanic and mixed folks all hanging out waiting for the food.  To me, this is a good sign.  \n\nThe Chicken Chimi was absolutely amazing.  Some of the most flavorful chicken pieces with lots of red & green pepper and onions.

This is a very thin category, in fact it's the only one. The Veracruz style snapper is single-handedly responsible for keeping me from moving to another city. The shrimp tacos certainly pitch in on this retention campaign as well. Let's go back to the snapper for a moment, shall we? This dish serves an ample portion of fresh snapper  in a near stew-like combination of jalapenos, onions, bay leaves and a rich tomato sauce. If that's not enough, you have the option to add shrimp. \n\nIf I'm not feeling like eating off the coast, the chicken mole is sure to get my vote. The mole here is so good that I get a little insulted when I see it on menus elsewhere. The chicken is pulled from the bone and seems stewed as it's very tender and juicy. \n\nService is always quick and friendly here.

They also have a menu full of the fish and mariscos that anglos tend not to order in typical Gringo-Mex outlets. They also don't drown their entrees under an avalanche of yellow cheddar cheese.\n\nBut as an experience I would say even if it does offer a greater selection of authentic menu items, it's not really that much more satisfying than the other places. \n\nI had the carne asada tacos, which were serviceable if not thrilling. The dish came out warm and didn't have the tell-tale signs of having sat under the salamander for longer than it should. At one time these tacos would have been a revelation to anyone weaned on the Lawry's hard-shell ones. Now, with their soft, grilled dual corn tortilla goodness wrapping them, they resemble any number of other \"street tacos\" that have become more and more popular recently.\n\nThe atmosphere is . . . well. . . \"comedor\" means \"dining room\" in Spanish. That's what it is: A big room full of tables. Mariachis were a nice touch.\n\nWe waited 30 minutes at lunchtime on a Saturday to get a table. Maybe that's why I am less than thrilled.

I wish the lightrail went to your doorstep so I could visit you more often!! This is my vote for best Mexican food in the city. Just north of the Salt River on Central Avenue, in what looks like a failing industrial part of the city just seconds south of Downtown Phoenix is this amazing, beautiful gem of a mexican restaurant. \n\nWith a large parking lot that is oftentimes full to the max, it can be a bit of a wait during peak eating hours.

Everyone is bright and happy and the drinks are flowing (yes at 2PM, don't judge me!) and the salsa is SCORCHING hot! and the chips are yummy and the Beans N Chorizo Dip is incredible! If the salsa is too hot, ask for the mild and/or sour cream. The mild has no heat at all but is still flavorful and you can add as much of the hotter sauce to match your taste. It's delish. I like to order the plate that comes with green chilie relleno and a beef taco w/rice & Beans. My fave! \n\nThis is a good place for large parties, as most tables can accommodate 6 people. and some tables in the back can host even more than that.

For breakfast, I recommend the chilaquiles, and machaca\n Lunch and dinner I like to eat the shredded beef tacos, shrimp soup, green Chile chicken enchiladas etc. Everything is really delicious.", "business_id": "BESmH-lmMm34_EefL8X9fQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-12-01", "type": "review"}

You can get a burrito, get your taxes done, cash a check, grab a bagel and an espresso before grocery shopping. Neat! \n\nChico's food has always been hit or miss with me. The fresh salsa bar is the stand-out feature, with salsas in varying degrees of intensity (I tend to go for the pico de gallo as, I am sure my friends will attest to, I am a wuss). Menu items include the standard tacos, burritos, chimichangas, quesadillas and nachos. There is also your choice of soda, beer, iced tea and margaritas.\n\nI think I had just missed the lunch rush as it was still fairly busy when I went in. The food was prepared quickly, which was good as I was on my way to work and in a time crunch. The chicken chimichanga I ordered was fairly tasty, but a bit on the bland side. The only thing wrapped up in the tortilla (which was swimming in grease inside my to-go container) was cheese and grilled chicken. The side of sour cream helped and the addition of pico de gallo made it much better.\n\nChico's works well as a lunch spot during the work week because of its central location.

Menudo at this restaurant, is served all through the week, though typically at other Mexican food restaurants, it is served primarily on Saturday and Sunday...Not sure why?\nThe seating can hold large parties of up to thirty or more or a comfy couple....The setting is strangely old, and on Sundays there is a Mariachi band that comes around and woos you to another time and space in Mexicana Latin Style and flair!\nParking is a pain, so be ready to walk a distance from the parking garage.

They were neighboring, competitor businesses owned by branches of the same family.  They had separate entrances but you could go from one to another through a doorway toward the back.\n\nAlas, the Matador family-branch took the buyout money and rebuilt across the street from the also-rebuilt  Adams Hotel downtown.  It fancied up, raised the prices, and went all to hell.  The decor is nice and the music soundtrack is excellent. \n\nI only go there anymore on Sundays, from 10am to 1pm, for the free mariachi show.  It is a very good group, Mariachi Tierra del Sol, of seven or eight musicians (hence the extra star).  I get the overpriced, blah breakfast just to enjoy the tunes.  I must say that they serve a pretty good cocido, only on Sundays, that is not on the menu...ask for it.\n\nIf it were not for the, downtown-captive businessmen and conventioneers, this place would have closed long ago.  The mariachi bring in a crowd on Sundays, after church, especially around Mexican national holidays.  It is probably a nice place for drinking, the bar is quite attractive.  \n\nMaybe they have to keep prices up to stay open in the iffy downtown market and \"americanize\" the mexican food for the damyankee business visitors, transplants and snowbirds.   \n\nI suppose the Nogales Restaurant branch of the family just took the money and retired.\n\nWith the economy crash and the impact of SB1070 this is one of only three places left in the Valley with a regularly scheduled mariachi show.

After hearing the praises sung about this place, I was ready to have \"real\" Mexican food (by my coworkers' definitions). \n\nThe location is small and not particularly tidy, but was seemed to be pretty legitimate, and we were happy to take the trip over.We started out with chips and salsa, red and green. The green was HOT, while the red was more mild, but they were both very flavorful. Our group of about 12 people was waited on by one woman, who did her best, but definitely could have used some help on a party that large.\n\nWe started with cheese crisp, which was new to me, and delicious! The cheese was hot and evenly melted, with a rich, buttery flavor. I added a little red salsa to give it a kick, and really enjoyed it!\n\nWe waited a LONG time to get our entrees (I would guess 45 minutes from the time the crisp was delivered), and I was accidentally given the wrong entree. I'd ordered a chicken burro, enchilada style, with rice, and received my boss' order of the same thing, but with beef. After cutting into it, I passed it to him and let the waitress know what I had ordered and that I hadn't received my food. 10 minutes later, she returned to our table with another burro (the one pictured) that was okay, but tasted a bit off... after examining it, I realized that it was pork... which I don't really care for. Not wanting to slow down an already-long lunch, I decided to just go ahead and eat the second burro, despite my not really caring for the meat. \n\nAll in all, I might be willing to give it another try, but the wait and receiving the wrong food twice were fairly off-putting. It would likely have been a better experience, had our table had an extra waitress, as my drink also sat empty for about a quarter of the meal with no server in sight.

However today was the last time we will be giving Rosita's our business.\n\nOne major complaint - EVERYTIME we order they give us the standard \"20 min\" pick up time, yet EVERYTIME we go to pick it up they scramble to find our order,which they most of the time, forget to give to the kitchen then we have to wait another 15-20mins. Annoying. But what's even worse is out of a dozen orders they've only ever gotten two right. They either forget something or give us the wrong thing. \n\nWe usually are annoyed but will go back after a couple weeks, each time convincing ourselves that is just a fluke. But I'm sorry, this isn't a small town with no other options and the food just isn't THAT good for the irritation. \n\nMaybe dine-in would be a better way to experience Rosita's.", "business_id": "hWhVP-28LYP3llaMlAJ_JA", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-12-12", "type": "review"}

Every business should be allowed an off day here and there, but 3 times in a row is way too many!\n\nThe first time, it took forever for the waitress to come over once we were seated. After what seemed like forever we finally got some chips and salsa and then the waitress finally appeared. My son's order came out way before mine, so far in advance that he was done eating when mine arrived. Once I finally got my enchilada and beans, the beans were cold and the cheese was not even melted in the enchilada and I had to send it back! Again, can't find the waitress and getting front of house is almost impossible! Finally the food was sent back, by the time it came back again, my son really wanted to go home, and quite frankly so did I! \n\nMy dad said to give them another try.... I did. \n\nThe second time my daughter really wanted to go for her birthday. Once seated, it took forever to get service. Finally someone brought salsa and chips, then a huge long wait for the waitress to come to the table. When the waitress finally came, our order was taken and it took over 20 minutes to get our drinks! When the food finally came out, the beef in the chimichangas was tough, I had to ask for the side of sour cream and guacamole over 3 times before it was brought out, the guacamole had zero flavor, worst meal ever! We needed refills on the drinks and chips, again good luck getting service from your waitress or the front of house. I asked 3 different people for boxes to go, that took over 15 minutes to get! Took another 15 minutes after that just to get the bill! When I got home, I fed the leftovers to the chickens! \n\nAfter this, I was never going back! \n\nDad just drove in from CA and the first place he wanted to go was here... I told him it would be a mistake... it was!\n\nAgain, hard to get service. There are about 10 tables and 4 waitresses! We placed our order, waited so long for our drinks that the basket of chips was almost gone before they arrived. Dad had the chile rellenos with a side of beans w/enchilada sauce and corn tortillas, I had a cheese enchilada w/beans and a side of sour cream. The chile rellenos were a mish mash of peppers and no cheese in sight, they did not put the enchilada sauce on the plate, forgot the sour cream, the beans were horribly over salted and did not bring the corn tortillas until the meal was almost done. Tried to get someones attention, anyone's attention to get a to go box! We left w/o the box. \n\nThis was a different waitress each time I went. I am so disappointed that customer service from the waitresses and front of house is non existent, so not customer friendly anymore! The food is also not what it use to be either! \n\nDad said I was right! We will never be going back!", "business_id": "hWhVP-28LYP3llaMlAJ_JA", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-12-20", "type": "review"}

The best part about it was the freshness and cleanliness of the dish. However, the serving was barely enough. Other menudo specialty restaurants serve a bottomless bowl for 50 cents less and it's usually as good or better tasting..\nThe service at Rosita's is the worst. When we arrived it took a few minutes for the waitress to arrive. She brought 2 forks, 1 knife and chips and salsa. No water.  She left and returned about 7 minutes later with pad and pen in hand. She asked us what we wanted to drink and my daughter ordered a soft drink and I ordered a Chelada.  I also asked for waters.  She asked my daughter what she wanted to order. My daughter asked me if we are ready and the waitress told my daughter \"You order now.\"  We ordered.  Several minutes later we got our drinks and 1 glass of water.  The Chelada tasted more like a Bloody Mary and I only drank 1/2.  \nThe food arrived and our order was right. My daughter had a beef Chimichanga with rice and beans. Over priced at $12 but the flavors were outstanding. Especially the beans and rice.  As mentioned earlier, the Menudo was fantastic but the portion left me wanting more.\nAs we were eating I called across the room for an order of Pozole to go.  My waitress replied from across the room \"Let me check.\"  She did not ask me if I wanted red or white, beef or pork, and flour or corn tortillas.  Yet when she brought me the to go bag I asked if it was red and if she included flour tortilla.  She replied they only sell red and she put flour tortilla as I had requested. Again I hadn't been offered a choice.  When my wife ate the Pozole she discovered the tortillas were corn. Also, the Pozole had only 2 pieces of meat and the hominy was hard.\nFinally, the check was scibbled and illegible. I was charged $40.65 for 2 bowls of basically soup,  a fried burrito with beans and rice, and a beer and soda.\nI wouldn't mind paying $40 if the Pozole had been as good as the Menudo.  They'd have a better chance of my return business or recommendation to others if portions were larger. I had a difficult time tipping as much as 10% for the horrible service that came with bottomless bowl of attitude.", "business_id": "hWhVP-28LYP3llaMlAJ_JA", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-12-22", "type": "review"}

Given that Yelp never fails, the deceptively named La Tolteca Mexican Foods was presented before us as an attractive option. Hesitant as to whether it was actually just a Mexican grocery store, we hustled in to see what the buzz was about. Now, I know I live in the Northeast (veritable Mexican food desert), but \"Oh. My. Gahhhhhhhhhhhhh...\" This place is amazing. \n\nOne of the most appealing things to me about La Tolteca was its no-nonsense approach to everything. Food is ordered from a board menu above a counter and prepared in a small kitchen area in front of you. Slightly further back lies the grocery store component which does have an interesting (Maybe typical for Phoenix, but what do I know?) variety of Mexican groceries and specialties to recommend it. Back to the food though... that really was the main event. I ordered a chicken burrito which came out quickly and was f---ing enormous. Imagine the beams of light shining down from above when I turned around a spotted the salsa bar! I was able to taste all of their salsas including the piquant green chili pepper one which I am still thinking about. There's a vast dining area to the back where you can bring your food and beverage to gorge and take in this amazing experience. Maybe I just love Mexican food too much... Who knows, but I was really a happy camper here. \n\nWe looked over and spotted some people eating burritos that were literally the size of loaves of Wonder Bread, so consider that as one more reason to go (though even I, self-proclaimed food eater extraordinaire could not fathom eating one of those).

On Google it's rated 5 stars.  Here it's 4 stars.  And only a single dollar sign!  So we drove over.\n\nThe place looks like something you might find in Mexico.  No hostess.  Walk up to the counter, order your food, wait for your number to be called, walk into the dining area (ducking under a low arch if you over 6' tall) where you are greeted with basic tables and chairs.  Seriously...if you didn't know you were in Phoenix you'd swear you were in an eatery in Mexico.  They also have a bakery and a market attached to the food counter.\n\nOn to the actual food.  As this was my first time here I ordered the chimi.  I usually do that so I have a basis for comparison to other places.  My wife had the albondigas soup.  We both liked our dishes.  The chimi was done perfectly.  A light crunch of the shell.  Not overcooked, not greasy.  The chicken was moist and tender.  And it was a pretty big chimi.  I think one does need to add some pico to it because the chicken's seasoning was very mild.  The pico added just a bit of flavor that really made the difference.  And the Mexican rice was very nice.\n\nI wish it wasn't so far from home (Gilbert) because I'd love to make this my \"regular\" spot for Mexican food.

That is not my review, but rather what is written on the side of the Ranch Market building. After reading other reviews of this place, I already had a feeling it was going to be good...but the Paradise Market...hmmm... Made me ask myself what my idea of a paradise market would be. ( In case you were wondering, it would include Gael Garcia Bernal, Alejandro Fernandez, Juanes and other latinos guapos pushing shopping carts... shirtless.)\n\nAnyway...focus!...Walking in from the parking lot, I could already hear lively music spilling out of the store. My blood started to sizzle with excitement. Then, right after crossing the threshold, I beheld a thing of dazzling beauty- carts and carts of aromatic and fresh pan dulce. I knew this place and I were just beginning a long and promising relationship. \n\nMy roommate and I wandered around the pan dulce display cases, salivating, pointing, giggling. We opted not to purchase as we have way too many holiday sweets left over as it is. We continued on to the jugeria where I had the best horchata I have had in a long, long time. Too much of the time horchata is watery. The Ranch Market horchata was so flavorful and creamy. I drank it just like a little kid who doesn't even let the straw leave their mouth for a moment. \n\nWe then wandered throughout the whole store. I know I probably looked awe-struck because it is overwhelming. It is bustling and frenetic and packed full of food treats, smells, conversation...LIFE. Be sure to pass by the tortilleria and take in the smell of freshly cooked tortillas. Also, don't miss the meats! Chicken feet! Tongue!  Tripas! Oh yeah! AWESOME! \n\nWho the hell would ever want to go to a Safeway again when shopping can be this entertaining?\n\nI'll be sure to go back soon for some pan dulce, a raspado or some lunch. More than anything, I'll go back for the experience because that's what this place is- a cultural experience.", "business_id": "VXIkI9_EbDbYHeO9IzKjJg", "stars": 5, "date": "2007-01-02", "type": "review"}

Forget the upscale breakfast and faux southwest shops that dot and line Scottsdale. Forget the 'burbs of Peoria, Goodyear, and East Mesa. Don't let your visiting family leave without making a trip down to the Phoenix Ranch Market on 16th st and Roosevelt. Yes, this is south of the I-10 freeway and far away from your faux mexican food at Macayo's Cantina. At Phoenix Ranch Market you'll find a side of the city that nearly all of the transplanted surburban population seems to want to ignore, or just completely forget. This is Phoenix being Phoenix, not Phoenix trying to be a new Los Angeles or anyplace else.\n\nAfter having breakfast at a carbon copy brunch eggery, I was in need of something less perfect and faux. I found exactly what I was craving. When you can hear the sounds of mariachi or radio campesina from your car parked at the other end of a packed lot, you know this isn't the local Kroger you're about to enter.\n\nPart grocery store, part food court, part village market, PRM is huge, it's overwhelming and it's surprisingly clean and comfortable - this isn't a low rent grocery like Food City. With a fresh seafood section two or three times the size you'd find anywhere else in Phoenix, and with parts of animals you've probably never prepared at home, it's fun to just look, but even more fun to buy. Want meat? Want better options? Better cuts? Want an entire skinned cow's head with the eyes intact and staring at you? Check. It's all SO GOOD.\n\nBut that's just the meats. They make their own tortillas onsite with a literal factory and small army of workers churning out the flat corn and flour awesomeness. Hungry? Want mexican food? Want great mexican food? ALWAYS consider going here. Think of anything on a restaurant menu and you have it here. Prepared fresh, and a la carte. Seriously. Tamales of any kind. Horchata! Cow Tongue! Burritos of immense size and stuffed with anything you want. Some of the best beans in town, rice, and parts from a pig that still actually look like parts from a pig. This isn't the mall food court.\n\nThe place is packed with mostly hispanic families but you'll also notice a few adventurous types, including my asian self. Most of the employees speak english very well so language is not a barrier. The only times you'll need help is when asking what is that? And like mentioned above, the answer just might be cow tongue (which by the way, is good, however I can see how the texture would turn some people off. Imagine a soft almost too mushy beef...)\n\nOh. The food is also cheap. You'll get more than full off of $5, you'll explode at $10. It's seriously like heaven here. Music, people, atmosphere, food, drinks, desserts, baked goods. All of it awesome. I met up with my friend Amy.The.Kidd for 'lunch' and we ended up spending almost 4 hours just walking around, back and forth, trying each new item we found, or trying the standards but knowing they were going to be better here. Mmmm. Horchata, great corn tamales, rice, beans, empanadas, warm fresh tortillas... bring everyone. This is a place that should be in people's minds when they think of Phoenix, not just the golf courses, or upscale Scottsdale, or Frat/Sorority Tempe... but South Phoenix. No matter how scary it is for suburban soccer moms to venture down there.\n\nPhoenix Ranch Market on 16th St and Roosevelt.

I experienced Ranch Market for the first time last summer. I'm not familiar with the holiday, but it's the one where they bake tons of cakes with little babies in them..? Someone help me here. Back to the point, it was EXTREMELY festive, and I don't know if it was the heat, or that I was tired, or that the place was just so decked out in colors and people and decorations, but I got sick. Sick to where I had to wait outside by the car for my company. Hilarious. Needless to say I was a little frightened, so it took a little while for the curiosity to pique again. \n\nSecond time was yesterday evening. Perhaps it was because instead of being a busy Saturday it was a slower (still busy, though) Tuesday that I was able to survive this visit. The boy decided to use it for a school project so I tagged along to see if I could help. The second we walked in the door however, all hope in my helping him was lost. My mind was in a frenzy as I decided where to stop first. The Jugeria for some Horchata? Or the restaurant for some asada? Or maybe the bakery for something sweet...? \n\nFound out the Horchata is way too sweet (but delicious) to drink alone so I shared with the boy. Grabbed some kind of sweet roll from the bakery that we practically fought over...and oh my! It was Taco Tuesday at the restaurant! I ordered 4 asada tacos for $2.99 and thanked the lord my boy is a vegetarian. Best carne asada ever! \n\nAnd the atmosphere in here is great. Oh! And they're open late. 6a-11p. The employees are friendly and the customers (mainly families) are just so full of life and happiness (or maybe it was the Spanish music blaring on the loudspeaker?). All in all, this is a new fave.

Today I finally made the trip inside the store, rather than just going to the restaurant on the side. It was too early for lunch at Tradiciones so in I went. I knew that the market had a lot going on at all times; I nearly run down at least 6 people getting in and out of the parking lot and I'm a really good driver (seriously-not Raymond from Rain Man good, but actually good!). The parking lot on the store side is always packed.\n\nSo the focus of my trip was the cucina. It was bustling for lunch already at just 10:30. So as I'm trying to make sense of the menus posted in both Spanish and English on the wall above the hot food line or whatever, I am greeted by a nice woman that helps me decide where to go. She mentioned sopes first, so that's what I started with.\n\nMy order was way too much food for one, but I wanted to try a couple of things. So I got both a chicken and a steak sopa, a street taco al pastor (pork), and a side of beans. They did have combos unlike another reviewer said but I only wanted to add beans an opted for a side instead. My total for food was $11.00. Not super cheap, but like I said more food than I would normally order at once.  \n\nSo a sope for those unfamilar is not a torta as someone else said. It's more like a weird tostada or open faced sandwich. The base is somewhere between a corn tortilla and an all out bread. It does appear to be flash fried to cook but I'm not totally sure and it didn't feel greasy. The sides are curved to make a small cup to fill with beans, meat of choice, topped with shredded lettuce, grated cojita cheese (I'd describe Mexican parm--hard salty and good!!) The chicken and steak were both tasty. The steak was a little strung together if you will. I'd rather have seen it be chopped better so I would be easier to eat smaller bites. If your teeth didn't make it through that bite, a big chunk was coming along with it. Sorta messy but good though I felt like my sopa was a bit tougher than it should be and my extra cheap plastic fork would bend to the will of the sope.\n\nThe street taco was just so I could taste the al pastor. Two tiny corn tortillas topped with a bit of pork. I topped it with onions and cilantro and would totally eat the al pastor in another dish. \n\nBeans. Not a really a fan. They lacked the taste of say Carolina's beans though the texture matched. A disappointment. \n\nSalsa bar was good. Hot green and red, and the pico was spicy too. Fresh onions and chopped cilantro are a must so it was good to have those. \n\nAgua Fresca...Just love it. I had the fresh guava juice. So tasty and well worth the additional $2.91 I spent for the 32oz drink. \n\nTotal food and drink, $13.91. A little spendy for lunch served in stryo while seated on a bench, but it was fun and I will order a little differently next time so it won't be as expensive and I won't order more food than I can eat.\n\nMarket, looks good. Great looking bakery (really), meat counter, tortilla factory, etc. I'll probably not go out of my way to get there for things I can buy at Food City on a regular day. This does look like a fun way to go get some lunch before you shop for dinner on a weekend. I'll definitely take others for hot food and a fun people watching experience, plus pick up a few goods on the way. \n\nI don't really know about authentic. It's probably not. I don't really care. My dad's family is from near the Mexican border and though I've been to mercados in Mexico and even here, I liked that this place is busy and clean. Campy, sure.

The atmosphere is great, the produce prices are very reasonable, and the civiche is excellent! I never go down the center isles, as they appear to be filled with typical grocery store packaged foods  What makes Ranch Market special are the fantastic offerings all around the center isles.  \n\nHere is my advice:  First, make your way to the fresca bar to get a fresh fruit drink, it's just past the bakery at the front door.  After you pick up your favorite fruit drink head over to the grill for some carne asada street tacos, but only order two because you'll want to save room for the seafood bar where you will find a deliciouso shrimp ceviche at a very reasonably price.  I usually order a half pound of the regular shrimp civiche and a half pound of the civiche ensalda; eat a little at the bar on a tostada and take the rest home for lunch the next day.  Yummy!  After you have filled your belly with the tasty carne asada and civiche, stop by the tortilla factory to get some fresh tortillas to go and don't forget to hit up the bakery for hot cream filled churro for desert.", "business_id": "VXIkI9_EbDbYHeO9IzKjJg", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-02-12", "type": "review"}

First off, I thought the service was mediocre to poor.  Not friendly, no smiles, and they never came back to the table except to take the order and deliver the food.  No water, no extra chips for the table of four, nothing.\n\nMy wife tried the Huevos Rancheros, which were okay, not terrific.  Congealed eggs versus over easy, but a big tortilla.  $6-7 bucks, so didn't break the bank.\n\nI had the two enchiladas and shredded taco plate, about $10.  Overpriced, greasy, and just not very good.  Gut bomb was more like it.\n\nMy daughter had two shredded beef tacos for $4, filling.  My son had a $4 or so bean an cheese burrito, again just okay.\n\nRe-fried beans were paste, and more lard than beans it tasted like.  Rice was good, not great.\n\nAnyway, not even in the top 1/2 of mexican restaurants I've been to.  Definitely not in the top 3-4 like many reviews seem to indicate. \n\nI live downtown, so only about 5 min from here.  I really wanted this to become my favorite new place.  \n\nBut when a place is in a just okay neighborhood, dirt driveway, and mediocre to poor interior, man, their food and service needs to shine.\n\nAnd they just don't.\n\nI won't be back.  \n\nBy the way, If anyone wants to know my favorite Mexican owned and operated, not ritzy but excellent food place in Phoenix, head to Las Glorias south of Northern on 19th Avenue.

I've heard some folks pan on other boards but I just flat out don't get it. For people visiting AZ, this is a must go imo. My relatives visiting from Australia requested it as their last meal on their way out of town.\n\nFirst of all, I'm not a big green chili fan. Second of all, Rito's green chile burro is one of my top 3 bites in all of AZ.\n\nTortillas are amazing (homemade), beans are amazing (I guess I'm still a big fan of lard). Unbelievably, beans seem to get even better when you microwave them from the fridge the next day too.\n\nI love the character of the place. It's run by a mother, her daughters & some other relatives. They do what they do & are who they are & don't really care beyond that. I've heard it compared to the Soup Nazi from the Seinfeld episode. My first visit, I did get that vibe but the ladies have been super sweet many, many times. It is a bit tough to find, they have short hours, they only take cash and as the sign says, do NOT approach the window on your cell phone.  \n\nI think at present they quit making tacos because they were too much work & the mom has had some health issues. So basically you get what you get. I say get the green chile burro.\n\nSo they are who they are & do what they do, take it or leave it. I love it.\n\nAs far as the shop, it's basically just a barred window counter you order from, you pick up your food & go outside & eat on picnic-like tables. \n\nThey are open only M-F from 9 - 5ish. Close even a bit earlier on Fridays I think. \n\nThey're on 14th street just south of Roosevelt right across from the school. You'll just see a screen door & that's it. If it's around lunch time, you'll probably see a line as well.\n\nI think the short hours & no evenings, no weekends even add to the obsession for me. Scarcity makes it even more desired.\n\nRight now, I cannot believe how much I'm craving this food.\n\nBTW, the warning about scalding food & soupy burrito are right on.

Maybe it was the fact there were no other white people nearby, and I was in the middle of a residental neighborhood, which made me feel as though I had walked into some gang's territory. \n\nI was still able to eat my meal though. I ordered the red chimi enchilada style. OH SNAP! That was the best chimi I think I have ever had. The food here is not eally cheap perse, but it is a cheap restaurant if that says anything. I wholeheartedly felt that I would go back on a regular basis if not for two things 1) it weren't in the location it's in and 2) it weren't so high fat.\n\nAt least go try it once, and take CASH.", "business_id": "Xo9Im4LmIhQrzJcO4R3ZbA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-02-10", "type": "review"}

We were first given a bowl of chips and salsa.  The salsa looked like a mix between red and green salsa, and since I have a weird aversion to green salsa, I hesitantly tried it.  It was delicious, as were the house-made chips.  We ate two bowls immediately because we couldn't stop.\n\nAfter asking the waitress what was best, my fiance decided on the spicy marinated fish, and I on the garlic shrimp.  Holy crap, it was delicious.  The garlic sauce for my shrimp covered everything, from the beans and rice to the secret fries beneath the shrimp (which magically didn't get soggy).  My fiance said his fish was the best he's ever had in America.  Mine also came with tortillas (I chose flour), and they were great, like the kind my mom bought from the \"tortilla lady\" back home.\n\nWe were so full we couldn't move afterward, but I woke up in the morning craving the garlic sauce again...\n\nThe place is small and quaintly decorated, like something you might find in a small town.  We saw lots of families and tables of friends come and go.  The best part is, you don't have to sit and awkwardly wait for your check.

What a find! It's located not far from the airport so that is really convenient. It's small and parking is limited, but it was raining (!) and so we were able to grab the last parking spot. \n\nOur food was nothing short of stupendous. They start you out with free ceviche on a mini tostado, and it is delicious. I got the enchilada jaiba (with crab) and it was really good, with red chile sauce. The wife got the camaron (shrimp) culichi with green chile sauce. We each ate about half of our meal and then traded because I love green chile and she loves red chile. I must say, I got the better of the trade! The green chile sauce was nothing short of orgasmic; just fantastically deliciously awe-inspiringly good. I could eat that sauce on a shoe and be happy. The rice and beans were also excellent, way above the typical non-descript flavor, and each meal also came with a salad! What a deal. We were so happy that Yelpers turned us on to this place.

El Nopalito fits the bill perfectly.  This place first popped up on my radar after seeing frequent mentions on Chowhound.  It was right in my neighborhood, but I never got around to trying it until last week. \n\nWe showed up on a Friday night starving and exhausted from teaching small children and, sadly, laying off employees.  Ick.  We started with two Cokes and some homemade chips with both a green and red salsa.  Both salsas were outstanding, which in my experience is rare.  Generally if you get two salsas on the table, one is terrible and one is at least decent.  And Mexican cokes in the cool bottles?  Yay!  Then we ordered a bowl of tortilla soup to share.  This was flavorful and the tortilla strips were nice and crispy.  We only ordered one portion to share but the server brought us two full bowls and charged us for one.  Generous.  The only room for improvement was temperature.  The soup could have been hotter.  Next, we ordered green chile chicken enchiladas and...and...and I forgot the name of my entree.  It was, however, the server's recommendation and she didn't let me down.  My dish was steak with bacon, green peppers, onions and cheese melted over the top.  All of this was served over two corn tortillas.  Super good.  Everything was cooked to perfection.  The green chile chicken enchiladas were outstanding and the green chile was the best my boyfriend has ever had.  The rice was flavorful and tender and beans great as well.

It was my Aunt's birthday and she _loves_ Macayo's. I went along begrudgingly and the results were terrifying.\n\nAs a Phoenix native, I've known Macayo's on Central for decades. Its unique facade emulates the style of some grand Guatemalan Mayan temple, but... no, not really. And what is it that you want when you see pictures of Machu Picchu or of Tikal? You want to climb the steps, to _go in_. In the case of Macayo's, you must resist this urge with all your might.\n\nThe main entrance is from the back and is true to form in the Egyptian style. A post and lintel rectangular opening leads to a long narrow hallway slightly sloped which opens to an antechamber branching off to the splendorous caverns within. Um. Except this article is about _food_, not a history of architecture lecture! Bleh.\n\nAs is my custom I order a cheese crisp straight off; I'm allergic to corn so the endless bowls of hardened, impervious-to-rot corn chips (see pic) just repel me. After the pushy (more on that later) waitress scurries off I notice my fork (see the picture) and realize that with the caked-on food, this place might be cutting corners on lots of stuff, namely that the tortillas might be so cheap that they are the type to be sprinkled with corn starch to keep them from sticking to each other. The waitress returns and I ask her to please check the ingredient list for the tortillas for corn starch. A few minutes later she returns with the label torn from the tortilla bag and says that without her glasses she cannot read the list. I'm not joking when I say that the list goes on as long as this paragraph. Chemical after chemical, non-food food after non-food food. And then there right in the middle is corn starch, corn meal, corn flour and corn syrup. In FLOUR tortillas! \n\nI immediately canceled my order for the cheese crisp and resolved not to place a single bite of anything into my mouth. \"Was the water bad too?\" I wondered.\n\nI'm not sure where it started, but Tex-Mex goers have come to expect the attentive busboys to continually flit about filling and refilling bowls of corn chips and salsa. Macayo's sets the standard. It seemed the bowls dropped every few seconds as my family devoured them while waiting for the birthday girl to show. The salsa was gloopy (again with the pic) and might have had something added to the mix after it was poured from a gigantic vat, but I doubt it. My sensible companion said it didn't taste fresh at all.\n\nThe birthday girl was almost 45 minutes late. After 40 minutes we discussed among us just ordering anyway. We decided to order, except that our decision quickly became an argument with the waitress who insisted that we wait for her. Um, whoa! Is this really happening to me? I must be in some kind of Mayan burial temple, I'm dead, and my servants and family were buried with me along with food and I'm going to be here for the next thousand years until someone decrypts the secret book and inserts the starfish-shaped key into the stony entrance to free my evil spirit back on the world.  AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!! Yes, I loved the Mummy movies.\n\nBut back to our pushy waitress. After the family tried over and over, unsuccessfully, to cajole me into ordering something, anything, we waited for the results. You'll have to see the pictures.\n\nYou know you're in a nightmare of menu hell when an item's description has to change languages from English in order to accurately describe its content. The average speaker uses something like 20,000 words regularly and you can't even find a few to accurately or even poetically describe this item? The steak was described with being covered in a spinach queso sauce (see pic). Those two words had to have been taken straight off the labels of the two cans that were dumped into a warming pot to create this sauce. Think nacho cheesy, oil and corn starch and that lovely orangey-yellow coloring. Disgusting.\n\nMy brother ordered a taco plate (see pic) and made the mistake of trying to bite into the taco shell with his teeth. This item should have come with a disclaimer and a hammer. Envision eating crab but with the shell still on it. He gave up quickly and dug out the innards with his fork, snail style. \n\nMacayo's should stick to their success like some cornstarch-less badly made stack of tortillas, namely large-scale manufactured canned foods sold to those who still think Phoenix is a town of rolling tumbleweeds and cowboys. Let them fantasize about questing to Phoenix and entering the secret Mayan temple to discover the secrets within. They can release my tormented soul from the hell that is Macayo's.", "business_id": "jzPMl-NoB5F2fwoHX3hN8A", "stars": 1, "date": "2008-12-12", "type": "review"}

Any one of the numerous Mexican restaurants usually ending with \"o's\" is better than this place.  \n\nThe reason they have big margarita's is to distract you from the horrible food and hope after you get over your hangover the margarita is all you remember. Everything I have tasted is bland and seems like it came out of a can.  This chain helps perpetuate the stereotype of Mexican food being of low quality.  I am Mexican-American and used to changing people's mindset when I have them over for dinner.\n\nThe only nice quality of this location is the building is unique it looks like a mesoamerican  pyramid.", "business_id": "jzPMl-NoB5F2fwoHX3hN8A", "stars": 1, "date": "2008-12-29", "type": "review"}

While I wouldn't say their food is the best it is far from the worst. After reading a couple of reviews some things come to mind.\n\n1) People in Arizona don't eat \"tex-mex\", people in Texas do. So, if you're looking for that from Macayo's or most other Mexican joints in town you're not going to get it.\n\n2) To say Macayo's is like some sort of Mexican Denny's is ridiculous.\n\nNow as far as the food is concerned, I like their salsa I'm not sure why but I do. I'd describe it as a bit watery with plenty of cilantro and green chiles. Pretty good in my opinion. Other things I like are the mini-chimis which have never been frozen when I ate them. Are they great for Mexican? Not so much but they're great for eating on the cheap and getting some food in the gut.\n\nMy all-time favorite dish was the Steak Cortez, which the anti-corn guy describes as nacho cheese and spinach; that's not quite right. The Steak Cortez is really a pretty great idea, a skirt steak covered in spinach con queso (con queso being a normal term at any spanish speaking joint that is combining something with cheese) and mushrooms that I really like the taste of and then folded over and a green chile slapped in the middle. I have to say WAS though because over the years the portion has decreased and depending on how the tide goes or which way the wind is blowing it comes out of the kitchen different. If they could serve it great consistently that would be a signature dish. But like Macayo's service itself they can't.\n\nThe carnitas burritos leave something to be desired. Maybe some guacamole or sour cream which you can get if you want to pay extra but it sure seems like stuffing a boatload of carnitas into a tortilla doesn't truly constitute a burrito.\n\nThe tamales are usually pretty decent, though I can't say I've ever had the green corn, I think only the beef. My favorite part of any Mexican meal is the cheesecrisp and it's just as good here as anywhere else. There are places that are better and places that are worse. \n\nCompletely irrelevant as far as food goes but they used to have a free payphone so long as the call was less than 5 minutes and was local. I always thought that was cool but that is gone now.\n\nPros:\n\nSalsa\nSome good ideas for food when executed properly (ie steak cortez, baja sauce)\ncentral location\nthe bar is hoppin' on friday nights\ngenerally decent food but not always and not all items (pro and con)\n\nCons:\nspotty service\nhit or miss inconsistent food\nno cheese enchilada on the kids menu\nthe bar is hoppin' on friday nights which makes for crappy parking", "business_id": "jzPMl-NoB5F2fwoHX3hN8A", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-12-08", "type": "review"}

The food is good and the lunch specials are great and economical. Complimentary chips and salsa while you wait for your order is also a plus. \n\nSome folks don't like the fact that the building is an old temple themed building, but personally I like it. I like the fact that it's the original Macayo's building from the 60's, but maybe I'm more of a purist. Would I prefer for it to be torn down and have a modern establishment with touch screen ordering and wi-fi and all that other technology? No. But that's just me. \n\nThe staff is friendly and courteous, this is also a plus. It's preferable over rude or neutral tempered staff right? The waiter held a conversation with us concerning Obama's visit to Macayo's.\n\nFor the \"Mex & Match\" lunch special I ordered a cheese enchilada and chile relleno with a side of beans. The enchilada was very good and even the beans were very good, as simple as beans are. My only issue was the chile relleno. It didn't have much of a chile flavor to it, kinda bland. It tasted more like the sauce it was topped with. But don't hold this against Macayo's. These type of chile's spiciness and flavor are very random. I know this from my experience with eating them. One can be very flavorful and spicy and the next one can be bland. So, I'm not gonna hold that bland chile against Macayo's. \n\nIf your wondering about price, I spent about $11.00 for this meal including the drink. My only issue with the service was the same waiter who conversed with us about Obama's visit, asked for a tip at the begging when he introduced himself. It sounded rehearsed and something to the effect of: \"Hi my name is so-and-so, I am your waiter today, a small tip would be appreciated...etc.\" I don't like that. I was planning to leave a tip, and I'm sure most people leave one, so asking for a tip to me almost sounds like begging.

Okay so the food wasn't too bad and it's probably consistant as well.  In fact I'd give the food a 3 since I'm not too picky but the utter soullessness of this place was almost too much to bare!  Green Day was blasting in the bar area where we were seated...and to be fair, I don't mind GD but come on, in a \"Mexican\" restaurant?...and at full volume?  Maybe it was just a poor seating arrangement and it would've been better in one of the other hundred or so rooms.

We both were in search of a restaurant that was open on the later side on New Year's Day and this happened to work out for us.  The building itself is like an Aztec or Mayan pyramid and hard to miss since it kind of sticks out - but I guess you could say it adds to the character of the place.  Overall the decor is a bit dated, but clean and honestly for the type of restaurant it is, it's acceptable.\n\nWe were greeted warmly and seated right away to a booth where we both decided to indulge in their margarita special for the evening which was an upgrade from the house.  I was surprised how large they were and tasted great.  I enjoyed the fact that they didn't taste watered down at all and were a bit more on the savory side versus tasting ultra sugary.\n\nThe chips and salsa were a nice touch since many places now don't seem to offer complementary items like that anymore.  The chips were perfectly crisp, not overly salty or thick.  The salsa lacked a bit of pizazz, but tasty none the less.  He ordered the Chimichanga de Macayo and I tried the Sonoran Enchilada Sampler.  Both were delicious and well seasoned.  The chiles in the enchiladas really brought out a nice rounded flavor.  Their rice was flavorful and not overcooked which seems to be a common issue for many restaurants I have tried.  For dessert, we shared the fried ice cream with chocolate sauce; I never had it previously, but it was tasty.  The crust wasn't quite as crispy as I had anticipated, but did have a nice little crunch to it.\n\nIn general, our visit to Macayo's was a pleasant one.

Because I had never been there, I was looking over their menu. The girl however, seemed in a rush to get my order done so she could go back to talking to her co worker. As I was going through the line I was asking for recommendations on what she thought went best together but again, she seemed bother to help me and had a bad attitude. She kept making comments on the fact they didn't charge extra for guacamole and I figured it was their job to sell you on that. Also, the food behind the counter seemed like it was sitting there all day and did not look appetizing at all. There was trash on the floor of the restaurant and there was even chairs on top of the tables. For a restaurant that didn't seem busy at all I would expect cleanliness. \n\nI ended up paying $11.00 for a bowl that seemed smaller than the bowls at chipotle that I would normally spend $9.00 for even with the extra guacamole. The worst part of my experience is that both  my room mate and I ended up getting food poisoning even though we ordered two completely different things. I literally rushed home to throw up because their food was so heavy on me. I automatically knew that it was from there because I had not eaten anything all day before that. \n\nI definitely do not recommend this place at all. I am going to stick with Chipotle all the way.

I decided on 5, and I will tell you why!\n\nFOOD gets the 5 stars- a rating for \"Old School Mexican Food\"; not for Elements or Kai.  In the genre of budget-priced Mexican food, it's a 5 star.\n\nThe food is SOOOO good!  It is that old school Sonoran style type of Mexican I remember from when I was a kid in Phoenix (60's-70's).  It is simple, generous servings but not monstrously so.  \n\nThe staff are long-term, get to know you types.  They work hard, and are very easy going when it comes to just about anything; even when you pay, they'll take your group's bill and allow you to pay one at a time, so no dealing with a split check a the table.  This is good for groups going out for lunch from work.\n\nIn the early 90's there original location was on 16th St- TINY... and they were renown for their burros.  They are still a mainstay today and if you aren't certain of what to order, get a burrito.  Their tortas are also exceptional.  I am partial to the basic combo plates.\n\nThe drawbacks:  and yes, there are some-  \n\nTIME.  I would go more often, but the amount of time you will wait can be very inconsistent.  Even when we arrive early (for lunch), there can be delays.  I shouldn't be gone for more than an hour for lunch, and have been 90 minutes twice when out at Juan's.  For me, this is a problem.  And even though i really like the wait-staff, i think that there are some organizational issues that cause the hold-ups.  Maybe understaffed?  I don't know for sure, but it's worth mentioning.\n\nCHIPS.  I like the chips and hot sauce, but don't LOVE them.  They are the old school variety, which are OK but I do like me some really hot out of the fryer chips served with cold chunky salsa, and that's not what you'll get here.  You will get the smooth red hot sauce and usually tepid thicker chips. \n\nIf you  haven't tried Juan's, and you don't have an inflexible schedule, DEFINITELY give them a try.

I'd recommend this spot to anyone looking for a large, Delicious meal not looking to spend a lot of money (did I mention they were cheap?!?)", "business_id": "DeAnVirgOxQnI36V1W158A", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-12-26", "type": "review"}

(At least where I work...)\n\nWhile I can't vouch for the restaurant itself, I do know the food to-go is awesome. I got the carne asada burro which was $4.79 and worth every penny. Beware of food belly: it's all meat! (Well there's onion, cilantro, and guac in there too, but it's mostly meat) The tortillas aren't quite as good as Carolina's, but they are a little denser/stretchier which is good when you're not up for messing around with a messy burrito. The meat was flavorful, and lean! I hate when there's a bunch of fatty goobery pieces in the carne, and Juan's didn't disappoint. I only ate a little over half of the burrito because it was so big...and I needed room for chips and salsa.\n\nNow the do or die: chips and salsa. I fancy myself a salsa connoisseur, and this was 8/10 only because I prefer a chunkier salsa. The flavor was really great though: smoky and spicy and obviously fresh. The chips are house made and perfect--firm but not hard, and crispy delicious. Hence my conversion to Nachos next week. \n\nNormally, I reserve nachos for sports bars and happy hours, but next Juansday I am totally ordering the machaca nachos. My work husband got them and they look/sound delicious.\n\nGive it a try. You know you ...

Having lived in the valley for most of my life I appreciate the sentimentality.  \n\nBUT!  It is important to separate nostalgia from reality, especially when others rely on your opinion when making dinner plans.\n\nI've lived in the Valley for a good long time- more than 40 years.  I've been to Jordan's more times than I can count.  \n\nAs a child, this was one of many local Mexican food restaurants we visited- others being El Maya, Don Jose's, Rosa's, Rosita's, George's Ole, and others.  As an adult, part of my enjoyment was the old-fashioned, retro atmosphere- the genuine Naugahyde seats, dark wrought iron, old-school environment.  I was even OK with the smooth taco sauce in lieu of chopped and chunky salsa.  I tend to stick with the old-school combo plate- taco, enchilada, tostada type combos when I visit.\n\nMy last two visits have occurred in the last year- most recently in November.  The experiences were almost identical- disappointing.  It was as if someone in the kitchen had just given up.  The taco meat was not really seasoned, very bland, and the shell tasted as if they went and picked up a package at the grocery instead of making their own.  The enchilada was rather oily.  Food was warm, not hot.  Service was friendly but scarce- my drink sat empty more than once.\n\nThe visit in November is likely my last.

Many memories. I can't say I remember much about the food, I ate it with no complains because I was just a kid and didn't know any better, but I've been back there a few times since then including a couple months ago. This time the food was less than palatable. Some of the food, like the chimichanga and the flautas, kinda tasted like they had been fried in rancid oil, and I am prone to believe so because I developed a bit of a stomach ache toward the end of the meal. Also, the width of the tamales were straight up laughable: the width of an index finger. On the plus side, the place is like a time machine; walk in and you'll think O.J. is on the run in his white Ford Bronco again, hurry and turn on the news, because its 1994 all over again! Not a thing has changed; same decor, including the paintings of sombrero totting men on the walls as you walk in, except for the fact that these paintings now have a protective plastic or glass cover. I like the fact that it hasn't changed. Brings back more vivid memories; going here on the weekend with my mom and her then Cuban boyfriend, and getting scolded by her to not eat so many darn churros, walking out with a Pancho's balloon in one hand and an ice cream cone for the road in the other hand, standing in front of one of the statues against the wall in the parking lot and looking up and snickering because someone stuck gum in one of his nostrils and it looks like snot.

Love the mellow vibe of sitting in the bar, sports is on super low volume and nice place to just hang out and relax with a quiet conversation.  Food is pretty good, won't knock your socks off or anything, but okay.  Lately, I think they have reduced their portion size and raised their prices, although I can't confirm that it just seems that is what they are doing.  Which is fine, not trying to pig out or anything, but then again, most people like a great bargain (and perhaps some leftovers for street tacos in the morning - if you are like me anyway).  \n\nI did want to add something.  I think I have talked about this before, but not sure.  Their cheese queso dip is the BEST IN THE VALLEY and you WILL NOT BEAT IT.  Recently, they started servicing sonoran hot dogs (awwww yeaaah, you know that's Attorney Steve's weak spot).  But anyhow, instead of ordering the hot dog their way, order it PLAIN with a bowl of the queso cheese sauce.  Then, when your dog comes, dip it into the cheese sauce with each bite.  If that is not the best thing you have ever had, respond to me on yelp telling me ATTORNEY STEVE YOU ARE A TOTAL MORON!!  I will deal with it if you do.  But yeah, that is DA BOMB sonoran dog.  \n\nThat being said, I always speak my mind.  The hot dog bun itself is a bit dry.  I really think they should serve those wrapped in aluminum to keep the bun soft and fresh. Also, ARE YOU KIDDING ME $9.99 FOR THE DOG ARE YTOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?  \n\nAnyway, we always go back, but based on their pricing schemes we are not regulars.  Still a great place to drop in, but that's a once every other month deal for me.   Keep in mind, if you have business clients, it is still a good place to take them.  Easy parking, good service, etc.  \n\nHave fun, and find your sizzle!\n\nAttorney Steve, the business and real estate lawyer.\nhttp://www.attorneysteve.net", "business_id": "0K35eGvzVRZEirNo5v_WfA", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-02-17", "type": "review"}

Owns 4 locations with many employees, is able to recognize my voice on the phone when I answer it and say \"Hello, Kaylee\". That's amazing. There has not been a single shift where a coworker, boss, or customer hasn't been able to put a genuine smile on my face. We all get along, and I am sure if you pay attention, you can see it by the way the employees interact with one another. I will always consider Ajo Al's my second family. \n\nAnd lastly... A review on the customers. You guys are the cherry on top. All around, you guys are some awesome, sweet people. About a third of the time I'm not even the first one to say \"How are you doing?\" It's you guys asking it the second you walk in the door.

We went to the Camelback location.  The place was OK.  Nothing stupendous and nothing God awful either.  The whole place looked pretty grungy, in particular there was trash all over the floors; bits of paper, wrappers, gum and such. \n\nThe service was \"meh\".  After we were seated a highly disinterested bus person or food runner dropped off a heaping wrought iron edifice of greasy, pretty tasteless chips.  They actually tasted more like cereal than tortilla chips. She also sloughed off extra ramekins of bland, but spicy bean dip and salsa.  She kinda dropped the stuff on the table and withdrew quickly as if she were throwing a diaper into the trash.  Our server barely spoke English and barely seemed to notice we were there.  She seemed either aloof or afraid to speak, which I guess was her personal rendition of subservience or something.\n\nThe BF and I both wanted to try the White Sands Chimi after all the awesome reviews on Yelp, so we agreed that he'd get it, give me a bite and I ordered the Arriba sampler, which was like 8 appetizer sized chucks of really greazy, indistinguishable and pretty tasteless finger foods.  He ordered guacamole with his and I asked for sour creme with mine.  His guacamole did not come out on his plate or on the side, but we were charged $2.50 for it.  I did get \"sour creme\" but it was more of a frozen glop of dairy than anything else.  The White Sands Chimi seemed like it would have a good flavor but I couldn't really savor it because the intense burning was too much to endure. The BF & I literally swapped plates halfway thru the meal b/c he couldn't take the heat of the chilies anymore.  I really don't think they're hatch chilies. They burned like jalape\u00f1o.  I buy roasted hatch chilies fresh-roasted at Food City all the time and they do not burn the crap outta your tongue like this food did.\n\nOur server never came back to check on the food, our drinks, bring more water or soda and I literally had to flag her down to ask for the check.  It was NOT busy in there at all and I saw about 5 other servers buzzing about serving the maybe 10 tables total that were seated in the whole place.\n\nAll in all -- nothing overwhelming, including the food. It just all tasted like overly greazy fried corn chips that had been in a half empty cereal box for 6 months.  Other than \"spicy\" -- there were no particularly memorable or enjoyable flavors.  I don't think that just burning my (I suppose wuss-assed, from other people's reviews) tongue on bland fried foods is authentic Mexican.\n\nThere were some people hootin' it up in the bar. I guess if you like Big Gulp-sized margaritas, this place might be cool. Doubt I'll return.  The BF liked it though, so who knows. Maybe it was just an off night for me.

However, I think she noticed that we were a little taken aback by the attitude, and quickly changed her mood.\n\nIn the downstairs bar, we ordered drinks while we waited for a table to open up for us.  The bartender made a mistake while preparing my friend's Bloody Mary, accidentally dumping an enormous amount of tabasco in her drink.  However instead of simply making a new one, he served it to her anyway (admitting his mistake while setting it down in front of her) and told her to let him know if she didn't like it and wanted a new one.  Of course she tried it, couldn't drink it and had to ask for a new one.\n\nAfter we got to our table upstairs and ordered our appetizers and meals, things got worse.  It took well over half an hour to get our appetizers, and when we did they were cold.  We were not sure that our oysters were supposed to be as cold as they were, but the fact that they had congealed melted cheese seemed to indicate that they should haver at least been warm.\n\nAfter we finally got our salads (about 45 minutes after ordering), we were rushed through them before getting our meals just a couple minutes later.  None of us enjoyed our meals, as we found them either burnt or bland.\n\nEven though we made a few complaints about our meal to the server, when our check came we found that we had been charged for everything and were only offered a very pallid apology for the obvious problems with our meal.\n\nthis was not an inexpensive meal, either, so we will likely not be back!", "business_id": "5kRug3bEienrpovtPRVVwg", "stars": 1, "date": "2008-01-22", "type": "review"}

I've had better steaks, but never in a cozier environment.  Their booths are ridiculously private and can be really romantic.  Until you stare across the way and see some baby boomers molesting each other under the table.  You can bring your own bottle here, but their corking fee was $25 or $30 which made me really kinda laugh to myself, but not out loud because i didn't want to disturb the mood of the evening or the piranhas in table 4.  \n\nSo, my $10 tip-top Malbec brought back from the actual country of Argentina via me and a large airliner (vino is amazingly good and cheap there), was now $40.  Whetever.  I just expected myself to be in LOOOVE with the food which was not the case.\n\nHowever.\n\nTheir basement bar is pretty much the most unique place to drink in the Valley.  Its focused around a wood burning fire and this is precisely where you go to get a strong cocktail or a deep red wine.  If you can snag the fire-front seating you will want to park it right there all night.\n\nMan, when they used to allow smoking down here, it was like being in the Loyal Order of Water Buffaloes Lodge.

Rokerij (pronounced ro-ka-ree) has all of the charm and coziness of Dick's without any of the tackiness of Richardson's. \n\nThe food is different, too--it's an Amsterdam smokehouse theme. You'll still find specials written on chalk boards in the dining areas, so bring your glasses if you're near-sighted. My favorite dish is the tenderloin on a toast, covered with peppercorn gravy. The Rokerij salad is delicious--a version of the classic wedge sprinkled with chunks of bleu cheese, red onion and bacon.  If you're looking for some fantastic appetizers, order the small plates--the toasts with melted brie and tenderloin are great. It's a nice place to bring clients for lunch, but it would also make for an intimate first date. Great beers on tap if you don't want to check out their more than adequate wine list. I think it's the same menu for lunch and dinner.

Funny I'd been wanting to go to Rokerij for a while now, and when we finally pulled up, I realized that I had been before!  (I guess I'm getting old or something and really losing it... I actually had been there once before when I first moved to AZ, not realizing what the name of the place was).\n\nI called to make a reservation a few days before the date and was told they could accommodate our group at upstairs, but not down unless we wanted to wait until 9:00.  Alright then... 7:00 upstairs worked!\n\nWe were celebrating our engagement and our friends' being pregnant, and we had the perfect booth; kind of a half circle shape.  Lindsay was our waitress and took good care of us.  The atmosphere is dark but warm and cozy... perfect to walk into on a cold night!\n\nWe decided to start with a few of the small plates to start... (both guys in our group are big eaters). They let me choose one of them and I chose the stuffed mushrooms - they are stuffed with crab meat and were delicious.  They also chose the spareribs (which I tasted and were quite tasty) and the bacon wrapped scallops.  \n\nFor entrees, Jared and I took advantage of the $36 special which included our choice of meet, 2 salads, and 2 side items.  I chose the entrecote and probably would not choose that again.  It's a bone-in ribeye and was way too fatty... we enjoyed our spinach and Rokerij salads and our sides of broccoli and asparagus.  I probably could've just had the small plates and salad and been just fine.  We took home leftover meat for Minnie, so she was a happy dog that night!\n\nInstead of ordering dessert, we walked next-door to DQ - can't go wrong with that!\n\nOverall, I'd say our experience was 3.5 but I'll round up for now because Lindsay was a great waitress and we had fun with our friends.

Can i get a slice a pie and a glass of manners?  I ask her what her name is... i then introduce myself and start to read some of the specials off of the wall.  She gets the hint.

I got the GCP... a side that Richardson's restaurants are known for: the infamous Green Chile Potato. \n\nIn the past, I have also had the Bacon Wrapped Shrimp... I may like this MORE than the scallops as it is not as subtle a flavor and really mingles perfectly with the bacon.\n\nIf you opt for the dining experience on the main level, they have big booth seating and a bar upstairs as well. They also have a big room in back for bigger parties! When dining in that room it feels special somehow. I love the big chalk boards that list all the daily specials... they are really Surf and Turf Specialists with SO MANY choices it's ridiculous... but in a good way! Just wait as the Waiter/Waitress attempts to rattle all of them off for you!\n\nWord of slight caution, because it's New Mexican cuisine, they do like to add heat to their sauces. And a word about sauces... they like to drench dishes in them, so if you don't like that, have them put it on the side for your discretion.\n\nAnd last, I will leave you with a story you would only get at a restaurant chain that has burning embers in its web address. I was dining with co-workers on a business lunch and one of our party was approached by the waitress with an apologetic look on her face. She told him that she was sorry but that his order fell into the fire in the oven and that she had forgot what it was (The Mahi Mahi Sandwich) and needed to get the order it again. What? Really?! Yes, really! They whipped out his meal part deux quickly after that but I still think that's pretty darn funny and not something you'd hear about just anywhere!", "business_id": "5kRug3bEienrpovtPRVVwg", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-01-31", "type": "review"}

The atmosphere is fantastic and the food is divine.\n\nI'll readily admit that I was shocked.  The average looking building in the middle of an unassuming neighborhood with a smaller than adequate sign almost blends in.  We drove past this place twice (with a GPS) before we finally realized where it was.\n\nPatrons are greeted with a choice upon stepping up to the entry.  A single solid massive wooden door that leads to the main dining room or a stair case encased in stone that leads below to a very intimate wine cellar and bar.  Full menu is available at both so you can't go wrong.\n\nInside the main dining room the theme is black and dark, even at a 10:00 AM brunch I feel as though I was just transported to a late night speak easy in 1923.  Large plush U-Shaped booths line the outer wall with a center bar and kitchen area in the middle.\n\nThe dim mood lighting and dark walls took some time for my eyes to get use to.  I thought this was a perfect restaurant for vampires, dark and cool, without a single shred of sunlight.  Then our appetizer came - one huge fire roasted clove of elephant garlic with breads and peppers and cheese.  No vampires with in a quarter mile of this place for sure!  It was divine and a meal for 3 by itself.\n\nOur early morning drinks were bloody-mary's and by far the best bloody-mary I've ever had.  They even come with a little 4oz mini beer of Stella Artrois and they drink like a meal.\n\nThe main course was every bit as good and seasoned for excellent flavor.  This isn't plain Sonoran Mexican Food.  It is billed as New Mexico Mexican Food but it seems to be a fusion of Cajun, Tex-Mex, Sonoran, and Mexi-Cali.\n\nThe food is fresh and smoky in a sultry and hot kind of way.  Portions are HUGE and the service is great.  Be prepared to split a meal and still take some home.\n\nWe gorged ourselves to the point that there was no room for dessert, but who cares.  This place is fantastic!  Definitely a \"must-do\" when you have company in from out of town, when you are celebrating, going on a date, popping the question, or looking to close a business deal.

Stella on tap - bonus for my dining companion. Iced tea for me with a generous slice of lemon (just the way I like it) didn't go empty.

So yeah, this one was amazing. Even without added chicken or blackened shrimp. The Menu just says \"spinach salad\" what it doesn't say is: with green, red and yellow bell peppers, red onion, tomatoes, sliced fresh jalapenos, feta cheese and bacon shallot vinaigrette (french vinaigrette I think - with balsamic instead of red wine - nice!!! heavy on the mustard and light on the honey) perfection as far as I'm concerned. Just a little fresh cracked black pepper made it even better.\n\nThe Entree arrived at the perfect time, and we quickly dove in. Perhaps a bit too quickly as the food was piping hot (not a bad thing). Now I claim to be a wimp about spicy food (especially chiles) but this dish stayed right at the edge of what I can handle, heat wise, and didn't push me over the edge. The flavors were amazing. A great sampler with a tamale, relleno and a chicken burro (heavy on the cheese - yum). Even my dining companion who likes things spicy agreed that there was good heat but tons of flavor (I think the hatch green chile surprised him).

We left with a small bill after a few drinks and some good food and vowed to go with friends again soon.\n\nGo at happy hour and sample some small plates.", "business_id": "5kRug3bEienrpovtPRVVwg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-01-20", "type": "review"}

He raved about this place. We went on a Wednesday night, with no reservation. The wait was about 1 hour. Luckily there were 2 bar seats that became available, so we took them. We ordered the 3 cheese flatbread appetizer and it was delicious. I had a large salad for dinner which was perfect, as I was not very hungry. My husband had the chicken enchiladas that I tasted and were very good. The food is cooked to order so it did take a while to get our meal, but it was worth the wait and service was excellent. While waiting, we chatted with several people at the bar, and one couple offered us a taste of their appetizer. We returned the favor, when flatbread came. One more thing, do not leave without getting the decadent truffle dessert. Heavenly, but not over done in any way. All in all a great experience.

Our table ended up being downstairs, and we had to go through the kitchen. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the ambiance downstairs - candlelit lighting, cozy ambiance, and menu specials written on the chalkboard (felt very New York).\n\nThe waiter was prompt in arriving to take our drink orders and to offer suggestions. I opted for the Prosecco ($10) since they didn't offer Moscato. \n\nWe started off with the Roasted Garlic Plate ($16) based on the waiter's recommendation. I expected the garlic taste to be overpowering but it was quite subtle, especially when it was spread over a piece of bread and topped with the cheese sauce. I don't know where they get the garlic, but those things were humungous! (The garlic was almost the consistency of butter, the way it was roasted.)\n\nFor the entree, I opted for the Pasta Heidi ($15), which consisted of green chile linguine, chunky slices of grilled chicken, and a chipotle cream sauce, served over a grilled tortilla. The plate came out piping hot and smelled so good! The pasta tasted so fresh and although I can handle spicy foods, this dish had my mouth burning. I could only handle a few small bites before I got full; had plenty of leftovers for lunch and dinner the next day.\n\nTwo of the gals ordered the special of the night, something with bone marrow, an enchilada, a tamale, and a side of what looked like fettucine alfredo. The other gal ordered the Chimayo Chicken ($22), which is stuffed chicken breast with a side of asparagus. I took a bite of this and found it pretty spicy (stuffed with poblano chiles), but delicious!\n\nWe shared a chocolate dessert, which is decently sized and enough to share between five gals. I could only handle one bite as it was too rich and chocolatey. \n\nOur waiter was very attentive, knows the menu, and provided very prompt service.", "business_id": "5kRug3bEienrpovtPRVVwg", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-01-23", "type": "review"}

I gave this place 1 star because the food is truly amazing. Too bad the manager has absolutely no clue what he is doing. Probably gets tipped on the side by \"regular\" patrons and believes that's where his priorities should be at. First of all I made reservations for my mother's 60th birthday because the food here the first time was great. But did I mention the first time I was here our server made a mistake on every single food item we ordered?? At least he had the decency to get our desserts to make it up. An hour or two before the reservations we had called to see if we could add two more people. They told us fine and moved us up to 9pm for the private dining area. Well we showed up exactly at 9 and our room was not ready. Ok no big deal. A little annoying cuz what's the point of making reservations but we were ok. But after 20-30 min of waiting, I started to get pissed. I told the manager and he actually had the nerve to blame it on me!!!! That I called and added two people last minute!! Isn't it his job to make sure that this doesn't happen?!!! If he couldn't accommodate 8 people then say so and we could have went somewhere else. Also the whole time, he was even apologetic and instead of offering maybe a round of drinks for the wait or anything, he just stood around doing nothing!!! So we left and went to Capital Grille instead. We were very happy to celebrate and spend tons of money where we didn't have to wait and the manager and staff knew what they were doing!!! I will never go here again and if u want to go just expect to wait at least am hour even w reservations!!!!!", "business_id": "5kRug3bEienrpovtPRVVwg", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-12-22", "type": "review"}

No explanation of specials, sides or advice for visitors who were curious about the menu. Recommendations from the waitress were the standard bloodsucker response of the most expensive thing on the menu. When the good arrived the plates were sloppier than usual. Food still tasted pretty good on most dishes but presentation was poor. Also  took a long time to get all the dishes to the table - maybe 8-10 minutes from first person getting their meal to last person being served. \nJust not as good an experience as I received a few months ago.

Any restaurant that has a Dutch name yet is classified as a Mexican restaurant definitely piques one's fancy.\nHaving found a space to park in the rather small parking lot, our group headed toward the entrance. Arriving there we had a choice, straight ahead or down the stairs into the bowels of the earth. An easy decision as the stairs reminded me of an English castle I once visited.\nAt the bottom of the stairs, the view we were offered was delightfully reminiscent of an old English pub (I'm not getting a Dutch vibe yet!). As there were no tables that did not have reserved signs on them, we decided to sit at the bar (great decision) and managed to find four seats at the end (or beginning if you have just entered the restaurant). We ordered a bottle of wine, because it was happy hour (half price), and perused the menu. As we couldn't decide which wine to order, the bar person, Nicole, gave us a couple of samples so it was much easier to decide.\nEverything looked tasty and what we ordered was delightful. Of the three dishes we ordered, the pecan grilled trout was the winner although nobody complained about anything, as all the plates were empty before we left and we were all stuffed. A close second were the carne adovada and the parppardelle with duck. (Nothing came third as two people ordered the carne adovada). The cauliflower and brussel sprouts were melt-in-your-mouth yummy.\nAs we were eating, the restaurant filled up so I would recommend reservations as the eating area is not very large.\nOverall, this was a great meal and this place ranks highly on my places where I need to eat again (and again).\nAs we left, I considered whether this was really a Dutch restaurant and I have to conclude that it is because the Dutch really know how to make food taste great.", "business_id": "5kRug3bEienrpovtPRVVwg", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-02-14", "type": "review"}

As with any Fill-In-The-Bertos, you have to know what to expect, and know what to order.  Here is a quick guide to a pleasant experience:\n\n1.  What time is it?  If it is 2:40 a.m. and you spent the entire night at your favorite bar hitting on every girl there, but you are in the long Berto's line alone at 3 a.m., order whatever sounds good, and lots of it.  You aren't as attractive and smart as you thought you were when you were drunk, so you might as well go home, eat yourself into a stupor, and pass out watching infomercials.  These recommendations are for you, you fat tub of lard:\n\na.  Cheese quesadilla \nb.  Shredded beef tacos (minimum of 3)\nc.  Rolled Tacos (one order to eat while you drive home)\nd.  Any burrito on the menu\n\n2.  It is dinnertime, you have had a long day, and your wife says bring home some Mexican food.  You are tired, and don't want to stop at a sit down restaurant and wait for the hostess to remember your food that is sitting in the kitchen.  You pull into Berto's drive thru.  There menu is huge, and a lot of their food is junk food, but there are a few gems on the menu:\n\na.  Can't go wrong with the burritos.  I personally love the chile relleno burrito, the carnitas burrito, and the carne asada burrito.  Get the green sauce with these.  I get a side of jalapenos with them too.\n\nb.  Tacos: chicken or shredded beef-- Stay away from any Berto's fish tacos or seafood in general!  I've tried and tried, but have never had a good seafood anything here.   Get the red salsa with these.  Stay away from the rolled tacos too, they are not food.\n\nc.  Never get a combo dinner plate.  The rice and beans are crap, the enchilada sauce is pathetic, and it is all going to leak out of the to-go box, through the bag and into your seat.  Stick with the burritos and tacos.\n\n\n3.  What?  You still think this place is no good?  Your expectations are just silly, and your opinion is uninformed.  Fill-In-The-Bertos is a sacred temple to those who know  what they like.  If you are like me, and think onions are God's gift to food, you should like this place.  Stick with the above guidelines, and you too will be a satisfied customer!\n\nStay hungry my friends!", "business_id": "o3TruOSgOwNgx08QosuWTw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-02-22", "type": "review"}

It seems like both time I have been there since the remodel I have had to chase down staff to order, get refills on everything, and get your check, and both times I have went it has not been busy enough to really allow this to happen.\n\nSeems management needs to get a better grasp on this. I wouldn't mind if a manager came to my table to and introduced himself and asked how everything was...not happening here. Staff seems to be off talking amongst them selves. Yesterday my server walked up and you could tell she was eating some food somewhere else, cause she was still chewing on it as she walked back up to our table to take out order after a lengthy wait.

Surprising!\n\nThe salsa bar was mediocre.  The Red Hot sauce was more vinigarry (word?) than deliciously hot, and the Pico De Gallo was made from canned tomatoes.  The chips were so old that by the time I got to them they were broken shards of their former selves. Pity, I was looking for a good chip pig out.\n\nThe service was very good.  The first waitress told me to seat myself and to come up and order at my convenience.  When I did, another waitress took my order promptly.  The wait wasn't long, it was about 5 minutes from ordering to receiving my food.  The tables were quickly cleaned and everyone seemed happy (the customers and the employees)  It was a very comfortable and pleasant setting.\n\nOverall, this restaurant has the 'Meh' effect.  I didn't hate it, but I don't think I'd be back.\n\nConstructive Criticism:\n1. Add some order to the ordering process.  I was a little confused on where (and when) to order\n2. Get rid of the stuffed animal order numbers.  Something about greasy food and fluffy animals says more of \"bacteria\" than it does \"uniqueness\"", "business_id": "7UTlEVHU5v2xBLdkGghyzQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-01-19", "type": "review"}

If I'm in the mood for something super healthy, which I haven't been in a while lol, I'll go for their humongous chicken tostadas. The whole thing is delicious including the taco shell bowl that it comes in. Their chicken is just amazing. You can taste that it is freshly grilled after marinating forever. Even though it is fast food, it doesn't taste like it! On the more regular occasion we usually opt for the family meal that comes with 8 pieces of chicken, 2 large sides, a salad and dessert for about $20. Macaroni and cheese is my side of choice; super cheesy (probably not healthy). We get some flour tortillas and make little tacos with the chicken, salsa and rice (Eric likes to put Mac n cheese in too).

The owner maybe didn't think that there was a liability to his customers by doing that themselves as the plates were steaming hot and I could have burned myself!

We all \"grew up\" with Don Jose (including my Mom who ate there once a week when she worked at Anita's back in the day) and thought this would be a great restaurant to meet at. My sister, daughter & I were 45 minutes early to the restaurant . To our SHOCK the owner would not allow us to be seated because our \"party\" was not all there. There would be 7 of us and he would not hear of it! Hum...there were two big tables sitting there empty. I told the owner that were were tired (just having finished the Willo Home Tour in downtown Phoenix and saving our appetite for Don Jose's) and would be ordering our drinks and a cheese crisp to hold us over until the rest of the girls came. Nope...would not let us be seated and were told \"that we had to think of him!\" \n\nWe then went outside and called the rest of our party and told them that the NEW OWNER would not let us sit down 45 minutes early so we would be going to \"Manuel's\" on 28th Street & Indian School to meet.

The new owners are incredibly nice, and most importantly, they loved Don Jose as much as we did, and took great pains to get it right--including partnering with the original owner and family to make sure everything lived up to the name. I've eaten there twice since the reopen and it was like coming home again. I gained five pounds in a week, sure, but that's a problem for another day. \n\nSure, foodie hipsters might not like the place--oh, they didn't redecorate! Waah, they didn't have huitlacoche or cochinita! Insufficiently complex notes in the salsa! Not enough bacon and bacon-related accessories! Egads, cold beef sandwiches!--Boo frickin' hoo. If you care about that stuff, this is likely not the kind of place you'll dig. I totally get that. I feel the same way when I go to a Mexican place that serves squid. Here's the purely objective truth: It's a little bit of a dive but that's just how we like it. It isn't \"foodie\", it's actual food. It's not trying to be anything it's not. No new frontiers or exotic taste adventures here. Just simple, tasty comfort food--classic Arizona Sonoran, with enough vintage American diner-style items to keep the grandparents happy--at a low price, in a warm, clean, classic, friendly old-school environment. If you dig that, you'll love it. If you need more, you'll find it elsewhere. Here the salsa's still tangy, the chips are just right, the beans--delicious. Tacos, burritos, enchiladas, combos, the works--just as it was. All is right with the universe.", "business_id": "uevPN8zwJpBpnxRur1jUhw", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-02-16", "type": "review"}

For the sake of those that pick a place based on the ratings, I think I owe it to them. \n\nI have lived by this place for years and always wondered why they hadn't torn it down because it was empty, and then one night the place was packed. I was very intrigued. And then when my husband described his receptionist declaring the reopening like it was a state holiday (with tears in her eyes) I thought \"I gotta get me some of that!\" \n\nWe decided to go on an off hour on a Saturday and there was still a 45 minute wait. I liked the old inside, the no need to upgrade attitude was just my style. All of the anxiously waiting people and being right near the kitchen while waiting...I was screaming on the inside with excitement for the sure pleasure my taste buds were about to be hit with....and then we were seated. \n\nFirst, no alcohol. OK, this is a newly reopened place and may not have their license yet (darn I wanted a margarita!), oh well diet coke it is. They bring out a 6 oz cup of drink, a little syrup container of salsa (cute!) and a bowl of chips. I finished the drink in two sips, the salsa had no flavor, and I avoided the chips after the drink because I think the server was a blackbelt in avoiding interaction once the order was placed. \n\nThe food came (and finally a refill, which I should have asked for no ice because the ignoring annoyed me the most) and we began to chow down. My husband got the chili relleno and I got the cheese enchiladas. My first bite I thought \"hmmm this reminds me of that frozen crap my mom used to try to pass off on me\" and I looked across the table to see my husband eyeing my food and his food barely touched. Now, my husband is an ex football player with a huge appetite that used to eat oysters out of a can in college, so that tells you something about his meal. Mine was edible and we shared with an overwhelming violated feeling . \n\nSurprisingly the server was very quick with the bill. I tried to talk my husband into not tipping but he is a gentleman. When I got home I began listing friends that I trusted their opinions to go and tell me that we are absolutely crazy (one of which likes Spam) and should give it another shot. The overall rating...bland, cheap and the salsa scared one of them (she described it like ketchup). \n\nBottom line, don't be fooled like me. The place is no good and should have stayed closed (and I really wanted to like it!).", "business_id": "uevPN8zwJpBpnxRur1jUhw", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-02-19", "type": "review"}

One night, we were craving some quality Mexican food and started exploring Yelp to find a nearby Mexican spot that we had never tried and had good reviews. We called to see what time they were closing, because it had conflicting results when we tried to figure it out online. The staff answered and stated that they were closing in 5 minutes, but very kindly said that we could order and pick up if we could make it there within 10 minutes. We don't live too far so it was doable, and we gratefully made our way there while still on the phone ordering. I didn't have too much time to ponder on what I would order so I skimmed through the menu and decided on the shredded beef (machaca) burrito-enchilada style (I'm a fatkid). My man got the combo #1, which included 2 enchiladas, a taco and beans. Both orders smelled amazing, it was hard not to pounce into it in the car. When we got home and started grubbin' it was scrumptious!!! I had to give this place 5 stars based on their awesome customer service and delicious food. I am definitely going to have a hard time ordering something different next time because the burrito was so satisfying. We plan to come back and actually sit and eat for a meal, some happy hour and looking forward to their taco Tuesday! The new menu is a little bit different than the one posted on the Yelp page and they gave us one with our pickup order. I'll post it when I get a chance :). They only take CASH so be prepared!!

Muy importante!\n\nI kind of feel bad doing this because we ordered the cheeseburger at a Mexican restaurant, but even our worst expectations were blown away.  You get a school cafeteria type burger with a patty as slim and small as McDonalds but without the flavor and fried crispy.  It's such a weird texture...  No tomato or onion, just a little bit of shredded lettuce.  The fries were soggy with oil, obviously not cooked at the right temperature and very unappetizingly brown.  Oy!\n\nI wouldn't rate it so bad just on the cheeseburger, though it was pretty darn bad.  I had a burrito enchilada style with some rice and it had much to be desired as well.  It was edible, there's some dry shredded beef in the middle of a tightly rolled burrito.  The \"smothering\" of enchilada sauce and cheese left much to be desired.  I usually don't like a huge pile of cheese on top but this was laughable as it probably covered maybe half the burrito.  I guess the ration of sauce and cheese is about 2 tablespoons.  \n\nThe chips were good, but I don't think you should be able to call hot sauce salsa.

There are a few types:\nSenoran\nNew Mexico\nMexico City\nTex Mex\nFresh Mex(BLARF!)\n\nI am an Arizona boy. I grew up eating americano senoran Mexican food. There is ABSOLUTELY nothing wrong with loving it. Is it real \"Mexican food\" who's to say. Do I appreciate other styles of Mexican food? Hell yes I do! Tex and Fresh being the lest of my favorites.\n\nWhen I got to Mexico I don't go looking for a cheese crisp and a shredded beef taco. I go looking for hangover cure menudo. I go looking for brain exploding chicken mole. I celebrate Mexican food in all of its delicious forms!\n\nSo now that we have that out of the way.\n\nCarlos O'Briens... This is a perfect example of americano senoran style Mexican food. I love this stuff.. I crave this stuff.. I have a Mexican food fuel gauge that must be filled when it hits empty.\n\nYou cannot go wrong with the classics here.\n\nCheese Crisp: One of the best in town.\n\nGuacamole: This is what quac should be. Its not 50% tomatoes. Its pretty much avocado, lime, salt, garlic, cilantro, some chilies. It is amazing and I feel is only topped by what I make at home which is the same style.\n\nShredded Beef Taco: Again how it should be. The beef is stuffed into the taco THEN deep fried so you get those delicious crispy fried beefs ends in the taco. It is then piled with delicious Mexican cheese blend.. real cheese..\n\nRed Enchilada Sauce: This stuff is great.. Your enchilada will come swiming in it again covered in cheese which is salamandered. When that cheese grease mates with the enchilada sauce.. Mmmmmm happy place.\n\nRolled Tacos: Both the beef and chicken are good.. Again filled then deep fried and covered in a huge glob of quac and cheese.\n\n\nFavorite Meal:\n#1 Combo (comes on two plates because its thats big!) Shredded Beef Taco, Cheese Enchilada, Rice, Beans\nCheese Crisp with guacamole. Ask for it WITH guacamole. You will get WAY more on it then if you order a side and its actually cheaper. If its to much scoop it onto a plate and enjoy it on some chips.\n\n\nBottom Line...\n\nYou will leave without a gaping hole in your wallet. You will leave with a very full stomach. The service will be acceptable. You will be happy. They also have great lunch specials here. They raised them a bit but its still a good deal.\n\nAlso.. do yourself a favor and stick to the northern location. The owner pretty much lives there and the quality is just better.

Nobody ever asked if there was an issue with the queso as the bowl was literally untouched. On the upside the chips and salsa are still good. We paid our tab and bailed.

I've also had the fried ice cream there too and it's hit and miss.  sometimes it turns out good and sometimes it's kinda soupy which is not so good.", "business_id": "ieYiA4L5gk7S3kZYK0l_dg", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-01-11", "type": "review"}

Eat in moderation - especially here.\n\nThen again, that really shouldn't deter you from stopping in. Especially if it is your birthday - because this is THE PLACE FOR BIRTHDAYS!

I wish I had those odds with the lottery.  \n\nThey have some of the best chip's and salsa in town and great beers, both in the bottle and on tap.

So far Aunt Chiladas has the best Margaritas I've had in the valley and we've been to quite a few places including Tee Pee (where the food is good but the Margaritas suck).  We ordered the hand shaken margarita and its a pretty big serving with lots of the good stuff in it...\n\n(2)  Chips and Salsa -   Thumbs up!  The chips are unusual in that they are flour not corn and come out nice and hot.  We liked the salsas and I love black olives so the fact it was in the salsa was a big yum factor for me.\n\n(3)  Food/Fajitas - Thumbs up!  We ordered a few different things including the Chingalingas (yum!), steak fajitas, and enchiladas.  We also really liked that they give noodles (fideos) with refried beans instead of rice.

Guy at my table asked for a second beer, never got it. Salt was delivered on the glass of a margharita even when it was requested not to be. It took forever for them to even take our order.\n\nThe best thing is that their outdoor patio is really nice, when the weather is good, especially.", "business_id": "G9LwkTSdKOyOGqd5BbuIkA", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-01-18", "type": "review"}

This is our neighborhood hangout, and we've always loved the salsa and chips. We ate lunch out on the patio yesterday, and got one bowl of regular chips and one of flour chips. Then, as we read the new menus, we noticed that they are now charging $2.25 for any additional bowls of chips! And these are small bowls! My favorite part of going to ACs was the salsa and chips. Also, with a new menu you get, you guessed it, higher prices! And they eliminated our favorite lunch specials! The waitress said they are making their own chips now, instead of buying them, so, since they have to pay someone to make the chips, they can no longer just give them away in the same quantities. She said something about how so many chips were being left on the tables. I can understand raising prices. I can even understand charging for extra chips. But, I can't tolerate raising prices and charging for extra chips. At least put out a larger bowl of chips for the first batch!! This may seem petty to some, but to us it is a very big deal. We will patronize those restaurants that seem to value us as customers. Free chips are such a tradition, it's hard to have that taken away. Oh, and it was very nice out on the patio--loved (seriously) all the little birdies coming around for morsels.", "business_id": "G9LwkTSdKOyOGqd5BbuIkA", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-01-26", "type": "review"}

The only good thing about this place was the ambiance and the service at the bar. I am appalled by the service we had at the table. I have never been treated so badly. We had a party of 6, and we chose a table on the patio. The patio was really cool and full of party goers, mostly large groups of people. We sat for about an hour and a half without a server, so we got our drinks from the bar.  No big deal.Finally we decided we wanted some food, so a member of our group flagged down a waitress. Big mistake! The server, Cindy, was the WORST! She was so rude. She explained that no one knew whose table ours was, so no one waited on us. My sister tried to order and she snapped at her, \"I am waiting until everyone is ready to order!\" I suggested maybe we should order from the bar and then she snapped at me, \"You cannot order from the bar! You have to order from me.\" We ordered our food and, after several eye rolls, Cindy left our table. I seriously should have talked to a manager because she was so rude to our party. She continually rolled her eyes when we ordered drinks. The food came and it was awful. I ordered the shrimp tacos. They were completely dry and almost inedible.  I will never go back to this establishment. I cannot believe the treatment we received. This woman should not be in the service industry. I would think, in this economy, there are plenty if servers who would have wanted to wait on a party like ours. We spent $200 at table, not even counting the drinks we got at the bar. We are all upper middle class people; there was no reason Cindy would have thought we would not have tipped her well. I always give servers the benefit of the doubt; I was a server for 10 years, so I understand they have bad days. But this behavior was inexcusable and shocking. Cindy was the rudest server I have EVER had. I cannot even explain it in words. It wasn't what she said, it was the condescending tone, eye rolling, and abrupt responses.", "business_id": "G9LwkTSdKOyOGqd5BbuIkA", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-02-19", "type": "review"}

I laughed because of all my bad experiences there myself. \n\nEvery time I have gone there for food I have had a horrible experience. They have very limited choices for vegetarians. Now, I understand Mexican food is not vegetarian friendly. I am half Mexican myself. I know refried beans and tamales are traditionally made with lard and sauces and rice often have stock in them. I am usually able to ignore it if I can't taste it. Or a server will be able to offer me vegetarian options. \n\nEvery time I have gone there and ordered the vegetable burrito or cheese enchilada combo, the beans tasted horrible. The last time I ordered food there, I was with a very big group of family and friends. I ordered the bean and cheese nachos. The beans tasted and horrible and I asked the server what was in the beans. He said there was bacon in it. I told him I was a vegetarian and ordered the cheese quesadilla. He informed me that there was lard in the tortilla. I told him I would stick to the chips and salsa. He told me there was lard in the chips. I asked him if there was anything without lard and he yelled at me (in front of the whole restaurant) that everything had lard in it. I sarcastically asked him if my margarita had lard in it. He smiled and said no. \n\nTo be fair, I have gone there just for drinks in the bar a few times and had a good time. The bartenders were always nice and they had good bands playing. \n\nSo imagine my horror when I found out my high school reunion was going to be at Aunt Chiladas. My $40 ticket included a buffet full of lard. At least 2 drink tickets were included. But I wasn't going to let a bad restaurant ruin my night of reuniting with my high school chums. So I had a good meal beforehand and hung out around the bar all night.

A Group of 6 adults. My wife and I visiting from Denver, the  rest live in the area. My son recommended the place and we went with him, his wife and their Realtors. We thought the restaurant was nicely decorated, they have an area for bocce ball play, they say they are dog friendly. My wife liked the lit fireplace. When we arrived, there was only 2 or three other parties there for lunch.  When we left, they started filling up. Guess we need to leave a place more often to help the business :-)\n\nWhat we Ordered:  Soft drinks for everyone.\n\nSour cream enchilada, El Pollo Fundido, Two item combo, Lunch Rellano, Spinach Chicken Enchilada, Chicken Avocado Salad, Caramel Flan, Sopapilla (nice they served the honey in a small bowl with a spoon), Caramel Flan\n\nWe also had chips and salsa. Chips were a combo of puffy and toasted. Salsa was mild. Over all thought they were okay. I happen to prefer crispy chips myself.\n\nEveryone thought the food was delicious, I had the Chicken Avocado salad, it was okay. I'm not much on Mexican food, and usually it doesn't agree with me, so I ordered a neutral dish.  I've ordered sopapllia before, these were triangular in shape, and I thought over done, and more chewy then I remember from other places.  Flan tasted pretty good.  The place seems okay, the Realtors, said they felt it was good and would try the other one that's in the area to see how it was.  I don't think the other Aunt Chiladas is associated with this one.\n\nI think it would be a good place, and would try the other dishes, as well as come back some evening to see how it is.  We came because my wife and I always enjoy visiting places with a history.\n\nBelow is History of Aunt Chiladas from their site abbreviated:\n\nShortly after the reluctant surrender of Geronimo (1886). Arizona was still an untamed territory, and Aunt Chilada's North Room was built on the foundation of the only general store serving the laborers working the Rico Mercury Mine... After a long day deep in the mines, the men emerged appearing somewhat inebriated and dreamy-eyed from inhaling the mercury fumes. As they walked down the dusty road to the general store, people were heard to remark, \"The men are back from The Dreamy Draw\".\n\nFollowing the repeal of prohibition, Dave and Jesse Noble, the land's owners at the time were granted the first liquor license issued by the State of Arizona.\n\nThe store was later reopened as The Peek Steak House, getting its name ..from a uniquely placed and somewhat revealing window set in the ceiling of the bar (now the Tienda). Throughout the night, scantily clad women would climb into the attic and perform a hootchy-kootchy dance while patrons sneaked a peek through the window. \n\nThis infamous bar and restaurant again found notoriety as it began a new life as George's Ole! George Cocherham was..a captain in the Phoenix Fire Department ... He used over 3,000 Santa Fe railroad ties, native stone from the area and a little help from his off-duty firefighter friends, George expanded the building to its present size. \n\nGeorge made one other important addition, he purchased Arizona's Original smoker from Gentleman Jim's Barbeque at the corner of 16th and Oak Streets, and moved it to the Garden Patio where he not only smoked traditional meats and fowl but would also smoke game animals brought in by his customers....\n\nThe same tradition exists today. Aunt Chilada's still slow roasts a variety of delicious meats, chicken and vegetables over aged mesquite wood every day....\n\nIn the early 80's, Bob Gosnell bought the restaurant, renamed it Aunt Chilada's and made it a member of The Pointe's growing family of restaurants. It became known as \" The Hideaway\", by the locals... \n\nKen was the overseer of food and beverage operations.... in January of 1995 Ken along with his partner, Lee Midtun, purchased the restaurant.\n\nThe Nagels - Ken, his wife Candice and their four daughters - now greet and serve guests.", "business_id": "G9LwkTSdKOyOGqd5BbuIkA", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-12-26", "type": "review"}

The decor is so cute right when you walk in, very cheerful. We went for lunch so it was quieter. Our waiter was friendly and attentive. Now the best part....the chips! They were delicious, some of the best chips I've ever tasted. They weren't greasy or over-salted, but so good. I had the machaca taco salad which wasn't served in a taco shell so took away some of the guilt from eating all those chips. It had a scoop of their guacamole in it which was also delicious and creamy. My husband and son had the beef and cheese enchiladas which were served in a delicious red sauce. The regular side is a pasta called fideo, but they opted for the traditional rice and beans. I loved the food, the atmosphere and the service was good too.

I remembered the house made tortilla chips being the best ever (and they still are, and they still put regular ones underneath).  \n\nWe ordered our drinks right away (a 22 oz beer and a margarita).  It was at least 10 to 15 minutes before we got them.  One guy was actually getting up from his table and just getting their drinks from the bar (it was not very busy, it was about 2 in the afternoon, so the lunch rush was over). When the drinks came, the beer was only a 16 oz, but who cares at that point, we were just happy to have drinks.  \n\nWhen we ordered lunch, I asked for a high chair for our son who was still in his stroller so he could eat as well.  They never brought the highchair and with the other things already done wrong, I just let it go, he was able to eat his quesadilla just fine (that they also charged us the full price for, not the children's - and again for $1 difference it wasn't worth the wait I knew we would have to mention it).\n\nI ordered 2 stuffed poblano peppers.  I was served one. It was however, delicious and plenty big enough that I still brought some of it home.  \n\nMy boyfriend just ordered a carne asada burrito, which came out fine, it was nothing spectacular, but decent.  As mentioned, my poblano was very tasty and a good sized portion.  \n\nWe waited for the bill for quite some time as well.  \n\nSo overall, the food was exactly what I remembered, tasty and a good variety.  But the service was terribly slow.  We'll go back when we can just sit at the bar, it seemed a better spot to be and much faster.

Portion sizes are definitely ample as none of us managed to finish and we definitely didn't leave hungry. Meat portions on the fajitas were very tiny, as I was down to onions and peppers after my second tortilla. I enjoyed the fideo pasta vs traditional rice, though consistently have an issue with mixed peas and carrots being added.

Who the hell pays for chips and salsa?!  For some thats a reason to boycott a place! Maybe its the homeless problem or the neighborhood around there, its still pretty lame!\n\nOrder a cheese crisp.. I have to say, one of the best Ive had.. super crunch, held the paid for salsa very well.. not to oily.. I could have had just this for lunch! For my entree I ordered a green corn tamale and a green chile burro with rice and beans. The green corn tamale was awesome! Super moist, cheesy and very flavorful. The rice and beans were decent enough.. the green chile burro was good but not great.. it had a strong black pepper flavor which I'm not a fan of but the meat was nice and tender. The tortilla was wonderful though.. soft and chewy and slightly charred. I think they actually make those there as I saw some other guests leaving with ziploc bags of them. \n\nThe chunky salsa was very fresh as all the food prepared for us seemed to be. However the red sauce in the bottle tasted fermented and much like beer. When we asked if she put beer in it she said no and said that it might be going bad. She tasted it at the table (which I loved) on her finger, shrugged and walked off.. must have been alright. Still didn't taste quite right to me. \n\nEl Bravo is decent Mexican food, close to work, cheap and comfortable.

However in these times I think that you need to excell on each level.  A restaurant can't rely soley on the food.\n\nLocated on the northern side of Bell Road in a newer strip mall the outside looks very inviting.  As you walk in the decor is neatly situated and the atmosphere gets you excited for some possible good mexican food.  After your initial look around when walking in a little confusion may settle in. No one will greet you at the door and you wonder if you should wait to be sat or just seat yourself.  With more observation you'll notice a sign far away from the front door saying \"Please seat yourself.\"  \n\nSo you look for a clean cozy table and seat yourself, which is not a big deal at all.  Next you have to wait for someone to give you a menu to see what they actually serve.  You would think that menus would arrive very shortly, but I found out that on two occasions it took upwards to five minutes for them to arrive.  I am an understanding person , I can see the place is busy,and I love mexican food so I patiently wait with a smile.\n\nI could go and on about how long it took for my experiences here.  What I found out on two lunch visits that the owners are the servers as well.  No problem at all with this if you are good at what you do and are speedy.  However when each server has over a ten table section and can't get you in and out in a timely manner then it's time to hire some help.  Or maybe change your concept of the restaurant while having customers go to a window and order their food.\n\nI'll remind you that the food is really good, but everything takes forever.

Reasonably priced. It also doubles as the senior menu any time of day (photo posted).\n\nI also like the kids menu. Drink included.

I'm just not a fan of the restaurant's use of seasonings, or lack thereof, starting with the chips and salsa. A mild salsa and a hot sauce are presented with chips immediately after being seated, but neither salsa is particularly flavorful. The enchilada sauce? It's kid friendly (not a compliment). I find myself blending the salsas and adding them to whatever I've ordered to try to compensate for a general lack of zest. For those not wanting much heat in their Mexican food, Julio G's is a decent choice.\n\nJulio's Too, next door, is a nice convenience.

The rice was clearly over cooked as it was all mushed together and had no flavor. I assume it is called the California bowl because of the guacamole. However, the amount of guacamole was highly disappointing. Once I mixed all the bowl ingredients together, I couldn't even taste the guacamole which is the best part. I added chicken and again highly disappointed with how much chicken they added. I could barely taste that there was even chicken. Overall, the NEW addition to the menu was a huge disappointment.

Great copper work along the wall that has a window into the kitchen, highlighting the copper plates above the window ledge.  There is a mural on the wall over the ample sized bar area that is an homage to Diego Rivera's work.  In shelves, and over the archways there are other pieces of pottery, tile work and other pieces that really set the stage.  They also have a great outdoor seating area off of the bar with overgrown climbing plants providing shade in the summer and heaters for colder nights.  There are several scattered TVs that are both viewable from most tables but are easily ignored.  Most nights it is soccer - of course.\n\nYou'll be brought chips and 3 dippers, a green tomatillo sauce, a great chunky salsa and a red sauce that has a nice spice to it, but I can't quite place the flavor.  Next, you'll notice the menu.  The last time we went my dining companion notices how many items were made with bacon.  You'll also find lots of great meals that I haven't seen served at other restaurants.  In my years of coming here, I haven't been disappointed by a dish yet.  Some items are similar, but different. Enchiladas are almost square shaped and come in a small dish.  Fajitas don't come in a skillet, which continues to cook and burn the edges, but in a large heating pan that you'd imagine seeing on a buffet line.  \n\nAverage meal price is about $12 and worth every penny.  Deserts are also wonderful - but it's been quite awhile since I was able to make it to dessert.  \n\nLa Parilla is really great if you're in the area - and even good if you had to drive a bit to get there.", "business_id": "WxpCYziMlEy8mrEa_VcB1w", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-02-05", "type": "review"}

For as much money as this place brings in, you think they could update it or add more seating. Even a new paint job on the interior and exterior would go a long way. Somehow they think people enjoy the charm of a dirty Mexican restaurant. I don't think that many people care, because they are there just to eat and get back to work as soon as possible, not to enjoy themselves. \n\nIf you go here for lunch, you will end up waiting in a long line.

HOWEVER, I tried one item today that was sub-par and I'd like to warn people about.  The Hard Taco was not good AT ALL.  First, it was one of those taco shells which is not crunchy, and not soft, but kinda.....stretchy?  The meat was shredded beef, and it was greasy with no apparent seasonings.  Quite unexpected from a place where SO many things are GREAT.  Anyway, stay away from THAT one item, but everything else I have tried is great.\n\nP.S. UPDATE NUMBER 2:  \nThe best time to eat at Carolina's is on Saturday.  They have the \"Menudo Fixins\" put out for you to use:  Chopped cilantro, chopped green and white onions, oregano, and red pepper flakes, and lemon wedges.  You don't have to eat menudo to use these fixins, and I like to put them on my tostadas or burros and it really takes the flavors to another plateau.

The problem is, I can't ever decide whether to get the bean and cheese burrito or the red machaca burrito, so I just end up getting both. And finishing both. And it's not even difficult! \n\nThese have to be two of the best burritos in the history of the world, and I'm sure a lot of it has to do with the ridiculously delicious tortillas they make here. I always pick up a dozen to take back with me to NYC, just to show people here that good Mexican DOES exist! It's just all, sadly, located in slightly shady parts of Phoenix (or in SoCal, or in actual Mexico). \n\nThe wait to order is never very long, but the wait to get your food does seem endless. It's only because they make everything fresh to order, though! And it probably just feels like an eternity because I've really been waiting several MONTHS to eat this food, and that's just added to the 5-10 minute wait for the food to arrive. \n\nThey have something here that I have never seen before...a Coke fountain AND a Pepsi fountain! And a smaller fountain with ok-tasting horchata and other Mexican refrescas. So no more fighting over whether a place is Coke or Pepsi, they've got it all covered. \n\nI could probably write several essays' worth of love for this place, but I'll save you all the time-just get off your butt and get to Carolina's ASAP! And if you're heading to NYC, bring me some tortillas! :)", "business_id": "d52zg-S0o940WUCK-nNiKw", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-02-09", "type": "review"}

I hadn't been to Carolina's (Cave Creek and Cactus) since we moved from North Phoenix a while ago. As my first visit to their downtown location, I was quickly reminded why this is one of my favorite Mexican food spots in Phoenix. \n\nI waited in a line filled with of \"out of place\" business casual, police officers, and Mexican nationals alike. This isn't exactly what I would call the normal business lunch locale; you don't come here for the ambiance. The food is served on styrofoam and paper plates, and the table service doesn't exist. I definitely don't suggest taking your special lady here on a date night.\n\nWith ala-cart tacos and burritos ranging from a couple $ through six or seven, this place is easy on the wallet. This is exactly what I was looking for and I savored every last bite of my Machaca (aka: beef) burrito, and taco! That was one great meal. Now I can scurry back to my mid-town office and finish up the day in style. Carolina's claims the valley's best tortillas; which can be ordered by the dozen and taken home, and you won't hear any disagreements from me.

If there is good food, it doesn't matter.\nSecond of all, the tortillas ARE very good, no doubt about it, but that might be the ONLY good thing we got out of our visit to that place. Me and my family were looking for a place to go eat menudo, we wanted a real good, flavorful menudo, and while we were driving, Yelp! took us there, with the promise of good menudo. When we got there, there was a line, but that only meant to us, that there was good food too.\nWe were looking at the menu, while moving up to the cashier, and noticed that they do not serve menudo... like EVER! So, that was a little deceiving. (The website says they have it on Saturdays, but that is the day we visited and NADA!)\nWhen we got there, my kiddos got a bean and cheese burrito, which, if it wasn't for the good tortillas, it would have been the same as ordering one at taco bell. My hubby ordered the Oaxaca style burrito, that had nothing very \"Oaxacan\" about (\"Beef Chorizo with Beans, Potatoes, Cheese\"... Oaxaca, me think not!), along with a tamal, don't remember what kind, didn't mater, wasn't good either.\nI ordered the green chile beef, which I was looking forward to. When we got our order, our kids enjoyed their burritos, my husband was OK with his, enjoyed the tortilla very much, but said that nothing special, and me, when I started eating it, a white goo came flowing out... it looked like the sticky goo we use to make home-made pi\u00f1atas called \"Engrudo\", which is a mix of hot water and enough flour to get a gooey consistency, and I think that's what they served me with some chunks of tenderly cooked beef. I went up to the cashier, and told her that my green chile wasn't green, that it looked like \"engrudo,\" she said that was the green chile, I asked \"Is it supposed to look like this?\" she gave me a little shy smile and said yes... the ladies making the tortillas just looked up and smiled at me, and I went back to my seat, opened up my burrito, picked out the beef chunks, scraped off the goo, and ate my tortilla... So, no. If you ask me if I am going back to Carolina's again, my answer is no. It too long of a ride, too bad of a food for me to do that. Like I said, I've had better... and will post pics to show you the whitish \"engrudo\" goo they served me... yuck!\n** Good thing I didn't get a cockroach in my burrito, like the other lady, that would have been so terrible!", "business_id": "d52zg-S0o940WUCK-nNiKw", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-01-16", "type": "review"}

I come here at least once (more if I can) whenever i visit. \n\nTheir flour tortillas are HUMONGOUS. Like, kind of out of control. The fold them over twice to get them in the plastic bag when you order a dozen. Here's a tip! Don't store them like that or they start to crack from being folded/unfolded over and over again when you want to take one out of the bag! And nobody likes a burrito warpper with structural flaws \n\nThey are so fresh and warm when you get them, the bag steams up with their goodness Another tip: rip a small hole for the trip home or else that steam makes them gummy and stick together - again endangering the structural integrity. Yet another tip: Don't throw them into a suitcase which shortly goes into an airplane's hold, or you'll arrive at your destination with frozen tortillas due to the moisture in the bag+high altitude cold air \n\nRefried Beans: Carolina's Unsung Hero\nSeriously delicious. When you can order something as simple as a bean and cheese burrito and feel like it's the best meal you've ever had, you know you got something special.\n\nFair warning (and I'm sorry in advance veggies): both the tortillas and beans have lard in them.\n\nIf you're planning to eat in, be aware this is not really a restaurant. It's like a small tortilla factory/ordering counter that has some card tables and plastic chairs strewn about. I sort of took this for granted while talking Carolina's up to my (British) husband and mother in law. By the time we got there they must of thought I'd lost my mind.

First off, the parking situation is ridiculous. I drive a long-bed crew cab truck so it's not like I ever expect it to be easy, but WTF? They have spaces facing a wall, which are easy to get to, but then have more spaces behind those for parallel parking and there isn't room for a go kart to back up when someone uses those other spaces. \n\nWhen you go inside it smells incredible, but when you get your food it just smells like pure butter. I am not even sure why I ate my dinner. It was a mix of ingredients that just didn't work. I had a carne asada burrito, probably not their specialty, but read enough of my reviews and you see thats almost all I eat. It was almost half beans, then a bunch of guacamole, and some very tasteless meat. It was a cardboard/bean/avocado burrito. The tortilla had so much damn butter on it that it tasted like a butter stick. I'm not looking forward to seeing my cardiologist report after this. \n\nProbably the one redeeming quality I see is the little 11 year old girl that was the cashier/order taker actually spoke english. The rest of the staff were not bi-lingual, and while they don't need to be, it seems funny that the entire menu is in English.

Because of the only constant in life being change, I am now flying outta Phoenix Wednesday morning and back Friday morning.  Since it was 8:45 AM, I had no idea what I was going to find once I passed through Security, so I figured I would give Oaxaca a try.\n\nLike most airport restaurants, it looks clean.  The menu, while varied, did not allow much for an innovative order.  My hispanic food passion of late is a guacamole burrito.  It's guacamole, onion, cheese, sour cream and bacon.  Between the milquetoast anglo morning register guy (looks too young and acts too immature to be called a \"manager\") who rang up my burrito by item...including the tortilla for the burrito...$8 for a burrito to go was a bit more than I anticipated.  Prices on the regular burritos and other offerings were a bit more reasonable, so I anticipated a pretty large burrito.\n\nMilquetoast, the register guy, asked if I preferred strips of bacon or if I wanted my bacon crumbled.  I asked for strips.  He then asked if I considered 2 strips sufficient, or if 3 sounded better.  I replied that I would take what I could get for the somewhat large charge ($2.09) I paid for bacon.  Milquetoast then spoke to the grill guy in broken schoolbook Spanish.  The grill guy looked at the receipt and turned to ask me if I wanted eggs or potato in the burrito.  When I replied that I did not, he asked me if this was a breakfast burrito or a lunch burrito.  Looking at my watch and seeing it was still before 9 AM, I replied that it would be a breakfast burrito unless it was cheaper for me as a lunch burrito.  \n\nThe grill guy turned and scooped crumbled bacon onto the grill, added onion and slapped down a tortilla.  Everything heated and he assembled the burrito.  I could not see all of his activities, so when he put a burrito on a plate and called me over, I reminded him this was ordered to go.  He wrapped up the small burrito and handed me burrito and salsa in a bag.  I turned and headed toward Security to get to my gate.  \n\nOn arriving at my gate, I sat down and prepared to enjoy breakfast.  The burrito was as light as it was small.  While I had requested strips of bacon, the crumbles were well distributed through the burrito.  It is too bad that the guacamole and cheese were not, and there was no sour cream anywhere on the burrito.  \n\nWhile my typical reaction in such a situation is to return to the restaurant, there just was not time to go back in front of security to display the incorrect order.  \n\nIf there is a next time, I just need to stick to the regular menu.", "business_id": "3QtWG5sN3HJNBVKn_wHQEw", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-12-01", "type": "review"}

The rice and beans were probably above normal quality, but the Relleno was just run of the mill for 7 bucks. Still a good crowd at 1:30pm, but most bakery items were sold out by then.", "business_id": "d2AeNB4xw67E1Bzpo1Pm7Q", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-01-23", "type": "review"}

I come here saturday mornings, looking like death warmed over seeking the warm and reassuring sustenance of their delicious fare.

Azteca is one of my favorite places to bring my family for a quick breakfast, since they all love it and it's easy on the wallet. So many memories I have of this joint I just love it and hope someday when I have a little snot nosed brat to tote around I can bring him here and shut him up with some pan dulce.

You know who you are. \nThis is about as it good as it gets for the Phoenix area. Everything is homemade and delicious.\n\nThe green corn tamales are absolutely stellar. This beauty comes out wrapped in waxed paper and corn husk to maintain the moisture and heat. It's like unwrapping presents at Christmas time, a pure delight! Top this bad boy with green sauce and dive in to find kernels of corn complemented by the perfect sweetness. The green chile is also superb and highly recommended. \n\nThe staples even stand on their own. Your meal begins with crispy chips fresh out the fryer! Throw a little salt and green sauce on them and enjoy. The consistency and flavor of the beans is just right and they are not offensively overwhelmed with cheese as so many other restaurants. The rice always has great flavor, but can range in moisture from slightly dry to very moist depending on the day (I'm assuming different cooks.) And lastly the flour tortillas. These goodies are concealed by foil to keep them piping hot. Every time I unwrap them I get a little giddy. The smell is just so damn good! There are few things better than flour tortillas with rice and beans. This is just about the best threesome I have ever had. \n\nThe only downside to Azteca is the limited daytime hours, and the large lunch crowds. If you love Mexican food, and have not eaten here you must make it a point to come. You will NOT be disappointed. I almost forgot it is also very inexpensive with most of the combos ranging from $5-6ish.", "business_id": "d2AeNB4xw67E1Bzpo1Pm7Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-02-23", "type": "review"}

My husband and I have lived in the area for 9 months or so but have always been a bit intimidated by just how much selection there is. To make matters worse, there aren't many Yelp reviews of places around here, so we keep feeling like any choice we make is uninformed. (Whatever did we do before Yelp?!) \n\nOne night, we decided to drive down Central and look for the restaurant that was the most crowded with locals. (Naturally, Poncho's was crowded but we have been there before and find it good but not particularly authentic). Las Glorias--a white and blue building with fish painted on it--was packed, so we made a mental note and decided to return. We came back on New Year's Day when it was decidedly less crowded but the food did not disappoint. In fact, it was downright delicious and this place is definitely our new local favorite. \n\nAs you can see from the pictures, this place is even more themed inside. There is kitschy nautical decor everywhere--my personal favorite is the lighthouse on the wall that lights up. This place could be covered in real barnacles, though, and I wouldn't care. The food was just that good. To start with, the tortilla chips were hot and fresh out of the oven and the salsa was perfect with the perfect consistency and flavor. \n\nFor our entrees, I got the Camarones Culichi ($12.50), and my husband got the Camar\u00f3n y Filete Empanizado ($12.50), which is essentially breaded fish and shrimp served with rice, beans and salad. My shrimp were the freshest I've had in Phoenix with a sweet flavor and firm texture and the culichi sauce (a spicy green chili cheese sauce) was creamy but spicy at the same time. Even when I had finished the shrimp, I found myself dipping chips into the sauce. Can't let something that good go to waste! My husband's fish and shrimp were also excellent, with a slightly spicy and crunchy breading. They were even better dipped in one of the provided hot sauces (don't remember the name but it had a brownish color and tasted smoky). \n\nOur experience at Las Glorias was so great the first time that we decided to order to go from there recently. It's nice that they have a website with a menu since most local Mexican places do not. That time, we sampled the Camarones a la Diabla (again, great shrimp and kickin' flavor), the Crab Enchiladas w/ green sauce (incredible flavor and not too rich, but we could have gone without the few shell pieces we encountered), and the Ceviche Tostada (super fresh and perfectly spicy and a steal at only $3). \n\nYou may have a local Mexican spot you love but there's something distinct and really wonderful about a seafood-only Mexican restaurant with eccentric decor and excellent fresh food. Venture on down Central (yes, south of downtown) and try it for yourself!", "business_id": "Bv3g-9R5wUevZPP0jzihqg", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-01-24", "type": "review"}

The food is heavy - the way Mexican food should be.  You cannot go wrong with the chimichangas, Mexican pizza, green chili or flautas.  \n\nA few years ago during a trip to Phoenix, President Clinton came into Ponchos.  They commemorated the event with a mural on the wall where Clinton sat.  Also the chips and salsa are bottomless and fantastic!", "business_id": "14NSxaXBNspIVnsrMYJZVw", "stars": 5, "date": "2006-12-06", "type": "review"}

The place is already packed almost any night we go so it's not like it's a secret, and most everyone knows about how Clinton ate here when he came to town which gives it some good Mexican food street-cred.   That said, I still know folks who would go to a chain restaurant instead of driving into \"South Phoenix\".  They have no idea what they are missing.\n\nFirst of all, don't confuse Pancho's with Poncho's.  Pancho's is a Mexican buffet place near the Rhythm Room where you raise a flag for service.  Poncho's is an amazing restaurant with roots in Phoenix that are deep and wide.\n\nPoncho's was created oh so many years ago by a woman who made food and sold it from her house.  Food was so amazing, business boomed even back then.  They added a walk up window to the front of their house.  Then a few tables outside.  Then they figured they might add a few tables inside.  Pretty soon they realized they needed to move out and turn the whole thing into a restaurant.  Good choice.  \n\nI don't know how to recommend anything on the menu because everything I've tried is great.  In my household Chimi's reign supreme.  I'm a fan of a few of their combo meals. Close your eyes, point to the menu, eat.  That's my recommendation.  It will be good.  \n\nThere is a back entrance to a lounge area where you can sit at the bar or one of their tables.  Full menu service is available.  It's an awesome place to watch the game on their big screen.  Everyone has been super friendly when we've been there.  The smallish rooms created when you make a house a restaurant can get a bit loud, but it would be worse if we were in one giant room.  Again, I've never been here when it wasn't hopping.  Tuesday, generally one of the slower nights, we had a 10 min wait for a table. It's never insane, but the biggest negative has to be their waiting area.  Or waiting hall I should say.  The door in is say 6 steps to the hostess booth down a \"hall where you can touch both sides with your hands at the same time easily - but there is a long bench on one side.  Since the place is packed most nights, that means a row of folks sitting, and a row of folks standing against the wall.  If this wasn't all close enough, new folks sometimes try to walk in and go up to the hostess area, or meet friends in the restaurant so they are walking down the middle.  That said, we have had some fun conversations while waiting.  Last Friday night the hostess (and older lady that I'm guessing is a partial owner) was busy running around and getting a drink, so young lady said to all the new groups that walked in while she was out, \"Well, I've been coming here since I was 6, so I'll play hostess\" and she started putting our names down on the list.  That turned into a \"who's been coming longer\" competition which was won buy a guy in his mid40's or so, we didn't ask, who'd been coming almost weekly since he was 4.   Funny how those tight quarters can lead to some pre-dinner bonding/story-sharing.  \n\nSo on top of the friendly folks, the great service, the fun wall painting (The Clinton room, as mentioned below, does have a picture of him painted on the wall.  It also has a painted representation of where his secret service guy stood during the whole meal.  One of the bus boys heard us showing it to someone and he stopped to mention to us, \"Yea, and he looked JUST like that ALL night.\"), the amazing food, and the short from down-town commute - these are some of the best dang prices you are going to find for real sit down service anywhere.  Every once in awhile we'll get a coupon for $1/off a chimi and we often don't use them because the bill is so low it already feels like a deal.  On a recent dinner, for 4 adults w/ full meals - but no bar tab, it came to $37 AFTER a 25% tip.  \n\nHow many other places in Phoenix can you dine with a President for that price?", "business_id": "14NSxaXBNspIVnsrMYJZVw", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-02-12", "type": "review"}
