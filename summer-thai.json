Let me start with a little story.  My sister lived in Northern California and was visiting.  We were talking about places to eat and I of course mentioned and suggested Thai Cuisine, knowing how good their food is.  My sister was skeptical, to say the least, mentioning in the same breath that she lives in the San Francisco area, could a place in Pittsburgh actually be that good if not better than restaurants in CA?  I decided to let the food speak for itself  --- and it did!  My sister ordered the red curry (duck with pineapple), her fave dish, and she LOVED it.  In fact, she admitted after that this restaurant was indeed the best she had had - and that it was too bad that it was in Pittsburgh.  \n\nMe personally?  I love the green curry with mock duck (wheat gluten) - and I am not vegan or vegetarian.  I would like to mention that this restaurant has a nice selection of vegetarian and vegan options.  The crispy spring rolls are yummy, especially with the sauce.  The soups are all pretty great.  \n\nYou should try this restaurant, it will definitely be worth your time.

Mike and I both went with fake duck dishes... mine (basil sauce) was decidedly better than his (don't remember... something bland). The appetizers were all pretty standard, but nothing stood out as particularly good or bad. \n\nOverall, 3-star food, plus vegetarian options, plus byob... it's a low 4.", "business_id": "sxeuOMBRllOHXJTaUlI9kQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-07-09", "type": "review"}

The first time I had food from here was when I was working and a  couple of co-workers wanted Thai.  It's nice that we have a place so convenient to our hospital.  Unfortunately during that time, I had to wait an extra 20 minutes past the estimated pick-up time for our order before receiving the food.  The order was received correctly, however my tofu pad thai just tasted a bit bland.  Not sure they got the sauce right or something.  It's not that it wasn't edible, it just wasn't very tasty.  Kind of meh, if you will.\n\nFast forward 3 weeks later when my co-workers and I went out to eat at the restaurant this time around.  The service was decent and the food was fantastic.  I had the spicy noodles which was a great mix of thick noodles, veggies and tofu.  Just a couple of critiques:  I think it's stupid that they charge you $1 extra per person for BYOB.  Also, their policy which states no separate checks for parties of 5 or more, is kind of annoying.  Otherwise, I'd consider eating here if you're in the area.  Though it is worth nothing a far superior Thai restaurant, Pusadee's Garden, is right up the street.", "business_id": "sxeuOMBRllOHXJTaUlI9kQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-08-02", "type": "review"}

I tried to save some to take home for later, but I just had to take more bites.\n\nThe prices are reasonable for quality Thai food.  I've tasted much worse in NYC but dishes were less than $10.

It was a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!! The service here is HORRIBLE!! \n\nWe went there around 9pm and was the only couple there besides another group at the place. The other group left shortly after we came, but we never got service after we received our food. We never got asked if we needed anything else and received no water refill. They had 6 staff walking around working and doing their own thing and NOT ONE of them ever even stop to come check on us especially our waitress. When we finally got up to leave she was talking out loud from the far back asking us if everything was okay. I wanted to throw a fit and say.. \"no, everything is not okay we got no service!\" \n\nAside from the poor customer service; we ordered my favorite dish which was the pad thai. I asked for no onions and bean sprouts, but we still got it with LOTS of big onions and bean sprouts. My husband told me to say something about it; but I figure I would deal w/ it because I'm always iffy about what people do with my food after they take it back and have to fix it for me. It already took about 15 minutes or so for them to bring out the dish and I didn't want to have to wait another 15 minutes. \n\nWe also ordered sticky rice..and I LOVE sticky rice. It took them longer to bring us the sticky rice than the other three dishes that we ordered. The sticky rice was not moist and sticky at all. It was dried and crusty like its been sitting out for too long. I guess they were trying to microwave or steam it before they brought it out, but didn't do a very good job.\n\nWe also ordered the green curry dish; that dish cost $13.95 and came in such a small size plate that should have been worth $7 at the most! Big disappointment on that dish. \n\nSo base on my experience last night; I have concluded that I will NEVER go here again nor will I even bother to order take out from this place.

I've actually never noticed this restaurant despite the millions of times I've frequent this road and passed this exact location. One of my friends recommended Bangkok Ocha and raved that this is his favorite Thai restaurant. Let's be honest, I ignored him. The dull, insipid exterior does not exactly scream \"GREAT, AUTHENTIC THAI FOOD HERE!\" Nonetheless, the boyfriend and I decided to pop in last night and give Ocha a try!\n\nWe ordered the stuffed chicken wings as our appetizer.  I must warn you, patience is key since everything is made to order. Boy was it worth the wait! The dish is accompanied with a sweet and sour peanut sauce. Crushed peanuts floated on the sauce's yummy horizon. I added some spicy peppers (\"hot sauce\") and BAM, perfection! Kinda felt horrible, but I couldn't resist asking the waiter for TWO refills on the sauce.\n\nFor the entree, my boyfriend settled on the Curry Fried Rice and I went with one of my Thai favorites, Pad Kee Mow (pan-fried noodles stir fried with various vegetables, tomatoes and FRESH basil!). We asked for a level 4 (out of 5) of spiciness for both dishes. The main reason why I LOVE Thai food is the abundance of flavors, herbs and spices.  WOW.. Ocha delivered just that! Not at all exaggerating, but with the first bites into the entrees, all my worries drifted to the ceiling and I was in food heaven! SO many different, yet distinctive flavors between the two dishes. The Pad Kee Mow was steaming of fresh basil. The Curry Fried Rice was what really stimulated my taste buds, the most compelling flavors and spices that I've ever had in a Thai dish. Level 4 of spiciness allowed the perfect amount of spicy that complemented the other flavors and not at all overwhelming. We topped the prefect meal with Thai tea. I couldn't believe my luck, even the tea was more abundant in flavor than other Thai teas I've had. That was it. I officially fell in love with Bangkok Ocha!\n\nThe only recommendation I have is to reflect the amazing spice and flavor of the food onto the design of the restaurant. I love hole-in-the-wall restaurants as much as anybody, but the flat decor and exterior does not do this place any justice! The restaurant is nice and clean, but the lighting is dark (and no, I do not mean dim), rendering the place dull. I think with a little bit of color and lighting, Bangkok Ocha will get the attention it deserves!

Now that the rail is almost up and running and getting to Wild Thaiger isn't such a chore, I went with a group of 6 to try this place out.\n\nWhen you walk in you immediately notice how dark it is as the lighting given off by candles and the kitchen in the back.  I've been to plenty of restaurants that do this to set the mood of the place so I don't mind candlelight.  However, this place was almost pitch black at times to where I couldn't see my dish so they could improve on the lighting a little bit.  The booths are small and set up very nice if you're just out on a date with your special someone.\n\nThe menu selection isn't vast but has all the usual suspects (curries, noodles, tofu dishes, etc.).  I had the chicken and potato dish with yellow curry with some cucumber and pepper veggies on the side.  While the presentation was very nice, the dish itself was just okay.  Almost everyone in the group I was with also had a currie dish and agreed the presentation was more impressive than the taste itself.  The one gal who got a noodle dish however said hers was terrific.\n\nMost of us got dessert to finish things off.  I got a slice of the mango cheesecake (very tasty).  Another person got the lemon ginger cheesecake and was very happy.  Everyone else got slices of the chocolate cake (which were HUGE by the way).\n\nThey also have drink specials on Monday and Wednesdays.  We went on Wednesday for $4 wine glass night.  I was gung ho to try a sip of the red Thai wine, but strangely the waiter strongly recommended against it.  I has a Shiraz instead which was fine.  Most everyone else got a white wine.\n\nOverall, the service was a little bit slow (especially getting us our check), but it was adequate.  The waiter was knowledgable about the nuances of each dish (which was good because two people in our group never had Thai food before).  Amazingly, when we originally sat down, the restaurant was just about dead.  But after 8:30pm the place was packed!  Not sure if this is normal, but seems like alot of the folks who live in and around the downtown area needed a late Thai fix.\n\nBottomline, good, but I've had better.  I commend Wild Thaiger and their people for surviving the onslaught of light rail construction that no doubt crippled their business.  Based on what we've seen, this place had a pretty solid local following so clearly they've done something right.  This place is okay if you're looking to go out with a group, but I'd probably enjoy this place more if it was just me and my girlfriend.", "business_id": "KPoTixdjoJxSqRSEApSAGg", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-08-07", "type": "review"}

Hummm, ok pretty standard menu, but being a fan of curries I noted my choices were limited. I guess I could have had them sub the beef for chicken in the dishes but I wasn't feeling up for the hassle. \nAfter a process that seemed like forever, I decided to start off with the Tofu Towers Appetizer and settled on the Green Curry with beef. \n\nThe tofu towers were well presented with a cucumber \"chutney\" / salad that was fresh with a vinegarette that still didn't do much for the tofu. [The same cucumber salad vinegarette at Siam Thai is more clean and crisp.] While green curry's are not generally my favorite (I often find them bland and less flavorful than a red), the beef green curry was tasty. The heat was one that built up slowly as you ate but was never overwhelming to the overall dish. The jasmine rice was cooked perfectly. \n\nWhile overall I can't complain, I can say I have had better but it is a worthy option when seeking a quick Thai fix.

The place was busy and noisy.  The menu was limited and average priced for most items. I craved noodles so ordered the Pad-Seiw. The noodles were alright.

They were not only delicious, and were accompanied by an exquisite peanut/citrus blend sauce with hints of anise...they were plated beautifully. Served two for $9.\n\nThe place is smallish....four booths and the rest tables, with a few  cafe height two-tops lining the hallway toward the bathrooms in the back that were obviously added out of necessity. The bar over looks an open kitchen where the owner/head chef prepares food next to assistant chefs. It is a show in itself.\n\nPhotos line the walls near the bathrooms and some of them are impressive--the head chef with some local celebrities and one with Steven Seagal. What were most impressive to us are the photos of their annual celebrations. Brightly costumed servers and performers...We want to know when these take place!\n\nIf you love Thai...GO THERE!", "business_id": "KPoTixdjoJxSqRSEApSAGg", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-06-12", "type": "review"}

A friend brought me here when I was visiting from out of town and I was really impressed. This may be my new favorite Thai food place. They have a ton of creative options on the menu that look delicious. When I told the waiter I was a vegetarian, he said that they could make 90% of things vegetarian. I asked whether that included using beef broth and fish sauce and he clarified that they use vegetarian broth and a veggie substitute for the fish sauce for all of the veggie dishes. Amazing! I got a delicious noodle dish that I'm now craving again. My friend got peanut chicken and sticky rice with mango, both of which looked delicious.

I said that's fine, and asked can we just go sit at the empty table of four then and we'll wait. She looked at me like I said something foreign and refused and said no. I said we can't be seated at the empty table for our party? At this point I'm getting mad and say to her I don't understand why you're refusing to seat us and can wait but you want us to stand in front of the hostess desk. I said never mind, we're leaving, never have been refused to be seated before. She didn't answer, gave me a dirty look and we walked out. I've never experienced anything like that.

Apparently Mild is always hotter than Medium no matter where you go, and I'm an F'n spicetard.

This is not just excellent Thai food for Phoenix, this is excellent Thai food for the Bay Area.  It's that good.  Thai Lahna's food will intrude into your thoughts for days after you eat here.  Like gustatory flashbacks, you will find yourself thinking about how wonderfully flavorful everything was.\n\nWe had dinner here with Christine O & Myles (+1) and shared 2 appetizers and 4 entrees.  We had Chicken Satay and Angel Wings.  The Satay was the least interesting item we had, it was merely good.  Everything else was great.\n\nOur entrees were Phaht Thai which we ordered with no spice and Khung Nahm Prik Pow which was sauteed shrimp with roasted curry paste, onions, chili, bell peppers and mushrooms.  Our friends ordered a spicy pineapple fried rice and a beef dish which I can't recall the name of.  All of the dishes were richly flavorful and had plenty of sauce to carry over to the steamed rice.\n\nOne enjoyable highlight was the point counter-point going from the spicy heat of the rice to the almost sweet sauciness of the Phaht Thai.  We can't wait to get back here and try more dishes.\n\nMy only complaint about this place is that they need to put some sort of tinting on the windows to a height of about 3 feet.

I'm happy to say that after eating at Thai Lahna with Jim W. and his wife Audrey, we now have another Thai place besides Swaddee (in Chandler) and Wild Thaiger (in downtown) that we're not just ok with going to but actually excited about. \n\nI'm docking Thai Lahna one star for the *really* slow service (I don't recommend going if you're on the verge of starving or with people you don't have much to say to), the less-than-stellar appetizers (the chicken satay was pretty bland and we've had better angel wings elsewhere), and that damn bright light from cars that were parking that kept blinding us that Jim W. mentioned in his review. \n\nAll this aside, Thai Lahna's super-flavorful main dishes merit four stars. The Khung Nahm Prik Pow was filled with high-quality shrimp (rare for Phoenix!), lots of well-chosenand fresh vegetables, and a really complex and rich curry and chili sauce. It was different than any sautee I've had at a Thai restaurant before but incredibly delicious. The Mussaman Curry was also a real standout. The beef wasn't as high-quality or tender as the beef that comes in Wild Thaiger's version of the same dish, but the curry itself was rich, flavorful, and not overly coconutty (if that isn't a word, it should be). The pineapple fried rice was also super satisfying, but be forewarned that if you ask for it spicy (as my husband did), it will be just that - sinus-clearing spicy. My husband and I weren't in love with the Pad Thai (Phaht Thai on their menu) - we prefer it a little more savory and a little less saucey - but it was one of the better we've had in Phoenix and Jim W. is right that the noodles' sweetness was necessary in this case to balance out the intense spiciness of that rice!\n\nThai Lahna serves authentic and flavorful Thai food that meets our Bay Area standards, and we will definitely be back. We won't, however, come when we are too hungry and we will probably avoid the appetizers and just go straight to the entree good stuff.", "business_id": "wct7rZKyZqZftzmAU-vhWQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-08-18", "type": "review"}

I thought the JJ would be a nice soothing dessert if my meal was nice and spicy. \nI enjoyed the lunch boofay very much - enough so that I had no room for my smoothie, and that is saying something if you know my love of smoothies.\n\nThe boofay area seemed small as you view it through the glass strip mall window, but once inside, it blossomed into a wide variety of dishes which were plentiful and varied: multiple rices, noodles, and soups, and several dishes each of chicken, seafood, tofu, pork, veggies.  There was a cold salad bar with regular and asian style salad.  \n\nLabeling of dishes was okay but not perfect, and I almost got a helping of deep fried calamari in creamy sauce that I thought was chicken, thank Buddha I didn't!  (yeah, I thanked Buddha, hey, we are in a Thai place)\n\nService was really friendly, start to finish, from several staff.  They have an oddly placed bar that looked well stocked for a restaurant.  Clean, yes, very much so, but uber-outdated decor.  A couple of other reviews mentioned Miami Vice, but I'm more reminded of those late 80's Nagel paintings and sneaking in a few guilty episodes of California Dreamin' (cheesy Saved By the Bell after-effect) when I would have claimed I was already much too old to still be watching.\n\nI'm calling this 3.75 Stars, but I'd easily give another star if there was some mango sticky rice available with the boofay for dessert, but I'll admit that's a lot to ask.  For a sweet bite to take some spice off the tongue, the bowl of 'fruit salad' (peach, pineapple, banana) and doughnut-hole-like, sugar-coated, fried dough balls would have to do.\n\nAnother thai restaurant I reviewed, Thouch of Thai ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/touch-of-thai-phoenix-2#hrid:XgMuRmuhpdQwbGXU9PMu5w ), seems to be North Phoenix's most popular Thai place, and it's allright, but Pink Pepper really takes the cake.\n\nThey are family owned and operated with only two locations, but they've been in Phoenix since 1983, and have earned a mass appeal since then.  This is from their website:\n\"\nPeoples Choice - Best of Phoenix/ Best Ambience 1985\n\n10 Years of the Best Thai Food - \"Phoenix New Times\" - `84, `86, `87, `89, `90, `91, `92, `93, `94, `95, `96.\n\nArizona's Best - Arizona Republic & Gazette - `91, `92, `93, `94, `95.\n\"\n\nI'm not sure what happened in the mid-90's there, but my guess is that Pink Pepper has just stayed the same, while the popularity of thai food in general -- and the sophistication of the Phoenician palate -- has grown up around them.  With a lot more choices, Pink Pepper is not quite the novelty it must have once been.  \n\nLunch boofay six days a week though means I will be back, and I will also use it as a way to get finicky eaters I know to try something different (boofays are great for that).  I loves me a boofay.    Weekday lunch price $9.15 after tax (no drink)", "business_id": "_IE5XDjxeM47NSzhg7sItg", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-07-30", "type": "review"}

A hole in the wall in a strip mall on 16th street and Bell Road. Very clean place with prompt and courteous service. Had the Chicken Satay ($7.95) with Peanut Sauce as an appetizer. Grilled perfect.

A small bowl fed two people ($4.50.) Next up, entrees. We shared a Krua Thai Rama, which is Stir-fried chicken in spicy peanut sauce served over a bed of lettuce. This was $8.95. The flavor was incredible but there was just a bit too much sauce. Mixing rice in with it helped. The last thing we tried was out of this world amazing. Chicken and Shrimp Pad Thai. We got everything with \"Medium\" spice which was perfect. We eat a lot of spicy food and medium was just a a great temp. The Pad Thai also was $8.95.

None of these things were an issue for us. We had an excellent meal here that started with a fabulous Thai Iced Tea and Vietnamese Spring Rolls. Wow! The rolls could not have been fresher. The freshness was augmented by a slightly spicy peanut sauce. We thought they would be veggies with a bit of pork, but also had a piece of shrimp in each half of each roll. My wife wanted something crispy to eat. So she ordered the Orange Beef and I the Katsu Don Chicken. I'm not usually one for anything fried, but was intrigued by the description of panko breaded chicken stir fry. It and the sauce was excellent! The Orange Beef was also very good. Neither was laden with veggies, but the manager has explained the limitations of the American palette and their willingness to special order virtually anything the guest wishes. That's pretty amazing for a \"fast food\" style restaurant. In the future, I will take them up on that and order some specific veggies to go onto my dishes.\n\nBottom line, it is so nice to eat fresh, made to order food, nicely prepared and served at a reasonable price.

Period. \n\nComing from the Bay Area, I have very high standards for Thai food. In the two months since moving here, I have found some places in the Phoenix area that offer good-quality and flavorful Thai food (Wild Thaiger in downtown, Benjarong in Mesa, Malee's in Desert Ridge and Scottsdale), but I have been waiting to find Thai mecca - a place with incredibly savory and well-balanced food that is served with an authentic level of spiciness. That place is Swaddee. In regards to the price, I am always willing to pay a few dollars more for food that is just that much better than its counterparts, and I would definitely pay more for Swaddee's cuisine than for that at Thai Basil down the road in Ahwatukee, which I found inauthentic and almost inedible. \n\nWe started our meal with the papaya salad and tom yum soup. The papaya was crispy and just the right flavor (sweet but not overwhelming), and the dressing was tangy. We asked for it to be '3' level of spiciness (on a scale of '1' to '5') and found that it had a kick without being overwhelming. The soup was unbelievably flavorful with just the right balance between sweet (tamarind) and sour (lime and kaffir). The chicken pieces floating in the broth were really large and tender - no dark meat chunks in this soup!\n\nFor our entrees, we had the Pad Thai and Roasted Duck Curry. Many places do their Pad Thai differently with the choice of preparation depending a lot on the region in Thailand that the owners hail from. This particular style of Pad Thai features a thicker sauce which is light on the peanut but heavy on the tamarind and lime flavors (a true \"sweet and sour,\" if you will); it was delicious. We selected '4' as the level of spiciness and found this to add a real kick without obscuring the flavor. As if these first three dishes weren't good enough, the Roasted Duck Curry blew us out of the water. Again, the curry was a thicker consistency than it is at many other Thai places here in Phoenix - almost like a creamy soup. Instead of being that electric red color, it looked like cinnamon. It was absolutely phenomenal - it had a richness of flavor with hints of rarely used spices (like cumin) accented (but not overwhelmed) by the coconut milk. The duck itself was roasted and super-tender and the pineapple was fresh. \n\nAll told, our two appetizers, two entrees, and two sodas came out to $45, probably about $15 more than we spent for the same quantity of food at Thai Elephant or Thai Basil, both places we aren't huge fans of, but it was so worth it. This is true Thai food - not watered down or tamed for the masses - that masters the difficult task of balancing sweet and sour, bold and mild.

The shrimp are always plump... the noodles are always just right... the seasoning is exactly what I want and need out of my Pad Thai dish.  The bean sprouts are crunchy and wonderful.  I'm a wimp & I get zero to none spicy because I can't take it otherwise & it's usually still spicy?  I think they do that just to spite me.\n\nI've had their pineapple fried rice before which I would describe as... Meeeh.  Take it or leave it.

I really like Thai food so I've been to Basil Thai, Benjarong Thai, Thai Elephant, Thai Rama, Papaya Thai, Mike's Thai, and Pink Pepper Thai among others and always end up walking away thinking \"not as good as Mint Thai\". The curries at Mint Thai all have a nice balance of flavors and heat and the spicy peanutty sauce in the Rama Beef here is more substantial and has a creamier consistency than other places which I personally prefer. I've tried several dishes here and you really can't go wrong because even those that may not be favorites are always well executed. I have had better Pad Thai but honestly its not what I usually order here anyway, and I agree that there is definitely something lost in the take-out here (not sure why as the leftovers- if there are any- are always yummy). For dessert- the creamy coolness of the coconut ice cream with the sweet warmth of the mango sticky rice is a luscious combination.", "business_id": "RFeDe3fNr14kvUKlVx6_4w", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-08-30", "type": "review"}

Each dish is numbered, named, and has a description, and there are something like 70+ dishes to choose from, plus spiciness options, so it can be kind of hard especially for a newbie.\n\nI picked something in the 60s with chicken and red curry. It was really delicious, with unique flavors and a good spiciness. My only difficulty was that my food was basically swimming in the sauce.

Not much chicken, good degree of hotness, too many onions, and I swear there were no cashews.  The white rice also didn't taste right to me, but that's easy to get wrong.\n\nAfter I ate it all I was still hungry and basically NOT very satisfied.  For $11 bucks I would have done better to eat panda express if I was craving some sort of asian.\n\nThe best part?  I believe they use MSG or too much salt or something, after eating I developed a severe headache which I went to bed with.  After drinking tons of water I hoped it would be better in the morning.  I was dead wrong.  This morning I woke up with a migraine and the same salty taste in my mouth that I can't get rid of from last night; I've never been sensitive to headaches in the past but today is simply unbearable.\n\nFor the money I would definitely advise avoiding this place.

I say surprisingly because it's in a strip mall with a Basha's anchor on the corner of Baseline/Greenfield.  In fact, I've driven by it for over 4 years and never noticed it.  Actually, the ONLY reason I noticed it was because from the street, I thought the sign said \"Boba Tea\" not \"Bola Thai\".  My initial experience with this place was not pleasant based solely on the fact that I rushed over to check it out, thinking it was Boba and when I found out it wasn't, I got pissed and held it against them and refused to eat there.  haha.  Well, my temper tantrum finally ended and tried it.\n\nWhat an idiot I am for not eating there sooner, Boba or no Boba.  You walk up and order at the counter, then they bring the food to you.  Their menu is a little weird in the sense that they don't have a lot of items, and do not have the typical Thai dishes.... BUT, they can and will make anything for you.  We had the Laarb (not on menu) and Drunken Noodles, both were delicious.  They've got real Thais working and cooking in the back and the taste shows they know what they are doing.  I saw an old Thai lady in the back with her mortar and pestle making curry. Two dishes cost us $16.00, not super cheap, but not bad and because you order at the counter, I didn't feel compelled to leave a tip.\n\nOH.. yeah, just a warning, their food is spicy.  I know you're thinking, \"no duh dude, it's Thai\" but what I mean is their scale seems a little hotter than other scales... they do a 1-4.  I usually like my food spicy, sometimes even order it \"Thai spicy\".  This time I went 3 and it was almost too spicy to enjoy.  Almost.  :)  Just a warning.\n\nThe decor is nothing to get excited about, but really, who cares.  My only complaint is the lady at the counter didn't smile, or seem friendly.... but I did notice she was friendly with what seemed like \"regulars\" who were also dining there, so I'm sure it's nothing personal, just her personality until she gets familiar with you.  Whatever, I just needed something to complain about.\n\nIf you ever, for some odd reason, find yourself on this side of town, stop in for some noodles or curry, you will not be disappointed!", "business_id": "KwWKimlUB64oJBtYJF7Bow", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-06-11", "type": "review"}

I was just in Thailand earlier this month and thought this would be a pleasant place to eat to remind me of the great food I had there. Sadly, I was disappointed.  The food was bland, the chicken overcooked, and the \"pad Thai\" noodles didn't taste anything like normal pad Thai noodles that I tried in Thailand or here. In fact, they tasted like Chinese pan fried fat noodles. I don't have anything against Chinese pan fried fat noodles but if I wanted that, I would have gone elsewhere.\n\nThere are too many other Thai places to try in Mesa/Gilbert to waste your time/money here.  Especially when they close at 8:30pm and charge you an extra 92 cents for an extra bowl of rice. If the owner of the restaurant reads this,  take note - rice isn't a huge cost when measuring on a per customer basis and you're already charging the customer a premium for the bland curry you're serving so follow suit with other Asian restaurants and just offer more rice instead of nickel and diming your customers.", "business_id": "KwWKimlUB64oJBtYJF7Bow", "stars": 1, "date": "2009-07-23", "type": "review"}

I don't think I have ever been disappointed in anything I have ever eaten there. The curries are a standout for me; particularly the Malaysia Cashew Beef and the Green Chicken Curry. Yum. Well, the hubby hated the atmosphere...too noisy due to concrete and scraping of chairs on said concrete...so if we want Flo's for dinner it is carryout only. One of my gal pals is always up for going out to lunch and loves the food at Flo's, too. We go there fairly frequently. Or should I say, we used to go there fairly frequently. Monday was the last straw. We sit down, with menus to the side and start yakking. A minute or two goes by and before our server has even come by, the food runner plunks down our salads and fried won tons. Now mind you, we have not ordered food yet, let alone DRINKS. Are you kidding me? Who serves the salad course before drinks are even ordered? Tacky. Super tacky. We looked at each other incredulously. Now here comes our \"charming\" server. Who waited on me last time I was there, by the way,  and was every bit as \"charming\". She opens with: \"Are you ready to order\" no \"Hello\", no \"May I get you something to drink\"...girlfriend is cutting right to the chase. I look up and simply say I would like an iced tea. Gal pal Sue replies, \"Yes the same for me\". Then Ms Personality asks if we are ready to order. I say \"No\" as coldly as she asks us. Yuk. What a buzz kill. Okay. Things went fairly fine after that. She came by two more times (with a little less 'tude) and on the third we did order. Of course it came out with lightening speed, and of course it was delicious. It is also such a good deal for lunch with most entrees served with salad coming in at around 7-8 bucks a pop. So, I have a couple of questions: Is the management so bad that they make everybody miserable who work there? And why the rush rush rush? It is a large restaurant, we were there at the tail end of lunch, and clearly not in a hurry. The joint was half empty. I have waited tables and I know that working the lunch shift kind of sucks because you don't turn your tables. But I tip accordingly if I overstay my welcome. Good look doing that at Flo's.

All of the other items seemed no better than from-the-freezer snacks I can get at the grocery store.  Are they making any of these on site?  Maybe, but it sure didn't taste like it.  The crab puffs were the most disappointing.  So little crab, so much cream cheese.  They should definitely take a look at that ratio and either rename the dish or up the crab quantity.

There is only one dish that I get from this place, but not because I don't like the other dishes.  It's the Curried Chicken.  I absolutely love curried chicken and this place has some of the BEST around.  I think people have a bit different feeling of the place because it is oriental type people, read: Asians, that are running the place.  Big deal and so what?  They are nice enough people, they are serving a good product and their prices are reasonable enough.  Go to some of the local Chinese restaurants and then I can start to talk about some weird, odd behavior from staff.

Favorite. \n\nThis place was...fine. I went at lunch and ordered the pad thai to go and the yellow curry chicken. The meals come with an egg roll, but I couldn't eat more than one bite. It was so heavily fried that it literally dripped oil. Not my style. I tasted the pad thai, and it, too, was very oily. The flavor was fine, but a little bland, and there was not much in the way of chicken or shrimp. The portion was, as others have mentioned, noticeably smaller than most thai places...but a reasonable serving size none the less. \n\nSo, the curry. \nI just...I can't even...ugh. It was so good. Thick and creamy curry, al dente carrots and peppers, and perfectly tender potatoes along with sliced white meat chicken. Guys, It was so good. I hate that the portion was so small--I typically expect to have leftovers for at least another meal. It was only $6 though so I certainly can't knock it. \n\nThe overall experience was fine, the place was clean and the food took a long time to come out but that's worth it for the fresh food.
